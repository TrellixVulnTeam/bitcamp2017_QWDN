NOWACZYK,\n\n                       Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                                 v.\n\n               WARDEN, NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE PRISON,\n\n                       Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n      [Hon. Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n             and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     William A. Hahn, with whom Hahn & Matkov was on brief, for\nappellant.\n\n     Nicholas Cort, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Philip T.\nMcLaughlin, Attorney General, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          August 14, 2002\n\n\n* Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.          This is the latest in a steady\n\nstream of cases involving the complex procedural requirements that\n\ngovern habeas corpus petitions filed under the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. § 2254.\n\nThis case differs from the norm, however, because the petition\n\nbefore us does not suffer from any procedural flaw.                     It was filed\n\nwithin   AEDPA's        one-year       statute        of        limitations,       see\n\nid. § 2244(d)(1), and it contains only fully-exhausted claims, see\n\nid. § 2254(b) and (c). Nevertheless, the district court refused to\n\naddress the merits of those claims and dismissed the petition\nwithout prejudice because the petitioner, Steven Nowaczyk, was in\n\nthe process of adjudicating an additional claim -- one he had not\npresented in his habeas petition -- in state court.                           AEDPA's\nstatute of     limitations     has   now     run    its    course,      meaning   that\n\nNowaczyk will be barred from filing a new petition if he cannot\nproceed on the petition dismissed by the district court.                    Although\nwe conclude that the district court was not required to adjudicate\n\nNowaczyk's     claims    immediately,       we     hold    that    it    abused   its\ndiscretion    in    dismissing   his    petition          rather   than     retaining\njurisdiction and entering a stay pending the outcome of the state\n\nproceedings.\n\n                                       I.\n\n          In       December,   1994,    Nowaczyk          was   convicted    in   New\n\nHampshire state court on charges of arson, conspiracy to commit\n\narson, and witness tampering.           The New Hampshire Supreme Court\n\naffirmed his conviction on direct appeal, entering its final\n\n                                       -2-\n\fjudgment on January 24, 1997. Nowaczyk did not seek further review\n\nfrom the United States Supreme Court.\n\n          Under AEDPA, Nowaczyk had one year \"from the date on\nwhich [his conviction] became final by the conclusion of direct\n\nreview or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\" in\n\nwhich to pursue federal habeas relief under § 2254.       28 U.S.C.\n§ 2244(d)(1)(A).   The parties agree that the one-year limitations\n\nperiod began on April 24, 1997,1 which marks the end of the 90-day\nperiod for filing a petition for writ of certiorari from the United\n\nStates Supreme Court.     See Donovan v. Maine, 276 F.3d 87, 91 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (\"[S]ection 2244(d)(1) provides for tolling during the\n\nninety-day period in which the petitioner would have been allowed\n\nto ask the United States Supreme Court to grant certiorari to\nreview the [state court's] denial of his direct appeal (the fact\n\nthat the petitioner did not seek certiorari is immaterial).\").\n\n          The statute of limitations is tolled whenever \"a properly\nfiled application for State post-conviction or other collateral\n\nreview with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\"\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2).   We have held that an application for state\n\npost-conviction relief is \"pending\" -- and, thus, the statute of\n\nlimitations is tolled -- not only when the application \"actually is\n\nbeing considered by the trial or appellate court, but also during\n\nthe 'gap' between the trial court's initial disposition and the\n\npetitioner's timely filing of a petition for review at the next\n\n\n     1\n      A chronology of the important dates in this case is set forth\nin the appendix.\n\n                                 -3-\n\flevel.\"     Currie v. Matesanz, 281 F.3d 261, 266 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Carey v. Saffold, 122\n\nS. Ct. 2134, 2136 (2002) (confirming the prevailing view that an\napplication remains pending between \"a lower state court's decision\n\nand the filing of a notice of appeal to a higher state court\").\n\nSuch   tolling     enables   state    prisoners   to   comply    with    AEDPA's\nexhaustion provisions, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b) and (c), which require\n\nthem   to   give    state    courts   a   \"full   opportunity\"    to    address\n\nconstitutional claims before presenting those claims to a federal\n\ncourt, O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 845 (1999).\n\n            Here, Nowaczyk filed his § 2254 petition in federal\n\ndistrict court on June 20, 1997, roughly two months after the\n\nstatute of limitations began to run.              The petition stated four\nclaims:     (1) that there was insufficient evidence to support his\n\nconviction; (2) that the jury was permitted to consider prejudicial\n\nevidence; (3) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at\ntrial; and (4) that he was denied the right to a neutral judge both\n\nat trial and on appeal.         Unlike the first three claims, Nowaczyk\n\nhad not raised the issue of judicial bias on direct appeal from his\n\nstate conviction.       In AEDPA parlance, therefore, that claim was\n\n\"unexhausted.\"      Perhaps anticipating that problem, Nowaczyk filed\n\nan application for state post-conviction review on October 28,\n\n1997, in which he presented his claim of judicial bias.                 He filed\n\na second such application on May 10, 1998, raising a claim of\n\ndouble jeopardy that was not included in his § 2254 petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            On July 22, 1998, the district court dismissed Nowaczyk's\n\n§ 2254 petition without prejudice. The court noted that Nowaczyk's\n\nfirst application for state post-conviction review was then pending\nbefore the New Hampshire Supreme Court.              It concluded, therefore,\n\nthat Nowaczyk had failed to exhaust all available state remedies as\n\nto his claim of judicial bias, and dismissed the § 2254 petition on\nthat ground.\n\n            Nowaczyk filed a notice of appeal from the district\n\ncourt's decision on July 24. Approximately one week later, on July\n\n31, 1998,    the    New    Hampshire      Supreme   Court    entered      its   final\n\ndecision rejecting Nowaczyk's judicial bias claim.                     Citing that\n\ndecision, Nowaczyk asked the federal district court to reconsider\n\nits judgment.      He argued that dismissal no longer was appropriate\nnow that all of the claims presented in his § 2254 petition were\n\nfully exhausted.      The district court denied the motion by margin\n\norder, reasoning that Nowaczyk's pending appeal before us rendered\nhis motion for reconsideration \"moot.\"\n\n            Nowaczyk then filed a motion in this court for summary\n\nreversal.    We granted the motion, explaining that, \"[e]ven though\n\n[Nowaczyk's]    appeal      had    been    noticed    when       the   motion    [for\n\nreconsideration] was filed, the motion was not entirely moot.                     The\n\ndistrict court still had authority to review the motion and to\n\nnotify   this      court    if    it   was    inclined      to    grant    relief.\"\n\nAccordingly, we remanded to the district court so that it could\n\naddress the merits of Nowaczyk's motion for reconsideration.                       We\n\nemphasized that the court should consider whether, given the time\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\flimitations imposed by AEDPA, dismissal still was appropriate in\n\nNowaczyk's case.\n\n          On remand, the matter was referred to a magistrate judge,\nsee 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B), who recommended that Nowaczyk's\n\nmotion for reconsideration be granted.2      The magistrate judge\n\nreasoned that, since Nowaczyk's § 2254 petition was no longer\n\"mixed,\" but presented only exhausted claims, it was not subject to\n\ndismissal.   He rejected the state's argument that dismissal was\n\nwarranted because Nowaczyk's second application for state post-\n\nconviction review (raising the double jeopardy claim) still was\n\npending before the state courts. Although principles of comity and\n\njudicial economy mandate dismissal of any unexhausted claims, see\n\nRose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518-20 (1982), the magistrate judge\nfound those principles inapplicable in Nowaczyk's case, \"since the\n\nState courts have already had an opportunity to consider each of\n\nthe issues raised in the federal petition.\"     Because the claims\npresented in Nowaczyk's § 2254 petition were fully exhausted and\n\nproperly before the district court, the magistrate judge concluded\n\nthat dismissal would be \"inconsistent with the imperative that\n\nunderscores all habeas corpus proceedings:   ensuring that federal\n\nconstitutional claims may be reviewed promptly in a federal forum\n\nif State remedies have been exhausted.\"       See Braden v. 30th\n\nJudicial Cir. Ct., 410 U.S. 484, 490 (1973) (explaining that the\n\nexhaustion doctrine reflects \"a careful balance between important\n\n     2\n       The magistrate judge construed the motion as a motion to\nalter or amend the judgment, filed under Rule 59(e) of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.\n\n                               -6-\n\finterests of federalism and the need to preserve the writ of habeas\n\ncorpus as a swift and imperative remedy in all cases of illegal\n\nrestraint or confinement\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n            The    district      court    rejected   the   magistrate   judge's\n\nrecommendation and dismissed Nowaczyk's § 2254 petition without\n\nprejudice.     The court agreed that Nowaczyk's petition presented\nonly exhausted claims.        However, it concluded that dismissal was\n\nappropriate       because   of     the    pendency    of   Nowaczyk's    second\n\napplication for state post-conviction review.                That application\n\ncontained a challenge to the same conviction Nowaczyk sought to\n\noverturn through the federal habeas proceedings, and \"Nowaczyk did\n\nnot raise any unusual circumstances about the state court actions,\n\nsuch   as    extraordinary       delay,    that   would    justify   concurrent\nactions.\"     In the district court's view, the principles of comity\n\ndiscussed in Rose counseled in favor of \"defer[ring] to the state\n\ncourt action\" in such a case.\n            The court then turned to the question of AEDPA's statute\n\nof limitations.      It assumed, without deciding, that since Nowaczyk\nhad not attempted to appeal his conviction to the United States\n\nSupreme Court, he was not entitled to the benefit of the 90-day\n\nperiod for seeking a writ of certiorari.              Accordingly, the court\n\nconcluded that the statute of limitations began to run on January\n\n24, 1997 -- the date of the New Hampshire Supreme Court's final\n\ndecision in Nowaczyk's direct appeal.\n\n             The next question was the extent to which the statute of\n\nlimitations was tolled by Nowaczyk's various filings. The district\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fcourt determined that Nowaczyk's § 2254 petition -- if dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice on the ground of comity -- would not itself toll\n\nthe   limitations    period    for   any   subsequently-filed      petition.\nHowever, under AEDPA, the statute of limitations would be tolled\n\nwhenever a state-court challenge to \"the pertinent judgment or\n\nclaim\" was pending.      28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2).          The parties agreed\nthat the statute was tolled during the pendency of Nowaczyk's first\n\napplication for state post-conviction review, which raised the\n\njudicial bias claim presented in his § 2254 petition.                  The more\n\ndifficult question was whether his second application had a tolling\n\neffect even though it concerned a claim that was not included in\n\nthe § 2254 petition.     The district court answered that question in\n\nthe affirmative, reasoning that the second application challenged\nNowaczyk's conviction -- \"the pertinent judgment\" for purposes of\n\nhis § 2254 petition -- and therefore satisfied AEDPA's tolling\n\nprovision.\n           Thus, the court found that the statute of limitations had\n\nrun between January 24, 1997, and October 28, 1997 (when Nowaczyk\n\nfiled his first application for state post-conviction review), and\n\nthen was tolled by the (still pending) state proceedings.               Because\n\nNowaczyk would have \"some time, but not the full year,\" to refile\n\nhis § 2254 petition at the conclusion of the state proceedings, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that dismissal still was appropriate.\n\nNevertheless,   it     ended   its   opinion   with   a    warning:       \"Once\n\n[Nowaczyk's] pertinent state court proceedings are concluded, the\n\nlimitations   period    will   again   begin   to   run   until   it    quickly\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fexpires.    Therefore, if issues remain at the conclusion of the\n\nstate court proceedings that are appropriate for habeas relief,\n\nNowaczyk should be mindful of the diminished limitation period that\nremains.\"\n\n            The district court entered judgment dismissing Nowaczyk's\n\npetition without prejudice on March 9, 1999.        Nowaczyk promptly\nappealed to this court.      On March 26, 1999, the New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court rejected Nowaczyk's double jeopardy claim.         That\n\ndecision marked the end of Nowaczyk's second application for state\n\npost-conviction review, and therefore started AEDPA's statute of\n\nlimitations running once again.        The same day, Nowaczyk filed a\n\nmotion asking permission to supplement the record on appeal to\n\nreflect the fact that he no longer had any claims pending before\nthe state courts.    We granted that motion by order dated April 28,\n\n1999.\n\n            After an initial round of briefing by the parties -- with\nNowaczyk still proceeding pro se -- it was apparent that one of the\n\nissues on appeal was whether the district court erred in concluding\n\nthat Nowaczyk's § 2254 petition did not operate to toll AEDPA's\n\nstatute of limitations.    The Supreme Court had granted certiorari\n\nto address that question in Duncan v. Walker, and we decided to\n\nstay consideration of Nowaczyk's appeal until the Court issued its\n\nopinion.\n\n            The Supreme Court decided Duncan in June of 2001, holding\n\nthat the statute of limitations is tolled only by applications for\n\nstate post-conviction review, and that later-dismissed federal\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fhabeas petitions do not have any tolling effect.               533 U.S. 167,\n\n181-82 (2001). The upshot of that decision for Nowaczyk was clear:\n\nif we affirmed the dismissal of his § 2254 petition by the district\ncourt in March of 1999, the fact that it had been pending before\n\nthe federal courts for roughly four years would have no impact on\n\nthe statute of limitations.          Absent equitable tolling, the AEDPA\none-year limitations period would have expired for Nowaczyk in\n\nSeptember of 2000, and any subsequent petition would be time\n\nbarred.\n\n             Following the Supreme Court's decision in Duncan, we\n\nappointed counsel for Nowaczyk, ordered supplemental briefing, and\n\nscheduled oral argument.       We instructed counsel to focus on three\n\nquestions:      whether the district court erred in holding that\nNowaczyk's second application for state post-conviction review\n\ntolled AEDPA's statute of limitations; whether the district court\n\nabused    its   discretion     in    dismissing,    rather     than    staying,\nNowaczyk's § 2254 petition, given the statute of limitations\n\nconcerns;     and   whether,   if    we   concluded   that     dismissal     was\n\nappropriate, Nowaczyk would be entitled to equitable tolling when\n\nhe attempted to refile his habeas petition.\n\n             In its supplemental brief and again at oral argument, the\n\nstate conceded that Nowaczyk's second application for state post-\n\nconviction review tolled the limitations period.               See Tillema v.\n\nLong, 253 F.3d 494, 502 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that \"AEDPA's\n\nperiod of limitation is tolled during the pendency of a state\n\napplication     challenging    the    pertinent    judgment,    even    if   the\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fparticular application does not include a claim later asserted in\n\nthe federal habeas petition\"); accord Carter v. Litscher, 275 F.3d\n\n663 (7th Cir. 2001) (same).      But see Austin v. Mitchell, 200 F.3d\n391 (6th Cir. 1999) (adopting contrary view).            Accordingly, we\n\nfocus on the question whether the district court should have stayed\n\nthe federal proceedings rather than dismissing Nowaczyk's petition\noutright.    We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case,\n\nthe district court abused its discretion in dismissing Nowaczyk's\n\n§ 2254 petition.       Accordingly, we need not decide whether the\n\ndoctrine of equitable tolling is available under AEDPA generally,\n\nsee, e.g., Donovan, 276 F.3d at 92-93 (reserving the question),\n\nand, if so, whether it would apply in this case.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            Before we can reach the issue of stay versus dismissal,\n\nwe first must address a threshold question: did the district court\nerr   in    delaying   its   decision     through   either   means?   Put\ndifferently, was the court obligated to adjudicate Nowaczyk's\n\nclaims immediately?3     We turn to that question.\n\nA.          Delay vs. Immediate Adjudication\n\n            In Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509 (1982), the Supreme Court\n\nheld that \"mixed\" § 2254 petitions -- that is, those containing\n\nboth exhausted and unexhausted claims -- must be dismissed for\n\n\n      3\n       We use the term \"immediately\" simply as shorthand for\nproceeding in the normal course of federal adjudication, without\nregard to the pending state proceedings. Similarly, we use the\nterm \"delay\" to refer to deferring federal proceedings until state\ncourt proceedings are resolved.\n\n                                   -11-\n\ffailure to exhaust state remedies.                The Court reasoned that such a\n\nrule   would    \"further[]         the     policy    of   comity    underlying      the\n\nexhaustion doctrine.\"          Id. at 514.          Requiring \"total exhaustion\"\nwould \"encourage state prisoners to seek full relief first from the\n\nstate courts, thus giving those courts the first opportunity to\n\nreview all     claims    of    constitutional         error.\"      Id.   at    518-19.\nMoreover, \"federal claims that have been fully exhausted in state\n\ncourts will more often be accompanied by a complete factual record\n\nto aid the federal courts in their review.\"                    Id. at 519.\n\n           The district court relied on that same policy of comity\n\nas a basis for dismissing Nowaczyk's § 2254 petition.                    It reasoned\n\nthat, although the claims presented in the petition had been fully\n\nexhausted,     the   fact     that       Nowaczyk    still   was   challenging       his\nconviction in state court brought his case within Rose's purview.\n\nThe court observed that the comity doctrine not only \"protect[s]\n\nthe state court's concurrent jurisdiction to enforce federal law\";\nit also \"'prevent[s] disruption of state judicial proceedings' by\n\nteaching that '\"one court should defer action on causes properly\nwithin its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty\n\nwith concurrent powers, and already cognizant of the litigation,\n\nhave had an opportunity to pass on the matter.\"'\"                    (Quoting Rose,\n\n455 U.S. at 518 (quoting Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 204\n\n(1950)).       Because   the       state    courts    had    not   yet   had   a    full\n\nopportunity     to   pass     on    one    of     Nowaczyk's    challenges     to    his\n\nconviction -- the double jeopardy claim -- the district court felt\n\n\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fitself bound to \"defer action\" on the related challenges contained\n\nin the § 2254 petition.\n\n           Nowaczyk argues that Rose does not support the district\ncourt's decision to dismiss his petition.     He maintains that the\n\nrule of total exhaustion is not based on avoiding parallel state-\n\nfederal proceedings.   Rather, Nowaczyk argues, Rose's core holding\n\nwas that federal courts should not grant relief on claims that have\n\nnot yet been presented to the state courts.    Consistent with that\n\nview, Rose directed district courts to offer a choice to state\n\nprisoners with mixed petitions: they could either accept dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice and return to state court to exhaust the claims\n\npresented in their § 2254 petitions, or they could amend those\n\npetitions to remove any unexhausted claims.   See Rose, 455 U.S. at\n\n510.   If the prisoner chose the latter option, the district court\n\nwould adjudicate the remaining (exhausted) claims immediately,\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that the other unexhausted claims might be\npending before the state courts at the same time.\n           We agree that Rose does not require the district court to\n\nwithhold decision in cases such as Nowaczyk's.         See Hurd v.\n\nMondragon, 851 F.2d 324, 327-28 (10th Cir. 1988) (concluding that\nRose is not controlling where the state prisoner has exhausted his\n\nstate remedies on the claims presented in his § 2254 petition, but\nhe has other claims that have not been exhausted); Jones v. Parke,\n\n734 F.2d 1142, 1145 (6th Cir. 1984) (same).   If anything, it points\n\nin the opposite direction.   Rose held that a state prisoner who has\n\nboth exhausted and unexhausted claims can obtain prompt federal\n\n                                -13-\n\freview of the exhausted claims if he files a mixed petition and\n\nthen amends it to remove the unexhausted claims.    See 455 U.S. at\n\n510; Lacy v. Gabriel, 732 F.2d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1984) (emphasizing\nthat, under Rose, the petitioner \"was entitled all along to present\n\nonly a part of the claims available to him\").   We see no reason why\n\na prisoner with a mixed petition should be better off than one\nwhose petition contains only exhausted claims.     But that is the\n\noddity implicit in the district court's reasoning. Under Rose, the\n\nstate prisoner with a mixed petition is entitled to proceed with\n\nhis exhausted claims if he agrees to amend his petition.   Under the\n\ndistrict court's approach, however, the state prisoner with a\n\npetition containing only exhausted claims is forbidden to proceed\n\nwith those claims until he adjudicates any unexhausted claims in\nstate court.   That distinction makes little sense, and we do not\n\nbelieve Rose compels it.\n\n           In addition to Rose, the district court also relied on\ncases such as Sherwood v. Tomkins, 716 F.2d 632 (9th Cir. 1983).\n\nThere, the petitioner had been convicted of manslaughter in state\n\ncourt and, in the course of appealing that conviction, lodged\n\nseveral requests for appointed counsel and a free transcript.   The\n\nstate courts denied his requests and, while his state appeal still\n\nwas pending, Sherwood filed a § 2254 petition challenging those\n\ndenials.    The Ninth Circuit held that Sherwood had failed to\n\nexhaust his state remedies with respect to his claim of indigency,\n\nand affirmed the dismissal of the § 2254 petition on that ground.\n\nSee id. at 633-34.    The court went on to note, in dicta, that\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f\"[w]hen, as in the present case, an appeal of a state criminal\n\nconviction is pending, a would-be habeas corpus petitioner must\n\nawait the outcome of his appeal before his state remedies are\nexhausted, even where the issue to be challenged in the writ of\n\nhabeas corpus has been finally settled in the state courts.\"           Id.\n\nat 634.\n            The Ninth Circuit reached a similar conclusion -- this\n\ntime not in dicta -- in Edelbacher v. Calderon, 160 F.3d 582 (9th\n\nCir. 1998), another case cited by the district court. Edelbacher's\n\nstate conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, but his death\n\nsentence was vacated.     Before the penalty-phase retrial had begun,\n\nEdelbacher filed a § 2254 petition challenging his conviction. The\n\nNinth Circuit concluded that the petition was premature, holding\nthat the district court should not entertain a federal habeas\n\nproceeding in the absence of a penalty phase judgment \"or until the\n\nexistence     of   extremely   unusual   circumstances    warrant[s]    an\nexception.\"    Id. at 585.\n\n            We are not persuaded that Sherwood and Edelbacher support\n\nthe district court's conclusion that dismissal was required in\n\nNowaczyk's case.      The dicta in Sherwood suggests that a state\n\nprisoner has not exhausted state remedies until he completes his\n\ndirect appeal from his conviction and sentence.          It therefore has\n\nlittle relevance here: Nowaczyk completed his direct appeal before\n\nhe filed his § 2254 petition, and the district court did not\n\nsuggest that dismissal was warranted because of any failure to\n\nexhaust state remedies.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f            Nor do we believe that Edelbacher stands for the broad\n\nrule that federal courts must dismiss § 2254 petitions whenever the\n\npetitioner is in the process of adjudicating other, related claims\nin the state courts.     As we explained above, such a rule would be\n\ninconsistent with Rose, and we doubt the Ninth Circuit intended to\n\nadopt it sub silentio.4     The better view is that Edelbacher held\nprecisely   what   it   said:     that,   in   the   absence   of   unusual\n\ncircumstances, a state prisoner cannot proceed with his § 2254\n\npetition when the state trial court has not yet rendered a decision\n\nas to the proper penalty.5      Obviously, that rule is not implicated\n\nhere.\n\n            In any event -- as the district court recognized -- other\n\ncircuits have rejected the broad rule that a state prisoner cannot\nadjudicate his fully-exhausted claims under § 2254 when other\n\n\n     4\n       Indeed, in the wake of AEDPA, the Ninth Circuit has taken\npains to protect a state prisoner's right to adjudicate any\nexhausted claims promptly. See Tillema, 253 F.3d at 503 (holding\nthat \"the district court committed prejudicial legal error when it\ndismissed Tillema's first federal habeas petition without affording\nhim the opportunity to abandon his sole unexhausted claim as an\nalternative to suffering dismissal\"); Anthony v. Cambra, 236 F.3d\n568, 574 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that \"outright dismissal\" of a\nmixed petition without leave to amend was \"improper,\" and\nemphasizing that \"district courts must provide habeas litigants\nwith the opportunity to amend their mixed petitions by striking\nunexhausted claims\").\n     5\n       There are sound reasons for such a rule, at least in cases\nlike Edelbacher, where the state prisoner was eligible for (and\ninitially received) a death sentence.       As the Ninth Circuit\nexplained, the federal habeas court needs to know whether the\nprisoner's case is \"capital\" or \"non-capital\" before it can\nproceed, because that designation determines which procedures will\ngovern the habeas proceedings. See Edelbacher, 160 F.3d at 585; 28\nU.S.C. §§ 2261-2266 (setting out special procedures for prisoners\nwho are subject to a capital sentence).\n\n                                   -16-\n\fclaims have not yet been decided by the state courts.               See, e.g.,\n\nPringle v. Court of Common Pleas, 744 F.2d 297, 300 (3d Cir. 1984)\n\n(holding that the district court erred in concluding that the state\nprisoner could     not   proceed   under   §   2254     on   exhausted     claims\n\nregarding her conviction until she exhausted other claims regarding\n\nher sentence); cf. Lacy, 732 F.2d at 12 (holding that the district\n\ncourt cannot transform a fully exhausted petition into a mixed one\n\nby raising an unexhausted claim sua sponte); Williams v. Maggio,\n\n727 F.2d 1387, 1389 (5th Cir. 1984) (similar); Butler v. Rose, 686\n\nF.2d 1163, 1167 (6th Cir. 1982) (similar).             Thus, we adhere to our\n\ninitial view that the district court was not required to delay its\n\ndecision on Nowaczyk's fully-exhausted claims until the conclusion\n\nof the state proceedings.      See Jones v. Wainwright, 608 F.2d 180,\n181 (5th Cir. 1979) (holding that petition need not be dismissed\n\n\"when the petitioner does not urge unexhausted grounds for relief\n\nbut the state claims that such grounds may be asserted in the\nfuture\"); United States ex rel. Boyance v. Myers, 372 F.2d 111, 112\n\n(3d Cir. 1967) (\"It is no bar to federal adjudication of the merits\n\nof the present claim that a separate claim for relief on a\n\ndifferent ground is pending in a state court.\").\n\n             The question remains, however, whether such a delay was\n\npermitted.     We hold that it was.        See Calderon v. United States\n\nDist. Ct., 134 F.3d 981 (9th Cir. 1998) (\"[T]he fact that the\n\ndistrict   court   was   not   required    .   .   .    to   hold   [the    state\n\nprisoner's] exhausted petition in abeyance does not necessarily\n\nimply that the district court was without discretion to do so.\").\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fAs the district court pointed out, if Nowaczyk had prevailed on his\n\ndouble jeopardy claim, there likely would have been no need to\n\ncontinue with the federal habeas proceedings.     Considerations of\njudicial economy support the district court's decision to withhold\n\ndecision on claims that could have been mooted by the pending state\n\nproceedings.   Moreover, although Rose's policy of comity did not\n\nrequire the district court to \"defer action\" until the conclusion\n\nof the state proceedings, 455 U.S. at 518, such a delay certainly\n\nis consistent with that policy.6\n          Not surprisingly, therefore, other courts to consider the\n\nquestion have held that Rose does not foreclose the option of\n\ndelaying consideration of exhausted claims pending resolution of\n\nother, unexhausted claims.     In Thompson v. Wainwright, 714 F.2d\n1495 (11th Cir. 1983), for example, the Eleventh Circuit held that\n\nthe district court acted within its discretion in staying decision\n\non the state prisoner's § 2254 petition -- which contained only\nexhausted claims -- while the petitioner presented an additional,\n\nunexhausted claim to the state courts.       The court rejected as\n\n\"patently without merit\" the state's argument that the district\n\ncourt was obligated by Rose to decide the unexhausted claims\n\nimmediately.   Id. at 1499.   \"The [district] court has the power to\n\ncontrol its docket.     So long as it abides by the limits of\n\n\n     6\n       We note that, at the time of the district court's decision\non remand, Nowaczyk's second application for post-conviction review\nalready had worked its way to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\nThus, any delay was likely to be short -- and, in fact, the New\nHampshire Supreme Court issued its decision within weeks of the\ndistrict court's judgment.\n\n                                 -18-\n\fdiscretion, it can leave a habeas petition dormant on its docket\n\nwhile the petitioner presents to the state court unexhausted\n\nclaims.\"   Id.\n\n           Similarly, in Calderon, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that\n\n\"'[a] district court has discretion to stay a petition which it may\n\nvalidly consider on the merits.'\"            134 F.3d at 987 (quoting\nGreenawalt v. Stewart, 105 F.3d 1268, 1274 (9th Cir. 1997)).             It\n\nrejected the view that Rose stood in the way of such a stay,\n\nexplaining that the Court in Rose \"did not . . . intimate that\n\nthose petitioners who opted for amendment were required to proceed\n\nposthaste on their remaining claims.\"        Id. at 988 n.10; see also\n\nBurris v. Farley, 51 F.3d 655, 659 (7th Cir. 1995) (indicating that\n\ndistrict court can stay decision on exhausted claims until state\nprisoner exhausts any remaining issues);       Fetterly v. Paskett, 997\n\nF.2d 1295 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding that district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying the state prisoner's request that it stay\ndecision on his § 2254 petition so that he could exhaust a newly-\n\ndiscovered claim in the state courts).\n           These cases support the district court's decision to\n\ndelay adjudication of Nowaczyk's fully-exhausted claims until the\n\nresolution of the related state proceedings. We conclude that such\n\ndelay was permissible here. We turn, therefore, to the question of\n\nwhat form the delay should have taken.\n\nB.         Stay vs. Dismissal\n\n           It appears that the question of stay versus dismissal in\n\ncases   involving   only   fully-exhausted    claims   is   one   of   first\n\n                                  -19-\n\fimpression.   However, several courts have addressed a related\n\nquestion: the propriety of dismissal in post-AEDPA cases involving\n\nmixed petitions.   Those cases are instructive here.\n          When   Rose was    decided,     there   was   no   time   limit   on\n\npetitions filed under § 2254.      Thus, there was little cost to a\n\ndismissal without prejudice -- the state prisoner could refile the\npetition at any time following exhaustion of his federal claims.\n\nAEDPA changed matters.      Its one-year statute of limitations \"has\n\nrendered outright dismissal perilous to some litigants, because\n\npetitioners . . . may find themselves time-barred when they attempt\n\nto resubmit their exhausted claims to the district court.\" Anthony\n\nv. Cambra, 236 F.3d 568, 573 (9th Cir. 2000).                Recognizing the\n\nrisks attendant to dismissal in the post-AEDPA world, several\ncourts have concluded that a stay is \"the right step to take\" in\n\ncases involving mixed petitions.         Newell v. Hanks, 283 F.3d 827,\n\n834 (7th Cir. 2002); Zarvela v. Artuz, 254 F.3d 374, 379-80 (2d\nCir. 2001) (concluding that \"the enactment of AEDPA warrants some\n\nadjustment in the pre-AEDPA requirement of Rose v. Lundy that mixed\n\npetitions be dismissed in their entirety,\" and that, \"[i]n many\n\ncases, a stay will be preferable\"); see also Duncan, 533 U.S. at\n\n182-83 (Stevens, J., concurring) (\"[I]n our post-AEDPA world there\n\nis no reason why a district court should not retain jurisdiction\n\nover a meritorious claim and stay further proceedings pending the\n\ncomplete exhaustion of state remedies.\").               But see Graham v.\n\nJohnson, 168 F.3d 762, 779-80 (5th Cir. 1999) (disapproving of\n\nopen-ended stays of mixed petitions).        Indeed, there is a growing\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fconsensus that a stay is required when dismissal could jeopardize\n\nthe petitioner's ability to obtain federal review.                  See, e.g.,\n\nZarvela, 254 F.3d at 380 (holding that a stay \"will be the only\nappropriate course\" where outright dismissal could jeopardize the\n\ntimeliness of any subsequent petition); Freeman v. Page, 208 F.3d\n\n572, 577 (7th Cir. 2000) (\"[D]ismissal is not appropriate when that\nstep could jeopardize the timeliness of a collateral attack.\"); see\n\nalso Palmer v. Carlton, 276 F.3d 777, 781 (6th Cir. 2002) (noting\n\nthat    the   Second    Circuit's   approach   in   Zarvela   \"is    eminently\n\nreasonable\").\n\n              Although none of our cases has turned on the question of\n\nstay versus dismissal, we have indicated that district courts\n\npresented with mixed petitions should take seriously any request\nfor a stay.     In Neverson v. Bissonnette, 261 F.3d 120, 126 n.3 (1st\n\nCir. 2001), we noted that \"the petitioner could have improved his\n\nposition by requesting that the district court stay, rather than\ndismiss, Petition No. 1.         Post-AEDPA, this will be the preferable\n\ncourse in many cases involving 'mixed' petitions -- and it may be\nthe only appropriate course in cases in which an outright dismissal\n\nthreatens to imperil the timeliness of a collateral attack.\"                We\n\nreiterated that view in Delaney v. Matesanz, 264 F.3d 7, 13 n.5\n\n(1st Cir. 2001), where we \"especially commend[ed]\" the use of stays\n\n\"in    instances   in    which   the   original   habeas   petition,    though\n\nunexhausted, is timely filed, but there is a realistic danger that\n\na second petition, filed after exhaustion has occurred, will be\n\nuntimely.\"\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\f           The state points out that neither Neverson nor Delaney\n\ncompels a stay in the circumstances of this case.                 When the\n\ndistrict court entered judgment in March of 1999, the statute of\nlimitations was still being tolled by Nowaczyk's second application\n\nfor state post-conviction review, and several months would remain\n\nin the limitations period when the clock started running again.7\nMoreover, the district court warned Nowaczyk that he would need to\n\nreturn promptly to federal court as soon as the state courts\n\ndecided   the   double   jeopardy    claims    presented   in   his   second\n\napplication for post-conviction review. Accordingly, if Nowaczyk's\n\npetition still had been \"mixed,\" Neverson and Delaney probably\n\nwould not have prevented the district court from dismissing it.\n\n           But therein lies the problem.           In both Neverson and\nDelaney, the district court was presented with a § 2254 petition\n\nthat contained unexhausted claims.            Thus, it did not have the\n\noption of adjudicating the petition immediately.                Unless the\npetitioner agreed to amend the petition to drop the unexhausted\n\nclaims, the district court had no choice but to delay decision\nuntil the prisoner completed the process of exhaustion.\n\n\n\n     7\n       Under the district court's computation (which excluded the\n90-day period for seeking certiorari from the United States Supreme\nCourt), the statute of limitations had run for approximately nine\nmonths when Nowaczyk filed his first application for state post-\nconviction review in October of 1997, leaving roughly three months\nto go.    Nowaczyk and the state maintain -- and we agree, see\nDonovan, 276 F.3d at 91 -- that the statute of limitations did not\nbegin to run until after the 90-day certiorari period. On that\nview, approximately six months remained in the limitations period\nwhen the New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected Nowaczyk's second\napplication for state-post conviction review.\n\n                                    -22-\n\f            The situation here is critically different.               Nowaczyk's\n\npetition contained only exhausted claims.               Nothing prevented the\n\ndistrict court from adjudicating those claims immediately; indeed,\nNowaczyk urged it to do so.        Although we have determined that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in withholding decision\n\nwhile Nowaczyk's      second     application     for   state    post-conviction\nrelief    was   pending,   it    bears    emphasis     that    --   unlike   cases\n\ninvolving mixed petitions -- such delay was not required here.                 It\n\nis one thing to say that a district court may choose between a stay\n\nand dismissal when a flaw in the § 2254 petition makes it necessary\n\nto delay decision through some means.             It is quite another to say\n\nthat the court may dismiss a petition that is properly before it\n\nand ready for decision.\n            The    state   has    not    even    attempted     to   defend    that\n\nproposition.      Instead, relying on cases such as Sherwood, it seeks\n\nto show that Nowaczyk's petition was not, in fact, ready for\ndecision.       We rejected that view above.           We explained that the\n\ndistrict court's decision to delay action on Nowaczyk's petition\nwas not compelled by Rose or by the principles of comity on which\n\nthe total exhaustion rule is based. That decision was permissible,\n\nhowever, as an exercise of the district court's \"power to control\n\nits docket,\" Thompson, 714 F.2d at 1499, and in the interest of\n\ncomity.    The question here is whether that power to delay embraces\n\nthe discretion to dismiss an action properly before the court and\n\nwithin its statutory jurisdiction.             We think not.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f            We conclude that \"[w]hen unusual circumstances\" -- rather\n\nthan a flaw in the petition itself -- \"make it imprudent to address\n\nthe § 2254 petition immediately, the collateral attack should be\nstayed rather than dismissed.\"                  Post v. Gilmore, 111 F.3d 556, 557\n\n(7th Cir. 1997).           This case is unusual because Nowaczyk was in the\n\nprocess of adjudicating his double jeopardy claim in the state\ncourts, yet made no effort to include that claim in his § 2254\n\npetition.       He    expressed         no    interest       in    delaying    the     federal\n\nproceedings until the resolution of his second application for\n\nstate post-conviction review; nor did he seek to amend his § 2254\n\npetition to include the claim of double jeopardy.                            Rather, he was\n\nready   and     willing          to    adjudicate      the        fully-exhausted       claims\n\npresented in that petition immediately.\n              Thus, Nowaczyk's case differs from those discussed in the\n\nprevious section, which affirm the district court's discretion to\n\ndelay   resolution          of    a    fully-exhausted            petition    so     that    the\npetitioner     can        exhaust      other    claims       in    state     court    and,   if\n\nnecessary, amend his federal petition to include them.                                  It is\n\nnotable   that       none    of       those    cases    so   much     as    suggested       that\n\ndismissal     was     a    viable       option.        Rather,       the   courts      clearly\n\nunderstood the choice to be between immediate adjudication or a\n\nstay.     See,      e.g.,        Anthony,      236    F.3d   at     575    (\"Our     precedent\n\nunequivocally authorizes district courts to stay fully exhausted\n\nfederal petitions . . . .\") (emphasis added); Thompson, 714 F.2d at\n\n1500 (affirming district court's decision to stay decision on\n\nexhausted claims although the district court also \"could have\n\n\n                                               -24-\n\fdenied a delay [and] decided the issues that were alleged in the\n\npetition\"). If outright dismissal of a fully-exhausted petition is\n\ndisfavored even when the petitioner asked the court to withhold\ndecision on his claims, it is even more inappropriate where, as\n\nhere, the petitioner resisted any such delay.      See Jones, 608 F.2d\n\nat 183 (holding that district court erred in dismissing a fully-\nexhausted petition on the ground that other, unexhausted, claims\n\nmight be asserted in the future); Myers, 372 F.2d at 112 (holding\n\nthat district court erred in dismissing, rather than adjudicating,\n\na fully-exhausted claim where another claim was still pending\n\nbefore the state courts).\n\n             The reason for such a rule is fairly simple.        Although\n\nhabeas relief is an equitable remedy, \"a district judge may not\nremit [§ 2254] petitioners to their other remedies, the way a judge\n\nmay decline to issue declaratory relief.\"       Post, 111 F.3d at 557.\n\nRather, like other civil actions, § 2254 petitions are \"governed by\nthe norm that a district court must exercise its full statutory\n\njurisdiction.\"     Id.; see also Colorado River Water Conservation\n\nDist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976) (noting \"the\n\nvirtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts to exercise\n\nthe jurisdiction given them\").        That norm is violated when the\n\ndistrict court dismisses a petition that is properly before it and\n\nwithin its jurisdiction under AEDPA.      A stay does not suffer from\n\nthe   same    infirmity.    Because     the   district   court   retains\n\njurisdiction over the petition during the course of a stay, that\n\nprocedure does not \"involve the abdication of federal jurisdiction,\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fbut only the postponement of its exercise.\" Harrison v. NAACP, 360\n\nU.S. 167, 177 (1959) (discussing a form of abstention under which\n\nthe district court retains jurisdiction over the federal action\npending proceedings in state court).8\n          Of course, the \"norm\" that a district court must exercise\n\nits full jurisdiction is just that -- a norm -- and can give way in\nthe face of countervailing demands. See, e.g., Colorado River, 424\n\nU.S. at 813 (explaining that \"exceptional circumstances\" may permit\n\nabstention from \"the duty of a District Court to adjudicate a\n\ncontroversy properly before it\").     Thus, we do not adopt a bright-\n\nline rule that a district court may never dismiss a fully-exhausted\n\npetition. However, in order to justify a departure from the \"heavy\n\n     8\n       We recognize that, in certain circumstances, \"a stay is as\nmuch a refusal to exercise federal jurisdiction as a dismissal.\"\nMoses H. Cone Mem. Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 28\n(1983). That is so, for example, when the district court enters a\nstay under the Colorado River doctrine on the ground that \"parallel\nstate-court litigation will be an adequate vehicle for the complete\nand prompt resolution of the issues between the parties.\" Id. In\nsuch a case, the expectation \"is that the controversy will be\nresolved in the state court proceeding, and that if the party\nreturns to federal court after the state action is over, the most\nthat will be needed is to dispose of the federal suit on principles\nof res judicata or collateral estoppel.\" Charles A. Wright, Arthur\nR. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, 17A Federal Practice and Procedure\n§ 4247, at 136 (2d ed. 1994). It therefore makes no difference\nwhether the district court enters a stay or dismisses the case\noutright: either way, the parties will be forced to adjudicate\ntheir claims in state, rather than federal, court.\n     That is not the situation here. The state courts' resolution\nof Nowaczyk's double jeopardy claim against him would not prevent\nNowaczyk from asserting that claim or any of his other claims in\nthe federal habeas proceedings. At most, a ruling in Nowaczyk's\nfavor on the double jeopardy claim would have rendered the federal\nproceedings unnecessary, because Nowaczyk already would have\nobtained the relief he desired. Thus, in staying its hand until\nthe resolution of the state court proceedings, the district court\nwould postpone, rather than abdicate, its exercise of jurisdiction\nover those claims.\n\n                               -26-\n\fobligation to exercise jurisdiction,\" id. at 820, there must be\n\nsome compelling reason to prefer dismissal over a stay.          Such a\n\njustification is wholly lacking here.        As the state conceded at\noral argument, the comity concerns on which the district court\n\nrelied are adequately served by a stay. Indeed, staying Nowaczyk's\n\nfully-exhausted petition would seem to be the most obvious way to\n\"defer action . . . until\" the state courts had a full opportunity\n\nto pass on the double jeopardy claim, Rose, 455 U.S. at 518.           See\n\nZarvela, 254 F.3d at 380 (noting that \"[s]taying the exhausted\n\nclaims would be a traditional way\" to satisfy Rose's policy of\n\ncomity).     Most importantly, a stay would serve the interest of\n\ncomity while, at the same time, protecting Nowaczyk's interest in\n\nadjudicating his federal constitutional claims in federal court.\n            The state argues vaguely that dismissal would relieve the\n\ndistrict court of the burden of keeping track of the case.            It is\n\nnot clear that leaving the case on the court's docket would be\nparticularly taxing, and the state has made no effort to explain\n\nthe point.    But even if we assume that a stay would cause some\n\nadditional administrative burden, such a minor inconvenience hardly\n\noutweighs    the   district   court's    obligation   to   exercise     its\n\njurisdiction under AEDPA.\n\n            Finally, the state emphasizes that the district court did\n\nnot ask much of Nowaczyk:      all he had to do was refile the same\n\npetition he filed in June of 1997.       That is beside the point.       As\n\nwe have explained, the district court has an affirmative obligation\n\nto adjudicate claims, such as Nowaczyk's, that are properly before\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fit. Thus, it is irrelevant that Nowaczyk easily could have refiled\n\nhis petition.    The same could be said of any civil complaint, but\n\nthat clearly would not justify dismissing it.       Rather, whatever\nadministrative inconvenience resulted from the district court's\n\ndecision to delay resolution of Nowaczyk's claims -- the burden of\n\nkeeping track of the case, as the state puts it -- should have been\nborne by the court, not Nowaczyk.\n\n            Under AEDPA, pro se prisoners seeking to adjudicate their\n\nconstitutional claims in federal court must satisfy several complex\n\nprocedural requirements that often are difficult even for courts to\n\ndecipher.    See, e.g., Carey v. Saffold, 122 S. Ct. 2134 (2002)\n\n(resolving a circuit split on the question when an application for\n\nstate post-conviction review is \"pending\" under AEDPA's tolling\nprovision); Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167 (2001) (same, on the\n\nquestion whether later-dismissed § 2254 petitions toll AEDPA's\n\nstatute of limitations); Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U.S. 4 (2000) (same,\non the question when an application for state post-conviction\n\nreview is \"properly filed\" under AEDPA's tolling provision); Slack\n\nv. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473 (2000) (same, on the question whether\n\npetitions filed after an earlier petition is dismissed for failure\n\nto exhaust state remedies are subject to the prohibition on \"second\n\nor successive\" petitions). When a prisoner manages to make his way\n\nthrough the procedural thicket and places his timely, fully-\n\nexhausted claims before the district court, we do not think he\n\nshould be turned away with dismissal of his action on the basis of\n\nan insubstantial claim of administrative convenience.\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f                                    III.\n\n            In summary, we hold that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying Nowaczyk's motion for reconsideration and\n\ndismissing his fully-exhausted § 2254 petition.              AEDPA's one-year\n\nstatute of limitations expired while this appeal was pending.\n\nThus, if we had affirmed the dismissal of Nowaczyk's first § 2254\n\npetition, a serious question would have arisen as to whether he\n\nwould be permitted to file a second petition at this time.\n\n            That Nowaczyk's claims were properly before the district\n\ncourt,    ready   for   adjudication,    is    critical     to   our   decision.\nNowaczyk urged prompt action. The district court has an obligation\n\nto   adjudicate    claims,   like   Nowaczyk's,      that    are      within    its\nstatutory    jurisdiction.      Although      the   question     is    close,   we\nconclude that the court is entitled to delay decision on such\n\nclaims when considerations of comity and judicial economy would be\nserved.     However, something more than related claims pending in\nstate court is needed before the court may dismiss a fully-\n\nexhausted petition outright.            Such dismissal has always been\ndifficult to square with the court's obligation to exercise the\njurisdiction given it by Congress.            AEDPA raises the stakes:          its\n\ncomplex procedural requirements heighten the risk that a dismissal\nwithout prejudice will, in practice, result in a dismissal with\n\nprejudice, as happened here.\n\n            In the face of those concerns, the district court cited\nthe general interest in federal-state comity as a reason for\n\ndismissing Nowaczyk's petition.            But that interest is served\n\n                                    -29-\n\fequally well by a stay; it cannot justify the court's choice of the\n\nmore extreme measure of dismissal.          The state points to the\n\nadministrative burden, identified as keeping track of the case,\nassociated with retaining jurisdiction over Nowaczyk's case.         That\n\nis not enough. If the court's obligation to exercise its statutory\n\njurisdiction means anything, it cannot possibly be trumped by such\na trivial inconvenience.     Indeed, an obligation that dissolves at\n\nthe first pinch of inconvenience is no obligation at all.\n\n           We have said that an \"[a]buse [of discretion] occurs when\n\na material factor deserving significant weight is ignored, when an\n\nimproper factor is relied upon, or when all proper and no improper\n\nfactors are assessed, but the court makes a serious mistake in\n\nweighing them.\"    Fashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892 F.2d\n\n1076, 1081 (1st Cir. 1989) (internal quotations omitted).           Here,\n\nthe factors on which the district court relied do not support its\n\ndecision   to   dismiss   Nowaczyk's    petition   rather   than   retain\njurisdiction and enter a stay.    Given the difficulties associated\n\nwith dismissal in general of a claim properly before the court --\n\nand under AEDPA in particular -- that decision constituted an abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n           It appears that Nowaczyk no longer has any claims pending\n\nbefore the state courts.        Accordingly, we remand his § 2254\n\npetition to the district court for decision on the merits of the\n\nclaims presented therein.9\n\n     9\n       Nowaczyk also argued that the statute of limitations should\nbe equitably tolled to permit him to file another petition.

This is the latest in a steady\n\nstream of cases involving the complex procedural requirements that\n\ngovern habeas corpus petitions filed under the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. § 2254.\n\nThis case differs from the norm, however, because the petition\n\nbefore us does not suffer from any procedural flaw.                     It was filed\n\nwithin   AEDPA's        one-year       statute        of        limitations,       see\n\nid. § 2244(d)(1), and it contains only fully-exhausted claims, see\n\nid. § 2254(b) and (c). Nevertheless, the district court refused to\n\naddress the merits of those claims and dismissed the petition\nwithout prejudice because the petitioner, Steven Nowaczyk, was in\n\nthe process of adjudicating an additional claim -- one he had not\npresented in his habeas petition -- in state court.                           AEDPA's\nstatute of     limitations     has   now     run    its    course,      meaning   that\n\nNowaczyk will be barred from filing a new petition if he cannot\nproceed on the petition dismissed by the district court.                    Although\nwe conclude that the district court was not required to adjudicate\n\nNowaczyk's     claims    immediately,       we     hold    that    it    abused   its\ndiscretion    in    dismissing   his    petition          rather   than     retaining\njurisdiction and entering a stay pending the outcome of the state\n\nproceedings.\n\n                                       I.\n\n          In       December,   1994,    Nowaczyk          was   convicted    in   New\n\nHampshire state court on charges of arson, conspiracy to commit\n\narson, and witness tampering.           The New Hampshire Supreme Court\n\naffirmed his conviction on direct appeal, entering its final\n\n                                       -2-\n\fjudgment on January 24, 1997. Nowaczyk did not seek further review\n\nfrom the United States Supreme Court.\n\n          Under AEDPA, Nowaczyk had one year \"from the date on\nwhich [his conviction] became final by the conclusion of direct\n\nreview or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\" in\n\nwhich to pursue federal habeas relief under § 2254.       28 U.S.C.\n§ 2244(d)(1)(A).

The petition stated four\nclaims:     (1) that there was insufficient evidence to support his\n\nconviction; (2) that the jury was permitted to consider prejudicial\n\nevidence; (3) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at\ntrial; and (4) that he was denied the right to a neutral judge both\n\nat trial and on appeal.         Unlike the first three claims, Nowaczyk\n\nhad not raised the issue of judicial bias on direct appeal from his\n\nstate conviction.       In AEDPA parlance, therefore, that claim was\n\n\"unexhausted.\"      Perhaps anticipating that problem, Nowaczyk filed\n\nan application for state post-conviction review on October 28,\n\n1997, in which he presented his claim of judicial bias.                 He filed\n\na second such application on May 10, 1998, raising a claim of\n\ndouble jeopardy that was not included in his § 2254 petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            On July 22, 1998, the district court dismissed Nowaczyk's\n\n§ 2254 petition without prejudice. The court noted that Nowaczyk's\n\nfirst application for state post-conviction review was then pending\nbefore the New Hampshire Supreme Court.              It concluded, therefore,\n\nthat Nowaczyk had failed to exhaust all available state remedies as\n\nto his claim of judicial bias, and dismissed the § 2254 petition on\nthat ground.\n\n            Nowaczyk filed a notice of appeal from the district\n\ncourt's decision on July 24. Approximately one week later, on July\n\n31, 1998,    the    New    Hampshire      Supreme   Court    entered      its   final\n\ndecision rejecting Nowaczyk's judicial bias claim.                     Citing that\n\ndecision, Nowaczyk asked the federal district court to reconsider\n\nits judgment.      He argued that dismissal no longer was appropriate\nnow that all of the claims presented in his § 2254 petition were\n\nfully exhausted.      The district court denied the motion by margin\n\norder, reasoning that Nowaczyk's pending appeal before us rendered\nhis motion for reconsideration \"moot.\"\n\n            Nowaczyk then filed a motion in this court for summary\n\nreversal.    We granted the motion, explaining that, \"[e]ven though\n\n[Nowaczyk's]    appeal      had    been    noticed    when       the   motion    [for\n\nreconsideration] was filed, the motion was not entirely moot.                     The\n\ndistrict court still had authority to review the motion and to\n\nnotify   this      court    if    it   was    inclined      to    grant    relief.\"\n\nAccordingly, we remanded to the district court so that it could\n\naddress the merits of Nowaczyk's motion for reconsideration.                       We\n\nemphasized that the court should consider whether, given the time\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\flimitations imposed by AEDPA, dismissal still was appropriate in\n\nNowaczyk's case.\n\n          On remand, the matter was referred to a magistrate judge,\nsee 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B), who recommended that Nowaczyk's\n\nmotion for reconsideration be granted.2      The magistrate judge\n\nreasoned that, since Nowaczyk's § 2254 petition was no longer\n\"mixed,\" but presented only exhausted claims, it was not subject to\n\ndismissal.   He rejected the state's argument that dismissal was\n\nwarranted because Nowaczyk's second application for state post-\n\nconviction review (raising the double jeopardy claim) still was\n\npending before the state courts. Although principles of comity and\n\njudicial economy mandate dismissal of any unexhausted claims, see\n\nRose v.

The court agreed that Nowaczyk's petition presented\nonly exhausted claims.        However, it concluded that dismissal was\n\nappropriate       because   of     the    pendency    of   Nowaczyk's    second\n\napplication for state post-conviction review.                That application\n\ncontained a challenge to the same conviction Nowaczyk sought to\n\noverturn through the federal habeas proceedings, and \"Nowaczyk did\n\nnot raise any unusual circumstances about the state court actions,\n\nsuch   as    extraordinary       delay,    that   would    justify   concurrent\nactions.\"     In the district court's view, the principles of comity\n\ndiscussed in Rose counseled in favor of \"defer[ring] to the state\n\ncourt action\" in such a case.\n            The court then turned to the question of AEDPA's statute\n\nof limitations.      It assumed, without deciding, that since Nowaczyk\nhad not attempted to appeal his conviction to the United States\n\nSupreme Court, he was not entitled to the benefit of the 90-day\n\nperiod for seeking a writ of certiorari.              Accordingly, the court\n\nconcluded that the statute of limitations began to run on January\n\n24, 1997 -- the date of the New Hampshire Supreme Court's final\n\ndecision in Nowaczyk's direct appeal.\n\n             The next question was the extent to which the statute of\n\nlimitations was tolled by Nowaczyk's various filings. The district\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fcourt determined that Nowaczyk's § 2254 petition -- if dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice on the ground of comity -- would not itself toll\n\nthe   limitations    period    for   any   subsequently-filed      petition.\nHowever, under AEDPA, the statute of limitations would be tolled\n\nwhenever a state-court challenge to \"the pertinent judgment or\n\nclaim\" was pending.      28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2).          The parties agreed\nthat the statute was tolled during the pendency of Nowaczyk's first\n\napplication for state post-conviction review, which raised the\n\njudicial bias claim presented in his § 2254 petition.                  The more\n\ndifficult question was whether his second application had a tolling\n\neffect even though it concerned a claim that was not included in\n\nthe § 2254 petition.     The district court answered that question in\n\nthe affirmative, reasoning that the second application challenged\nNowaczyk's conviction -- \"the pertinent judgment\" for purposes of\n\nhis § 2254 petition -- and therefore satisfied AEDPA's tolling\n\nprovision.\n           Thus, the court found that the statute of limitations had\n\nrun between January 24, 1997, and October 28, 1997 (when Nowaczyk\n\nfiled his first application for state post-conviction review), and\n\nthen was tolled by the (still pending) state proceedings.               Because\n\nNowaczyk would have \"some time, but not the full year,\" to refile\n\nhis § 2254 petition at the conclusion of the state proceedings, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that dismissal still was appropriate.\n\nNevertheless,   it     ended   its   opinion   with   a    warning:       \"Once\n\n[Nowaczyk's] pertinent state court proceedings are concluded, the\n\nlimitations   period    will   again   begin   to   run   until   it    quickly\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fexpires.    Therefore, if issues remain at the conclusion of the\n\nstate court proceedings that are appropriate for habeas relief,\n\nNowaczyk should be mindful of the diminished limitation period that\nremains.\"\n\n            The district court entered judgment dismissing Nowaczyk's\n\npetition without prejudice on March 9, 1999.        Nowaczyk promptly\nappealed to this court.      On March 26, 1999, the New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court rejected Nowaczyk's double jeopardy claim.         That\n\ndecision marked the end of Nowaczyk's second application for state\n\npost-conviction review, and therefore started AEDPA's statute of\n\nlimitations running once again.        The same day, Nowaczyk filed a\n\nmotion asking permission to supplement the record on appeal to\n\nreflect the fact that he no longer had any claims pending before\nthe state courts.    We granted that motion by order dated April 28,\n\n1999.\n\n            After an initial round of briefing by the parties -- with\nNowaczyk still proceeding pro se -- it was apparent that one of the\n\nissues on appeal was whether the district court erred in concluding\n\nthat Nowaczyk's § 2254 petition did not operate to toll AEDPA's\n\nstatute of limitations.    The Supreme Court had granted certiorari\n\nto address that question in Duncan v. Walker, and we decided to\n\nstay consideration of Nowaczyk's appeal until the Court issued its\n\nopinion.\n\n            The Supreme Court decided Duncan in June of 2001, holding\n\nthat the statute of limitations is tolled only by applications for\n\nstate post-conviction review, and that later-dismissed federal\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fhabeas petitions do not have any tolling effect.               </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n181-82 (2001). The upshot of that decision for Nowaczyk was clear:\n\nif we affirmed the dismissal of his § 2254 petition by the district\ncourt in March of 1999, the fact that it had been pending before\n\nthe federal courts for roughly four years would have no impact on\n\nthe statute of limitations.          Absent equitable tolling, the AEDPA\none-year limitations period would have expired for Nowaczyk in\n\nSeptember of 2000, and any subsequent petition would be time\n\nbarred.\n\n             Following the Supreme Court's decision in Duncan, we\n\nappointed counsel for Nowaczyk, ordered supplemental briefing, and\n\nscheduled oral argument.       We instructed counsel to focus on three\n\nquestions:      whether the district court erred in holding that\nNowaczyk's second application for state post-conviction review\n\ntolled AEDPA's statute of limitations; whether the district court\n\nabused    its   discretion     in    dismissing,    rather     than    staying,\nNowaczyk's § 2254 petition, given the statute of limitations\n\nconcerns;     and   whether,   if    we   concluded   that     dismissal     was\n\nappropriate, Nowaczyk would be entitled to equitable tolling when\n\nhe attempted to refile his habeas petition.\n\n             In its supplemental brief and again at oral argument, the\n\nstate conceded that Nowaczyk's second application for state post-\n\nconviction review tolled the limitations period.

Accordingly, we\n\nfocus on the question whether the district court should have stayed\n\nthe federal proceedings rather than dismissing Nowaczyk's petition\noutright.    We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case,\n\nthe district court abused its discretion in dismissing Nowaczyk's\n\n§ 2254 petition.       Accordingly, we need not decide whether the\n\ndoctrine of equitable tolling is available under AEDPA generally,\n\nsee, e.g., Donovan, 276 F.3d at 92-93 (reserving the question),\n\nand, if so, whether it would apply in this case.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            Before we can reach the issue of stay versus dismissal,\n\nwe first must address a threshold question: did the district court\nerr   in    delaying   its   decision     through   either   means?   Put\ndifferently, was the court obligated to adjudicate Nowaczyk's\n\nclaims immediately?3     We turn to that question.\n\nA.          Delay vs. Immediate Adjudication\n\n            In Rose v.

Similarly, we use the\nterm \"delay\" to refer to deferring federal proceedings until state\ncourt proceedings are resolved.\n\n                                   -11-\n\ffailure to exhaust state remedies.                The Court reasoned that such a\n\nrule   would    \"further[]         the     policy    of   comity    underlying      the\n\nexhaustion doctrine.\"          Id. at 514.          Requiring \"total exhaustion\"\nwould \"encourage state prisoners to seek full relief first from the\n\nstate courts, thus giving those courts the first opportunity to\n\nreview all     claims    of    constitutional         error.\"      Id.   at    518-19.\nMoreover, \"federal claims that have been fully exhausted in state\n\ncourts will more often be accompanied by a complete factual record\n\nto aid the federal courts in their review.\"                    Id. at 519.\n\n           The district court relied on that same policy of comity\n\nas a basis for dismissing Nowaczyk's § 2254 petition.                    It reasoned\n\nthat, although the claims presented in the petition had been fully\n\nexhausted,     the   fact     that       Nowaczyk    still   was   challenging       his\nconviction in state court brought his case within Rose's purview.\n\nThe court observed that the comity doctrine not only \"protect[s]\n\nthe state court's concurrent jurisdiction to enforce federal law\";\nit also \"'prevent[s] disruption of state judicial proceedings' by\n\nteaching that '\"one court should defer action on causes properly\nwithin its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty\n\nwith concurrent powers, and already cognizant of the litigation,\n\nhave had an opportunity to pass on the matter.\"'\"                    (Quoting Rose,\n\n455 U.S. at 518 (quoting Darr v.

He maintains that the\n\nrule of total exhaustion is not based on avoiding parallel state-\n\nfederal proceedings.   Rather, Nowaczyk argues, Rose's core holding\n\nwas that federal courts should not grant relief on claims that have\n\nnot yet been presented to the state courts.    Consistent with that\n\nview, Rose directed district courts to offer a choice to state\n\nprisoners with mixed petitions: they could either accept dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice and return to state court to exhaust the claims\n\npresented in their § 2254 petitions, or they could amend those\n\npetitions to remove any unexhausted claims.   See Rose, 455 U.S. at\n\n510.   If the prisoner chose the latter option, the district court\n\nwould adjudicate the remaining (exhausted) claims immediately,\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that the other unexhausted claims might be\npending before the state courts at the same time.\n           We agree that Rose does not require the district court to\n\nwithhold decision in cases such as Nowaczyk's.         See Hurd v.\n\nMondragon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508573\"><a href=\"/opinion/508573/laurence-hurd-v-eloy-mondragon-warden-and-attorney-general-for-the-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327-28 (10th Cir. 1988) (concluding that\nRose is not controlling where the state prisoner has exhausted his\n\nstate remedies on the claims presented in his § 2254 petition, but\nhe has other claims that have not been exhausted); Jones v.

If anything, it points\n\nin the opposite direction.   Rose held that a state prisoner who has\n\nboth exhausted and unexhausted claims can obtain prompt federal\n\n                                -13-\n\freview of the exhausted claims if he files a mixed petition and\n\nthen amends it to remove the unexhausted claims.    See 455 U.S. at\n\n510; Lacy v.

We see no reason why\n\na prisoner with a mixed petition should be better off than one\nwhose petition contains only exhausted claims.     But that is the\n\noddity implicit in the district court's reasoning. Under Rose, the\n\nstate prisoner with a mixed petition is entitled to proceed with\n\nhis exhausted claims if he agrees to amend his petition.   Under the\n\ndistrict court's approach, however, the state prisoner with a\n\npetition containing only exhausted claims is forbidden to proceed\n\nwith those claims until he adjudicates any unexhausted claims in\nstate court.   That distinction makes little sense, and we do not\n\nbelieve Rose compels it.\n\n           In addition to Rose, the district court also relied on\ncases such as Sherwood v. Tomkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424115\"><a href=\"/opinion/424115/frank-john-sherwood-iii-v-honorable-wendell-h-tomkins-circuit-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1983).\n\nThere, the petitioner had been convicted of manslaughter in state\n\ncourt and, in the course of appealing that conviction, lodged\n\nseveral requests for appointed counsel and a free transcript.   The\n\nstate courts denied his requests and, while his state appeal still\n\nwas pending, Sherwood filed a § 2254 petition challenging those\n\ndenials.    The Ninth Circuit held that Sherwood had failed to\n\nexhaust his state remedies with respect to his claim of indigency,\n\nand affirmed the dismissal of the § 2254 petition on that ground.\n\nSee id. at 633-34.    The court went on to note, in dicta, that\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f\"[w]hen, as in the present case, an appeal of a state criminal\n\nconviction is pending, a would-be habeas corpus petitioner must\n\nawait the outcome of his appeal before his state remedies are\nexhausted, even where the issue to be challenged in the writ of\n\nhabeas corpus has been finally settled in the state courts.\"           Id.\n\nat 634.\n            The Ninth Circuit reached a similar conclusion -- this\n\ntime not in dicta -- in Edelbacher v. Calderon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759204\"><a href=\"/opinion/759204/98-cal-daily-op-serv-8480-98-daily-journal-dar-11789-peter-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th\n\nCir. 1998), another case cited by the district court. Edelbacher's\n\nstate conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, but his death\n\nsentence was vacated.     Before the penalty-phase retrial had begun,\n\nEdelbacher filed a § 2254 petition challenging his conviction. The\n\nNinth Circuit concluded that the petition was premature, holding\nthat the district court should not entertain a federal habeas\n\nproceeding in the absence of a penalty phase judgment \"or until the\n\nexistence     of   extremely   unusual   circumstances    warrant[s]    an\nexception.\"    Id. at 585.\n\n            We are not persuaded that Sherwood and Edelbacher support\n\nthe district court's conclusion that dismissal was required in\n\nNowaczyk's case.      The dicta in Sherwood suggests that a state\n\nprisoner has not exhausted state remedies until he completes his\n\ndirect appeal from his conviction and sentence.          It therefore has\n\nlittle relevance here: Nowaczyk completed his direct appeal before\n\nhe filed his § 2254 petition, and the district court did not\n\nsuggest that dismissal was warranted because of any failure to\n\nexhaust state remedies.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f            Nor do we believe that Edelbacher stands for the broad\n\nrule that federal courts must dismiss § 2254 petitions whenever the\n\npetitioner is in the process of adjudicating other, related claims\nin the state courts.     As we explained above, such a rule would be\n\ninconsistent with Rose, and we doubt the Ninth Circuit intended to\n\nadopt it sub silentio.4     The better view is that Edelbacher held\nprecisely   what   it   said:     that,   in   the   absence   of   unusual\n\ncircumstances, a state prisoner cannot proceed with his § 2254\n\npetition when the state trial court has not yet rendered a decision\n\nas to the proper penalty.5      Obviously, that rule is not implicated\n\nhere.\n\n            In any event -- as the district court recognized -- other\n\ncircuits have rejected the broad rule that a state prisoner cannot\nadjudicate his fully-exhausted claims under § 2254 when other\n\n\n     4\n       Indeed, in the wake of AEDPA, the Ninth Circuit has taken\npains to protect a state prisoner's right to adjudicate any\nexhausted claims promptly. See Tillema, 253 F.3d at 503 (holding\nthat \"the district court committed prejudicial legal error when it\ndismissed Tillema's first federal habeas petition without affording\nhim the opportunity to abandon his sole unexhausted claim as an\nalternative to suffering dismissal\"); Anthony v.

As the Ninth Circuit\nexplained, the federal habeas court needs to know whether the\nprisoner's case is \"capital\" or \"non-capital\" before it can\nproceed, because that designation determines which procedures will\ngovern the habeas proceedings.

Stay vs. Dismissal\n\n           It appears that the question of stay versus dismissal in\n\ncases   involving   only   fully-exhausted    claims   is   one   of   first\n\n                                  -19-\n\fimpression.   However, several courts have addressed a related\n\nquestion: the propriety of dismissal in post-AEDPA cases involving\n\nmixed petitions.   Those cases are instructive here.\n          When   Rose was    decided,     there   was   no   time   limit   on\n\npetitions filed under § 2254.      Thus, there was little cost to a\n\ndismissal without prejudice -- the state prisoner could refile the\npetition at any time following exhaustion of his federal claims.\n\nAEDPA changed matters.      Its one-year statute of limitations \"has\n\nrendered outright dismissal perilous to some litigants, because\n\npetitioners . . . may find themselves time-barred when they attempt\n\nto resubmit their exhausted claims to the district court.\" Anthony\n\nv.

In Neverson v.

Post-AEDPA, this will be the preferable\n\ncourse in many cases involving 'mixed' petitions -- and it may be\nthe only appropriate course in cases in which an outright dismissal\n\nthreatens to imperil the timeliness of a collateral attack.\"                We\n\nreiterated that view in Delaney v. Matesanz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774790\"><a href=\"/opinion/774790/charles-c-delaney-iii-v-james-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 n.5\n\n(1st Cir. 2001), where we \"especially commend[ed]\" the use of stays\n\n\"in    instances   in    which   the   original   habeas   petition,    though\n\nunexhausted, is timely filed, but there is a realistic danger that\n\na second petition, filed after exhaustion has occurred, will be\n\nuntimely.\"\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\f           The state points out that neither Neverson nor Delaney\n\ncompels a stay in the circumstances of this case.                 When the\n\ndistrict court entered judgment in March of 1999, the statute of\nlimitations was still being tolled by Nowaczyk's second application\n\nfor state post-conviction review, and several months would remain\n\nin the limitations period when the clock started running again.7\nMoreover, the district court warned Nowaczyk that he would need to\n\nreturn promptly to federal court as soon as the state courts\n\ndecided   the   double   jeopardy    claims    presented   in   his   second\n\napplication for post-conviction review. Accordingly, if Nowaczyk's\n\npetition still had been \"mixed,\" Neverson and Delaney probably\n\nwould not have prevented the district court from dismissing it.\n\n           But therein lies the problem.           In both Neverson and\nDelaney, the district court was presented with a § 2254 petition\n\nthat contained unexhausted claims.            Thus, it did not have the\n\noption of adjudicating the petition immediately.                Unless the\npetitioner agreed to amend the petition to drop the unexhausted\n\nclaims, the district court had no choice but to delay decision\nuntil the prisoner completed the process of exhaustion.\n\n\n\n     7\n       Under the district court's computation (which excluded the\n90-day period for seeking certiorari from the United States Supreme\nCourt), the statute of limitations had run for approximately nine\nmonths when Nowaczyk filed his first application for state post-\nconviction review in October of 1997, leaving roughly three months\nto go.    Nowaczyk and the state maintain -- and we agree, see\nDonovan, 276 F.3d at 91 -- that the statute of limitations did not\nbegin to run until after the 90-day certiorari period. On that\nview, approximately six months remained in the limitations period\nwhen the New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected Nowaczyk's second\napplication for state-post conviction review.\n\n                                    -22-\n\f            The situation here is critically different.               Nowaczyk's\n\npetition contained only exhausted claims.               Nothing prevented the\n\ndistrict court from adjudicating those claims immediately; indeed,\nNowaczyk urged it to do so.        Although we have determined that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in withholding decision\n\nwhile Nowaczyk's      second     application     for   state    post-conviction\nrelief    was   pending,   it    bears    emphasis     that    --   unlike   cases\n\ninvolving mixed petitions -- such delay was not required here.                 It\n\nis one thing to say that a district court may choose between a stay\n\nand dismissal when a flaw in the § 2254 petition makes it necessary\n\nto delay decision through some means.             It is quite another to say\n\nthat the court may dismiss a petition that is properly before it\n\nand ready for decision.\n            The    state   has    not    even    attempted     to   defend    that\n\nproposition.      Instead, relying on cases such as Sherwood, it seeks\n\nto show that Nowaczyk's petition was not, in fact, ready for\ndecision.       We rejected that view above.           We explained that the\n\ndistrict court's decision to delay action on Nowaczyk's petition\nwas not compelled by Rose or by the principles of comity on which\n\nthe total exhaustion rule is based. That decision was permissible,\n\nhowever, as an exercise of the district court's \"power to control\n\nits docket,\" Thompson, 714 F.2d at 1499, and in the interest of\n\ncomity.    The question here is whether that power to delay embraces\n\nthe discretion to dismiss an action properly before the court and\n\nwithin its statutory jurisdiction.             We think not.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f            We conclude that \"[w]hen unusual circumstances\" -- rather\n\nthan a flaw in the petition itself -- \"make it imprudent to address\n\nthe § 2254 petition immediately, the collateral attack should be\nstayed rather than dismissed.\"                  Post v. Gilmore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739717\"><a href=\"/opinion/739717/roy-post-v-jerry-d-gilmore/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557\n\n(7th Cir. 1997).           This case is unusual because Nowaczyk was in the\n\nprocess of adjudicating his double jeopardy claim in the state\ncourts, yet made no effort to include that claim in his § 2254\n\npetition.       He    expressed         no    interest       in    delaying    the     federal\n\nproceedings until the resolution of his second application for\n\nstate post-conviction review; nor did he seek to amend his § 2254\n\npetition to include the claim of double jeopardy.                            Rather, he was\n\nready   and     willing          to    adjudicate      the        fully-exhausted       claims\n\npresented in that petition immediately.\n              Thus, Nowaczyk's case differs from those discussed in the\n\nprevious section, which affirm the district court's discretion to\n\ndelay   resolution          of    a    fully-exhausted            petition    so     that    the\npetitioner     can        exhaust      other    claims       in    state     court    and,   if\n\nnecessary, amend his federal petition to include them.                                  It is\n\nnotable   that       none    of       those    cases    so   much     as    suggested       that\n\ndismissal     was     a    viable       option.        Rather,       the   courts      clearly\n\nunderstood the choice to be between immediate adjudication or a\n\nstay.     See,      e.g.,        Anthony,      236    F.3d   at     575    (\"Our     precedent\n\nunequivocally authorizes district courts to stay fully exhausted\n\nfederal petitions . . . .\") (emphasis added); Thompson, 714 F.2d at\n\n1500 (affirming district court's decision to stay decision on\n\nexhausted claims although the district court also \"could have\n\n\n                                               -24-\n\fdenied a delay [and] decided the issues that were alleged in the\n\npetition\"). If outright dismissal of a fully-exhausted petition is\n\ndisfavored even when the petitioner asked the court to withhold\ndecision on his claims, it is even more inappropriate where, as\n\nhere, the petitioner resisted any such delay.      See Jones, 608 F.2d\n\nat 183 (holding that district court erred in dismissing a fully-\nexhausted petition on the ground that other, unexhausted, claims\n\nmight be asserted in the future); Myers, 372 F.2d at 112 (holding\n\nthat district court erred in dismissing, rather than adjudicating,\n\na fully-exhausted claim where another claim was still pending\n\nbefore the state courts).\n\n             The reason for such a rule is fairly simple.        Although\n\nhabeas relief is an equitable remedy, \"a district judge may not\nremit [§ 2254] petitioners to their other remedies, the way a judge\n\nmay decline to issue declaratory relief.\"       Post, 111 F.3d at 557.\n\nRather, like other civil actions, § 2254 petitions are \"governed by\nthe norm that a district court must exercise its full statutory\n\njurisdiction.\"     Id.; see also Colorado River Water Conservation\n\nDist. v.

That norm is violated when the\n\ndistrict court dismisses a petition that is properly before it and\n\nwithin its jurisdiction under AEDPA.      A stay does not suffer from\n\nthe   same    infirmity.    Because     the   district   court   retains\n\njurisdiction over the petition during the course of a stay, that\n\nprocedure does not \"involve the abdication of federal jurisdiction,\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fbut only the postponement of its exercise.\" Harrison v.

See, e.g., Colorado River, 424\n\nU.S. at 813 (explaining that \"exceptional circumstances\" may permit\n\nabstention from \"the duty of a District Court to adjudicate a\n\ncontroversy properly before it\").     Thus, we do not adopt a bright-\n\nline rule that a district court may never dismiss a fully-exhausted\n\npetition. However, in order to justify a departure from the \"heavy\n\n     8\n       We recognize that, in certain circumstances, \"a stay is as\nmuch a refusal to exercise federal jurisdiction as a dismissal.\"\nMoses H. Cone Mem. Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110873\"><a href=\"/opinion/110873/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-v-mercury-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28\n(1983). That is so, for example, when the district court enters a\nstay under the Colorado River doctrine on the ground that \"parallel\nstate-court litigation will be an adequate vehicle for the complete\nand prompt resolution of the issues between the parties.\" Id. In\nsuch a case, the expectation \"is that the controversy will be\nresolved in the state court proceeding, and that if the party\nreturns to federal court after the state action is over, the most\nthat will be needed is to dispose of the federal suit on principles\nof res judicata or collateral estoppel.\" Charles A. Wright, Arthur\nR. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, 17A Federal Practice and Procedure\n§ 4247, at 136 (2d ed. 1994). It therefore makes no difference\nwhether the district court enters a stay or dismisses the case\noutright: either way, the parties will be forced to adjudicate\ntheir claims in state, rather than federal, court.\n     That is not the situation here. The state courts' resolution\nof Nowaczyk's double jeopardy claim against him would not prevent\nNowaczyk from asserting that claim or any of his other claims in\nthe federal habeas proceedings. At most, a ruling in Nowaczyk's\nfavor on the double jeopardy claim would have rendered the federal\nproceedings unnecessary, because Nowaczyk already would have\nobtained the relief he desired. Thus, in staying its hand until\nthe resolution of the state court proceedings, the district court\nwould postpone, rather than abdicate, its exercise of jurisdiction\nover those claims.\n\n                               -26-\n\fobligation to exercise jurisdiction,\" id. at 820, there must be\n\nsome compelling reason to prefer dismissal over a stay.          Such a\n\njustification is wholly lacking here.        As the state conceded at\noral argument, the comity concerns on which the district court\n\nrelied are adequately served by a stay. Indeed, staying Nowaczyk's\n\nfully-exhausted petition would seem to be the most obvious way to\n\"defer action . . . until\" the state courts had a full opportunity\n\nto pass on the double jeopardy claim, Rose, 455 U.S. at 518.           See\n\nZarvela, 254 F.3d at 380 (noting that \"[s]taying the exhausted\n\nclaims would be a traditional way\" to satisfy Rose's policy of\n\ncomity).     Most importantly, a stay would serve the interest of\n\ncomity while, at the same time, protecting Nowaczyk's interest in\n\nadjudicating his federal constitutional claims in federal court.\n            The state argues vaguely that dismissal would relieve the\n\ndistrict court of the burden of keeping track of the case.            It is\n\nnot clear that leaving the case on the court's docket would be\nparticularly taxing, and the state has made no effort to explain\n\nthe point.    But even if we assume that a stay would cause some\n\nadditional administrative burden, such a minor inconvenience hardly\n\noutweighs    the   district   court's    obligation   to   exercise     its\n\njurisdiction under AEDPA.\n\n            Finally, the state emphasizes that the district court did\n\nnot ask much of Nowaczyk:      all he had to do was refile the same\n\npetition he filed in June of 1997.       That is beside the point.       As\n\nwe have explained, the district court has an affirmative obligation\n\nto adjudicate claims, such as Nowaczyk's, that are properly before\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fit. Thus, it is irrelevant that Nowaczyk easily could have refiled\n\nhis petition.    The same could be said of any civil complaint, but\n\nthat clearly would not justify dismissing it.       Rather, whatever\nadministrative inconvenience resulted from the district court's\n\ndecision to delay resolution of Nowaczyk's claims -- the burden of\n\nkeeping track of the case, as the state puts it -- should have been\nborne by the court, not Nowaczyk.\n\n            Under AEDPA, pro se prisoners seeking to adjudicate their\n\nconstitutional claims in federal court must satisfy several complex\n\nprocedural requirements that often are difficult even for courts to\n\ndecipher.    See, e.g., Carey v. Saffold, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121154\"><a href=\"/opinion/121154/carey-v-saffold/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When a prisoner manages to make his way\n\nthrough the procedural thicket and places his timely, fully-\n\nexhausted claims before the district court, we do not think he\n\nshould be turned away with dismissal of his action on the basis of\n\nan insubstantial claim of administrative convenience.\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f                                    III.\n\n            In summary, we hold that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying Nowaczyk's motion for reconsideration and\n\ndismissing his fully-exhausted § 2254 petition.              AEDPA's one-year\n\nstatute of limitations expired while this appeal was pending.\n\nThus, if we had affirmed the dismissal of Nowaczyk's first § 2254\n\npetition, a serious question would have arisen as to whether he\n\nwould be permitted to file a second petition at this time.\n\n            That Nowaczyk's claims were properly before the district\n\ncourt,    ready   for   adjudication,    is    critical     to   our   decision.\nNowaczyk urged prompt action. The district court has an obligation\n\nto   adjudicate    claims,   like   Nowaczyk's,      that    are      within    its\nstatutory    jurisdiction.      Although      the   question     is    close,   we\nconclude that the court is entitled to delay decision on such\n\nclaims when considerations of comity and judicial economy would be\nserved.     However, something more than related claims pending in\nstate court is needed before the court may dismiss a fully-\n\nexhausted petition outright.            Such dismissal has always been\ndifficult to square with the court's obligation to exercise the\njurisdiction given it by Congress.            AEDPA raises the stakes:          its\n\ncomplex procedural requirements heighten the risk that a dismissal\nwithout prejudice will, in practice, result in a dismissal with\n\nprejudice, as happened here.\n\n            In the face of those concerns, the district court cited\nthe general interest in federal-state comity as a reason for\n\ndismissing Nowaczyk's petition.            But that interest is served\n\n                                    -29-\n\fequally well by a stay; it cannot justify the court's choice of the\n\nmore extreme measure of dismissal.          The state points to the\n\nadministrative burden, identified as keeping track of the case,\nassociated with retaining jurisdiction over Nowaczyk's case.         That\n\nis not enough. If the court's obligation to exercise its statutory\n\njurisdiction means anything, it cannot possibly be trumped by such\na trivial inconvenience.     Indeed, an obligation that dissolves at\n\nthe first pinch of inconvenience is no obligation at all.\n\n           We have said that an \"[a]buse [of discretion] occurs when\n\na material factor deserving significant weight is ignored, when an\n\nimproper factor is relied upon, or when all proper and no improper\n\nfactors are assessed, but the court makes a serious mistake in\n\nweighing them.\"    Fashion House, Inc. v.

Here,\n\nthe factors on which the district court relied do not support its\n\ndecision   to   dismiss   Nowaczyk's    petition   rather   than   retain\njurisdiction and enter a stay.    Given the difficulties associated\n\nwith dismissal in general of a claim properly before the court --\n\nand under AEDPA in particular -- that decision constituted an abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n           It appears that Nowaczyk no longer has any claims pending\n\nbefore the state courts.
