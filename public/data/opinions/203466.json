William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Leslie J. McGill on brief pro se.\n     H. Andrew Matzkin and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky\nand Popeo, P.C. on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          September 3, 2008\n\f               Per Curiam.   Pro se appellant Leslie J. McGill seeks\n\nreview of the dismissal of her employment discrimination complaint\n\nagainst her previous employer, appellee U.S. Express Truck Co. of\n\nOhio.       The district court dismissed McGill's amended complaint as\n\ntime-barred and denied her motion to amend as futile.          As the\n\nfollowing discussion will show, McGill's timely-filed in forma\n\npauperis (\"IFP\") motion and application tolled the statute of\n\nlimitations.\n\n               There is no dispute that McGill filed (and the clerk\n\ndocketed) her original complaint and IFP application on August 10,\n\n2007, before the expiration of the 90-day limitations period for\n\nfiling a complaint following receipt of the EEOC right to sue\n\nletter.1      42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-(5)(f)(1) (Title VII) and 29 U.S.C. ยง\n\n626(e) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act).        On September 5,\n\n2007, the district court denied McGill's IFP application (without\n\nprejudice) because it was incomplete, and it ordered her to file a\n\nnew application or pay the filing fee within 35 days.        Two days\n\nlater, McGill filed a new IFP application and an amended complaint.\n\nThe district court granted the new IFP application on September 12,\n\n2007.\n\n\n\n        1\n        Although the record does not indicate when McGill received\nthe EEOC right to sue letter, assuming that she received it in the\nmail three days after it was issued, the 90-day limitations period\nbegan on May 18, 2007, the day after receipt. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n6(a), (d).    At the earliest, therefore, the limitations period\nexpired on August 15, 2007.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            Appellee moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).        After hearing on this motion on\n\nDecember 11, 2007, the district court gave McGill 30 days in which\n\nto seek leave to further amend her complaint, apparently to prove\n\nthat she had exhausted her administrative remedies. That same day,\n\nMcGill filed a \"second amended complaint\" to which was attached a\n\ncopy of her EEOC right to sue letter, dated May 14, 2007.\n\n            Treating this pleading as a motion for leave to amend,\n\nappellee filed its opposition, arguing that leave should be denied\n\nand the case should be dismissed.       According to appellee, McGill's\n\ncomplaint could not be considered \"filed\" until she submitted a\n\nproper and complete IFP application, and this she had failed to do\n\nuntil September 7, 2007, well after the 90-day limitations period\n\nhad expired in mid-August.    The district court agreed.        It denied\n\nthe motion for leave to amend as \"futile\" and summarily dismissed\n\nthe case.\n\n            In this circuit, \"advance payment of a filing fee is\n\ngenerally   not   a   jurisdictional    prerequisite   to   a   lawsuit.\"\n\nCasanova v. Dubois, 304 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2002); Bolduc v.\n\nUnited States, 189 F. Supp. 640 (D. Me. 1960).              Where an IFP\n\napplication is subsequently granted, the complaint is deemed timely\n\nfiled if it was presented to the court along with the IFP motion\n\nwithin the limitations period. Williams-Guice v. Board of Educ., 45\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fF.3d   161,   163   (7th   Cir.   1995);    Jarrett   v.   U.S.   Sprint\n\nCommunications Co., 22 F.3d 256, 259 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\n          The filing of the IFP application tolled the limitations\n\nperiod until the court ruled on it.     Jarrett, 22 F.3d at 259.    When\n\nthe court denied the original IFP application, it did so without\n\nprejudice and it gave McGill 35 days in which to file a new\n\napplication or pay the filing fee.         Instead, she filed her new\n\napplication in two days.      Assuming that the limitations period\n\nstarted running again on the day the first IFP application was\n\ndenied, three more days still remain on the clock.           Thus both\n\nMcGill's original complaint and her ultimately successful IFP\n\napplication were filed within the limitations period.\n\n          Even if the district court had denied McGill's amended\n\nIFP application, she would have been entitled to a reasonable time\n\nin which to pay the filing fee.    Williams-Guice, 45 F.3d at 163 (15\n\ndays); Jarrett, 22 F.3d at 259 (reasonable grace period permitted).\n\nThere is simply no basis in this record for dismissing McGill's\n\ncomplaint as time-barred.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.     Costs shall be taxed in favor of\n\nappellant.    Fed. R. App. P. 30(a)(4).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
