This civil rights case requires us\n\nto decide whether police officers of the Town of Walpole and the\n\nCommonwealth      of   Massachusetts         Department     of     State      Police\n\n(\"Massachusetts State Police\" or \"MSP\") were entitled to summary\n\njudgment on Plaintiff-Appellant Edmund F. Burke's claim that they\n\nviolated his Fourth Amendment rights when they arrested him for a\n\nbrutal murder he did not commit.               We must also decide whether\n\nforensic     dentists/odontologists          who   assisted      in    the    murder\n\ninvestigation were entitled to summary judgment on Burke's claims\n\nthat they fabricated or exaggerated inculpatory bite mark evidence\n\nin support of probable cause.      Finally, we must decide whether the\n\nChief of Police of the Town of Walpole was entitled to summary\n\njudgment on Burke's claim that he defamed Burke after his arrest.\n\n            We first identify the defendants and their official\n\npositions.     Defendants James J. Dolan, William F. Bausch, Joseph\n\nBetro, and Richard Stillman were employed in the Police Department\n\nof Defendant Town of Walpole, Dolan and Bausch as detectives, Betro\n\nas Chief of Police, and Stillman as Lieutenant and press officer.\n\nDefendants Stephen McDonald and Kevin Shea were Troopers with the\n\nMassachusetts State Police assigned to the Crime Prevention and\n\nControl    Unit   at   the   Norfolk    County     Office     of      the    District\n\nAttorney,1 with Shea holding the rank of Sergeant.                 Defendants Dr.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The MSP operates a \"Division of Investigative Service\" at the\nDistrict Attorney's Office.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fLowell Levine and Dr. Kathleen Crowley were employed as forensic\n\nodontologists, Dr. Levine as an independent consultant to the\n\nNorfolk County District Attorney's Office, and Dr. Crowley on a\n\npart-time basis with the Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical\n\nExaminer.   Appellee Robert Martin was employed as a chemist at the\n\nMSP Crime Laboratory.\n\n            After a careful review of the record, with our focus on\n\nBurke's principal § 1983 claim, we conclude the following:\n\n            • viewing the evidence as we must on summary\n              judgment, Burke has proffered evidence\n              sufficient to support a finding that he was\n              arrested without probable cause, and hence\n              in violation of his Fourth Amendment right;\n\n            • Trooper McDonald's defense of qualified\n              immunity fails because the record contains\n              evidence, sufficient to create a jury\n              question,    that   he   intentionally    or\n              recklessly withheld exculpatory DNA evidence\n              from the magistrate who issued the warrant\n              to arrest Burke, and a reasonable officer\n              would know that such conduct violated a\n              clearly established Fourth Amendment right;\n\n            • Det. Dolan had a reasonable basis for\n              seeking an arrest warrant and is entitled to\n              summary judgment on the ground of qualified\n              immunity;\n\n            • Det. Bausch and Sgt. Shea reasonably relied\n              on a facially valid arrest warrant and are\n              entitled to summary judgment on the ground\n              of qualified immunity;\n\n            • the   record fails    to   support   Burke's\n              allegation that Dr. Levine or Dr. Crowley\n              intentionally or recklessly fabricated or\n              exaggerated inculpatory bite mark opinions,\n              and they are entitled to summary judgment on\n              the ground of qualified immunity;\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          • Chief Betro's public statements made in the\n            exercise   of his    official   duties   are\n            conditionally privileged, and he is entitled\n            to summary judgment on Burke's defamation\n            claim.2\n\n\n     2\n      Burke raised many other claims on appeal, all without merit.\nWe have disposed of those claims summarily for substantially the\nsame reasons given by the magistrate judge and adopted by the\ndistrict court. These claims include: civil conspiracy under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 (Dr. Levine, Trooper McDonald, Sgt. Shea, Dets. Dolan\nand Bausch, Lt. Stillman, Chief Betro, and Dr. Crowley (appeal from\ndismissal of claim)), supervisory liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n(Lt. Stillman and Chief Betro), municipal liability under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 (Town of Walpole), defamation (Lt. Stillman), and medical\nmalpractice (Dr. Levine). See Burke v. Town of Walpole, No. 00-\n10376, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24912 (D. Mass. Aug. 5, 2003)\n(adopting magistrate judge's report and recommendation on motion to\ndismiss); Burke v. Town of Walpole, Nos. 00-10376, 00-10384, 00-\n12541, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3964 (D. Mass. Jan. 22, 2004)\n(adopting magistrate judge's reports and recommendations on summary\njudgment and granting summary judgment to Dr. Crowley without\nreferring motion to magistrate judge).\n     Given Burke's lack of due diligence in identifying MSP Crime\nLab Chemist Robert Martin as a potential defendant, we also affirm,\non the ground of prejudicial delay, the district court's decision\ndenying Burke's motion to amend his complaint. See Steir v. Girl\nScouts of the USA, 383 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"[P]rotracted\ndelay, with its attendant burdens on the opponent and the court, is\nitself a sufficient reason for the court to withhold permission to\namend.\").\n     We treat as waived all claims not mentioned in Burke's omnibus\nobjection to the magistrate judge's reports and recommendations on\nsummary judgment, Keating v. Sec'y of Health and Human Servs., 848\nF.2d 271, 275 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"[O]nly those issues fairly raised\nby the objections to the magistrate's report are subject to review\nin the district court and those not preserved by such objection are\nprecluded on appeal.\"), as well as those insufficiently developed\non appeal, United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by\nsome effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").\nThese include: Burke's claim that his home was searched without\nprobable cause; all supplemental state law claims against Dets.\nDolan and Bausch, Trooper McDonald, and Dr. Crowley; and all claims\nagainst two defendants whom Burke originally named as appellees\n(MSP Trooper Scott Jennings and Dr. Crowley's supervisor at the\nOffice of the Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Richard Evans).\n\n                               -5-\n\f                            I. BACKGROUND\n\n          We recount the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nPlaintiff-Appellant Burke.     Diaz v. City of Fitchburg, 176 F.3d\n\n560, 561 (1st Cir. 1999).    On the morning of December 1, 1998, the\n\npartially clothed and mutilated body of 75-year-old Irene Kennedy\n\nwas found in a wooded area of Bird Park in Walpole, Massachusetts.\n\nShe had been savagely beaten, strangled, and stabbed multiple\n\ntimes.   Her breasts were exposed, and the left breast bore a\n\nvisible bite mark.   Investigators from the Town of Walpole Police\n\nDepartment and the Massachusetts State Police were called to the\n\nscene after Kennedy's husband alerted a park caretaker to the\n\nbody's presence.3    According to police reports, Mr. Kennedy told\n\ninvestigators that he and his wife walked in the park almost daily,\n\nbut that they took separate routes because an injury prevented him\n\nfrom walking as quickly as his wife.     He stated that he had gone\n\nlooking for his wife when she failed to meet him at their usual\n\ntime in the parking lot that morning, and that he had discovered\n\nher body in an area of the park where he knew she sometimes stopped\n\nto urinate.\n\n          Upon learning of Mrs. Kennedy's murder, one of the\n\nKennedys' daughters, Nancy Tower, told Det. Bausch that he should\n\n\n\n     3\n      The Walpole officers were not directly involved in the\ncollection or analysis of forensic evidence, which was handled\nprimarily by MSP Crime Scene Services and the Office of the Chief\nMedical Examiner.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fspeak to Edmund Burke, who lived on the street adjoining the\n\nparking lot where her parents routinely parked, and whose brother\n\nwas married to another of the Kennedys' daughters.          According to\n\nDet. Bausch's report, Tower told him that Burke was \"very odd.\"\n\nTrooper McDonald also reported that Tower told him \"that Eddie\n\nBurke is abusive to his mother\" and that Burke's mother had told\n\nMrs. Kennedy so.    Trooper McDonald's report continued, \"Ms. Tower\n\nstated that as a result of these conversations she felt that her\n\nmother was leery of Burke.       Ms. Tower stated that subject Burke is\n\nunemployed and hangs around his house all day and seems very\n\nstrange.\"\n\n            Later that morning, when Det. Bausch and another Walpole\n\npolice officer visited Burke's home, where he lived with his 88-\n\nyear-old mother, no one responded to their knocks or shouts.          When\n\nthey returned to the house a short time later, Burke's mother and\n\nbrother were     outside   the   house.   According   to   Det.   Bausch's\n\nreport, Burke's mother told him Burke had been asleep when she left\n\nthe house earlier that morning, and she seemed reluctant to wake\n\nhim, but eventually agreed to do so.      When Burke came outside, Det.\n\nBausch informed him and his brother of Mrs. Kennedy's death. Burke\n\nthen agreed to go to the police station to talk to investigators\n\nand left with his brother while Det. Bausch remained outside\n\nBurke's house.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f          Meanwhile, investigators at the crime scene employed a K-\n\n9 tracking dog to follow any scents detected near the body.\n\nAccording to a report by the dog's handler, the dog was introduced\n\nto \"a pile of leaves [removed] from between the victim's legs\" and\n\nthen proceeded through the woods and across a field towards the\n\nstreet on which Burke lived. From there, the handler recorded, \"we\n\nwent to the right before the K-9 circled back to the left heading\n\nwest. [The] K-9 . . . traveled along the . . . sidewalk past\n\n[Burke's house] for about fifteen to twenty feet.        The K-9 circled\n\nback and traveled to the front door of [Burke's house] . . . .\"\n\n          Det. Bausch saw the K-9 dog come out of the woods and\n\nultimately stop at Burke's house.        Det. Bausch then went to the\n\npolice   station,   where   he,   Sgt.   Shea,   and   Trooper   McDonald\n\nquestioned Burke.   According to Sgt. Shea's report, Burke told the\n\nofficers that he knew the Kennedys but not well, and he described\n\ntheir walking routine, which he knew because he usually saw them in\n\nthe morning in the parking lot next to his house.          Burke stated\n\nthat he had been asleep at home at the time of the murder until the\n\npolice arrived and his mother woke him up.       Burke also stated that\n\nhe had not visited the park for two years, intending the statement\n\nto mean that he had not gone to the park as a destination during\n\nthat time.    When Det. Bausch told Burke that a K-9 dog had\n\napparently tracked a scent through the park to Burke's front door,\n\nBurke stated that he had taken a shortcut through the park late on\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fthe Sunday night before the Tuesday morning murder, along with two\n\nof   his   cats.   The   officers   considered   this   statement   to   be\n\ninconsistent with Burke's earlier statement that he had not visited\n\nthe park for two years.      While at the station, Burke provided a\n\nsaliva sample for DNA testing and comparison with any foreign DNA\n\ncollected from the body.      He also permitted police to take his\n\njacket in order to test it for forensic evidence.\n\n            In the days after the murder, Det. Dolan interviewed\n\npotential witnesses who lived in the vicinity of Bird Park or who\n\nwalked regularly in the park.       He recorded statements by several\n\npeople who reported seeing a person matching Burke's description in\n\nthe general area of the park in which the body was found in the\n\ndays before the murder and also in the driveway outside Burke's\n\nhouse on the morning of the murder when Burke said he had been\n\nasleep.\n\n            Further examination of the victim's body by the Chief\n\nMedical Examiner's Office revealed a second bite mark on the other\n\nbreast.     Both bite marks were determined to have been made by a\n\nhuman.     The bite marks were photographed and the bite mark on the\n\nleft breast swabbed to collect DNA evidence from any traces of\n\nforeign saliva or skin.    The swab from the victim's left breast and\n\nthe sample of Burke's saliva were sent to the Maine State Police\n\nCrime Laboratory on December 4 for expedited DNA analysis because\n\nno such facility was yet in operation in Massachusetts.                  Two\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fswatches from Burke's jacket were also sent to the Maine Crime Lab\n\non December 8.\n\n            On December 3, Burke agreed to go to the police station\n\nso that Dr. Crowley, a forensic odontologist with the Office of the\n\nChief    Medical   Examiner,     could   make    a    mold   of   his     teeth   for\n\ncomparison with photographs of the bite marks on the victim's\n\nbreasts.      Upon    Dr.    Crowley's        recommendation,       the    district\n\nattorney's office hired Dr. Lowell Levine, an experienced forensic\n\nodontologist based in Albany, New York, to examine the mold of\n\nBurke's teeth and compare it with the photographs of the bite\n\nmarks.     On December 6, Dr. Crowley, Det. Dolan, and Trooper\n\nJennings traveled to Albany to bring the mold and the photographs\n\nto Dr. Levine for examination.                Dr. Levine formed an initial\n\nopinion that Burke could not be excluded as the source of the bite\n\nmarks, but stated that he would need to see enhanced photographs in\n\norder to render a final opinion.\n\n            On December 9, Dr. Levine traveled to Boston to examine\n\nsamples of the victim's clothing for bite marks and to instruct a\n\nphoto laboratory employee on how to enlarge the photographs for\n\nbetter comparison with the mold of Burke's teeth.                 Dr. Levine then\n\nreturned to Albany.     Trooper McDonald and Sgt. Shea delivered the\n\nenlarged photographs        to   Dr.   Levine    in   Albany      late    that    same\n\nevening.    Also on December 9, Theresa Calicchio, the forensic DNA\n\nchemist at the Maine Crime Lab who was assigned to perform the DNA\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fanalysis of Burke's saliva samples, the swatches from his jacket,\n\nand the samples taken from the victim's left breast, called Trooper\n\nMcDonald to inform him that she had extracted DNA from the samples\n\nshe had received and that she would call with results of the\n\nanalysis the next day.\n\n          Sometime on the morning of December 10, after comparing\n\nthe mold of Burke's teeth with the enlarged photographs of the bite\n\nmarks, Dr. Levine told Trooper McDonald that Burke's teeth matched\n\nthe bite mark on the victim's left breast to a \"reasonable degree\n\nof scientific certainty.\"   That same morning, at around 11:00 AM,\n\nCalicchio informed Trooper McDonald that the DNA analysis showed\n\nthat Burke was excluded as the source of male DNA found in the bite\n\nmark on the victim's left breast.4\n\n          According to a report by Sgt. Shea, he and another MSP\n\nTrooper, Scott Jennings, received Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion\n\nfrom Trooper McDonald on December 10 \"at approximately 1315 hours\"\n\n(i.e., 1:15 PM).   Sgt. Shea and Trooper Jennings then incorporated\n\nthe bite mark opinion into an affidavit in support of a search\n\n\n     4\n      Calicchio wrote in her call log that Trooper McDonald called\nher, and that she \"gave him verbal results on the DNA profiles\nobtained from the evidence.\" Calicchio's written report of the DNA\nanalysis, which she prepared on December 12, stated: \"A mixture of\nmale and female DNA profiles was obtained from the breast swabbings\n(Items #1A and 1B). The predominant DNA profile matches the DNA\nprofile of Irene Kennedy. The minor component of the DNA profile\ndoes not match the DNA profile of Edmund Burke. A nine locus DNA\nprofile was obtained from the cuttings of [Burke's] blue jacket\n(Items 3A and 3B) which matches the DNA profile of Edmund Burke.\"\nNo other human DNA was found on Burke's jacket.\n\n                                -11-\n\fwarrant.     Based      on   the    facts    recited     in    the    search   warrant\n\naffidavit, Det. Dolan prepared an application for a warrant for\n\nBurke's arrest.\n\n            At    approximately       3:00   PM     that   afternoon,      Burke     was\n\narrested    at    his   home   and    brought       to   the   police     station     in\n\nhandcuffs.       Det. Bausch, Sgt. Shea, Trooper Jennings, and Trooper\n\nMcDonald, among other officers, were present during the arrest,\n\nalthough Troopers Jennings and McDonald testified at deposition\n\nthat they were present only to conduct a search of Burke's home\n\npursuant to the search warrant.\n\n            During Burke's arraignment the next day, December 11,\n\nTrooper McDonald called Sgt. Shea, who was at the courthouse, to\n\ntell him that the DNA analysis results excluded Burke as the source\n\nof the unidentified male DNA on the victim's left breast.                            Sgt.\n\nShea alerted Assistant District Attorney (\"ADA\") Gerald Pudolsky\n\nmid-argument and pulled him away from the arraignment to tell him\n\nthe   new   information.           When   Burke's    arraignment        resumed,      ADA\n\nPudolsky represented to the arraigning judge that DNA analysis had\n\nshown ambiguous results and that \"further testing\" was required.5\n\nHe then sought Burke's detention without bail.                       Burke's attorney\n\ndid   not   request     Burke's      immediate      release     on    bail,    and    the\n\narraigning judge ordered Burke held pending a bail hearing on\n\n\n      5\n      It is unclear why ADA Pudolsky believed that the DNA analysis\nresults were ambiguous and that additional testing was required to\nexclude Burke as the source of the male DNA in the bite mark.\n\n                                          -12-\n\fDecember 29.   On that date, Burke was granted release on bail to\n\nhouse arrest with electronic monitoring.   His release was delayed,\n\nhowever, because his house could not immediately be equipped for\n\nmonitoring.\n\n          On January 17, while Burke was awaiting release on\n\nconditional bail, a comparison of a palm print found on the\n\nvictim's body against a set of palm prints taken from Burke by\n\ncourt order a few days earlier revealed that Burke was not the\n\nsource of the palm print on the victim's body.   On January 19, the\n\ndistrict attorney filed a nolle prosequi in the case on the ground\n\nthat Burke's prosecution was premature.    The next day, forty-one\n\ndays after his arrest, Burke was released from custody.6\n\n          Just over one year after his arrest, on December 13,\n\n1999, Burke filed a civil rights action in state court against the\n\nTown of Walpole, Dr. Levine, and various officers and supervisors\n\nof the Walpole Police Department in their individual and official\n\ncapacities alleging, among other state and federal law claims, that\n\nthe defendants had violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by depriving him of\n\nhis right under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to be free\n\n\n\n     6\n      According to a Boston Globe article of June 28, 2003, which\nBurke submitted in his opposition to the Walpole defendants' motion\nfor summary judgment, police sought an arrest warrant for another\nman who was already serving a life sentence for murder after a DNA\ndatabase search indicated a possible match between his DNA profile\nand samples taken from Kennedy's body.

Burke also alleged that Chief\n\nBetro had defamed him by falsely attributing the murder to him in\n\npublic.   The defendants removed the case to federal court.            On\n\nDecember 14, 2000, Burke filed a similar action in federal court\n\nagainst various MSP Troopers, employees of the Massachusetts Chief\n\nMedical Examiner's Office, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nBurke then filed an amended complaint to consolidate the two cases.\n\nIn May 2001 Burke amended his complaint to add claims of negligence\n\nagainst the    Commonwealth.    Burke   was   permitted   to   amend   his\n\ncomplaint again on February 19, 2002 to join Dr. Crowley as a\n\ndefendant.    On July 16, 2002, Burke moved to amend his complaint a\n\nfourth time to join Robert Martin, a chemist at the Massachusetts\n\nCrime Lab, as a defendant, but the motion was denied.\n\n          In May 2003, all defendants except Dr. Crowley moved for\n\nsummary judgment.7   In October 2003 a magistrate judge recommended\n\ngranting summary judgment to all defendants on all claims in three\n\ncomprehensive reports and recommendations.

Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166 (1985).10\n\nBurke alleges that the police defendants violated his Fourth\n\nAmendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure11 by procuring:\n\n(1) his home arrest without a valid warrant, (2) his arrest without\n\nprobable cause, and (3) his arrest on the basis of a misleading\n\nwarrant   application   submitted     with     intentional      or     reckless\n\ndisregard for the truth.\n\n          The    defendants   all    insist    that     Burke   suffered    no\n\nconstitutional    deprivation.      The    individual    police      defendants\n\n\n\n     9\n      Because we summarily affirm the grant of summary judgment to\nLt. Stillman and Chief Betro on Burke's § 1983 claims, see supra\nnote 2, we exclude them from the discussion that follows.\n     10\n      42 U.S.C. § 1983 states, in relevant part: \"Every person who,\nunder color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or\nusage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia,\nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United\nStates or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the\ndeprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\nConstitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an\naction at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for\nredress . . . .\"\n     11\n      The Fourth Amendment provides: \"The right of the people to\nbe secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against\nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\nWarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or\naffirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched,\nand the persons or things to be seized.\"\n\n                                    -17-\n\ffurther argue that even if the record supports Burke's allegations\n\nthat he suffered a violation of a Fourth Amendment right, they are\n\nentitled to qualified immunity against suit for damages in their\n\nindividual capacities for any acts or omissions that caused such a\n\ndeprivation.      The doctrine of qualified immunity aims to\n\n            balance [the] desire to compensate those whose\n            rights are infringed by state actors with an\n            equally compelling desire to shield public\n            servants from undue interference with the\n            performance of their duties and from threats\n            of liability which, though unfounded, may\n            nevertheless be unbearably disruptive.\n\nBuenrostro v. Collazo, 973 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 1992).              Because\n\nexposure to civil rights suits may result in \"distraction of\n\nofficials    from     their   governmental      duties,    inhibition    of\n\ndiscretionary action, and deterrence of able people from public\n\nservice,\"   the    doctrine   of   qualified   immunity   protects    public\n\nofficials from liability under § 1983 so long as \"their conduct\n\ndoes not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional\n\nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"          Harlow v.\n\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 816, 818 (1982).            The doctrine thus\n\nprotects \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly\n\nviolate the law.\"       Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).\n\nBecause \"[q]ualified immunity serves not only as a defense to\n\nliability but also as 'an entitlement not to stand trial or face\n\nthe other burdens of litigation,'\" Cox v. Hainey, 391 F.3d 25, 29\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Mitchell v.

Condon, 372 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).12    \"Under ordinary circumstances, the development of the\n\ndoctrine of qualified immunity is best served by approaching these\n\ninquiries\" in sequence.

See also Kirk v. Louisiana,\n\n536 U.S. 635, 638 (2002) (per curiam) (existence of probable cause\n\ndoes not obviate warrant requirement absent exigent circumstances).\n\nBurke argues that a reasonable jury could infer that no valid\n\nwarrant issued for his arrest.       The police defendants insist that\n\nthey have produced sufficient evidence to compel the inference that\n\na valid arrest warrant was issued.13\n\n\n     13\n      The police defendants do not argue that exigent circumstances\nexisted to arrest Burke without a warrant, or that Burke consented\nto the arresting officers' crossing \"the firm line at the entrance\nto the house drawn by the Fourth Amendment.\" Payton, 445 U.S. at\n590; see e.g., Robbins v. MacKenzie, 364 F.2d 45 (1st Cir. 1966)\n(describing actions sufficient to manifest consent to warrantless\nsearch of rooming house).      The record is also silent on the\nquestion of whether Burke was free to withhold permission for the\narresting officers to enter his house.

The Fourth\n\nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution requires at a minimum, however,\n\nthat     a     warrant     be    \"supported      by      Oath   or   affirmation.\"\n\nAdditionally, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, § 22 (1998) requires that an\n\narrest warrant be issued \"in compliance with the provisions of the\n\nMassachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure,\" which in turn require\n\nan arrest warrant to be \"signed by the official issuing it,\" Mass.\n\nR.

Nov. 21, 2001).14\n\n          In lieu of a signed arrest warrant accompanied by an\n\naffidavit describing the facts allegedly establishing probable\n\ncause, the police defendants point to other evidence that a valid\n\nwarrant was issued by a neutral magistrate upon a finding of\n\nprobable cause prior to Burke's arrest.   Det. Dolan testified at\n\ndeposition that he prepared an application for an arrest warrant at\n\nthe request of the District Attorney, including a summary of the\n\nfacts establishing probable cause based on information provided by\n\nother investigating officers, and that he submitted the application\n\nto a magistrate.   At his deposition, Det. Dolan identified as the\n\ntext of his probable cause summary a six-paragraph excerpt from a\n\ncomputer printout containing numerous reports allegedly produced by\n\nWalpole officers during the murder investigation.    Det. Dolan also\n\nidentified a longer version of the summary of the evidence that he\n\n\n\n     14\n      Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, § 23A (1998) provides in relevant\npart that \"[w]henever a court is requested to issue a warrant,\" the\nclerk's office \"shall enter\" specified information about the\nindividual who is the subject of the warrant \"into a computer\nsystem to be known as the warrant management system. All warrants\nappearing in the warrant management system shall be accessible\nthrough the criminal justice information system, maintained by the\ncriminal history systems board, to law enforcement agencies and the\nregistry of motor vehicles.        The warrant shall consist of\nsufficient information electronically appearing in the warrant\nmanagement system, and a printout of the electronic warrant from\nthe criminal justice information system shall constitute a true\ncopy of the warrant.\"\n\n\n                               -22-\n\fdrafted, but which the District Attorney requested that he shorten\n\nfor submission with the warrant application.   Burke insists that a\n\njury could infer that the probable cause summaries in the computer\n\nprint-out were created only after Burke's arrest.\n\n          In addition to the unsigned copy of the arrest warrant\n\nand Det. Dolan's summary of facts establishing probable cause, the\n\npolice defendants have produced a copy of the application for a\n\ncriminal complaint signed by Det. Dolan, on which the box marked\n\n\"Warrant\" has been checked and initialed by a magistrate; a copy of\n\na summons and a complaint signed by the same magistrate, on each of\n\nwhich the box for entry of \"RETURN DATE AND TIME\" contains the word\n\n\"warrant\"; and a computer printout of Burke's criminal docket\n\n(stored in the Warrant Management System database and retrieved\n\nthrough the Criminal Justice Information System) showing a return\n\nof warrant at around 4:00 PM on December 10.    Finally, the police\n\ndefendants have produced a search warrant, obtained by Trooper\n\nJennings, dated December 10 and signed by the same magistrate judge\n\nwho signed and initialed the criminal complaint.            The search\n\nwarrant is accompanied by a six-page affidavit including a much\n\nmore detailed summary of the facts allegedly establishing probable\n\ncause than the summary Det. Dolan testified that he provided in\n\nsupport of the arrest warrant.\n\n          We   conclude   that    the   defendants   have     produced\n\nsubstantial, though imperfect, evidence that a valid arrest warrant\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fissued upon a neutral magistrate's review of facts allegedly\n\nestablishing probable cause.          By contrast, Burke has adduced no\n\nevidence demonstrating that no warrant was issued apart from his\n\nown affidavit stating that he never saw a warrant.                  There is no\n\nrequirement, either under the Constitution or under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, that a copy of the arrest warrant automatically be given to\n\nthe person arrested at the time of the arrest.                   Burke's sworn\n\nstatement,        standing   alone   in   the    face   of    the   defendants'\n\nsubmissions, cannot bear the evidentiary weight Burke seeks to give\n\nit.   Because there is no genuine dispute regarding the question\n\nwhether a valid arrest warrant was issued, the record fails to\n\nsupport   Burke's       allegation    that      he   was     deprived   of   his\n\nconstitutional right to be arrested at home only upon issuance of\n\na warrant.\n\n             2.       Existence of Probable Cause\n\n             While we must \"pay substantial deference to judicial\n\ndeterminations of probable cause\" made by a magistrate issuing a\n\nwarrant, we \"must still insist that the magistrate . . . not serve\n\nmerely as a rubber stamp for the police.\"               Aguilar v. Texas, 378\n\nU.S. 108, 111 (1964), abrogated on other grounds by Illinois v.\n\nGates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983).          Burke argues that even if a neutral\n\nmagistrate issued a warrant for his arrest, he was nevertheless\n\nsubjected to deprivation of his Fourth Amendment right because the\n\n\"totality of the circumstances,\" Gates 462 U.S. at 238, as set\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fforth in the warrant application, was insufficient to establish\n\nprobable cause for his arrest.          See, e.g., United States v. Zayas-\n\nDiaz, 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"The issuing magistrate\n\nordinarily    considers    only   the    facts   set   forth   in   supporting\n\naffidavits accompanying [a search] warrant application.\").15\n\n            \"Probable     cause   determinations        are,   virtually   by\n\ndefinition, preliminary and tentative.\"                Acosta v. Ames Dep't\n\nStores, Inc., 386 F.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir. 2004).            The exact degree of\n\ncertainty required to establish probable cause is difficult to\n\nquantify; it falls somewhere between \"'bare suspicion' [and] what\n\nwould be needed to 'justify . . . conviction.'\"            Valente, 332 F.3d\n\nat 32 (quoting Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175\n\n(1949)).    As always, \"[t]he touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is\n\nreasonableness.\"     Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, 250 (1991).\n\nProbable cause thus exists if \"the facts and circumstances within\n\nthe relevant actors' knowledge and of which they had reasonably\n\nreliable information\" would suffice to \"warrant a prudent person in\n\nbelieving\" that a person has committed or is about to commit a\n\ncrime.

A State Police K-9\n          unit conducted a track from the victim. The\n          K-9 [led] directly to Edmund Burke's front\n          door [at his street address].\n                 Edmund was interviewed and he said that\n          he had been sleeping all morning[.]        Our\n          investigation    revealed    two   independent\n          witnesses who saw him outside of his house in\n          his yard on the morning of the murder. They\n          also described the clothing he was wearing.\n          He has denied owning clothing of this type.\n                 Edmund has changed his story several\n          times during the course of this investigation\n          to try and explain his actions. They are all\n          inconsistent.\n                 Preliminary autopsy reports indicated\n          that Irene Kennedy had been bitten on her\n          breasts.    These bites appear to be human.\n          They were examined by Forensic Dentist Kate\n          Crowley of the Medical Examiners Office and\n          compared to impressions of Edmund Burke's\n          teeth.\n                 She requested that Dr. [Lowell] Levine\n          examine them also. He is the leading expert\n          in the country and has testified as such[.]\n          He is a Forensic Dentist with over thirty\n          years of experience. He determined that the\n          marks were bite marks made by human teeth. He\n          has also determined with reasonable scientific\n          certainty that [they] were made by Edmund\n          Burke.\n                 Based on the above facts, there is\n          probable cause to believe that Edmund Burke\n          entered Bird Park on the morning of 12-1-98\n          and brutally murdered Irene Kennedy. I am\n          requesting a warrant for his arrest for\n          murder.\n\nWhile Burke disputes the accuracy and reliability of all of the\n\npurported facts described in Det. Dolan's summary, he assails in\n\nparticular the inclusion of an inaccurate inculpatory bite mark\n\n                               -26-\n\fopinion.        Bite mark evidence, Burke argues, is so unreliable that\n\nit could not reasonably support probable cause.\n\n                The existence of probable cause is based on the facts and\n\ncircumstances known at the time of arrest rather than in hindsight.\n\nRoche, 81 F.3d at 254.               Moreover, forensic evidence relied upon by\n\nthe police to establish probable cause to arrest need not be\n\nunassailably       accurate.             \"[O]ne      who   asserts    the     existence    of\n\nprobable cause is not a guarantor either of the accuracy of the\n\ninformation upon which he has reasonably relied or of the ultimate\n\nconclusion that he reasonably drew therefrom.\"                        Id. at 255.     Burke\n\npoints to the affidavit of his own proposed trial expert, Dr.\n\nRichard R. Souviron, in which he states that \"[b]ite mark evidence,\n\nif   it    is    the       only    evidence     of     identity,     cannot    be   used   to\n\npositively identify a possible perpetrator to the exclusion of all\n\nothers     within          a    significant     population.\"16         This    categorical\n\nstatement about the limited probative value of bite mark evidence\n\nto   inculpate         a       suspect   does   not    establish     that     Dr.   Levine's\n\nspecific bite mark comparison in this case failed to support\n\nprobable cause when considered in light of the other available\n\nevidence.       In many types of forensic analysis, an \"examiner can do\n\n\n      16\n      The magistrate judge found Dr. Souviron's affidavit to be\nuntimely filed after the deadline for disclosure of proposed expert\ntestimony. See Burke, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24895 at *9 n.133.\nThe magistrate judge nevertheless considered the affidavit for\npurposes of addressing Burke's claim that Dr. Levine intentionally\nfabricated or recklessly exaggerated his bite mark opinion. We\ndiscuss that claim below in Part IV.B.1.\n\n                                                -27-\n\fno more than speak of probabilities.\"          Valente, 332 F.3d at 33\n\n(handwriting comparison, \"a less rigorous means of identification\"\n\nthan fingerprint analysis, may be used to support probable cause);\n\nsee also Roche, 81 F.2d at 255 (inculpatory voice identification\n\nmay support probable cause).           The bite mark evidence was an\n\nappropriate factor to be weighed in the probable cause calculus,\n\nand the \"totality of the circumstances,\" Gates, 462 U.S. at 238, as\n\nstated in Det. Dolan's summary in support of the arrest warrant\n\napplication, sufficiently established probable cause.\n\n          3.      Misleading Warrant Application Submitted with\n                  Intentional or Reckless Disregard for the Truth\n\n          Burke alleges that even if a valid arrest warrant was\n\nissued on the basis of an application that set forth sufficient\n\nfacts and circumstances to establish probable cause, the police\n\ndefendants nevertheless violated his Fourth Amendment right. Burke\n\nalleges that the police defendants, with intentional or reckless\n\ndisregard for the truth, included inculpatory bite mark evidence\n\nthat they knew or had reason to know was inaccurate in the warrant\n\napplication and excluded exculpatory DNA evidence that would have\n\neliminated   probable   cause   from   the   same   application,   thereby\n\nrequiring the magistrate to make his probable cause decision on the\n\nbasis of a tainted submission.\n\n          \"A Fourth Amendment violation may be established if a\n\n[plaintiff] can show that officers acted in reckless disregard,\n\nwith a 'high degree of awareness of [the] probable falsity'\" of\n\n                                  -28-\n\fstatements made in support of an arrest warrant.                        Forest v.\n\nPawtucket Police Dep't, 377 F.3d 52, 58 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation\n\nomitted), cert. denied, 2005 U.S. LEXIS 1507 (Feb. 22, 2005).\n\nSimilarly,    the   intentional   or    reckless    omission       of    material\n\nexculpatory facts from information presented to a magistrate may\n\nalso amount to a Fourth Amendment violation.               DeLoach v. Bevers,\n\n922 F.2d 618, 622 (10th Cir. 1990) (upholding verdict for plaintiff\n\nwhere jury could have inferred that defendant police detective\n\ndeliberately or recklessly excluded the exculpatory opinion of an\n\nimportant medical expert from the affidavit).              Reckless disregard\n\nfor the truth in the submission of a warrant application may be\n\nestablished where an officer \"in fact entertained serious doubts as\n\nto the truth of the allegations\" or where \"circumstances evinc[ed]\n\nobvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the allegations\" in the\n\napplication.    United States v. Ranney, 298 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the case of allegedly\n\nmaterial omissions, \"recklessness may be inferred where the omitted\n\ninformation was critical to the probable cause determination.\"\n\nGolino v. New Haven, 950 F.2d 864, 871 (2d Cir. 1991); see also\n\nWilson v. Russo, 212 F.3d 781, 783 (3d Cir. 2000) (\"omissions are\n\nmade   with   reckless   disregard     for   the   truth    when   an     officer\n\nrecklessly omits facts that any reasonable person would know that\n\na judge would want to know\" when deciding whether to issue a\n\nwarrant).\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f            Allegations of intentional or reckless misstatements or\n\nomissions    implicate    the   very     truthfulness,   not   just   the\n\nsufficiency, of a warrant application.        If such allegations prove\n\nto be true, a court owes no deference to a magistrate's decision to\n\nissue an arrest warrant because, \"where officers procuring a\n\nwarrant have deliberately misled the magistrate about relevant\n\ninformation, no magistrate will have made a prior probable cause\n\ndetermination\" based on the correct version of the material facts.\n\nVelardi v. Walsh, 40 F.3d 569, 574 n.1 (2d Cir. 1994).\n\n            The requirement that the contested facts included in or\n\nomitted from a warrant application be material to the probable\n\ncause determination to establish a Fourth Amendment violation\n\nderives from the standard announced for the suppression of evidence\n\nin Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).         There, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that a criminal defendant who establishes that a police\n\nofficer procured a search warrant by intentionally or recklessly\n\nmaking materially false statements in a supporting affidavit is\n\nentitled to the suppression of evidence so long as \"the remaining\n\ncontent [in the affidavit] is insufficient\" to support probable\n\ncause.   Id. at 156.     Appellate courts have consistently held that\n\nthe Franks standard for suppression of evidence informs the scope\n\nof qualified immunity in a civil damages suit against officers who\n\nallegedly procure a warrant based on an untruthful application.\n\nSee, e.g., Aponte Matos v. Toledo-Dávila, 135 F.3d 182, 185 (1st\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\fCir. 1998) (where allegedly false statement was necessary to\n\nestablish probable cause, defendant \"will not be protected by\n\nqualified immunity\" if plaintiffs prevail at trial on claim that\n\ndefendant lied in search warrant application); Olson v. Tyler, 771\n\nF.2d 277, 282 (7th Cir. 1985) (\"Where the judicial finding of\n\nprobable cause is based solely on information the officer knew to\n\nbe false or would have known was false had he not recklessly\n\ndisregarded the truth, not only does the arrest violate the fourth\n\namendment, but the officer will not be entitled to [qualified]\n\nimmunity.\").   As in the suppression context, \"[t]o determine . . .\n\nmateriality of the misstatements and omissions, we excise the\n\noffending inaccuracies and insert the facts recklessly omitted, and\n\nthen determine whether or not the 'corrected' warrant affidavit\n\nwould establish probable cause.\"   Wilson, 212 F.3d at 789.\n\n          a.      Inclusion of Inaccurate Bite Mark Evidence\n\n          Burke argues that the police defendants should have known\n\nthat Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion was inaccurate and unreliable,17\n\nand that they acted with reckless disregard for the truth by\n\nincluding that evidence in the arrest warrant application.18   As we\n\nhave discussed, bite mark evidence may be considered as a factor in\n\n\n\n     17\n      We discuss and reject Burke's independent claims that Drs.\nLevine and Crowley intentionally or recklessly fabricated\ninculpatory bite mark evidence below in Part IV.\n     18\n      The police defendants do not dispute that Dr. Levine's bite\nmark opinion was central to the existence of probable cause.\n\n                               -31-\n\fthe probable cause analysis. The summary filed by Det. Dolan along\n\nwith his application for an arrest warrant describes Dr. Levine as\n\n\"the leading expert in the country [who] has testified as such[.]\n\nHe is a Forensic Dentist with over thirty years of experience.\"\n\nWhile     Burke   assails    the   reliability   of   bite   mark   analysis\n\ngenerally, he does not dispute Dr. Levine's credentials or point to\n\nany evidence that the police had any reason to doubt Dr. Levine's\n\nopinion.      Burke   thus   fails   to   establish   that   \"circumstances\n\nevinc[ed] obvious reasons to doubt the veracity\" of the inculpatory\n\nbite mark evidence, and fails to preserve a genuine dispute on his\n\nclaim that inaccurate evidence was recklessly included in the\n\nwarrant application in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nRanney, 298 F.3d at 78 (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted).19\n\n\n     19\n      While Det. Dolan's probable cause summary relates that Dr.\nLevine found a match \"with reasonable scientific certainty\" with\nrespect to both bite marks, Dr. Levine maintains that he rendered\nhis opinion to this degree of certainty only with respect to the\nbite mark on the victim's left breast. See infra Part IV.B.1. The\naffidavit in support of a search warrant produced by Sgt. Shea and\nTrooper Jennings, upon which Det. Dolan relied in preparing his\narrest warrant application, also states that Dr. Levine rendered an\nopinion to a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty that both\nbite marks found on the body . . . were caused by Edmund Burke\"\n(emphasis added).    Sgt. Shea testified that he asked Trooper\nMcDonald to call Dr. Levine \"and get the exact wording\" of his bite\nmark opinion for inclusion in the search warrant affidavit.\nTrooper McDonald, in turn, testified at his deposition that Dr.\nLevine gave his opinion to a \"reasonable degree of scientific\ncertainty,\" but that Dr. Levine could have said \"[bite] mark or\nmarks, I don't know.\" Burke does not specifically allege on appeal\nthat Trooper McDonald intentionally or recklessly misrepresented\nDr. Levine's bite mark opinion, rendered with a \"reasonable degree\n\n                                     -32-\n\f          b.        Omission of Exculpatory DNA Analysis Results\n\n             Burke's most serious challenge to his arrest involves his\n\nclaim that crucial exculpatory DNA evidence was known to the police\n\nat the time of his arrest but omitted from Det. Dolan's statement\n\nof probable cause, thus precluding review by a neutral magistrate\n\nof all the facts material to the existence of probable cause.\n\nBurke argues that the inculpatory bite mark evidence could not\n\nrationally co-exist with the exculpatory DNA evidence in his case.\n\nGiven the greater certainty of the DNA analysis results, he argues,\n\nthe inclusion of those results in the warrant application would\n\nhave eliminated probable cause.       Moreover, Burke argues, because\n\nthe exculpatory DNA evidence was \"critical to the probable cause\n\ndetermination,\" Golino, 950 F.2d at 871, a reasonable jury could\n\ninfer that its omission from the warrant application submitted to\n\nthe magistrate was made with deliberate or reckless disregard for\n\nthe truth.\n\n          Maine     Crime   Lab   chemist   Calicchio's   uncontroverted\n\ndeposition testimony was that DNA analysis may exclude a person as\n\na source of DNA with virtual certainty: \"We like to say an\n\nexclusion is absolute.\"     In a report dated December 12, Calicchio\n\nmemorialized the DNA results she had communicated by telephone to\n\nTrooper McDonald:\n\n\n\nof scientific certainty,\" as referring to two bite marks rather\nthan one.\n\n                                   -33-\n\f               A mixture of male and female DNA profiles was\n               obtained from the breast swabbings (Items #1A\n               and 1B). The predominant DNA profile matches\n               the DNA profile of Irene Kennedy. The minor\n               component of the DNA profile does not match\n               the DNA profile of Edmund Burke.\n\nAccording to these results, Burke could not have been the source of\n\nthe bite mark on the victim's left breast unless he bit the victim\n\nwithout    leaving    his   own     DNA    behind       and   another    man   somehow\n\ndeposited his DNA in the bite mark without producing a bite mark of\n\nhis own.20      Based on the combination of forensic evidence available\n\nin this case, a reasonable jury assessing the \"totality of the\n\ncircumstances,\" Gates, 462 U.S. at 238, could find that the DNA\n\nevidence was \"so probative [it] would vitiate probable cause,\" and\n\nthat its omission reflected at least reckless disregard for the\n\ntruth.     DeLoach, 922 F.2d at 623.\n\n               Of course, for purposes of the probable cause analysis,\n\nthe exculpatory DNA evidence must also have been known to the\n\npolice at the time of the warrant application.                  See Roche, 81 F.3d\n\nat 254.        Burke alleges that at least one officer central to the\n\ninvestigation,       Trooper   McDonald,         knew    that   DNA     analysis   had\n\nconclusively excluded him as the source of the saliva in the bite\n\nmark and, consequently, as the murderer, as early as four hours\n\nprior     to    Burke's   arrest,    and    two     hours     before    any    warrant\n\napplications were prepared. Calicchio's contemporaneous notes show\n\n\n     20\n      Only the bite mark on the victim's left breast was swabbed\nfor DNA testing.\n\n                                          -34-\n\fthat Trooper McDonald called her at 11:00 AM on December 10 to find\n\nout the DNA analysis results.21           About two hours later, at 1:15 PM,\n\nTrooper McDonald communicated Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion, but\n\nnot   the   DNA   results,    to   Sgt.    Shea   and    Trooper   Jennings   for\n\ninclusion in an affidavit in support of a search warrant.                Trooper\n\nMcDonald testified at his deposition that he also communicated Dr.\n\nLevine's bite mark opinion to Det. Dolan at some point, and that\n\nDet. Dolan would have relied on the information in the search\n\nwarrant affidavit to prepare his arrest warrant application.\n\n            In contrast to Calicchio's account, Trooper McDonald\n\ntestified at deposition that he did not receive the DNA results\n\nuntil the    day   after     Burke's   arrest,     and    that   he   immediately\n\ncommunicated the exculpatory results, through Sgt. Shea, to the\n\nprosecutor during Burke's arraignment.            Calicchio's notes document\n\nonly one phone conversation on December 11 relating to the case,\n\nwith Massachusetts Crime Lab chemist Richard Iawicci, who called\n\n\n\n\n      21\n      Calicchio explained at deposition that she routinely\ndocuments business-related phone calls by writing down the date,\ntime, and general subject matter of incoming and outgoing calls.\nShe also testified that she knew the Kennedy murder case was a high\npriority, and that she would have contacted Trooper McDonald as\nsoon as the DNA results were available. Based on computer records\nprinted and dated during the DNA analysis, Calicchio testified that\nshe knew the exculpatory results as early as 9:00 AM on December\n10. Calicchio's notes also show that she spoke to Trooper McDonald\non December 9 to notify him that the samples contained sufficient\nDNA to test and that she would call him the next day with the\nresults.\n\n                                       -35-\n\fher at 11:15 AM, after the DNA results were disclosed during\n\nBurke's arraignment.\n\n                  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nBurke, the record supports the inference that exculpatory DNA\n\nanalysis that directly contradicted the inculpatory bite mark\n\nevidence was known to at least one officer centrally involved in\n\nthe investigation, and was intentionally or recklessly withheld\n\nfrom        the    officer     who     was      actually    preparing     the   warrant\n\napplication,         resulting       in   its    omission    from   the   application.\n\nAccordingly, for purposes of the summary judgment analysis, and in\n\nanswer to the first question of the qualified immunity inquiry,\n\nBurke has proffered evidence sufficient to support a finding that\n\nhe was arrested without probable cause in violation of his Fourth\n\nAmendment right.             See Limone, 372 F.3d at 44 (first question in\n\nqualified          immunity     analysis         is     \"whether    the    plaintiff's\n\nallegations,         if   true,      establish      a   constitutional    violation\").\n\nWhether any of the police defendants may be liable for damages\n\nresulting from this constitutional violation turns on the balance\n\nof the qualified immunity inquiry.22\n\n\n       22\n      Neither the magistrate judge nor the district court\ndesignated the grants of summary judgment to the police defendants\nas grants of qualified immunity based on Burke's failure to\nestablish a constitutional violation.       The magistrate judge\nrecommended, however, that even if Burke did establish such a\nviolation, Det. Dolan, Sgt. Shea, and Trooper McDonald should\nreceive qualified immunity on the ground that their conduct was\nobjectively reasonable under clearly established law. See Burke,\n2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24897, at *25 (Det. Dolan); Burke, 2003 U.S.\n\n                                             -36-\n\fB.          Clearly Established Law\n\n            The   second     prong   of     the   qualified   immunity    inquiry\n\n\"focus[es] on whether [an] officer had fair notice that [his]\n\nconduct was unlawful.\"         Brosseau v. Haugen, 125 S. Ct. 596, 599\n\n(2004).     Uniquely among the defendant police officers, Trooper\n\nMcDonald argues that he had no constitutional duty to disclose\n\nexculpatory evidence to anyone because he was neither an affiant\n\nfor the arrest warrant nor technically an arresting officer (merely\n\na searching officer).        Thus, we must ask \"whether the state of the\n\nlaw at    the    time   of   the   putative       violation   afforded   [Trooper\n\nMcDonald]       fair    warning      that     his     .   .    .   conduct    was\n\nunconstitutional.\"       Limone, 372 F.3d at 45.23\n\n            \"It has long been well established that . . . a material\n\nfabrication [in a warrant application] violates the Warrant Clause\n\nof the Fourth Amendment.\"          Aponte Matos, 135 F.3d at 185.         As the\n\n\nDist. LEXIS 24896, at *31, *41 (Sgt. Shea and Trooper McDonald).\nThe magistrate judge also determined that Det. Bausch was neither\nan affiant for the arrest warrant nor an arresting officer and\ntherefore bore no liability regardless of whether Burke established\na constitutional violation. Burke, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24897, at\n*31.   The statement of undisputed facts submitted by the MSP\ndefendants, including Sgt. Shea, who was admittedly an arresting\nofficer, lists Det. Bausch as the only other arresting officer.\nViewing the facts in the light most favorable to Burke, we consider\nDet. Bausch to be one of the officers who arrested Burke and reach\nhis qualified immunity defense.\n     23\n      The other police defendants raise no argument about the\nabsence of clearly established law. Instead, they focus on the\nthird prong of the qualified immunity analysis, asserting that\nthere was nothing unreasonable about their conduct. We address\nthis argument in Part III.C.\n\n                                       -37-\n\fSupreme Court explained in Franks, \"[when] the Fourth Amendment\n\ndemands a factual showing sufficient to comprise 'probable cause,'\n\nthe obvious assumption is that there will be a truthful showing.\"\n\n438 U.S. at 164-65 (quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis\n\nin   original).   In   the   absence    of   such   a   requirement,   the\n\ninterposition of an objective magistrate into the arrest process\n\nwould serve little purpose. This court has also applied the Franks\n\nstandard to material omissions from a warrant application, which\n\nare likewise prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. See United States\n\nv. Rumney, 867 F.2d 714, 720 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n           Because Franks involved allegations that an affidavit in\n\nsupport of a search warrant contained false statements by the\n\naffiant, the Court's ruling requiring suppression of evidence\n\nprocured through a misleading warrant application spoke in terms of\n\nimpeachment only \"of the affiant, not of any nongovernmental\n\ninformant.\"   438 U.S. at 171.   The Supreme Court later clarified,\n\nhowever, that courts deciding motions to suppress evidence despite\n\nthe issuance of a valid warrant must \"consider the objective\n\nreasonableness, not only of the officers who eventually executed a\n\nwarrant, but also of the officers who originally obtained it or who\n\nprovided information material to the probable-cause determination.\"\n\nUnited States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 923 n. 24 (1984).         Just as a\n\npolice officer who seeks an arrest warrant despite the lack of\n\nprobable cause may not \"excuse his own default by pointing to the\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\fgreater incompetence of [a] magistrate\" who erroneously issues a\n\nwarrant, Malley, 475 U.S. at 346 n.9, a police defendant who acts\n\nintentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth may not\n\ninsulate himself from liability through the objectively reasonable\n\nconduct of other officers.       See Leon, 468 U.S. at          923 n.24\n\n(\"Nothing in our opinion suggests, for example, that an officer\n\ncould obtain a warrant\" based on an insufficient affidavit \"and\n\nthen rely on colleagues who are ignorant of the circumstances under\n\nwhich the warrant was obtained to conduct the search.\").\n\n          Thus,   Trooper   McDonald's   argument   that   he    had   no\n\nconstitutional duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to anyone\n\nprior to Burke's arrest because he was neither an affiant for the\n\narrest warrant nor technically an arresting officer is unavailing.\n\nHowever Trooper McDonald chooses to characterize or minimize his\n\nrole, the summary judgment record establishes that he was centrally\n\ninvolved in the collection of evidence to be used to secure an\n\narrest warrant for Burke.24    At the time of Burke's arrest, his\n\n\n     24\n      Significantly, the record shows that Walpole officers were\nnot involved in the collection or analysis of forensic evidence\nduring the murder investigation. At the same time, Sgt. Shea of\nthe Massachusetts State Police testified at deposition that the\nexisting practice was to have a local officer apply for the arrest\nwarrant: \"[W]henever we . . . arrest somebody for murder, the local\n[police department] does the arrest warrant. It is common.\" Under\nthese circumstances, on Trooper McDonald's theory, any MSP Trooper\n-- as the only possible source of forensic evidence in support of\na local officer's application for an arrest warrant -- could easily\nfabricate forensic evidence to procure a warrant in violation of a\nsuspect's Fourth Amendment rights while insulating himself against\ncivil suit in his personal capacity for damages.\n\n                                -39-\n\fconstitutional right to be free from arrest pursuant to a warrant\n\nthat would not have issued if material exculpatory evidence had\n\nbeen provided to the magistrate was clearly established, as was\n\nTrooper   McDonald's        concomitant          constitutional       duty   of   full\n\ndisclosure of exculpatory information to fellow officers seeking\n\nwarrants based on probable cause.\n\nC.           The Police Defendants' Allegedly Unconstitutional Conduct\n\n             The    third   prong    of     the    qualified    immunity     analysis\n\n\"channels the analysis from abstract principles to the specific\n\nfacts of a given case.\"             Cox, 391 F.3d at 31.              Because \"[t]he\n\nconcern of the immunity inquiry is to acknowledge that reasonable\n\nmistakes can be made as to the legal constraints on particular\n\npolice conduct,\" Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 205 (2001), even\n\nwhere a plaintiff has shown, for purposes of withstanding summary\n\njudgment, that a government official may have deprived him of a\n\nclearly   established       constitutional           right,    qualified     immunity\n\nremains available to defendants who demonstrate that they acted\n\nobjectively reasonably in applying clearly established law to the\n\nspecific facts they faced.               Having determined for the purpose of\n\nthe qualified immunity analysis that Burke was arrested pursuant to\n\na warrant issued because of reckless or intentional omissions of\n\nmaterial facts from the warrant application (the constitutional\n\nviolation),        we   proceed     to     analyze    each     police    defendant's\n\nindividual     conduct      in    this     case,     focusing    on     whether   each\n\n\n                                          -40-\n\f\"officer's mistake as to what the law requires [was] reasonable.\"\n\nId.\n\n           a.      Det. Dolan, Det. Bausch, and Sgt. Shea\n\n           The record fails to support any reasonable inference that\n\nDet. Dolan, who obtained the arrest warrant, or Sgt. Shea and Det.\n\nBausch, the arresting officers, had any knowledge of or reason to\n\nknow about the exculpatory DNA results prior to Burke's arrest.\n\nNor did they have any reason to doubt the reliability of Dr.\n\nLevine's bite mark opinion.\n\n           It is objectively reasonable for officers to seek an\n\narrest warrant \"so long as the presence of probable cause is at\n\nleast arguable.\"        Prokey v. Watkins, 942 F.2d 67, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).   Because the facts known to Det. Dolan, as set forth in his\n\nsummary of probable cause, formed a plausible basis for seeking an\n\narrest warrant, he is entitled to qualified immunity.              Similarly,\n\n\"[w]hen officers make an arrest subject to a warrant . . . even if\n\nprobable   cause   is    lacking,   [they]   are   entitled   to    qualified\n\nimmunity unless the warrant application is so lacking in indicia of\n\nprobable cause as to render official belief in its existence\n\nunreasonable.\"     Abreu-Guzman v. Ford, 241 F.3d 69, 73 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).           Both Det. Bausch and\n\nSgt. Shea reasonably relied on the existence of an apparently valid\n\nwarrant and are therefore entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -41-\n\f          b.     Trooper McDonald\n\n          When viewed in Burke's favor, the facts in the record\n\nreveal that Trooper McDonald knew the DNA analysis had excluded\n\nBurke as a suspect on the morning of December 10, but failed to\n\ncommunicate that information to the officers preparing applications\n\nfor search and arrest warrants despite his awareness of their\n\nongoing preparation and ample opportunity to communicate the newly\n\nacquired information.     Trooper McDonald's deposition testimony\n\nreveals that he relayed Dr. Levine's inculpatory bite mark opinion\n\nto Trooper Jennings and Sgt. Shea for inclusion in their affidavit\n\nin support of a search warrant about two hours after he received\n\nthe DNA results from Calicchio, and that he was aware that Det.\n\nDolan would rely on the information in the search warrant affidavit\n\nto prepare an arrest warrant application.25\n\n          While Trooper McDonald testified at his deposition that\n\nhe received the DNA results on the day after Burke's arrest, he\n\nalso testified that he knew their exculpatory significance and that\n\nhe immediately communicated the results, through Sgt. Shea, to the\n\nprosecution.   At his deposition, Trooper McDonald responded to\n\nquestioning as follows:\n\n\n\n\n     25\n      Trooper McDonald also testified at deposition that he\ncommunicated Dr. Levine's inculpatory bite mark opinion to Det.\nDolan at some point during the investigation, but he could not\nrecall whether this occurred before or after Det. Dolan applied for\nthe arrest warrant.\n\n                               -42-\n\f             A. I spoke with       the     Maine    state    police\n             directly, the lab.\n\n             Q. And they told you they excluded [Burke]?\n\n             A. Excluded.   The profile doesn't match.\n\n             [. . . ]\n\n             Q. And it's your testimony you communicated\n             that immediately to [the prosecution]?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\nTrooper McDonald also testified that when he found out the results\n\nof the DNA analysis, he called Dr. Levine to ask whether he still\n\nstood by his bite mark opinion in light of the conflicting DNA\n\nresults.26    The record thus shows that Trooper McDonald \"correctly\n\nperceive[d] all of the relevant facts,\" Saucier, 533 U.S. at 195,\n\nincluding the DNA results and their exculpatory significance.\n\n             Given the clearly established prohibition on material\n\nomissions by officers central to an investigation from an arrest\n\nwarrant application, and given Trooper McDonald's knowledge of the\n\ncrucial    facts,   we   cannot   say,    as   a   matter   of    law,    that   a\n\nreasonable,     similarly   situated      officer    would       feel    free    to\n\ncommunicate only inculpatory bite mark evidence to fellow officers\n\nseeking warrants on probable cause while withholding his knowledge\n\nof   directly   contradictory     DNA    results.     Accordingly,        Trooper\n\n\n\n\n      26\n      Dr. Levine testified that he received a call from Trooper\nMcDonald about the DNA analysis a day or so after rendering his\nbite mark opinion on December 10.\n\n                                    -43-\n\fMcDonald was not entitled to a favorable summary judgment ruling on\n\nhis qualified immunity defense.\n\n            IV. CLAIMS AGAINST THE FORENSIC ODONTOLOGISTS\n\nA.          Under Color of State Law\n\n            Dr. Levine argues that he is entitled to summary judgment\n\nbecause he was not acting \"under color of state law\" within the\n\nmeaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in his capacity as an independent\n\nconsultant to the District Attorney's office or, alternatively,\n\nthat if he was acting under color of state law, he is nevertheless\n\nentitled to immunity from suit. Private citizens may be liable for\n\nacts and omissions committed \"under color of state law\" where they\n\nare    \"jointly   engaged   with   state     officials    in   the    prohibited\n\naction.\"    Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 941 (1982)\n\n(citation omitted).     \"A private party's conduct is attributable to\n\nthe state if the state has so far insinuated itself into a position\n\nof    interdependence   with   [the    private   party]    that      it   must   be\n\nrecognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity.\"\n\nCamilo-Robles v. Hoyos, 151 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted, alteration in original).\n\n            Dr. Levine rendered a bite mark opinion only because the\n\nNorfolk District Attorney's Office, at the recommendation of the\n\nstate's own forensic odontologist, sought his assistance with the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -44-\n\fanalysis of forensic evidence in a criminal investigation.27       As a\n\nresult, Dr. Levine is \"both subject to suit under section 1983 and\n\neligible for   the   balm   of   qualified   immunity.\"   Id. (private\n\npsychiatrists under contract with the police department to evaluate\n\nofficers' mental health are state actors and entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity); see also Rodriques v. Furtado, 950 F.2d 805, 815 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (private physician from whom police requested assistance\n\nin conducting a body cavity search pursuant to a search warrant\n\nentitled to qualified immunity).          We turn, then, to the initial\n\nquestion in the qualified immunity analysis, whether \"all the\n\nuncontested facts and any contested facts looked at in [Burke's]\n\nfavor\" allege a constitutional violation.        Riverdale Mills Corp.,\n\n392 F.3d at 62.\n\nB.        Deprivation of a Constitutional Right\n\n          Burke alleges that Dr. Levine and Dr. Crowley each\n\ndeprived him of his independent constitutional right to be free\n\nfrom arrest on the basis of knowingly or recklessly exaggerated\n\ninculpatory bite mark evidence.       While the police defendants may\n\nhave had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the bite mark evidence\n\nincluded in the arrest warrant application, Burke asserts that both\n\nDr. Levine and Dr. Crowley had ample reason to doubt the validity\n\n\n\n\n     27\n      Dr. Crowley does not dispute that she acted under color of\nstate law.\n\n                                   -45-\n\fof    their   own       bite    mark    analyses      for    use   in    determining      the\n\nexistence of probable cause.28\n\n              The intentional or reckless fabrication of inculpatory\n\nevidence or omission of material exculpatory evidence by a forensic\n\nexaminer      in        support    of     probable       cause     may     amount    to     a\n\nconstitutional violation.               See Galbraith v. Cty. of Santa Clara,\n\n307 F.3d 1119, 1126 (9th Cir. 2002) (\"[A] coroner's reckless or\n\nintentional        falsification         of    an    autopsy     report    that   plays     a\n\nmaterial role in the false arrest and prosecution of an individual\n\ncan    support      a    claim    under       42    U.S.C.   §   1983    and   the   Fourth\n\nAmendment.\"); Pierce v. Gilchrist, 359 F.3d 1279, 1296 (10th Cir.\n\n2004) (plaintiff alleging post-arrest fabrication of hair sample\n\nopinion       states        a     claim        against       forensic      chemist        for\n\nunconstitutional prosecution, of which one element is lack of\n\nprobable cause).           We thus inquire whether the facts in the record,\n\nwhen viewed in the light most favorable to Burke, permit the\n\ninference that either Dr. Levine or Dr. Crowley rendered a bite\n\nmark opinion with deliberate falsity or reckless disregard for the\n\ntruth.\n\n              To support his allegations, Burke must show that Dr.\n\nLevine or Dr. Crowley \"in fact entertained serious doubts as to the\n\n\n\n       28\n      The record reveals no evidence that either Dr. Levine or Dr.\nCrowley knew the exculpatory DNA analysis results prior to Burke's\narrest; accordingly, we exclude the DNA results from our analysis\nof Burke's claims against them.\n\n                                              -46-\n\ftruth\" of their bite mark opinions or that \"circumstances evinc[ed]\n\nobvious reasons to doubt the veracity\" of those results.             Ranney,\n\n298 F.3d at 78 (internal quotation marks omitted).             To constitute\n\na   Fourth    Amendment     violation,      the   allegedly   fabricated   or\n\nexaggerated evidence must also be material to the probable cause\n\ndetermination.      See, e.g., Pierce, 359 F.3d at 1287-88 (on motion\n\nto dismiss claim of unconstitutional prosecution, \"we cannot say\n\nthat the false information supplied by [forensic chemist] and the\n\naccurate exculpatory information disregarded by [her] were not\n\nsignificant       enough   to   prejudice    [plaintiff's]    constitutional\n\nrights\"); Aponte Matos, 135 F.3d at 185 (police officer's \"material\n\nfabrication [in a warrant application] violates the Warrant Clause\n\nof the Fourth Amendment.\").\n\n             1.      Dr. Levine\n\n             Burke alleges that Dr. Levine acted with deliberate or\n\nreckless disregard for the truth by overstating the degree of\n\ncertainty with which the mold of Burke's teeth matched the bite\n\nmark on the victim's left breast.29          Burke attempts to demonstrate\n\nthat Dr. Levine was at least reckless by (1) referring to Dr.\n\n\n\n     29\n      While Trooper McDonald testified at his deposition that he\nbelieved Dr. Levine had rendered an opinion that both bite marks\nmatched Burke's teeth to a \"reasonable degree of scientific\ncertainty,\" see supra note 19, Burke does not ground his argument\non Dr. Levine's communication of an opinion on both bite marks to\na \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty,\" focusing instead on\nDr. Levine's opinion regarding the bite mark on the victim's left\nbreast.\n\n                                     -47-\n\fLevine's own statements made during the instant litigation, (2)\n\nassailing the terminology with which Dr. Levine rendered his\n\nopinion before Burke's arrest, and (3) referring to the statements\n\nof Burke's own expert witness regarding the process of bite mark\n\nanalysis.\n\n              Burke points to Dr. Levine's affidavit, filed on March\n\n16, 2000 in support of a motion to dismiss Burke's claims against\n\nhim for lack of personal jurisdiction (based on Dr. Levine's New\n\nYork residence and alleged lack of contacts with Massachusetts).\n\nIn   his    affidavit,     Dr.    Levine     stated    that    he    told     police\n\ninvestigators on December 10, 1998 that he \"could not rule out Mr.\n\nBurke\" as a source of the bite marks.           At their depositions, Chief\n\nBetro   and    Trooper     McDonald   indicated       that    they       viewed   this\n\naffidavit as effectively disavowing the opinion that Dr. Levine had\n\nrendered      for   them   with   a   \"reasonable      degree       of    scientific\n\ncertainty\" prior to Burke's arrest.\n\n              On July 7, 2000, Dr. Levine supplemented his affidavit of\n\nMarch 16, 2000 to clarify that on December 10, 1998, \"I could not\n\nrule out Mr. Burke as a suspect.             Both of the two bite marks on\n\n[the victim's] body were consistent with his dentition. One of the\n\nbite marks was consistent with his dentition to a high level of\n\nprobability, or a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\"                      Dr.\n\nLevine thus does not deny that he rendered his opinion on December\n\n10, 1998 about the bite mark on the victim's left breast with a\n\n\n                                      -48-\n\f\"reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\"          At the same time,\n\nthere is a significant difference between opining to a \"reasonable\n\ndegree of scientific certainty\" that Burke's teeth matched one of\n\nthe bite marks and simply opining that \"I could not rule out Mr.\n\nBurke as a suspect,\" both of which statements are included in Dr.\n\nLevine's July 7, 2000 affidavit.          Dr. Levine maintains that the\n\nopinion he communicated to police on December 10, 1998 to a\n\n\"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" before Burke's arrest\n\nwas   and    remains   accurate.    At    his   deposition,   Dr.   Levine\n\ndemonstrated his bite mark analysis methodology by comparing the\n\nmold of Burke's teeth with the enlarged photographs and testified\n\nthat he adhered to his original opinion that Burke's teeth matched\n\nthe bite mark on the victim's left breast to a reasonable degree of\n\nscientific certainty.\n\n             Still, Burke asserts that Dr. Levine used the phrase\n\n\"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" when, as revealed by\n\nthe clarifying affidavit of July 7, 2000, he in fact meant a \"high\n\nlevel of probability.\"      Burke argues that Dr. Levine's misuse of\n\nterminology exhibited reckless disregard for his obligation to\n\ncommunicate his actual level of certainty about the bite mark\n\nmatch.      \"'Reasonable degree of scientific certainty' is a plastic\n\nphrase.\"     Buie v. McAdory, 341 F.3d 623, 625 (7th Cir. 2003).     That\n\nfact is evident from Dr. Levine's attempts to explain the meaning\n\nhe assigns to the term.      At his deposition, Dr. Levine testified\n\n\n                                   -49-\n\fthat he uses \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" to mean\n\n\"high degree of probability,\" a higher standard than \"could not\n\nrule    out    as    a       suspect.\"        Dr.    Levine's         explanation    of   his\n\nterminology comports with the non-binding \"Bite-Mark Terminology\n\nGuidelines\"         of       the   American    Board      of    Forensic      Odontologists\n\n(\"ABFO\"), of which Dr. Levine is a founding diplomate and member,\n\nwhich equate the related terms \"reasonable medical certainty\" and\n\n\"high degree of certainty.\"                   As Burke points out, however, the\n\nguidelines further define both terms to mean \"virtual certainty; no\n\nreasonable or practical possibility that someone else did it.\"30\n\nBy using the term \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty,\"\n\nBurke reasons, Dr. Levine communicated a higher degree of certainty\n\n(\"virtual       certainty,\"          according       to    a        passage   in   the    ABFO\n\nguidelines) than he actually felt (only that he \"could not rule out\n\nMr.    Burke    as       a    suspect,\"   according            to    his   March   16,    2000\n\n\n       30\n      The \"Bite-Mark Terminology Guidelines,\" adopted by the\nAmerican Board of Forensic Odontologists in 1995, thus conflate\nseveral arguably distinct levels of certainty (\"reasonable medical\ncertainty,\" \"high degree of certainty,\" and \"virtual certainty\")\ninto the same high standard.     The guidelines further describe\n\"reasonable medical certainty\" as\n\n               convey[ing]   the  connotation  of   virtual\n               certainty or beyond reasonable doubt.    The\n               term deliberately avoids the message of\n               unconditional certainty only in deference to\n               the scientific maxim that one can never be\n               absolutely positive unless everyone in the\n               world was examined or the expert was an eye\n               witness.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n                                              -50-\n\faffidavit).   At his deposition, Dr. Levine \"clarified\" that while\n\nhe uses \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" and \"high\n\ndegree of probability\" interchangeably, his left breast bite mark\n\nopinion   never    met   the   high   standard   of   the   ABFO   guidelines'\n\ndefinition of \"reasonable medical certainty\" -- namely, that there\n\nwas \"no reasonable or practical possibility that someone else\"\n\nother than Burke made the bite mark on the victim's left breast.\n\n           We need not determine whether Dr. Levine's terminology or\n\nthe terminology recommended by the ABFO guidelines is correct.\n\nNeither the ABFO guidelines' definition nor Dr. Levine's alternate\n\nterm, \"high degree of probability,\" appears in Det. Dolan's summary\n\nof probable cause in the arrest warrant application.               The summary\n\nmerely    states   that    Dr.   Levine      \"determined    with    reasonable\n\nscientific certainty that [the bite marks] were made by Edmund\n\nBurke.\"   In the absence of any indication to the contrary, we must\n\nassume that the magistrate who issued the arrest warrant assigned\n\nno more than the commonly accepted meaning among lawyers and judges\n\nto the term \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" -- \"a\n\nstandard requiring a showing that the injury was more likely than\n\nnot caused by a particular stimulus, based on the general consensus\n\nof recognized [scientific] thought.\"           Black's Law Dictionary 1294\n\n(8th ed. 2004) (defining \"reasonable medical probability,\" or\n\n\"reasonable medical certainty,\" as used in tort actions).                 That\n\nstandard, of course, is fully consistent with the probable cause\n\n\n                                      -51-\n\fstandard.     See   Roche,   81   F.3d    at   254   (\"By   definition,   the\n\ndetermination [of probable cause] does not require scientific\n\ncertainty.\").\n\n            Finally, Burke relies on the affidavit of his own chosen\n\nexpert, Dr. Souviron, which states that bite mark evidence alone\n\ncannot be used to \"positively identify a possible perpetrator to\n\nthe exclusion of all others within a significant population.\"31 The\n\nrecord does not support the inference that Dr. Levine communicated,\n\nor risked communicating, that Burke was the source of the bite mark\n\n\"to the exclusion of all others within a significant population.\"\n\nRather, he opined that Burke's teeth matched the bite mark to a\n\n\"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" without specifying the\n\nnumber of individuals who could have made the same bite mark.             Dr.\n\nSouviron was unable to render his own independent opinion comparing\n\nthe mold of Burke's teeth to the photographs of the bite mark\n\nbecause, he explained, \"[b]ased on my knowledge and expertise, I\n\nconcluded that the photographs I was provided with were not the\n\nphotographs that were used originally to make the evaluation of\n\nthis case. . . .    I would need the particular photographs in order\n\nto be able to perform any in-depth identification.\"            Burke points\n\n\n\n     31\n      As we have noted, the magistrate judge considered the\naffidavit to be untimely filed after the deadline for disclosure of\nproposed expert testimony.     Nevertheless, the magistrate judge\nconsidered the affidavit and found that it did not establish that\nDr. Levine recklessly or deliberately rendered a false bite mark\nopinion. See Burke, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24895 at *9 n.133.\n\n                                   -52-\n\fout that copies of the enlarged photographs were not made available\n\nto him during discovery through no fault of his own.              But even a\n\ncontrary expert opinion from Dr. Souviron based on the exact same\n\nmaterials used by Dr. Levine would not necessarily shed any light\n\non how Dr. Levine performed his own analysis and arrived at his own\n\nconclusions at the time he rendered his bite mark opinion.\n\n          Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nBurke, we conclude that the record reveals no support for an\n\ninference that Dr. Levine's methodology or judgment were so clearly\n\nflawed that he should have harbored serious doubts about the\n\nreliability of his resulting opinion.         Because Burke has failed to\n\ngenerate a genuine dispute on the threshold question of whether Dr.\n\nLevine violated his Fourth Amendment rights by rendering his bite\n\nmark opinion with deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth,\n\nDr. Levine is entitled to summary judgment on the ground of\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n          2.       Dr. Crowley\n\n          Burke    alleges     that    Dr.   Crowley   also    intentionally\n\nfabricated or recklessly exaggerated an inculpatory bite mark\n\nopinion in     support   of   probable   cause.    Burke      highlights   Dr.\n\nCrowley's deposition testimony that although she was professionally\n\ninterested in the field of bite mark analysis and regarded Dr.\n\nLevine as a mentor, she was trained only as a dentist and had no\n\nexperience in bite mark analysis.            Rather, her experience as a\n\n\n                                      -53-\n\fforensic odontologist was limited to identifying human remains\n\nthrough comparison with dental records.     Burke maintains that any\n\nbite mark opinion Dr. Crowley rendered would have reflected at a\n\nminimum her reckless disregard for the truth because she knew she\n\nwas not qualified to perform such an analysis.\n\n          Dr. Crowley insists that she never formed a bite mark\n\nopinion in support of probable cause.    At deposition, Dr. Crowley\n\ntestified that while she examined the mold of Burke's teeth and the\n\nbite mark on the victim, she did not make any comparisons: \"I never\n\nconcluded that there was a match.   I made some observations.\"   She\n\nalso stated that she made transparencies and impressions of Burke's\n\nteeth and the bite mark, but that she used these materials only as\n\nlearning tools.   In short, Dr. Crowley testified that her role in\n\nthe investigation was limited to that of collecting and preserving\n\nthe bite mark evidence, including making the mold of Burke's teeth,\n\na task that dentists routinely perform.32\n\n          Burke counters that Dr. Crowley did render a bite mark\n\nopinion in support of probable cause.   He points to the deposition\n\ntestimony of Dr. Levine and Lt. Kenneth Martin, an investigator\n\nwith MSP Crime Scene Services, indicating that Dr. Crowley agreed\n\nwith Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion.    Dr. Levine testified that he\n\nwas surprised to find out that Dr. Crowley had no experience in\n\n\n\n     32\n      Burke does not dispute that Dr. Crowley competently made the\nmold of his teeth.\n\n                               -54-\n\fbite mark analysis, and that he had the impression that she shared\n\nhis initial opinion formed in Albany on December 6 as well as his\n\nobservations made at the Medical Examiner's Office in Boston on\n\nDecember 9.33     Lt. Martin testified at deposition that he believed\n\nDr. Crowley would be the primary person testifying about the bite\n\nmark evidence at a criminal trial and that Dr. Levine would be\n\nconsulted to give a second opinion.           He further stated that he knew\n\nDr.   Crowley    had   never   testified      at   a   trial   about   bite    mark\n\nanalysis, but that he had no reason to think she was not qualified\n\nto do so, given her examination of the actual bite mark and the\n\nunenhanced      photographs,34   his   understanding       that   \"she   had    had\n\nprevious training under Lowell Levine who is recognized as a\n\nforensic odontologist,\" and her job qualifications.\n\n           Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nBurke, the record fails to support Burke's allegation that Dr.\n\nCrowley actually communicated a bite mark opinion to the police\n\ninvestigators for use in Det. Dolan's arrest warrant application.\n\n\n\n      33\n      Trooper McDonald testified at his deposition that he shared\nDr. Levine's general impression that Dr. Crowley agreed with his\ninitial conclusions made in Albany on December 6.\n      34\n      Dr. Crowley maintains that she never saw the enhanced\nphotographs that Trooper McDonald and Sgt. Shea delivered to Dr.\nLevine in Albany late in the evening of December 9. Dr. Crowley\ndid not accompany the officers on this second trip to Albany, nor\nwas she present when Dr. Levine gave instructions to the photo lab\nin Boston on how to enlarge the photographs. However, Lt. Martin\nmentioned \"the digital enhancements\" of the photographs as being\namong the items he believed Dr. Crowley examined.\n\n                                       -55-\n\fNor does the record indicate that the police investigators sought\n\nor relied upon Dr. Crowley's opinion after Dr. Levine became\n\ninvolved in the investigation.\n\n            Even if we were required to take a different view of the\n\nevidence (and we are not), Dr. Crowley's communication of a bite\n\nmark    opinion,   without   more,     would   not   amount   to   reckless\n\nexaggeration, much less intentional fabrication, of bite mark\n\nevidence.    Dr. Crowley herself advised the District Attorney to\n\nhire Dr. Levine as an expert.        Given her knowledge of Dr. Levine's\n\ncredentials, as well as her own, albeit limited, knowledge of\n\nforensic odontology, no rational jury could find that an opinion\n\nfrom Dr. Crowley merely concurring in Dr. Levine's bite mark\n\nopinion would be based on such dubious premises that it would\n\nmanifest reckless disregard for the truth.\n\n            Because Burke has failed to establish a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact on the initial question of whether Dr. Crowley\n\ndeprived him of his Fourth Amendment right, Dr. Crowley is entitled\n\nto summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.\n\n                         V. DEFAMATION CLAIM\n\n            Burke alleges that Walpole Police Chief Betro defamed him\n\nby falsely and publicly attributing Kennedy's murder to him.35\n\n\n\n       35\n      Burke styles his defamation claim as being brought pursuant\nto § 1983. Discerning no federal right affected by Chief Betro's\npublic statements, we analyze Burke's claim under the Massachusetts\nlaw of defamation, as did the district court.\n\n                                     -56-\n\fAccording to the deposition testimony of a reporter for the Daily\n\nTranscript, a regional newspaper, Chief Betro made an appearance in\n\nhis official capacity at a public meeting organized by the East\n\nWalpole Civic Association on or about January 13, 1999, after the\n\nexculpatory DNA results became public and while Burke was awaiting\n\nrelease to house arrest. Approximately two dozen citizens, fearful\n\nthat the murderer was still at large, attended the meeting.                      The\n\nBoston Herald, relying on an article in the Daily Transcript,\n\nreported on January 25, 1999 that Chief Betro assured the audience,\n\n\"I can tell you we've got the right man.\"36\n\n            Chief Betro then advanced a theory to explain how Burke\n\ncould be the killer despite having been excluded as a source of the\n\nforeign   DNA    found   in   the    bite     mark   on   the   victim's   breast.\n\nAccording   to    the    Boston     Herald,    again      relying   on   the   Daily\n\nTranscript, \"[Chief] Betro . . . told the crowd that an orange\n\njuice container was found about 40 feet from Kennedy's body, and it\n\nwas possible Burke drank the orange juice and washed away any DNA\n\nsamples in his mouth.\"            The Boston Globe, which reported Chief\n\nBetro's remarks on January 22, 1999, stated, \"[i]n the highly\n\ncomplex world of DNA testing, the idea that the results could be\n\nmanipulated by juice is not reasonable, according to several\n\nscientists at laboratories who conduct the tests.\"                       The Globe\n\n\n\n     36\n      The Daily Transcript article written by the reporter who\nattended the meeting is not part of the record.\n\n                                       -57-\n\farticle went on to state that \"[t]he deputy laboratory director for\n\nCellmark Diagnostics in Maryland, perhaps the best known private\n\nDNA testing laboratory in the country, dismissed the possibility.\"\n\n            Chief Betro argues that his statements at the meeting of\n\nconcerned citizens are absolutely privileged and cannot form the\n\nbasis for a defamation suit because they were made during the\n\ncourse of a criminal investigation.            While \"statements made to\n\npolice or prosecutors prior to trial are absolutely privileged if\n\nthey are made in the context of a proposed judicial proceeding,\"\n\nCorrellas v. Viveiros, 572 N.E.2d 7, 11 (Mass. 1991), Chief Betro's\n\nstatements were made to members of a neighborhood association and\n\nwere unrelated to any \"proposed judicial proceeding,\" id.                   The\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") \"has recognized the\n\nexistence    of    an   absolute     privilege        in     relatively     few\n\ncircumstances.\" Mulgrew v. Taunton, 574 N.E.2d 389, 392 n.6 (Mass.\n\n1991).   Nevertheless, the court has recognized that \"[s]tatements\n\nmade by public officials while performing their official duties are\n\nconditionally     privileged.\"     Id.    at   392.        Chief   Betro   seeks\n\nrecognition of that privilege as well.          Under Massachusetts law,\n\nthe availability of such a qualified privilege turns on whether\n\nChief Betro had an official duty to discuss Burke at a meeting of\n\nconcerned citizens.\n\n            The Massachusetts SJC has not decided the question of\n\nwhether a police chief has an official duty to appear at a meeting\n\n\n                                   -58-\n\fof citizens who are concerned about a violent crime but who are\n\nthemselves uninvolved in the criminal investigation.                  While the\n\ncourt has extended a conditional privilege to statements made by a\n\npolice chief to a city council committee about a police officer's\n\nperformance history because \"[t]he public has an interest in having\n\na police force comprised of competent and able individuals,\" id. at\n\n392,   it   has    declined     to    extend   a   conditional    privilege   to\n\nstatements made by a police chief to a newspaper reporter about a\n\npolice officer's potentially illegal conduct where the statements\n\nwere not made \"during the original investigation\" to \"persons\n\nconcerned with the investigation,\" Draghetti v. Chmielewski, 626\n\nN.E.2d 862, 867-68 (Mass. 1994) (also rejecting argument that\n\npolice chief \"and the citizens who read the [newspaper] share a\n\n'common interest' in the communication which entitles him to a\n\nqualified privilege\").          \"Lacking clear guidance\" from the state\n\ncourts,     we    must   make   our    \"best   guess   based     on   suggestive\n\n[Massachusetts] precedents, policy, and the general direction in\n\nwhich the case law is tending in other states.\"                Nicolo v. Philip\n\nMorris, Inc., 201 F.3d 29, 40 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            The conditional privilege for defamatory statements is\n\n\"designed to allow public officials to speak freely on matters of\n\npublic importance in the exercise of their official duties.\"\n\nDraghetti, 626 N.E.2d at 867.            Determining whether a conditional\n\nprivilege is appropriate requires balancing of \"the interest of the\n\n\n                                        -59-\n\fdefamed person in the protection of his reputation against the\n\ninterests of the publisher, of third persons[,] and of the public\n\nin having the publication take place.\"                 Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts § 598A (1977).             Burke's interest in the protection of his\n\nreputation      from    false      imputations   of     criminality   cannot     be\n\ngainsaid.       \"Words may be found to be defamatory if they hold the\n\nplaintiff up to contempt, hatred, scorn or ridicule, or tend to\n\nimpair his standing in the community.\"                Poland v. Post Publ. Co.,\n\n116 N.E.2d 860, 861 (Mass. 1953).                Imputations of criminality\n\ngenerally fit the bill.            See, e.g., Draghetti, 626 N.E.2d at 866;\n\nJones v. Taibbi, 512 N.E.2d 260, 268-69 (Mass. 1987).\n\n               Nevertheless, the concerned citizens in this case were\n\njustifiably apprehensive about the commission of this brutal crime\n\nin their community and its implications for their safety.                   Chief\n\nBetro accepted the invitation to speak at the meeting and attended\n\nin his official capacity.              Understandably, the local citizens\n\nlooked    to    him    for   a    current   report     on   the   status   of   the\n\ninvestigation. We note that several jurisdictions have recognized,\n\neither by statute or by judicial decision, a conditional privilege\n\nfor statements made by the police to members of the press or the\n\npublic.     See, e.g., Lanier v. Higgins, 623 S.W.2d 914, 916 (Ky.\n\nApp. 1981) (police chief interviewed by television station \"was not\n\nclothed with an absolute privilege but rather with a special or\n\nconditional privilege\"); Trentecosta v. Beck, 703 So. 2d 552, 564\n\n\n                                        -60-\n\f(La.    1997)     (qualified         privilege       for    \"fair   reporting       of\n\ninvestigations or arrest\" may be \"available to . . . troopers in\n\ntheir role as law enforcement officers reporting the facts of an\n\ninvestigation and a resulting arrest to the press and, in turn, to\n\nthe public\"); Peterson v. City of Mitchell, 499 N.W.2d 911, 915-16\n\n(S.D.   1993)   (per     curiam)      (upholding      application       of   statutory\n\nqualified \"common interest privilege\" for statements made in a\n\npolice press release where \"the citizens of Mitchell had [a]\n\ncommon, public interest in the apprehension of those responsible\n\nfor [a] recent wave of thefts and vandalisms\").                  On balance, while\n\nrecognizing     that     the    authoritative        call   on   this    conditional\n\nprivilege issue is for the Massachusetts SJC, our best judgment is\n\nthat, when the SJC eventually decides the question, it will hold\n\nthat Massachusetts law affords a police chief standing in Chief\n\nBetro's   shoes    the    protection      of     a   conditional    privilege      for\n\nallegedly defamatory statements to a citizens' group.\n\n            Unlike absolutely privileged statements, which \"cannot\n\nsupport a claim of defamation, even if uttered with malice or in\n\nbad faith,\" Correllas, 572 N.E.2d at 10, a conditional privilege\n\nmay be overcome where a plaintiff shows that the defendant \"acted\n\nwith actual malice or [that] there is unnecessary, unreasonable or\n\nexcessive publication, and the plaintiff establishes that the\n\ndefendant     published        the   defamatory       information       recklessly,\"\n\nMulgrew, 574 N.E.2d at 391 (internal quotation marks and citations\n\n\n                                        -61-\n\fomitted).     While a reasonable jury could find that Chief Betro's\n\nalleged statements indicating that the police had \"the right man\"\n\nand theorizing that Burke could have rinsed his DNA out of his\n\nmouth before making the bite mark on the victim were \"unnecessary,\n\nunreasonable or excessive,\" id. at 391,37 the record reveals no\n\nevidence that Chief Betro acted with the necessary recklessness or\n\nactual malice to overcome the conditional privilege.         Accordingly,\n\nChief Betro is entitled to summary judgment on Burke's defamation\n\nclaim.\n\n                                  VI. CONCLUSION\n\n             For the reasons stated, we vacate the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment to Trooper McDonald on Burke's § 1983\n\nclaim     alleging   a   Fourth    Amendment   violation.   In   all   other\n\nrespects, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.                The\n\nparties shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n     37\n      By contrast, Lt. Stillman, the Walpole Police Department's\ndesignated public information officer, limited his public\nstatements to the disclosure of information supported by evidence.\nFor example, The Walpole Times reported on January 21, 1999 that\n\"Stillman acknowledg[ed] that DNA evidence and a palm print taken\nfrom the victim's body [have] excluded Burke. Stillman did point\nout, however, that bite marks taken from Mrs. Kennedy's body\nmatched Burke's dental profile, according to one of the nation's\ntop forensic dentists.\"\n\n                                      -62-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff-Appellant Burke. <i>Diaz v. City of Fitchburg,</i> 176 F.3d 560, 561 (1st Cir.1999). On the morning of December 1, 1998, the partially clothed and mutilated body of 75-year-old Irene Kennedy was found in a wooded area of Bird Park in Walpole, Massachusetts. She had been savagely beaten, strangled, and stabbed multiple times. Her breasts were exposed, and the left breast bore a visible bite mark. Investigators from the Town of Walpole Police Department and the Massachusetts State Police were called to the scene after Kennedy's husband alerted a park caretaker to the body's presence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> According to police reports, Mr. Kennedy told investigators that he and his wife walked in the park almost daily, but that they took separate routes because an injury prevented him from walking as quickly as his wife. He stated that he had gone looking for his wife when she failed to meet him at their usual time in the parking lot that morning, and that he had discovered her body in an area of the park where he knew she sometimes stopped to urinate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon learning of Mrs. Kennedy's murder, one of the Kennedys' daughters, Nancy Tower, told Det. Bausch that he should speak to Edmund Burke, who lived on the street adjoining the parking lot where her parents routinely parked, and whose brother was married to another of the Kennedys' daughters. According to Det. Bausch's report, Tower told him that Burke was \"very odd.\" Trooper McDonald also reported that Tower told him \"that Eddie Burke is abusive to his mother\" and that Burke's mother had told Mrs. Kennedy so. Trooper McDonald's report continued, \"Ms. Tower stated that as a result of these conversations she felt that her mother was leery of Burke. Ms. Tower stated that subject Burke is unemployed and hangs around his house all day and seems very strange.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that morning, when Det. Bausch and another Walpole police officer visited Burke's home, where he lived with his 88-year-old mother, no one responded to their knocks or shouts. When they returned to the house a short time later, Burke's mother and brother were outside the house. According to Det. Bausch's report, Burke's mother told him Burke had been asleep when she left the house earlier that morning, and she seemed reluctant to wake him, but eventually agreed to do so. When Burke came outside, Det. Bausch informed him and his brother of Mrs. Kennedy's death. Burke then agreed to go to the police station to talk to investigators and left with his brother while Det. Bausch remained outside Burke's house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, investigators at the crime scene employed a K-9 tracking dog to follow any scents detected near the body. According to a report by the dog's handler, the dog was introduced to \"a pile of leaves [removed] from between the victim's legs\" and then proceeded through the woods and across a field towards the street on which Burke lived. From there, the handler recorded, \"we went to the right before the K-9 circled back to the left heading west. [The] K-9 ... traveled along the ... sidewalk past [Burke's house] for about fifteen to twenty feet. The K-9 circled back and traveled to the front door of [Burke's house]....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Det. Bausch saw the K-9 dog come out of the woods and ultimately stop at Burke's house. Det. Bausch then went to the police station, where he, Sgt. Shea, and Trooper McDonald questioned Burke. According to Sgt. Shea's report, Burke told the officers that he knew the Kennedys but not well, and he described their walking routine, which he knew because he usually saw them in the morning in the parking lot next to his house. Burke stated that he had been asleep at home at the time of the murder until the police arrived and his mother woke him up. Burke also stated that he had not visited the park for two years, intending the statement to mean that he had not gone to the park as a destination during that time. When Det. Bausch told Burke that a K-9 dog had apparently tracked a scent through the park to Burke's front door, Burke stated that he had taken a shortcut through the park late on the Sunday night before the Tuesday morning murder, along with two of his cats. The officers considered this statement to be inconsistent with Burke's earlier statement that he had not visited the park for two years. While at the station, Burke provided a saliva sample for DNA testing and comparison with any foreign DNA collected from the body. He also permitted police to take his jacket in order to test it for forensic evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the days after the murder, Det. Dolan interviewed potential witnesses who lived in the vicinity of Bird Park or who walked regularly in the park. He recorded statements by several people who reported seeing a person matching Burke's description in the general area of the park in which the body was found in the days before the murder and also in the driveway outside Burke's house on the morning of the murder when Burke said he had been asleep.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further examination of the victim's body by the Chief Medical Examiner's Office revealed a second bite mark on the other breast. Both bite marks were determined to have been made by a human. The bite marks were photographed and the bite mark on the left breast swabbed to collect DNA evidence from any traces of foreign saliva or skin. The swab from the victim's left breast and the sample of Burke's saliva were sent to the Maine State Police Crime Laboratory on December 4 for expedited DNA analysis because no such facility was yet in operation in Massachusetts. Two swatches from Burke's jacket were also sent to the Maine Crime Lab on December 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, Burke agreed to go to the police station so that Dr. Crowley, a forensic odontologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, could make a mold of his teeth for comparison with photographs of the bite marks on the victim's breasts. Upon Dr. Crowley's recommendation, the district attorney's office hired Dr. Lowell Levine, an experienced forensic odontologist based in Albany, New York, to examine the mold of Burke's teeth and compare it with the photographs of the bite marks. On December 6, Dr. Crowley, Det. Dolan, and Trooper Jennings traveled to Albany to bring the mold and the photographs to Dr. Levine for examination. Dr. Levine formed an initial opinion that Burke could not be excluded as the source of the bite marks, but stated that he would need to see enhanced photographs in order to render a final opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 9, Dr. Levine traveled to Boston to examine samples of the victim's clothing for bite marks and to instruct a photo laboratory employee on how to enlarge the photographs for better comparison with the mold of Burke's teeth. Dr. Levine then returned to Albany. Trooper McDonald and Sgt. Shea delivered the enlarged photographs to Dr. Levine in Albany late that same evening. Also on December 9, Theresa Calicchio, the forensic DNA chemist at the Maine Crime Lab who was assigned to perform the DNA analysis of Burke's saliva samples, the swatches from his jacket, and the samples taken from the victim's left breast, called Trooper McDonald to inform him that she had extracted DNA from the samples she had received and that she would call with results of the analysis the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime on the morning of December 10, after comparing the mold of Burke's teeth with the enlarged photographs of the bite marks, Dr. Levine told Trooper McDonald that Burke's teeth matched the bite mark on the victim's left breast to a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\" That same morning, at around 11:00 AM, Calicchio informed Trooper McDonald that the DNA analysis showed that Burke was excluded as the source of male DNA found in the bite mark on the victim's left breast.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to a report by Sgt. Shea, he and another MSP Trooper, Scott Jennings, received Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion from Trooper McDonald on December 10 \"at approximately 1315 hours\" (i.e., 1:15 PM). Sgt. Shea and Trooper Jennings then incorporated the bite mark opinion into an affidavit in support of a search warrant. Based on the facts recited in the search warrant affidavit, Det. Dolan prepared an application for a warrant for Burke's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 3:00 PM that afternoon, Burke was arrested at his home and brought to the police station in handcuffs. Det. Bausch, Sgt. Shea, Trooper Jennings, and Trooper McDonald, among other officers, were present during the arrest, although Troopers Jennings and McDonald testified at deposition that they were present only to conduct a search of Burke's home pursuant to the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Burke's arraignment the next day, December 11, Trooper McDonald called Sgt. Shea, who was at the courthouse, to tell him that the DNA analysis results excluded Burke as the source of the unidentified male DNA on the victim's left breast. Sgt. Shea alerted Assistant District Attorney (\"ADA\") Gerald Pudolsky mid-argument and pulled him away from the arraignment to tell him the new information. When Burke's arraignment resumed, ADA Pudolsky represented to the arraigning judge that DNA analysis had shown ambiguous results and that \"further testing\" was required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> He then sought Burke's detention without bail. Burke's attorney did not request Burke's immediate release on bail, and the arraigning judge ordered Burke held pending a bail hearing on December 29. On that date, Burke was granted release on bail to house arrest with electronic monitoring. His release was delayed, however, because his house could not immediately be equipped for monitoring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, while Burke was awaiting release on conditional bail, a comparison of a palm print found on the victim's body against a set of palm prints taken from Burke by court order a few days earlier revealed that Burke was not the source of the palm print on the victim's body. On January 19, the district attorney filed a <i>nolle prosequi</i> in the case on the ground that Burke's prosecution was premature. The next day, forty-one days after his arrest, Burke was released from custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just over one year after his arrest, on December 13, 1999, Burke filed a civil rights action in state court against the Town of Walpole, Dr. Levine, and various officers and supervisors of the Walpole Police Department in their individual and official capacities alleging, among other state and federal law claims, that the defendants had violated 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 by depriving him of his right under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to be free from arrest without probable cause. Burke also alleged that Chief Betro had defamed him by falsely attributing the murder to him in public. The defendants removed the case to federal court. On December 14, 2000, Burke filed a similar action in federal court against various MSP Troopers, employees of the Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner's Office, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Burke then filed an amended complaint to consolidate the two cases. In May 2001 Burke amended his complaint to add claims of negligence against the Commonwealth. Burke was permitted to amend his complaint again on February 19, 2002 to join Dr. Crowley as a defendant. On July 16, 2002, Burke moved to amend his complaint a fourth time to join Robert Martin, a chemist at the Massachusetts Crime Lab, as a defendant, but the motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2003, all defendants except Dr. Crowley moved for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In October 2003 a magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment to all defendants on all claims in three comprehensive reports and recommendations. <i>See Burke v. Town of Walpole,</i> Nos. 00-10376, 00-10384, 00-12541, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24896 (D.Mass. Oct. 6, 2003) (MSP defendants); <i>Burke v.

On January 22, 2004, the district court adopted the magistrate judge's reports and recommendations and granted Dr. Crowley's motion for summary judgment without referring the motion to the magistrate judge. <i>Burke v. Town of Walpole,</i> Nos. 00-10376, 00-10384, 00-12541, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3964, 2004 WL 502617 (D.Mass. Jan. 22, 2004).

Smith,</i> 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir.1990), we must discern whether \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \"In this context, `genuine' means that the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party; `material' means that the fact is one `that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.'\" <i>United States v.

Graham,</i> 473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Burke alleges that the police defendants violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> by procuring: (1) his home arrest without a valid warrant, (2) his arrest without probable cause, and (3) his arrest on the basis of a misleading warrant application submitted with intentional or reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants all insist that Burke suffered no constitutional deprivation. The individual police defendants further argue that even if the record supports Burke's allegations that he suffered a violation of a Fourth Amendment right, they are entitled to qualified immunity against suit for damages in their individual capacities for any acts or omissions that caused such a deprivation. The doctrine of qualified immunity aims to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">balance [the] desire to compensate those whose rights are infringed by state actors with an equally compelling desire to shield public servants from undue interference with the performance of their duties and from threats of liability which, though unfounded, may nevertheless be unbearably disruptive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Buenrostro v. Collazo,</i> 973 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir.1992). Because exposure to civil rights suits may result in \"distraction of officials from their governmental duties, inhibition of discretionary action, and deterrence of able people from public service,\" the doctrine of qualified immunity protects public officials from liability under &#167; 1983 so long as \"their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 816, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The doctrine thus protects \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\" <i>Malley v. Briggs,</i> 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).

Det. Dolan testified at deposition that he prepared an application for an arrest warrant at the request of the District Attorney, including a summary of the facts establishing probable cause based on information provided by other investigating officers, and that he submitted the application to a magistrate. At his deposition, Det. Dolan identified as the text of his probable cause summary a six-paragraph excerpt from a computer printout containing numerous reports allegedly produced by Walpole officers during the murder investigation. Det. Dolan also identified a longer version of the summary of the evidence that he drafted, but which the District Attorney requested that he shorten for submission with the warrant application. Burke insists that a jury could infer that the probable cause summaries in the computer print-out were created only after Burke's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the unsigned copy of the arrest warrant and Det. Dolan's summary of facts establishing probable cause, the police defendants have produced a copy of the application for a criminal complaint signed by Det. Dolan, on which the box marked \"Warrant\" has been checked and initialed by a magistrate; a copy of a summons and a complaint signed by the same magistrate, on each of which the box for entry of \"RETURN DATE AND TIME\" contains the word \"warrant\"; and a computer printout of Burke's criminal docket (stored in the Warrant Management System database and retrieved through the Criminal Justice Information System) showing a return of warrant at around 4:00 PM on December 10. Finally, the police defendants have produced a search warrant, obtained by Trooper Jennings, dated December 10 and signed by the same magistrate judge who signed and initialed the criminal complaint. The search warrant is accompanied by a six-page affidavit including a much more detailed summary of the facts allegedly establishing probable cause than the summary Det. Dolan testified that he provided in support of the arrest warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the defendants have produced substantial, though imperfect, evidence that a valid arrest warrant issued upon a neutral magistrate's review of facts allegedly establishing probable cause. By contrast, Burke has adduced no evidence demonstrating that no warrant was issued apart from his own affidavit stating that he never saw a warrant. There is no requirement, either under the Constitution or under Massachusetts law, that a copy of the arrest warrant automatically be given to the person arrested at the time of the arrest. Burke's sworn statement, standing alone in the face of the defendants' submissions, cannot bear the evidentiary weight Burke seeks to give it. Because there is no genuine dispute regarding the question whether a valid arrest warrant was issued, the record fails to support Burke's allegation that he was deprived of his constitutional right to be arrested at home only upon issuance of a warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

Texas,</i> 378 U.S. 108, 111, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), <i>abrogated on other grounds by Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). Burke argues that even if a neutral magistrate issued a warrant for his arrest, he was nevertheless subjected to deprivation of his Fourth Amendment right because the \"totality of the circumstances,\" <i>Gates</i> 462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, as set forth in the warrant application, was insufficient to establish probable cause for his arrest. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.1996) (\"The issuing magistrate ordinarily considers only the facts set forth in supporting affidavits accompanying [a search] warrant application.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Probable cause determinations are, virtually by definition, preliminary and tentative.\" <i>Acosta v. Ames Dep't Stores, Inc.,</i> 386 F.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir.2004). The exact degree of certainty required to establish probable cause is difficult to quantify; it falls somewhere between \"`bare suspicion' [and] what would be needed to `justify ... conviction.' \"<i>Valente,</i> 332 F.3d at 32 (quoting <i>Brinegar v.

Probable cause thus exists if \"the facts and circumstances within the relevant actors' knowledge and of which they had reasonably reliable information\" would suffice to \"warrant a prudent person in believing\" that a person has committed or is about to commit a crime. <i>Roche,</i> 81 F.3d at 254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police defendants insist that the magistrate had before him ample facts and circumstances establishing probable cause for Burke's arrest.

Dolan's summary, he assails in particular the inclusion of an inaccurate inculpatory bite mark opinion. Bite mark evidence, Burke argues, is so unreliable that it could not reasonably support probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The existence of probable cause is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time of arrest rather than in hindsight. <i>Roche,</i> 81 F.3d at 254. Moreover, forensic evidence relied upon by the police to establish probable cause to arrest need not be unassailably accurate. \"[O]ne who asserts the existence of probable cause is not a guarantor either of the accuracy of the information upon which he has reasonably relied or of the ultimate conclusion that he reasonably drew therefrom.\" <i>Id.</i> at 255. Burke points to the affidavit of his own proposed trial expert, Dr. Richard R. Souviron, in which he states that \"[b]ite mark evidence, if it is the only evidence of identity, cannot be used to positively identify a possible perpetrator to the exclusion of all others within a significant population.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> This categorical statement about the limited probative value of bite mark evidence to inculpate a suspect does not establish that Dr. Levine's specific bite mark comparison in this case failed to support probable cause when considered in light of the other available evidence. In many types of forensic analysis, an \"examiner can do no more than speak of probabilities.\" <i>Valente,</i> 332 F.3d at 33 (handwriting comparison, \"a less rigorous means of identification\" than fingerprint analysis, may be used to support probable cause); <i>see also Roche,</i> 81 F.3d at 255 (inculpatory voice identification may support probable cause). The bite mark evidence was an appropriate factor to be weighed in the probable cause calculus, and the \"totality of the circumstances,\" <i>Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, as stated in Det.

Burke alleges that the police defendants, with intentional or reckless disregard for the truth, included inculpatory bite mark evidence that they knew or had reason to know was inaccurate in the warrant application and excluded exculpatory DNA evidence that would have eliminated probable cause from the same application, thereby requiring the magistrate to make his probable cause decision on the basis of a tainted submission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A Fourth Amendment violation may be established if a [plaintiff] can show that officers acted in reckless disregard, with a `high degree of awareness of [the] probable falsity'\" of statements made in support of an arrest warrant. <i>Forest v. Pawtucket Police Dep't,</i> 377 F.3d 52, 58 (1st Cir.2004) (citation omitted), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 1315, 161 L.Ed.2d 111 (2005). Similarly, the intentional or reckless omission of material exculpatory facts from information presented to a magistrate may also amount to a Fourth Amendment violation. <i>DeLoach v. Bevers,</i> 922 F.2d 618, 622 (10th Cir.1990) (upholding verdict for plaintiff where jury could have inferred that defendant police detective deliberately or recklessly excluded the exculpatory opinion of an important medical expert from the affidavit). Reckless disregard for the truth in the submission of a warrant application may be established where an officer \"in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the allegations\" or where \"circumstances evinc[ed] obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the allegations\" in the application. <i>United States v. Ranney,</i> 298 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the case of allegedly material omissions, \"recklessness may be inferred where the omitted information was critical to the probable cause determination.\" <i>Golino v. New Haven,</i> 950 F.2d 864, 871 (2d Cir.1991); <i>see also Wilson v. Russo,</i> 212 F.3d 781, 783 (3d Cir.2000) (\"omissions are made with reckless disregard for the truth when an officer recklessly omits facts that any reasonable person would know that a judge would want to know\" when deciding whether to issue a warrant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allegations of intentional or reckless misstatements or omissions implicate the very truthfulness, not just the sufficiency, of a warrant application. If such allegations prove to be true, a court owes no deference to a magistrate's decision to issue an arrest warrant because, \"where officers procuring a warrant have deliberately misled the magistrate about relevant information, no magistrate will have made a prior probable cause determination\" based on the correct version of the material facts. <i>Velardi v. Walsh,</i> 40 F.3d 569, 574 n. 1 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement that the contested facts included in or omitted from a warrant application be material to the probable cause determination to establish a Fourth Amendment violation derives from the standard announced for the suppression of evidence in <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). There, the Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant who establishes that a police officer procured a search warrant by intentionally or recklessly making materially false statements in a supporting affidavit is entitled to the suppression of evidence so long as \"the remaining content [in the affidavit] is insufficient\" to support probable cause. <i>Id.</i> at 156, 98 S.Ct. 2674. Appellate courts have consistently held that the <i>Franks</i> standard for suppression of evidence informs the scope of qualified immunity in a civil damages suit against officers who allegedly procure a warrant based on an untruthful application. <i>See, e.g., Aponte Matos v. Toledo-Davila,</i> 135 F.3d 182, 185 (1st Cir.1998) (where allegedly false statement was necessary to establish probable cause, defendant \"will not be protected by qualified immunity\" if plaintiffs prevail at trial on claim that defendant lied in search warrant application); <i>Olson v. Tyler,</i> 771 F.2d 277, 282 (7th Cir.1985) (\"Where the judicial finding of probable cause is based solely on information the officer knew to be false or would have known was false had he not recklessly disregarded the truth, not only does the arrest violate the fourth amendment, but the officer will not be entitled to [qualified] immunity.\"). As in the suppression context, \"[t]o determine ... materiality of the misstatements and omissions, we excise the offending inaccuracies and insert the facts recklessly omitted, and then determine whether or not the `corrected' warrant affidavit would establish probable cause.\" <i>Wilson,</i> 212 F.3d at 789.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

The summary filed by Det. Dolan along with his application for an arrest warrant describes Dr. Levine as \"the leading expert in the country [who] has testified as such[.] He is a Forensic Dentist with over thirty years of experience.\" While Burke assails the reliability of bite mark analysis generally, he does not dispute Dr. Levine's credentials or point to any evidence that the police had any reason to doubt Dr. Levine's opinion. Burke thus fails to establish that \"circumstances evinc[ed] obvious reasons to doubt the veracity\" of the inculpatory bite mark evidence, and fails to preserve a genuine dispute on his claim that inaccurate evidence was recklessly included in the warrant application in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. <i>Ranney,</i> 298 F.3d at 78 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

Dolan's statement of probable cause, thus precluding review by a neutral magistrate of all the facts material to the existence of probable cause. Burke argues that the inculpatory bite mark evidence could not rationally co-exist with the exculpatory DNA evidence in his case. Given the greater certainty of the DNA analysis results, he argues, the inclusion of those results in the warrant application would have eliminated probable cause. Moreover, Burke argues, because the exculpatory DNA evidence was \"critical to the probable cause determination,\" <i>Golino,</i> 950 F.2d at 871, a reasonable jury could infer that its omission from the warrant application submitted to the magistrate was made with deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine Crime Lab chemist Calicchio's uncontroverted deposition testimony was that DNA analysis may exclude a person as a source of DNA with virtual certainty: \"We like to say an exclusion is absolute.\" In a report dated December 12, Calicchio memorialized the DNA results she had communicated by telephone to Trooper McDonald:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A mixture of male and female DNA profiles was obtained from the breast swabbings (Items # 1A and 1B).

Burke alleges that at least one officer central to the investigation, Trooper McDonald, knew that DNA analysis had conclusively excluded him as the source of the saliva in the bite mark and, consequently, as the murderer, as early as four hours prior to Burke's arrest, and two hours before any warrant applications were prepared. Calicchio's contemporaneous notes show that Trooper McDonald called her at 11:00 AM on December 10 to find out the DNA analysis results.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> About two hours later, at 1:15 PM, Trooper McDonald communicated Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion, but not the DNA results, to Sgt. Shea and Trooper Jennings for inclusion in an affidavit in support of a search warrant. Trooper McDonald testified at his deposition that he also communicated Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion to Det. Dolan at some point, and that Det. Dolan would have relied on the information in the search warrant affidavit to prepare his arrest warrant application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to Calicchio's account, Trooper McDonald testified at deposition that he did not receive the DNA results until the day after Burke's arrest, and that he immediately communicated the exculpatory results, through Sgt. Shea, to the prosecutor during Burke's arraignment. Calicchio's notes document only one phone conversation on December 11 relating to the case, with Massachusetts Crime Lab chemist Richard Iawicci, who called her at 11:15 AM, after the DNA results were disclosed during Burke's arraignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Burke, the record supports the inference that exculpatory DNA analysis that directly contradicted the inculpatory bite mark evidence was known to at least one officer centrally involved in the investigation, and was intentionally or recklessly withheld from the officer who was actually preparing the warrant application, resulting in its omission from the application. Accordingly, for purposes of the summary judgment analysis, and in answer to the first question of the qualified immunity inquiry, Burke has proffered evidence sufficient to support a finding that he was arrested without probable cause in violation of his Fourth Amendment right. <i>See Limone,</i> 372 F.3d at 44 (first question in qualified immunity analysis is \"whether the plaintiff's allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation\"). Whether any of the police defendants may be liable for damages resulting from this constitutional violation turns on the balance of the qualified immunity inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Haugen,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 125 S.Ct. 596, 599, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004). Uniquely among the defendant police officers, Trooper McDonald argues that he had no constitutional duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to anyone because he was neither an affiant for the arrest warrant nor technically an arresting officer (merely a searching officer). Thus, we must ask \"whether the state of the law at the time of the putative violation afforded [Trooper McDonald] fair warning that his ... conduct was unconstitutional.\" <i>Limone,</i> 372 F.3d at 45.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It has long been well established that ... a material fabrication [in a warrant application] violates the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment.\" <i>Aponte Matos,</i> 135 F.3d at 185. As the Supreme Court explained in <i>Franks,</i>\"[when] the Fourth Amendment demands a factual showing sufficient to comprise `probable cause,' the obvious assumption is that there will be a <i>truthful</i> showing.\" 438 U.S. at 164-65, 98 S.Ct. 2674 (quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original). In the absence of such a requirement, the interposition of an objective magistrate into the arrest process would serve little purpose. This court has also applied the <i>Franks</i> standard to material omissions from a warrant application, which are likewise prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. <i>See United States v. Rumney,</i> 867 F.2d 714, 720 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because <i>Franks</i> involved allegations that an affidavit in support of a search warrant contained false statements by the affiant, the Court's ruling requiring suppression of evidence procured through a misleading warrant application spoke in terms of impeachment only \"of the affiant, not of any nongovernmental informant.\" 438 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674. The Supreme Court later clarified, however, that courts deciding motions to suppress evidence despite the issuance of a valid warrant must \"consider the objective reasonableness, not only of the officers who eventually executed a warrant, but also of the officers who originally obtained it or who provided information material to the probable-cause determination.\" <i>United States v. Leon,</i> 468 U.S. 897, 923 n. 24, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). Just as a police officer who seeks an arrest warrant despite the lack of probable cause may not \"excuse his own default by pointing to the greater incompetence of [a] magistrate\" who erroneously issues a warrant, <i>Malley,</i> 475 U.S. at 346 n. 9, 106 S.Ct. 1092, a police defendant who acts intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth may not insulate himself from liability through the objectively reasonable conduct of other officers. <i>See Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 923 n. 24, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (\"Nothing in our opinion suggests, for example, that an officer could obtain a warrant\" based on an insufficient affidavit \"and then rely on colleagues who are ignorant of the circumstances under which the warrant was obtained to conduct the search.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Trooper McDonald's argument that he had no constitutional duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to anyone prior to Burke's arrest because he was neither an affiant for the arrest warrant nor technically an arresting officer is unavailing. However Trooper McDonald chooses to characterize or minimize his role, the summary judgment record establishes that he was centrally involved in the collection of evidence to be used to secure an arrest warrant for Burke.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> At the time of Burke's arrest, his constitutional right to be free from arrest pursuant to a warrant that would not have issued if material exculpatory evidence had been provided to the magistrate was clearly established, as was Trooper McDonald's concomitant constitutional duty of full disclosure of exculpatory information to fellow officers seeking warrants based on probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), even where a plaintiff has shown, for purposes of withstanding summary judgment, that a government official may have deprived him of a clearly established constitutional right, qualified immunity remains available to defendants who demonstrate that they acted objectively reasonably in applying clearly established law to the specific facts they faced. Having determined for the purpose of the qualified immunity analysis that Burke was arrested pursuant to a warrant issued because of reckless or intentional omissions of material facts from the warrant application (the constitutional violation), we proceed to analyze each police defendant's individual conduct in this case, focusing on whether each \"officer's mistake as to what the law requires [was] reasonable.\" <i>Id.</i> a.

Watkins,</i> 942 F.2d 67, 72 (1st Cir.1991). Because the facts known to Det. Dolan, as set forth in his summary of probable cause, formed a plausible basis for seeking an arrest warrant, he is entitled to qualified immunity. Similarly, \"[w]hen officers make an arrest subject to a warrant ... even if probable cause is lacking, [they] are entitled to qualified immunity unless the warrant application is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable.\" <i>Abreu-Guzman v. Ford,</i> 241 F.3d 69, 73 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Both Det. Bausch and Sgt.

Trooper McDonald's deposition testimony reveals that he relayed Dr. Levine's inculpatory bite mark opinion to Trooper Jennings and Sgt. Shea for inclusion in their affidavit in support of a search warrant about two hours after he received the DNA results from Calicchio, and that he was aware that Det.

Shea, to the prosecution.

Accordingly, Trooper McDonald was not entitled to a favorable summary judgment ruling on his qualified immunity defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>IV.

Deprivation of a Constitutional Right</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke alleges that Dr. Levine and Dr. Crowley each deprived him of his independent constitutional right to be free from arrest on the basis of knowingly or recklessly exaggerated inculpatory bite mark evidence. While the police defendants may have had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the bite mark evidence included in the arrest warrant application, Burke asserts that both Dr. Levine and Dr. Crowley had ample reason to doubt the validity of their own bite mark analyses for use in determining the existence of probable cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intentional or reckless fabrication of inculpatory evidence or omission of material exculpatory evidence by a forensic examiner in support of probable cause may amount to a constitutional violation. <i>See Galbraith v. Cty. of Santa Clara,</i> 307 F.3d 1119, 1126 (9th Cir.2002) (\"[A] coroner's reckless or intentional falsification of an autopsy report that plays a material role in the false arrest and prosecution of an individual can support a claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and the Fourth Amendment.\"); <i>Pierce v. Gilchrist,</i> 359 F.3d 1279, 1296 (10th Cir.2004) (plaintiff alleging post-arrest fabrication of hair sample opinion states a claim against forensic chemist for unconstitutional prosecution, of which one element is lack of probable cause). We thus inquire whether the facts in the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to Burke, permit the inference that either Dr. Levine or Dr. Crowley rendered a bite mark opinion with deliberate falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his allegations, Burke must show that Dr. Levine or Dr. Crowley \"in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth\" of their bite mark opinions or that \"circumstances evinc[ed] obvious reasons to doubt the veracity\" of those results. <i>Ranney,</i> 298 F.3d at 78 (internal quotation marks omitted). To constitute a Fourth Amendment violation, the allegedly fabricated or exaggerated evidence must also be material to the probable cause determination. <i>See, e.g., Pierce,</i> 359 F.3d at 1287-88 (on motion to dismiss claim of unconstitutional prosecution, \"we cannot say that the false information supplied by [forensic chemist] and the accurate exculpatory information disregarded by [her] were not significant enough to prejudice [plaintiff's] constitutional rights\"); <i>Aponte Matos,</i> 135 F.3d at 185 (police officer's \"material fabrication [in a warrant application] violates the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Dr. Levine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke alleges that Dr. Levine acted with deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth by overstating the degree of certainty with which the mold of Burke's teeth matched the bite mark on the victim's left breast.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> Burke attempts to demonstrate that Dr. Levine was at least reckless by (1) referring to Dr. Levine's own statements made during the instant litigation, (2) assailing the terminology with which Dr. Levine rendered his opinion before Burke's arrest, and (3) referring to the statements of Burke's own expert witness regarding the process of bite mark analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke points to Dr. Levine's affidavit, filed on March 16, 2000 in support of a motion to dismiss Burke's claims against him for lack of personal jurisdiction (based on Dr. Levine's New York residence and alleged lack of contacts with Massachusetts). In his affidavit, Dr. Levine stated that he told police investigators on December 10, 1998 that he \"could not rule out Mr. Burke\" as a source of the bite marks. At their depositions, Chief Betro and Trooper McDonald indicated that they viewed this affidavit as effectively disavowing the opinion that Dr. Levine had rendered for them with a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" prior to Burke's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 7, 2000, Dr. Levine supplemented his affidavit of March 16, 2000 to clarify that on December 10, 1998, \"I could not rule out Mr. Burke as a suspect. Both of the two bite marks on [the victim's] body were consistent with his dentition. One of the bite marks was consistent with his dentition to a high level of probability, or a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\" Dr. Levine thus does not deny that he rendered his opinion on December 10, 1998 about the bite mark on the victim's left breast with a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\" At the same time, there is a significant difference between opining to a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" that Burke's teeth matched one of the bite marks and simply opining that \"I could not rule out Mr. Burke as a suspect,\" both of which statements are included in Dr. Levine's July 7, 2000 affidavit. Dr. Levine maintains that the opinion he communicated to police on December 10, 1998 to a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" before Burke's arrest was and remains accurate. At his deposition, Dr. Levine demonstrated his bite mark analysis methodology by comparing the mold of Burke's teeth with the enlarged photographs and testified that he adhered to his original opinion that Burke's teeth matched the bite mark on the victim's left breast to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, Burke asserts that Dr. Levine used the phrase \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" when, as revealed by the clarifying affidavit of July 7, 2000, he in fact meant a \"high level of probability.\" Burke argues that Dr. Levine's misuse of terminology exhibited reckless disregard for his obligation to communicate his actual level of certainty about the bite mark match. \"`Reasonable degree of scientific certainty' is a plastic phrase.\" <i>Buie v. McAdory,</i> 341 F.3d 623, 625 (7th Cir.2003). That fact is evident from Dr. Levine's attempts to explain the meaning he assigns to the term. At his deposition, Dr. Levine testified that he uses \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" to mean \"high degree of probability,\" a higher standard than \"could not rule out as a suspect.\" Dr. Levine's explanation of his terminology comports with the non-binding \"Bite-Mark Terminology Guidelines\" of the American Board of Forensic Odontologists (\"ABFO\"), of which Dr. Levine is a founding diplomate and member, which equate the related terms \"reasonable medical certainty\" and \"high degree of certainty.\" As Burke points out, however, the guidelines further define both terms to mean \"virtual certainty; no reasonable or practical possibility that someone else did it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> By using the term \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty,\" Burke reasons, Dr. Levine communicated a higher degree of certainty (\"virtual certainty,\" according to a passage in the ABFO guidelines) than he actually felt (only that he \"could not rule out Mr. Burke as a suspect,\" according to his March 16, 2000 affidavit). At his deposition, Dr. Levine \"clarified\" that while he uses \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" and \"high degree of probability\" interchangeably, his left breast bite mark opinion never met the high standard of the ABFO guidelines' definition of \"reasonable medical certainty\" &#8212; namely, that there was \"no reasonable or practical possibility that someone else\" other than Burke made the bite mark on the victim's left breast.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not determine whether Dr. Levine's terminology or the terminology recommended by the ABFO guidelines is correct. Neither the ABFO guidelines' definition nor Dr. Levine's alternate term, \"high degree of probability,\" appears in Det. Dolan's summary of probable cause in the arrest warrant application. The summary merely states that Dr. Levine \"determined with reasonable scientific certainty that [the bite marks] were made by Edmund Burke.\" In the absence of any indication to the contrary, we must assume that the magistrate who issued the arrest warrant assigned no more than the commonly accepted meaning among lawyers and judges to the term \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" &#8212; \"a standard requiring a showing that the injury was more likely than not caused by a particular stimulus, based on the general consensus of recognized [scientific] thought.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1294 (8th ed.2004) (defining \"reasonable medical probability,\" or \"reasonable medical certainty,\" as used in tort actions). That standard, of course, is fully consistent with the probable cause standard. <i>See Roche,</i> 81 F.3d at 254 (\"By definition, the determination [of probable cause] does not require scientific certainty.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Burke relies on the affidavit of his own chosen expert, Dr. Souviron, which states that bite mark evidence alone cannot be used to \"positively identify a possible perpetrator to the exclusion of all others within a significant population.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> The record does not support the inference that Dr. Levine communicated, or risked communicating, that Burke was the source of the bite mark \"to the exclusion of all others within a significant population.\" Rather, he opined that Burke's teeth matched the bite mark to a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" without specifying the number of individuals who could have made the same bite mark. Dr. Souviron was unable to render his own independent opinion comparing the mold of Burke's teeth to the photographs of the bite mark because, he explained, \"[b]ased on my knowledge and expertise, I concluded that the photographs I was provided with were not the photographs that were used originally to make the evaluation of this case.... I would need the particular photographs in order to be able to perform any in-depth identification.\" Burke points out that copies of the enlarged photographs were not made available to him during discovery through no fault of his own. But even a contrary expert opinion from Dr. Souviron based on the exact same materials used by Dr. Levine would not necessarily shed any light on how Dr. Levine performed his own analysis and arrived at his own conclusions at the time he rendered his bite mark opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Burke, we conclude that the record reveals no support for an inference that Dr. Levine's methodology or judgment were so clearly flawed that he should have harbored serious doubts about the reliability of his resulting opinion. Because Burke has failed to generate a genuine dispute on the threshold question of whether Dr. Levine violated his Fourth Amendment rights by rendering his bite mark opinion with deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth, Dr. Levine is entitled to summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Dr. Crowley</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke alleges that Dr. Crowley also intentionally fabricated or recklessly exaggerated an inculpatory bite mark opinion in support of probable cause. Burke highlights Dr. Crowley's deposition testimony that although she was professionally interested in the field of bite mark analysis and regarded Dr. Levine as a mentor, she was trained only as a dentist and had no experience in bite mark analysis. Rather, her experience as a forensic odontologist was limited to identifying human remains through comparison with dental records. Burke maintains that any bite mark opinion Dr. Crowley rendered would have reflected at a minimum her reckless disregard for the truth because she knew she was not qualified to perform such an analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Crowley insists that she never formed a bite mark opinion in support of probable cause. At deposition, Dr. Crowley testified that while she examined the mold of Burke's teeth and the bite mark on the victim, she did not make any comparisons: \"I never concluded that there was a match. I made some observations.\" She also stated that she made transparencies and impressions of Burke's teeth and the bite mark, but that she used these materials only as learning tools. In short, Dr. Crowley testified that her role in the investigation was limited to that of collecting and preserving the bite mark evidence, including making the mold of Burke's teeth, a task that dentists routinely perform.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke counters that Dr. Crowley did render a bite mark opinion in support of probable cause. He points to the deposition testimony of Dr. Levine and Lt. Kenneth Martin, an investigator with MSP Crime Scene Services, indicating that Dr. Crowley agreed with Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion. Dr. Levine testified that he was surprised to find out that Dr. Crowley had no experience in bite mark analysis, and that he had the impression that she shared his initial opinion formed in Albany on December 6 as well as his observations made at the Medical Examiner's Office in Boston on December 9.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Lt. Martin testified at deposition that he believed Dr. Crowley would be the primary person testifying about the bite mark evidence at a criminal trial and that Dr. Levine would be consulted to give a second opinion. He further stated that he knew Dr. Crowley had never testified at a trial about bite mark analysis, but that he had no reason to think she was not qualified to do so, given her examination of the actual bite mark and the unenhanced photographs,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> his understanding that \"she had had previous training under Lowell Levine who is recognized as a forensic odontologist,\" and her job qualifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Burke, the record fails to support Burke's allegation that Dr. Crowley actually communicated a bite mark opinion to the police investigators for use in Det. Dolan's arrest warrant application. Nor does the record indicate that the police investigators sought or relied upon Dr. Crowley's opinion after Dr. Levine became involved in the investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were required to take a different view of the evidence (and we are not), Dr. Crowley's communication of a bite mark opinion, without more, would not amount to reckless exaggeration, much less intentional fabrication, of bite mark evidence. Dr. Crowley herself advised the District Attorney to hire Dr. Levine as an expert. Given her knowledge of Dr. Levine's credentials, as well as her own, albeit limited, knowledge of forensic odontology, no rational jury could find that an opinion from Dr. Crowley merely concurring in Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion would be based on such dubious premises that it would manifest reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Burke has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact on the initial question of whether Dr. Crowley deprived him of his Fourth Amendment right, Dr. Crowley is entitled to summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. DEFAMATION CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke alleges that Walpole Police Chief Betro defamed him by falsely and publicly attributing Kennedy's murder to him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> According to the deposition testimony of a reporter for the <i>Daily Transcript,</i> a regional newspaper, Chief Betro made an appearance in his official capacity at a public meeting organized by the East Walpole Civic Association on or about January 13, 1999, after the exculpatory DNA results became public and while Burke was awaiting release to house arrest. Approximately two dozen citizens, fearful that the murderer was still at large, attended the meeting. The <i>Boston Herald,</i> relying on an article in the <i>Daily Transcript,</i> reported on January 25, 1999 that Chief Betro assured the audience, \"I can tell you we've got the right man.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Betro then advanced a theory to explain how Burke could be the killer despite having been excluded as a source of the foreign DNA found in the bite mark on the victim's breast. According to the <i>Boston Herald,</i> again relying on the <i>Daily Transcript,</i>\"[Chief] Betro ... told the crowd that an orange juice container was found about 40 feet from Kennedy's body, and it was possible Burke drank the orange juice and washed away any DNA samples in his mouth.\" The <i>Boston Globe,</i> which reported Chief Betro's remarks on January 22, 1999, stated, \"[i]n the highly complex world of DNA testing, the idea that the results could be manipulated by juice is not reasonable, according to several scientists at laboratories who conduct the tests.\" The <i>Globe</i> article went on to state that \"[t]he deputy laboratory director for Cellmark Diagnostics in Maryland, perhaps the best known private DNA testing laboratory in the country, dismissed the possibility.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Betro argues that his statements at the meeting of concerned citizens are absolutely privileged and cannot form the basis for a defamation suit because they were made during the course of a criminal investigation. While \"statements made to police or prosecutors prior to trial are absolutely privileged if they are made in the context of a proposed judicial proceeding,\" <i>Correllas v. Viveiros,</i> 410 Mass. 314, 572 N.E.2d 7, 11 (1991), Chief Betro's statements were made to members of a neighborhood association and were unrelated to any \"proposed judicial proceeding,\" <i>id.</i> The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") \"has recognized the existence of an absolute privilege in relatively few circumstances.\" <i>Mulgrew v. Taunton,</i> 410 Mass. 631, 574 N.E.2d 389, 392 n. 6 (1991). Nevertheless, the court has recognized that \"[s]tatements made by public officials while performing their official duties are conditionally privileged.\" <i>Id.</i> at 392. Chief Betro seeks recognition of that privilege as well. Under Massachusetts law, the availability of such a qualified privilege turns on whether Chief Betro had an official duty to discuss Burke at a meeting of concerned citizens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts SJC has not decided the question of whether a police chief has an official duty to appear at a meeting of citizens who are concerned about a violent crime but who are themselves uninvolved in the criminal investigation. While the court has extended a conditional privilege to statements made by a police chief to a city council committee about a police officer's performance history because \"[t]he public has an interest in having a police force comprised of competent and able individuals,\" <i>id.</i> at 392, it has declined to extend a conditional privilege to statements made by a police chief to a newspaper reporter about a police officer's potentially illegal conduct where the statements were not made \"during the original investigation\" to \"persons concerned with the investigation,\" <i>Draghetti v. Chmielewski,</i> 416 Mass. 808, 626 N.E.2d 862, 867-68 (1994) (also rejecting argument that police chief \"and the citizens who read the [newspaper] share a `common interest' in the communication which entitles him to a qualified privilege\"). \"Lacking clear guidance\" from the state courts, we must make our \"best guess based on suggestive [Massachusetts] precedents, policy, and the general direction in which the case law is tending in other states.\" <i>Nicolo v. Philip Morris, Inc.,</i> 201 F.3d 29, 40 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conditional privilege for defamatory statements is \"designed to allow public officials to speak freely on matters of public importance in the exercise of their official duties.\" <i>Draghetti,</i> 626 N.E.2d at 867. Determining whether a conditional privilege is appropriate requires balancing of \"the interest of the defamed person in the protection of his reputation against the interests of the publisher, of third persons[,] and of the public in having the publication take place.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 598A (1977). Burke's interest in the protection of his reputation from false imputations of criminality cannot be gainsaid. \"Words may be found to be defamatory if they hold the plaintiff up to contempt, hatred, scorn or ridicule, or tend to impair his standing in the community.\" <i>Poland v. Post Publ. Co.,</i> 330 Mass. 701, 116 N.E.2d 860, 861 (1953). Imputations of criminality generally fit the bill. <i>See, e.g., Draghetti,</i> 626 N.E.2d at 866; <i>Jones v. Taibbi,</i> 400 Mass. 786, 512 N.E.2d 260, 268-69 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the concerned citizens in this case were justifiably apprehensive about the commission of this brutal crime in their community and its implications for their safety. Chief Betro accepted the invitation to speak at the meeting and attended in his official capacity. Understandably, the local citizens looked to him for a current report on the status of the investigation. We note that several jurisdictions have recognized, either by statute or by judicial decision, a conditional privilege for statements made by the police to members of the press or the public. <i>See, e.g., Lanier v. Higgins,</i> 623 S.W.2d 914, 916 (Ky.App.1981) (police chief interviewed by television station \"was not clothed with an absolute privilege but rather with a special or conditional privilege\"); <i>Trentecosta v. Beck,</i> 703 So.2d 552, 564 (La.1997) (qualified privilege for \"fair reporting of investigations or arrest\" may be \"available to ... troopers in their role as law enforcement officers reporting the facts of an investigation and a resulting arrest to the press and, in turn, to the public\"); <i>Peterson v. City of Mitchell,</i> 499 N.W.2d 911, 915-16 (S.D.1993) (per curiam) (upholding application of statutory qualified \"common interest privilege\" for statements made in a police press release where \"the citizens of Mitchell had [a] common, public interest in the apprehension of those responsible for [a] recent wave of thefts and vandalisms\"). On balance, while recognizing that the authoritative call on this conditional privilege issue is for the Massachusetts SJC, our best judgment is that, when the SJC eventually decides the question, it will hold that Massachusetts law affords a police chief standing in Chief Betro's shoes the protection of a conditional privilege for allegedly defamatory statements to a citizens' group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike absolutely privileged statements, which \"cannot support a claim of defamation, even if uttered with malice or in bad faith,\" <i>Correllas,</i> 572 N.E.2d at 10, a conditional privilege may be overcome where a plaintiff shows that the defendant \"acted with actual malice or [that] there is unnecessary, unreasonable or excessive publication, and the plaintiff establishes that the defendant published the defamatory information recklessly,\" <i>Mulgrew,</i> 574 N.E.2d at 391 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). While a reasonable jury could find that Chief Betro's alleged statements indicating that the police had \"the right man\" and theorizing that Burke could have rinsed his DNA out of his mouth before making the bite mark on the victim were \"unnecessary, unreasonable or excessive,\" <i>id.</i> at 391,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> the record reveals no evidence that Chief Betro acted with the necessary recklessness or actual malice to overcome the conditional privilege.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff-Appellant Burke. <i>Diaz v. City of Fitchburg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198467\"><a href=\"/opinion/198467/diaz-v-city-of-fitchburg/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span>, 561 (1st Cir.1999). On the morning of December 1, 1998, the partially clothed and mutilated body of 75-year-old Irene Kennedy was found in a wooded area of Bird Park in Walpole, Massachusetts. She had been savagely beaten, strangled, and stabbed multiple times. Her breasts were exposed, and the left breast bore a visible bite mark. Investigators from the Town of Walpole Police Department and the Massachusetts State Police were called to the scene after Kennedy's husband alerted a park caretaker to the body's presence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> According to police reports, Mr. Kennedy told investigators that he and his wife walked in the park almost daily, but that they took separate routes because an injury prevented him from walking as quickly as his wife. He stated that he had gone looking for his wife when she failed to meet him at their usual time in the parking lot that morning, and that he had discovered her body in an area of the park where he knew she sometimes stopped to urinate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon learning of Mrs. Kennedy's murder, one of the Kennedys' daughters, Nancy Tower, told Det. Bausch that he should speak to Edmund Burke, who lived on the street adjoining the parking lot where her parents routinely parked, and whose brother was married to another of the Kennedys' daughters. According to Det. Bausch's report, Tower told him that Burke was \"very odd.\" Trooper McDonald also reported that Tower told him \"that Eddie Burke is abusive to his mother\" and that Burke's mother had told Mrs. Kennedy so. Trooper McDonald's report continued, \"Ms. Tower stated that as a result of these conversations she felt that her mother was leery of Burke. Ms. Tower stated that subject Burke is unemployed and hangs around his house all day and seems very strange.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that morning, when Det. Bausch and another Walpole police officer visited Burke's home, where he lived with his 88-year-old mother, no one responded to their knocks or shouts. When they returned to the house a short time later, Burke's mother and brother were outside the house. According to Det. Bausch's report, Burke's mother told him Burke had been asleep when she left the house earlier that morning, and she seemed reluctant to wake him, but eventually agreed to do so. When Burke came outside, Det. Bausch informed him and his brother of Mrs. Kennedy's death. Burke then agreed to go to the police station to talk to investigators and left with his brother while Det. Bausch remained outside Burke's house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, investigators at the crime scene employed a K-9 tracking dog to follow any scents detected near the body. According to a report by the dog's handler, the dog was introduced to \"a pile of leaves [removed] from between the victim's legs\" and then proceeded through the woods and across a field towards the street on which Burke lived. From there, the handler recorded, \"we went to the right before the K-9 circled back to the left heading west. [The] K-9 ... traveled along the ... sidewalk past [Burke's house] for about fifteen to twenty feet. The K-9 circled back and traveled to the front door of [Burke's house]....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Det. Bausch saw the K-9 dog come out of the woods and ultimately stop at Burke's house. Det. Bausch then went to the police station, where he, Sgt. Shea, and Trooper McDonald questioned Burke. According to Sgt. Shea's report, Burke told the officers that he knew the Kennedys but not well, and he described their walking routine, which he knew because he usually saw them in the morning in the parking lot next to his house. Burke stated that he had been asleep at home at the time of the murder until the police arrived and his mother woke him up. Burke also stated that he had not visited the park for two years, intending the statement to mean that he had not gone to the park as a destination during that time. When Det. Bausch told Burke that a K-9 dog had apparently tracked a scent through the park to Burke's front door, Burke stated that he had taken a shortcut through the park late on the Sunday night before the Tuesday morning murder, along with two of his cats. The officers considered this statement to be inconsistent with Burke's earlier statement that he had not visited the park for two years. While at the station, Burke provided a saliva sample for DNA testing and comparison with any foreign DNA collected from the body. He also permitted police to take his jacket in order to test it for forensic evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the days after the murder, Det. Dolan interviewed potential witnesses who lived in the vicinity of Bird Park or who walked regularly in the park. He recorded statements by several people who reported seeing a person matching Burke's description in the general area of the park in which the body was found in the days before the murder and also in the driveway outside Burke's house on the morning of the murder when Burke said he had been asleep.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further examination of the victim's body by the Chief Medical Examiner's Office revealed a second bite mark on the other breast. Both bite marks were determined to have been made by a human. The bite marks were photographed and the bite mark on the left breast swabbed to collect DNA evidence from any traces of foreign saliva or skin. The swab from the victim's left breast and the sample of Burke's saliva were sent to the Maine State Police Crime Laboratory on December 4 for expedited DNA analysis because no such facility was yet in operation in Massachusetts. Two swatches from Burke's jacket were also sent to the Maine Crime Lab on December 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 3, Burke agreed to go to the police station so that Dr. Crowley, a forensic odontologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, could make a mold of his teeth for comparison with photographs of the bite marks on the victim's breasts. Upon Dr. Crowley's recommendation, the district attorney's office hired Dr. Lowell Levine, an experienced forensic odontologist based in Albany, New York, to examine the mold of Burke's teeth and compare it with the photographs of the bite marks. On December 6, Dr. Crowley, Det. Dolan, and Trooper Jennings traveled to Albany to bring the mold and the photographs to Dr. Levine for examination. Dr. Levine formed an initial opinion that Burke could not be excluded as the source of the bite marks, but stated that he would need to see enhanced photographs in order to render a final opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 9, Dr. Levine traveled to Boston to examine samples of the victim's clothing for bite marks and to instruct a photo laboratory employee on how to enlarge the photographs for better comparison with the mold of Burke's teeth. Dr. Levine then returned to Albany. Trooper McDonald and Sgt. Shea delivered the enlarged photographs to Dr. Levine in Albany late that same evening. Also on December 9, Theresa Calicchio, the forensic DNA chemist at the Maine Crime Lab who was assigned to perform the DNA analysis of Burke's saliva samples, the swatches from his jacket, and the samples taken from the victim's left breast, called Trooper McDonald to inform him that she had extracted DNA from the samples she had received and that she would call with results of the analysis the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime on the morning of December 10, after comparing the mold of Burke's teeth with the enlarged photographs of the bite marks, Dr. Levine told Trooper McDonald that Burke's teeth matched the bite mark on the victim's left breast to a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\" That same morning, at around 11:00 AM, Calicchio informed Trooper McDonald that the DNA analysis showed that Burke was excluded as the source of male DNA found in the bite mark on the victim's left breast.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to a report by Sgt. Shea, he and another MSP Trooper, Scott Jennings, received Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion from Trooper McDonald on December 10 \"at approximately 1315 hours\" (i.e., 1:15 PM). Sgt. Shea and Trooper Jennings then incorporated the bite mark opinion into an affidavit in support of a search warrant. Based on the facts recited in the search warrant affidavit, Det. Dolan prepared an application for a warrant for Burke's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 3:00 PM that afternoon, Burke was arrested at his home and brought to the police station in handcuffs. Det. Bausch, Sgt. Shea, Trooper Jennings, and Trooper McDonald, among other officers, were present during the arrest, although Troopers Jennings and McDonald testified at deposition that they were present only to conduct a search of Burke's home pursuant to the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Burke's arraignment the next day, December 11, Trooper McDonald called Sgt. Shea, who was at the courthouse, to tell him that the DNA analysis results excluded Burke as the source of the unidentified male DNA on the victim's left breast. Sgt. Shea alerted Assistant District Attorney (\"ADA\") Gerald Pudolsky mid-argument and pulled him away from the arraignment to tell him the new information. When Burke's arraignment resumed, ADA Pudolsky represented to the arraigning judge that DNA analysis had shown ambiguous results and that \"further testing\" was required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> He then sought Burke's detention without bail. Burke's attorney did not request Burke's immediate release on bail, and the arraigning judge ordered Burke held pending a bail hearing on December 29. On that date, Burke was granted release on bail to house arrest with electronic monitoring. His release was delayed, however, because his house could not immediately be equipped for monitoring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, while Burke was awaiting release on conditional bail, a comparison of a palm print found on the victim's body against a set of palm prints taken from Burke by court order a few days earlier revealed that Burke was not the source of the palm print on the victim's body. On January 19, the district attorney filed a <i>nolle prosequi</i> in the case on the ground that Burke's prosecution was premature. The next day, forty-one days after his arrest, Burke was released from custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just over one year after his arrest, on December 13, 1999, Burke filed a civil rights action in state court against the Town of Walpole, Dr. Levine, and various officers and supervisors of the Walpole Police Department in their individual and official capacities alleging, among other state and federal law claims, that the defendants had violated 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 by depriving him of his right under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to be free from arrest without probable cause. Burke also alleged that Chief Betro had defamed him by falsely attributing the murder to him in public. The defendants removed the case to federal court. On December 14, 2000, Burke filed a similar action in federal court against various MSP Troopers, employees of the Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner's Office, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Burke then filed an amended complaint to consolidate the two cases. In May 2001 Burke amended his complaint to add claims of negligence against the Commonwealth. Burke was permitted to amend his complaint again on February 19, 2002 to join Dr. Crowley as a defendant. On July 16, 2002, Burke moved to amend his complaint a fourth time to join Robert Martin, a chemist at the Massachusetts Crime Lab, as a defendant, but the motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2003, all defendants except Dr. Crowley moved for summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In October 2003 a magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment to all defendants on all claims in three comprehensive reports and recommendations. <i>See Burke v.

Det. Dolan testified at deposition that he prepared an application for an arrest warrant at the request of the District Attorney, including a summary of the facts establishing probable cause based on information provided by other investigating officers, and that he submitted the application to a magistrate. At his deposition, Det. Dolan identified as the text of his probable cause summary a six-paragraph excerpt from a computer printout containing numerous reports allegedly produced by Walpole officers during the murder investigation. Det. Dolan also identified a longer version of the summary of the evidence that he drafted, but which the District Attorney requested that he shorten for submission with the warrant application. Burke insists that a jury could infer that the probable cause summaries in the computer print-out were created only after Burke's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the unsigned copy of the arrest warrant and Det. Dolan's summary of facts establishing probable cause, the police defendants have produced a copy of the application for a criminal complaint signed by Det. Dolan, on which the box marked \"Warrant\" has been checked and initialed by a magistrate; a copy of a summons and a complaint signed by the same magistrate, on each of which the box for entry of \"RETURN DATE AND TIME\" contains the word \"warrant\"; and a computer printout of Burke's criminal docket (stored in the Warrant Management System database and retrieved through the Criminal Justice Information System) showing a return of warrant at around 4:00 PM on December 10. Finally, the police defendants have produced a search warrant, obtained by Trooper Jennings, dated December 10 and signed by the same magistrate judge who signed and initialed the criminal complaint. The search warrant is accompanied by a six-page affidavit including a much more detailed summary of the facts allegedly establishing probable cause than the summary Det. Dolan testified that he provided in support of the arrest warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the defendants have produced substantial, though imperfect, evidence that a valid arrest warrant issued upon a neutral magistrate's review of facts allegedly establishing probable cause. By contrast, Burke has adduced no evidence demonstrating that no warrant was issued apart from his own affidavit stating that he never saw a warrant. There is no requirement, either under the Constitution or under Massachusetts law, that a copy of the arrest warrant automatically be given to the person arrested at the time of the arrest. Burke's sworn statement, standing alone in the face of the defendants' submissions, cannot bear the evidentiary weight Burke seeks to give it. Because there is no genuine dispute regarding the question whether a valid arrest warrant was issued, the record fails to support Burke's allegation that he was deprived of his constitutional right to be arrested at home only upon issuance of a warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

Burke argues that the inculpatory bite mark evidence could not rationally co-exist with the exculpatory DNA evidence in his case. Given the greater certainty of the DNA analysis results, he argues, the inclusion of those results in the warrant application would have eliminated probable cause. Moreover, Burke argues, because the exculpatory DNA evidence was \"critical to the probable cause determination,\" <i>Golino,</i> 950 F.2d at 871, a reasonable jury could infer that its omission from the warrant application submitted to the magistrate was made with deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine Crime Lab chemist Calicchio's uncontroverted deposition testimony was that DNA analysis may exclude a person as a source of DNA with virtual certainty: \"We like to say an exclusion is absolute.\" In a report dated December 12, Calicchio memorialized the DNA results she had communicated by telephone to Trooper McDonald:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A mixture of male and female DNA profiles was obtained from the breast swabbings (Items # 1A and 1B).

Burke alleges that at least one officer central to the investigation, Trooper McDonald, knew that DNA analysis had conclusively excluded him as the source of the saliva in the bite mark and, consequently, as the murderer, as early as four hours prior to Burke's arrest, and two hours before any warrant applications were prepared. Calicchio's contemporaneous notes show that Trooper McDonald called her at 11:00 AM on December 10 to find out the DNA analysis results.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> About two hours later, at 1:15 PM, Trooper McDonald communicated Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion, but not the DNA results, to Sgt.

Accordingly, for purposes of the summary judgment analysis, and in answer to the first question of the qualified immunity inquiry, Burke has proffered evidence sufficient to support a finding that he was arrested without probable cause in violation of his Fourth Amendment right. <i>See Limone,</i> 372 F.3d at 44 (first question in qualified immunity analysis is \"whether the plaintiff's allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation\").

Uniquely among the defendant police officers, Trooper McDonald argues that he had no constitutional duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to anyone because he was neither an affiant for the arrest warrant nor technically an arresting officer (merely a searching officer).

Trooper McDonald's deposition testimony reveals that he relayed Dr. Levine's inculpatory bite mark opinion to Trooper Jennings and Sgt.

In his affidavit, Dr. Levine stated that he told police investigators on December 10, 1998 that he \"could not rule out Mr. Burke\" as a source of the bite marks. At their depositions, Chief Betro and Trooper McDonald indicated that they viewed this affidavit as effectively disavowing the opinion that Dr. Levine had rendered for them with a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" prior to Burke's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 7, 2000, Dr. Levine supplemented his affidavit of March 16, 2000 to clarify that on December 10, 1998, \"I could not rule out Mr. Burke as a suspect. Both of the two bite marks on [the victim's] body were consistent with his dentition. One of the bite marks was consistent with his dentition to a high level of probability, or a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\" Dr. Levine thus does not deny that he rendered his opinion on December 10, 1998 about the bite mark on the victim's left breast with a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\" At the same time, there is a significant difference between opining to a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" that Burke's teeth matched one of the bite marks and simply opining that \"I could not rule out Mr. Burke as a suspect,\" both of which statements are included in Dr. Levine's July 7, 2000 affidavit. Dr. Levine maintains that the opinion he communicated to police on December 10, 1998 to a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" before Burke's arrest was and remains accurate. At his deposition, Dr. Levine demonstrated his bite mark analysis methodology by comparing the mold of Burke's teeth with the enlarged photographs and testified that he adhered to his original opinion that Burke's teeth matched the bite mark on the victim's left breast to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, Burke asserts that Dr. Levine used the phrase \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" when, as revealed by the clarifying affidavit of July 7, 2000, he in fact meant a \"high level of probability.\" Burke argues that Dr. Levine's misuse of terminology exhibited reckless disregard for his obligation to communicate his actual level of certainty about the bite mark match. \"`Reasonable degree of scientific certainty' is a plastic phrase.\" <i>Buie v. McAdory,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783331\"><a href=\"/opinion/783331/joel-buie-v-eugene-mcadory-warden-menard-correctional-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span>, 625 (7th Cir.2003). That fact is evident from Dr. Levine's attempts to explain the meaning he assigns to the term. At his deposition, Dr. Levine testified that he uses \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" to mean \"high degree of probability,\" a higher standard than \"could not rule out as a suspect.\" Dr. Levine's explanation of his terminology comports with the non-binding \"Bite-Mark Terminology Guidelines\" of the American Board of Forensic Odontologists (\"ABFO\"), of which Dr. Levine is a founding diplomate and member, which equate the related terms \"reasonable medical certainty\" and \"high degree of certainty.\" As Burke points out, however, the guidelines further define both terms to mean \"virtual certainty; no reasonable or practical possibility that someone else did it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> By using the term \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty,\" Burke reasons, Dr. Levine communicated a higher degree of certainty (\"virtual certainty,\" according to a passage in the ABFO guidelines) than he actually felt (only that he \"could not rule out Mr. Burke as a suspect,\" according to his March 16, 2000 affidavit). At his deposition, Dr. Levine \"clarified\" that while he uses \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" and \"high degree of probability\" interchangeably, his left breast bite mark opinion never met the high standard of the ABFO guidelines' definition of \"reasonable medical certainty\" &#8212; namely, that there was \"no reasonable or practical possibility that someone else\" other than Burke made the bite mark on the victim's left breast.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not determine whether Dr. Levine's terminology or the terminology recommended by the ABFO guidelines is correct. Neither the ABFO guidelines' definition nor Dr. Levine's alternate term, \"high degree of probability,\" appears in Det. Dolan's summary of probable cause in the arrest warrant application. The summary merely states that Dr. Levine \"determined with reasonable scientific certainty that [the bite marks] were made by Edmund Burke.\" In the absence of any indication to the contrary, we must assume that the magistrate who issued the arrest warrant assigned no more than the commonly accepted meaning among lawyers and judges to the term \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" &#8212; \"a standard requiring a showing that the injury was more likely than not caused by a particular stimulus, based on the general consensus of recognized [scientific] thought.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1294 (8th ed.2004) (defining \"reasonable medical probability,\" or \"reasonable medical certainty,\" as used in tort actions). That standard, of course, is fully consistent with the probable cause standard. <i>See Roche,</i> 81 F.3d at 254 (\"By definition, the determination [of probable cause] does not require scientific certainty.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Burke relies on the affidavit of his own chosen expert, Dr. Souviron, which states that bite mark evidence alone cannot be used to \"positively identify a possible perpetrator to the exclusion of all others within a significant population.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> The record does not support the inference that Dr. Levine communicated, or risked communicating, that Burke was the source of the bite mark \"to the exclusion of all others within a significant population.\" Rather, he opined that Burke's teeth matched the bite mark to a \"reasonable degree of scientific certainty\" without specifying the number of individuals who could have made the same bite mark. Dr. Souviron was unable to render his own independent opinion comparing the mold of Burke's teeth to the photographs of the bite mark because, he explained, \"[b]ased on my knowledge and expertise, I concluded that the photographs I was provided with were not the photographs that were used originally to make the evaluation of this case.... I would need the particular photographs in order to be able to perform any in-depth identification.\" Burke points out that copies of the enlarged photographs were not made available to him during discovery through no fault of his own. But even a contrary expert opinion from Dr. Souviron based on the exact same materials used by Dr. Levine would not necessarily shed any light on how Dr. Levine performed his own analysis and arrived at his own conclusions at the time he rendered his bite mark opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Burke, we conclude that the record reveals no support for an inference that Dr. Levine's methodology or judgment were so clearly flawed that he should have harbored serious doubts about the reliability of his resulting opinion. Because Burke has failed to generate a genuine dispute on the threshold question of whether Dr. Levine violated his Fourth Amendment rights by rendering his bite mark opinion with deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth, Dr. Levine is entitled to summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Dr. Crowley</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke alleges that Dr. Crowley also intentionally fabricated or recklessly exaggerated an inculpatory bite mark opinion in support of probable cause. Burke highlights Dr. Crowley's deposition testimony that although she was professionally interested in the field of bite mark analysis and regarded Dr. Levine as a mentor, she was trained only as a dentist and had no experience in bite mark analysis. Rather, her experience as a forensic odontologist was limited to identifying human remains through comparison with dental records. Burke maintains that any bite mark opinion Dr. Crowley rendered would have reflected at a minimum her reckless disregard for the truth because she knew she was not qualified to perform such an analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Crowley insists that she never formed a bite mark opinion in support of probable cause. At deposition, Dr. Crowley testified that while she examined the mold of Burke's teeth and the bite mark on the victim, she did not make any comparisons: \"I never concluded that there was a match. I made some observations.\" She also stated that she made transparencies and impressions of Burke's teeth and the bite mark, but that she used these materials only as learning tools. In short, Dr. Crowley testified that her role in the investigation was limited to that of collecting and preserving the bite mark evidence, including making the mold of Burke's teeth, a task that dentists routinely perform.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke counters that Dr. Crowley did render a bite mark opinion in support of probable cause. He points to the deposition testimony of Dr. Levine and Lt. Kenneth Martin, an investigator with MSP Crime Scene Services, indicating that Dr. Crowley agreed with Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion. Dr. Levine testified that he was surprised to find out that Dr. Crowley had no experience in bite mark analysis, and that he had the impression that she shared his initial opinion formed in Albany on December 6 as well as his observations made at the Medical Examiner's Office in Boston on December 9.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> Lt. Martin testified at deposition that he believed Dr. Crowley would be the primary person testifying about the bite mark evidence at a criminal trial and that Dr. Levine would be consulted to give a second opinion. He further stated that he knew Dr. Crowley had never testified at a trial about bite mark analysis, but that he had no reason to think she was not qualified to do so, given her examination of the actual bite mark and the unenhanced photographs,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> his understanding that \"she had had previous training under Lowell Levine who is recognized as a forensic odontologist,\" and her job qualifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Burke, the record fails to support Burke's allegation that Dr. Crowley actually communicated a bite mark opinion to the police investigators for use in Det. Dolan's arrest warrant application. Nor does the record indicate that the police investigators sought or relied upon Dr. Crowley's opinion after Dr. Levine became involved in the investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were required to take a different view of the evidence (and we are not), Dr. Crowley's communication of a bite mark opinion, without more, would not amount to reckless exaggeration, much less intentional fabrication, of bite mark evidence. Dr. Crowley herself advised the District Attorney to hire Dr. Levine as an expert. Given her knowledge of Dr. Levine's credentials, as well as her own, albeit limited, knowledge of forensic odontology, no rational jury could find that an opinion from Dr. Crowley merely concurring in Dr. Levine's bite mark opinion would be based on such dubious premises that it would manifest reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Burke has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact on the initial question of whether Dr. Crowley deprived him of his Fourth Amendment right, Dr. Crowley is entitled to summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. DEFAMATION CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke alleges that Walpole Police Chief Betro defamed him by falsely and publicly attributing Kennedy's murder to him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> According to the deposition testimony of a reporter for the <i>Daily Transcript,</i> a regional newspaper, Chief Betro made an appearance in his official capacity at a public meeting organized by the East Walpole Civic Association on or about January 13, 1999, after the exculpatory DNA results became public and while Burke was awaiting release to house arrest. Approximately two dozen citizens, fearful that the murderer was still at large, attended the meeting. The <i>Boston Herald,</i> relying on an article in the <i>Daily Transcript,</i> reported on January 25, 1999 that Chief Betro assured the audience, \"I can tell you we've got the right man.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Betro then advanced a theory to explain how Burke could be the killer despite having been excluded as a source of the foreign DNA found in the bite mark on the victim's breast. According to the <i>Boston Herald,</i> again relying on the <i>Daily Transcript,</i>\"[Chief] Betro ... told the crowd that an orange juice container was found about 40 feet from Kennedy's body, and it was possible Burke drank the orange juice and washed away any DNA samples in his mouth.\" The <i>Boston Globe,</i> which reported Chief Betro's remarks on January 22, 1999, stated, \"[i]n the highly complex world of DNA testing, the idea that the results could be manipulated by juice is not reasonable, according to several scientists at laboratories who conduct the tests.\" The <i>Globe</i> article went on to state that \"[t]he deputy laboratory director for Cellmark Diagnostics in Maryland, perhaps the best known private DNA testing laboratory in the country, dismissed the possibility.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chief Betro argues that his statements at the meeting of concerned citizens are absolutely privileged and cannot form the basis for a defamation suit because they were made during the course of a criminal investigation.
