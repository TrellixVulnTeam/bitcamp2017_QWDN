Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Boudin, Lipez and Howard,\n\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Raymond Mansolillo with whom Law Office of Raymond Mansolillo\nwas on brief for appellant.\n     Jack W. Pirozzolo, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          January 22, 2009\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.        Between around August 1997 and\n\nJune 2005, Ronald Evano and his wife engaged in a series of frauds\n\nby intentionally ingesting glass and then claiming that it came\n\nfrom food sold by various restaurants, supermarkets and hotels. To\n\navoid detection, they used fictitious identifications and submitted\n\nfalse insurance claims in several different states.           Evano and his\n\nwife bilked insurers of over $200,000 and incurred over $100,000 in\n\nunpaid medical bills.\n\n            On March 16, 2006, the government charged Evano in a 33-\n\ncount    indictment   alleging    various    forms   of   fraud   and   false\n\nstatements.1    Evano pled guilty to 20 counts and was sentenced to\n\n63   months    imprisonment,     along    with   supervised   release    and\n\nrestitution requirements. This appeal is concerned with challenges\n\nto the district court's sentencing, which was based on a guideline\n\nrange of 51-63 months, calculated using a total offense level of 22\n\nand a criminal history category (CHC) of III.\n\n            The calculation began with an initial base offense level\n\nof 7, which was increased as follows: 12 levels for a loss amount\n\nbetween $200,000 and $400,000, U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(G) (2005); 2\n\nlevels because the offense involved between 10 and 50 victims, id.\n\n§ 2B1.1(b)(2)(A); 2 levels based on use of sophisticated means, id.\n\n\n     1\n      Evano was indicted and charged with mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. §\n1341 (2000); wire fraud, id. § 1343; identity fraud, id. §\n1028(a)(7); social security fraud, 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B) §\n(C)(2000); conspiracy to defraud the United States, id. § 371; and\nfalse statements relating to health care matters, id. § 1035(a).\n\n                                    -2-\n\f§ 2B1.1(b)(9)(C); and 2 levels based on identity theft, id. §\n\n2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(ii).     The resulting sum was then reduced 3 levels\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility, id. § 3E1.1.\n\n             On appeal, Evano challenges the sophisticated means and\n\nidentity theft enhancements, as well as his category III criminal\n\nhistory designation.      We review de novo the district court’s\n\nreading of guideline provisions, United States v. Stoupis, 530 F.3d\n\n82, 84 (1st Cir. 2008), and underlying factual findings for clear\n\nerror, id.    Deference may be accorded, depending on circumstances,\n\nto application of general standards to particular facts.      United\n\nStates v. Duclos, 214 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             Evano received the two-level identity theft enhancement\n\nfor “possession of five or more means of identification that\n\nunlawfully were produced from, or obtained by the use of, another\n\nmeans of identification.”       USSG § 2B1.1(b)(10)(c)(ii).    Evano\n\nclaims that the enhancement was inapplicable because he did not use\n\nfalse information to create or obtain other documents.      However,\n\nthe pre-sentence report shows that Evano used the social security\n\nnumbers of at least eight individuals in order to obtain documents\n\nsuch as driver's licenses and Social Security cards.     On multiple\n\noccasions, Evano used a social security number that was not his own\n\nto secure a Massachusetts driver's license.\n\n             Relying on United States v. Godin, 534 F.3d 51 (1st Cir.\n\n2008), Evano also argues that the government failed to prove that\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fhe knew the false ID information was of an actual person.    Godin\n\nheld that the federal aggravated identity theft statute, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1028A(a)(1) (2006), requires that the defendant knew that the\n\nfalse information belonged to a real person.   The government says\n\nthat the sentencing enhancement does not require such knowledge:\n\nthat it is enough that he used the \"means of identification.\"   The\n\ngovernment is correct that Godin does not apply here.\n\n          The federal statute at issue in Godin makes it criminal\n\nfor one who, “during and in relation to” a felony, “knowingly\n\ntransfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of\n\nidentification of another person.”      18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1).\n\nGodin, applying the rule of lenity, read “knowingly” to apply to\n\n“of another person,” thus requiring that the defendant know that\n\nidentification information pertains to an actual person.   534 F.3d\n\nat 61.   By contrast, the enhancement at issue here requires only\n\n\"possession of five or more means of identification that unlawfully\n\nwere produced from, or obtained by the use of, another means of\n\nidentification.”   The enhancement provision--unlike the statute--\n\ndoes not use the word \"knowingly.\"\n\n          Sentencing enhancements often apply even without a strong\n\nmens rea requirement. United States v. Figuereo, 404 F.3d 537, 541\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); United States v. Lavender, 224 F.3d 939, 941 (9th\n\nCir. 2000).   Here, the \"legislative history\" of the enhancement,\n\nadopted pursuant to a statutory directive, bears out this reading.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fAs the Sentencing Commission explained, the guideline sought to\n\naddress Congress’ concern with the harm suffered by the victims\n\nrather than the mens rea of the defendant.          U.S.S.G. Supplement to\n\nAppendix C, Amendment 596 (statute instructed the Commission to\n\nconsider the number of victims, harm to their reputations, and\n\ninconvenience produced by the theft of their identities).\n\n            Indeed, in construing an adjacent subsection of the same\n\nidentity theft provision, U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(9)(C)(i) (enhancement\n\n“[i]f the offense involved . . . the unauthorized transfer or use\n\nof any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any\n\nother means of identification”), the Seventh Circuit held that the\n\nprovision   does   not    require    that   one   know   that   the   means   of\n\nidentification relates to a real person.           United States v. Cisse,\n\n103 Fed. Appx. 27, 29-30 (7th Cir. 2004) (unpublished opinion)\n\n(saying “[i]t is not unforeseeable or even unlikely that a made-up\n\nsocial security number will turn out to belong to a real person\").\n\n            Evano also challenges the district court’s two-level\n\nenhancement    for       “use   of    sophisticated       means,”     USSG     §\n\n2B1.1(b)(9)(c).      He contends that use of false identification is\n\nnot a “sophisticated” means of carrying out a fraud but rather\n\nquite typical, and therefore already punished by the sentence\n\ndictated by the statute and guidelines base offense level. But the\n\ndistrict judge imposed the sophisticated means enhancement not\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fsimply because Evano used false IDs and documents but because he\n\nundertook elaborate efforts to conceal his scheme.\n\n            The district court's reading of the guideline was sound\n\nand   its     application   reasonable.      The   commentary,   USSG\n\n2B1.1(b)(9)(C), cmt. n.8(B), instructs that\n\n      [f]or purposes of subsection (b)(9)(C), \"'sophisticated\n      means'\" means especially complex or especially intricate\n      offense   conduct  pertaining   to   the   execution  or\n      concealment   of  an   offense.   For   example,   in  a\n      telemarketing scheme, locating the main office of the\n      scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting\n      operations in another jurisdiction ordinarily indicates\n      sophisticated means.\n\nThe scheme may be sophisticated even if the individual elements\n\ntaken alone are not. United States v. Jackson, 346 F.3d 22, 25 (2nd\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n            Here, the Evanos targeted multiple restaurants, hotels,\n\nsupermarkets, hospitals, doctors and insurance companies in several\n\ndifferent regions, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maryland,\n\nVirginia and the District of Columbia.    They used fictitious names,\n\nfake identifications such as false social security numbers, and most\n\nimportantly, they actually ingested glass particles.    All this was\n\nenough to make their scheme more effective and difficult to thwart,\n\nand it is enough to justify the enhancement.\n\n            Finally, Evano does not dispute that his offenses were\n\nscored correctly under the guidelines and formally place him in\n\ncriminal history category III; but he argues that this assessment\n\noverstates the seriousness of his criminal past.    He says that none\n\n                                 -6-\n\fof his prior convictions involved violent crimes or drug offenses.\n\nRather, they involved motor vehicle violations, one DUI, larceny,\n\ntheft and shoplifting.\n\n            Whether    this   attack    is   permitted    might   be   debated.\n\nInsofar as Evano is claiming that the district judge should have\n\n\"departed\" from the guideline's category III designation,                   the\n\ndistrict    court's    decision   is   unreviewable      unless   based   on   a\n\nmisapprehension by the judge of his own authority, United States v.\n\nRichardson, 515 F.3d 74, 86 (1st Cir. 2008), and of this there is\n\nno evidence.     To the extent the claim is framed as a post-Booker\n\nchallenge   to   the   overall    reasonableness    of    the   sentence,   the\n\ndistrict court's explanation as to criminal history is reasonable:\n\n            My sense is that the criminal history is,\n            indeed, long and I think, on the other hand,\n            the nature of the offenses is not the sort\n            that we see in the gun and drug cases. There\n            is no violence. There is no life-endangering\n            activity.    It’s mostly driving without a\n            license, shoplifting, disorderly conduct, and\n            the like.\n\n            On the other hand, it is, as I said before,\n            relentless, and by virtue of the fact that it\n            is relentless, Mr. Evano is a danger to the\n            society. He simply does not respect the rules\n            under which we work.\n\n            Nonetheless, I think that the Criminal History\n            Category 3 properly reflects both the length\n            and the nature of the offenses and will,\n            therefore, agree with the probation report\n            that Criminal History Category 3 is the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f             correct one, and will go neither up nor down\n             on the Criminal History Category.2\n\n             It is not drugs and violence alone that mark out someone\n\nas habitually criminal.       The present scheme, although treated as a\n\ncontinuing    pattern    of   fraud,   endured   over   a   long   period;   it\n\ndoubtless caused much trouble and disruption; and even probation\n\nstatus did not deter Evano from halting his criminal conduct. There\n\nis nothing in the district court's assessment that is unreasonable.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The sentencing judge’s final remark is in respect to a\nrequest by the government to depart upward to a CHC IV.\n\n                                       -8-\n\f",

Appx. 27, 29-30 (7th Cir. 2004) (unpublished opinion)\n\n(saying “[i]t is not unforeseeable or even unlikely that a made-up\n\nsocial security number will turn out to belong to a real person\").\n\n            Evano also challenges the district court’s two-level\n\nenhancement    for       “use   of    sophisticated       means,”     USSG     §\n\n2B1.1(b)(9)(c).      He contends that use of false identification is\n\nnot a “sophisticated” means of carrying out a fraud but rather\n\nquite typical, and therefore already punished by the sentence\n\ndictated by the statute and guidelines base offense level. But the\n\ndistrict judge imposed the sophisticated means enhancement not\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fsimply because Evano used false IDs and documents but because he\n\nundertook elaborate efforts to conceal his scheme.\n\n            The district court's reading of the guideline was sound\n\nand   its     application   reasonable.      The   commentary,   USSG\n\n2B1.1(b)(9)(C), cmt. n.8(B), instructs that\n\n      [f]or purposes of subsection (b)(9)(C), \"'sophisticated\n      means'\" means especially complex or especially intricate\n      offense   conduct  pertaining   to   the   execution  or\n      concealment   of  an   offense.   For   example,   in  a\n      telemarketing scheme, locating the main office of the\n      scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting\n      operations in another jurisdiction ordinarily indicates\n      sophisticated means.\n\nThe scheme may be sophisticated even if the individual elements\n\ntaken alone are not. United States v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783805\"><a href=\"/opinion/783805/united-states-v-james-rinaldo-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (2nd\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n            Here, the Evanos targeted multiple restaurants, hotels,\n\nsupermarkets, hospitals, doctors and insurance companies in several\n\ndifferent regions, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maryland,\n\nVirginia and the District of Columbia.    They used fictitious names,\n\nfake identifications such as false social security numbers, and most\n\nimportantly, they actually ingested glass particles.    All this was\n\nenough to make their scheme more effective and difficult to thwart,\n\nand it is enough to justify the enhancement.\n\n            Finally, Evano does not dispute that his offenses were\n\nscored correctly under the guidelines and formally place him in\n\ncriminal history category III; but he argues that this assessment\n\noverstates the seriousness of his criminal past.    He says that none\n\n                                 -6-\n\fof his prior convictions involved violent crimes or drug offenses.\n\nRather, they involved motor vehicle violations, one DUI, larceny,\n\ntheft and shoplifting.\n\n            Whether    this   attack    is   permitted    might   be   debated.\n\nInsofar as Evano is claiming that the district judge should have\n\n\"departed\" from the guideline's category III designation,                   the\n\ndistrict    court's    decision   is   unreviewable      unless   based   on   a\n\nmisapprehension by the judge of his own authority, United States v.\n\nRichardson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203173\"><a href=\"/opinion/203173/united-states-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86 (1st Cir. 2008), and of this there is\n\nno evidence.     To the extent the claim is framed as a post-Booker\n\nchallenge   to   the   overall    reasonableness    of    the   sentence,   the\n\ndistrict court's explanation as to criminal history is reasonable:\n\n            My sense is that the criminal history is,\n            indeed, long and I think, on the other hand,\n            the nature of the offenses is not the sort\n            that we see in the gun and drug cases. There\n            is no violence. There is no life-endangering\n            activity.    It’s mostly driving without a\n            license, shoplifting, disorderly conduct, and\n            the like.\n\n            On the other hand, it is, as I said before,\n            relentless, and by virtue of the fact that it\n            is relentless, Mr. Evano is a danger to the\n            society. He simply does not respect the rules\n            under which we work.\n\n            Nonetheless, I think that the Criminal History\n            Category 3 properly reflects both the length\n            and the nature of the offenses and will,\n            therefore, agree with the probation report\n            that Criminal History Category 3 is the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f             correct one, and will go neither up nor down\n             on the Criminal History Category.2\n\n             It is not drugs and violence alone that mark out someone\n\nas habitually criminal.       The present scheme, although treated as a\n\ncontinuing    pattern    of   fraud,   endured   over   a   long   period;   it\n\ndoubtless caused much trouble and disruption; and even probation\n\nstatus did not deter Evano from halting his criminal conduct. There\n\nis nothing in the district court's assessment that is unreasonable.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The sentencing judge’s final remark is in respect to a\nrequest by the government to depart upward to a CHC IV.\n\n                                       -8-\n\f</pre>",
