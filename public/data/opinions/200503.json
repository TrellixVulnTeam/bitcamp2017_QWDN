Plaintiffs instituted\n\nthis action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress an array of alleged\n\nviolations    of    their   civil   rights   arising    from   an   arrest   for\n\nshoplifting.       Five years later, the district court dismissed the\n\ncase for lack of prosecution under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), a\n\nsanction Plaintiffs here challenge.             Because the record fully\n\njustifies dismissal, we conclude the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion.\n\n     After the complaint was filed on December 30, 1997, the docket\n\nsheet reveals a series of motions triggering various orders then\n\nissued by United States District Judge Salvador E. Casellas.                  On\n\nSeptember 30, 1999, Judge Casellas partially granted a motion to\n\ndismiss, eliminating certain defendants and substantive claims.\n\nSix months later, the district court permitted an extension of time\n\nto complete discovery and “admonished” the parties that “no further\n\nextensions will be granted.”1          On August 10, 2000, the case was\n\n\n     1\n      The March 7, 2000 order implicitly overlooked a pattern of\ndelays.    The district court chronicled a July 6, 1998 case\nmanagement order setting a deadline of February 11, 1999 to\ncomplete discovery, and the untimely response to its January 5,\n2000 order for a joint proposed pre-trial order.         The court\nobserved,\n     All of the above has caused undue delays and prejudice to\n     the Court. The Parties are instructed to be diligent in\n     conducting discovery in this case.         The discovery\n     deadline [February 11, 1999] is hereby extended as\n     requested until June 30, 2000. However, all discovery\n     must be finished by then.      The Court admonishes the\n     parties that no further extensions will be granted\n     regarding this issue.\n                                                     (continued...)\n\n                                      -2-\n\ftransferred to United States District Judge Jay A. Garcia-Gregory.\n\nOn January 4, 2001, Judge Garcia-Gregory ordered the parties to\n\nanswer a questionnaire within 15 days. Plaintiffs did not respond.\n\n        On July 2, 2002, the district court ordered Plaintiffs to show\n\ncause why the case should not be dismissed for want of prosecution,\n\nnoting the absence of any docket entries from them since July 31,\n\n2000.     The court set a July 9, 2002 deadline.            Plaintiffs filed a\n\nresponse on July 10, 2002, one day late.\n\n        In its July 11, 2002 order, the district court predicated\n\ndismissal on Rule 41(b), which warrants the sanction “[f]or failure\n\nof the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any\n\norder of court,” and cited First Circuit precedent upholding such\n\ndismissals for “extremely protracted inaction (measured in years),\n\ndisobedience     of     court      orders,     ignorance    of   warnings,   or\n\ncontumacious conduct.” See, e.g., Benjamin v. Aroostook Med. Ctr.,\n\nInc.,    57   F.3d    101,   108    (1st     1995).   The    court   documented\n\nPlaintiffs’ extended inactivity, noted it was neither explained nor\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      (...continued)\n(emphasis added).    Despite this warning, Plaintiffs’ inactivity\ncontinued.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fexcused in their untimely response,2 and sua sponte dismissed the\n\ncase in its entirety.\n\n     Plaintiffs   now   contend   the   district   court   abused   its\n\ndiscretion, characterizing the dismissal as drastic and draconian,\n\na harsh alternative when the case had “progressed along” and\n\nappropriate alternatives like warnings or economic sanctions were\n\navailable.   They rely on Chamorro v. Puerto Rican Cars, Inc., 304\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002), which instructed a reviewing court to\n\n“balance the trial court’s authority to impose such a sanction\n\nagainst the obvious policy considerations that favor disposition of\n\ncases on the merits.”    According to Plaintiffs, that balancing,\n\ntipped by the presence of certain Plaintiffs, who are minors\n\n“entitled to special attention by the State,” demands a remand “for\n\ncontinuation of the proceedings a quo.”\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The   district    court   rejected   Plaintiffs’    proffered\nexplanation: counsel was out of the jurisdiction when the order to\nshow cause arrived, excusing his filing a day late; the case\nstalled after it was referred to a “newly appointed judge;” “due to\nan interruption in the proceedings of the bankruptcy case of co-\nplaintiffs Juan Carlos Arias and Josefina Laura Gonzalez, no action\nwas taken;” counsel for several defendants and the attorney for the\nCommonwealth Department of Justice resigned, precipitating a delay\nwhile a replacement was selected; and counsel “lost adequate track\nof the present case, due to other professional taks [sic].” The\ndistrict court also noted Plaintiffs’ proposed pre-trial order,\nfiled on July 31, 2000, was actually filed by defendant Amigo\nSupermarket to comply with the court’s order to file a joint\nproposed pre-trial order.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f     The record defies Plaintiffs’ gloss. Indeed, Chamorro demands\n\nwe reject it.    There, under similar though less egregious facts,3\n\nwe catalogued the “protracted foot-dragging to defiance of court\n\norders to ignoring warnings,” id., all present in this case, and\n\nconcluded the justifications, rationalizations, and pleas for “a\n\nsympathetic ear to the importunings of those who claim that a trial\n\njudge abused his [] discretion by dismissing a case for want of\n\nprosecution,” were outweighed by the court’s authority to impose\n\nthe sanction.     Id. at 6.    The “bedrock” for that conclusion\n\npersists: “the effective administration of justice requires that\n\ntrial courts possess the capability to manage their own affairs.”\n\nId. (citing Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43 (1991)).\n\n     Because the record here also reflects a virtual absence of\n\nprosecution and Plaintiffs’ flagrant disregard of court orders, the\n\ndistrict court properly exercised its discretion under Rule 41(b).\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      In Chamorro, plaintiff filed an employment discrimination\naction on October 8, 1999. Chamorro v. Puerto Rican Cars, Inc.,\n304 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2002). After a year of inactivity, the court\ninstructed the parties to explain how they intended to proceed in\ndiligently prosecuting the case. Plaintiff ignored the order, and\nthe district court dismissed the action with prejudice under Rule\n41(b) on October 18, 2001. We held the dismissal was not an abuse\nof discretion. Comparing the two cases in time span alone, the\nfive years of inactivity here dwarfs the two years of Chamorro’s\ndallying.\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
