Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n               Selya, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\f     Jean Philip Gauthier for Jaime Pinillos-Prieto.\n     Stephen J.

These appeals stem from a multi-\n\ndefendant    drug    conspiracy      trial    involving   a   \"reverse    sting\"\n\noperation.    Appellants were convicted of conspiring and attempting\n\nto possess, with intent to distribute, five or more kilograms of\n\ncocaine. They challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\n\ntheir   convictions,     the    admission     of   certain    testimony   by    an\n\nundercover    agent,   and     the   jury    instructions.      We   affirm    the\n\nconvictions.\n\n            The government cross-appeals from the district court's\n\ndenial of a mandatory life sentence for Rodriguez under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A).       However, we need not decide the correctness of\n\nthat decision.      In light of United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005), and without opposition from the government, we vacate all\n\nof the defendants' sentences and remand for re-sentencing under\n\nadvisory sentencing guidelines.\n\n                                       I.\n\nA.          Factual background\n\n            We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict.     United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 2004), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 1620 (2005).                Nelson \"Rafa\"\n\nRodríguez, an experienced government informant of Colombian origin,\n\nfirst met defendant-appellant Jaime Pinillos-Prieto (\"Pinillos\") in\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fColombia in early 2001.     In this meeting, Rafa1 represented himself\n\nas a drug trafficker.     Pinillos, in turn, represented himself as a\n\nfacilitator of sorts who had access to potential cocaine buyers in\n\nthe United States and the ability to launder drug money by using it\n\nto   buy   computers,   which   could   then    be   imported   legally   into\n\nColombia and sold.\n\n            In July 2001, Pinillos telephoned Rafa (who was in Puerto\n\nRico at the time) from Miami and said that he had a customer to buy\n\n100 kilograms (kilos) of cocaine.              Rafa asked Pinillos if the\n\ncustomer had the money -- approximately $1.4 million, since the\n\ngoing rate was about $13,500 per kilo. Pinillos confirmed that the\n\nbuyer had the money.       During this telephone call, as in other\n\ncommunications, Rafa and Pinillos did not use the terms \"cocaine\"\n\nor \"kilos,\" but rather the terms \"laptops\" and \"computers,\" which,\n\nRafa later testified, were code words designed to obscure their\n\nconversation in case law enforcement officers overheard them.\n\n            Rafa contacted his case agent at the Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration, who authorized him to proceed with a \"reverse\n\nsting\" operation. In a classic sting, government agents attempt to\n\nbuy drugs from persons suspected of being drug sellers.                   In a\n\nreverse sting, government agents offer to sell drugs to persons\n\nsuspected of being drug buyers.\n\n\n      1\n      We refer to Rafa by alias mainly to avoid confusion with\nappellant Rodriguez-Zamot, but also because all witnesses so\nreferred to him at trial.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f          In this reverse sting, Rafa would be part of a three-\n\nperson team of \"sellers,\" and would serve as the negotiator and\n\nprincipal liaison to the buyers.      Nataya \"Princesa\" Posada, a\n\nColombian national and occasional government informant, would pose\n\nas the owner of the drugs.    Special Agent Anthony Toro-Zambrana\n\n(\"Toro\") of the Special Investigations Bureau of the Puerto Rico\n\nDepartment of Justice, an undercover narcotics agent, would pose as\n\nPrincesa's bodyguard and, as a Puerto Rican, one who was familiar\n\nwith Puerto Rico and could arrange certain logistics.\n\n          Rafa and Pinillos arranged to meet on July 9, 2001 in the\n\nEspaña Bakery in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico to finalize a sale of 100\n\nkilos at the market rate.   At the appointed time, Rafa, Princesa,\n\nand Toro arrived at the bakery.   Pinillos was already there, and\n\njoined them after they entered.   The subsequent conversation was\n\nvideotaped from outside the bakery, but no sound was recorded.\n\n          After initial introductions, Pinillos assured the sellers\n\nthat he had $700,000 ready for the purchase.2   However, he stated\n\nthat his friends wanted first to buy one kilo and test its quality\n\nbefore committing to a larger purchase. Rafa and Princesa refused,\n\nsaying they were there for a multi-kilo deal. Princesa pointed out\n\nthat cocaine was traded wholesale in 25-kilo packages, and she\n\nwould not open up a package just to extract one kilo.   Rafa further\n\n\n     2\n      Rafa and Pinillos had previously discussed paying $700,000\n(half the purchase price) up front in Puerto Rico, and the\nremainder in New York when the drugs were actually delivered.\n\n                                -4-\n\fnoted that Pinillos's proposal was not in the buyers' interests,\n\nsince the sellers could easily provide a high-quality test kilo and\n\nthen sell them 99 low-quality kilos.           Rafa suggested instead that\n\nthe buyers purchase an entire 25-kilo package, and the buyers could\n\ntest one kilo from that package while remaining assured that the\n\nother 24 kilos were of equal quality.\n\n             Pinillos then went to another table and conferred with\n\ntwo other men whom the \"sellers\" had not met, defendants-appellants\n\nNolgie     Rodriguez-Zamot    (\"Rodriguez\")       and   Rodrigo   Campusano.\n\nPinillos shortly returned and related that his friends had rejected\n\nthe 25-kilo proposal because that type of deal was how undercover\n\npolice agents did business. Rafa and Princesa then suggested that,\n\ninstead of communicating through Pinillos as an intermediary, they\n\nshould talk directly to the buyers themselves.\n\n             Pinillos led Rafa, Princesa, and Toro to meet Rodriguez\n\nand Campusano, who were sitting at a nearby table, and introduced\n\nthe group.    Rodriguez was the owner of the money and therefore the\n\nprincipal on the buyers' side.            Campusano was identified as the\n\nliaison between Rodriguez and Pinillos.             The group then resumed\n\nnegotiations.       Rodriguez insisted that he wanted to buy just one\n\nkilo, and proceed from there if he was satisfied with the quality.\n\nPrincesa    (who,    as   leader   of    the   \"sellers,\"   was   Rodriguez's\n\ncounterpart) refused and made a counteroffer, which the buyers\n\nrejected.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f          Rodriguez and Campusano then abruptly left the bakery.\n\nPinillos and Rafa followed them outside; Toro and Princesa remained\n\nbehind.   Rodriguez explained that he disliked doing business with\n\nwomen, and the way that Princesa wanted to arrange the deal was\n\ncharacteristic of a police sting. Outside the bakery, negotiations\n\ncontinued for another 15 or 20 minutes.      Rodriguez was interested\n\nin making the purchase, but the two sides could not agree on\n\nvarious logistical details.   The parties agreed to meet later that\n\nafternoon to continue talking.\n\n          That afternoon, the group met at the parking lot of the\n\nPlaza Carolina shopping mall. By established protocol, the leaders\n\n(Rodriguez and Princesa) would not attend this or later meetings.\n\nThus, the buyers were represented by Pinillos and Campusano, and\n\nthe \"sellers\" by Rafa and Toro.        During this meeting, Campusano\n\nspoke via mobile phone with Rodriguez, who insisted on receiving\n\nthe drugs and testing the quality before delivering the money. The\n\nbuyers continued to argue that the sellers' proposals were how\n\nundercover police do business; the \"sellers\" countered that the\n\nbuyers' proposals were how thieves do business.\n\n          Finally, the group reached an agreement. The transaction\n\nwould involve two cars.       First, Campusano would drive a car\n\ncontaining the money to the handoff site.      After Rafa counted the\n\nmoney, the buyers would drive the car offsite.       Then Rafa would\n\nsignal for a car containing the drugs to come to the site.\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fCampusano would drive that car away, leaving Pinillos with the\n\n\"sellers\" as a guarantee, i.e., a hostage.     Once the buyers had\n\nverified the quantity and quality of the drugs, they would return\n\nwith the \"money\" car; the sellers would take the money and Pinillos\n\nwould be released.     Pinillos and Rafa later agreed that this\n\ntransaction would take place on July 11, 2001 at the parking lot of\n\nthe Metropol Restaurant.\n\n           At the appointed time, Rafa and Toro arrived in the\n\nparking lot and waited.     Pinillos arrived first and the group\n\nwaited for Campusano to come with the \"money\" car.         Pinillos\n\nappeared somewhat nervous but assured Rafa and Toro that everything\n\nwas in order -- he had seen the money, and the buyers were not\n\nplanning to rob the \"sellers.\"   Rafa sensed that something was not\n\nright and asked Pinillos to call Campusano, but Pinillos replied\n\nthat Campusano would not be available by telephone.       Rafa then\n\nasked whether the buyers were going to pay for one kilo or 25\n\nkilos.   Pinillos did not answer, but appeared anxious.   Both Rafa\n\nand Toro grew concerned that the transaction was not proceeding as\n\nplanned and that their lives might be at risk.\n\n           Finally, Campusano arrived at the parking lot on foot.\n\nToro decided that this was a bad sign.    He called nearby agents,\n\nwho surrounded the vehicle and arrested Pinillos and Campusano.\n\nRodriguez was later arrested after a brief car chase.     No drugs,\n\nmoney, or weapons were ever found on or near any defendant.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fB.          Trial\n\n            On July 24, 2001, a grand jury returned a two-count\n\nindictment against Pinillos, Campusano, and Rodriguez.                   Count I\n\ncharged    that   defendants    conspired    to   possess   with    intent    to\n\ndistribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846.         Count II charged that defendants, aiding and\n\nabetting each other, attempted to possess with intent to distribute\n\nfive or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2(a)\n\nand   21     U.S.C.      §     841(a)(1).         See   also       21     U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II) (defining penalties for violations involving\n\nfive or more kilograms of cocaine).\n\n            Defendants       were   represented    separately      but     tried\n\ntogether.    Rafa, Toro, and Princesa testified for the prosecution,\n\npresenting essentially identical accounts of the conversations at\n\nthe three meetings (minus Princesa for the last two meetings).\n\nRafa and Toro further testified on the use of code words in drug\n\ntransactions, based on their experience investigating such deals.\n\nAll three defendants testified and offered innocent explanations\n\nfor their business in Puerto Rico:          Pinillos was there to broker a\n\ncomputer sale; Rodriguez was visiting family; and Campusano was\n\nthere as a favor to Pinillos.\n\n            The jury instructions -- to which the defendants did not\n\nobject -- required the jury to find, first, whether the defendants\n\nconspired and/or attempted to possess with intent to distribute\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fcocaine; then, by special verdict form, whether \"the quantity of\n\ncocaine involved [in each count] was more than five kilograms as\n\ncharged in the indictment?\"            The jury found all defendants guilty\n\non both counts, and that the amount involved was more than five\n\nkilograms.\n\nC.             Sentencing\n\n               The pre-sentence report computed the defendants' offense\n\nlevels on the basis that the conspiracy involved 100 kilograms of\n\ncocaine.       This led to a base offense level of 36.                All three\n\ndefendants objected to the 100 kilogram figure, arguing that they\n\nwere not reasonably capable of purchasing that amount of cocaine\n\nbecause they did not have nearly enough money for such a purchase.\n\nThe district court disagreed and found that the drug offenses\n\ninvolved 100 kilograms of cocaine.             It therefore applied a base\n\noffense       level   of    36   for    each   defendant.      See     U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1(c)(2).\n\n               For Pinillos and Campusano, the court then applied a two-\n\nlevel       enhancement    for   obstruction   of   justice   under    U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3C1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 38.3                  That total\n\noffense level led to guideline ranges of 235-293 months, and the\n\ncourt sentenced both Pinillos and Campusano to two concurrent terms\n\nof 235 months.\n\n\n\n        3\n      The basis for the obstruction of justice enhancement was\nperjury at trial.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f             For Rodriguez, there was an additional issue.                   The\n\ngovernment argued that Rodriguez's prior convictions mandated a\n\nsentence of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), which\n\nstates     that   \"[i]f    any   person    commits    a    violation   of   this\n\nsubparagraph . . . after two or more prior convictions for a felony\n\ndrug offense have become final, such person shall be sentenced to\n\na mandatory term of life imprisonment without release.\"                However,\n\na question arose as to whether Rodriguez had properly been notified\n\nthat the government intended to introduce prior convictions to seek\n\nan enhanced sentence under § 841.            Prior convictions may not be\n\nused to increase the sentence for a drug offense \"unless before\n\ntrial . . . the United States attorney files an information with\n\nthe court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or\n\ncounsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions\n\nto be relied upon.\"        21 U.S.C. § 851(a)(1).         The record indicated\n\nthat the government had, just minutes before jury selection, filed\n\nan information alleging Rodriguez's prior convictions, but it was\n\nnot clear whether the information had been timely served.\n\n             The court apparently concluded that Rodriguez had not\n\nreceived     adequate     notice,   and   therefore   declined    to   consider\n\nRodriguez's criminal history for purposes of the mandatory life\n\nsentence provision.        Instead, it applied a two-level enhancement\n\nfor obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.14 and a two-level\n\n\n     4\n         For perjury at trial.      See supra note 3.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fenhancement           for    being     a     leader      or   manager     under    U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.1(c), resulting in a total offense level of 40.                               Combined\n\nwith his career offender status, that offense level led to a\n\nguideline range of 360 months to life.                            The court sentenced\n\nRodriguez to two concurrent terms of 360 months.\n\n                Defendants          timely     appealed       their      convictions      and\n\nsentences.        The government cross-appealed from the court's denial\n\nof   a       mandatory      life    sentence       for    Rodriguez      under    21   U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A).             We begin with appellants' challenges to their\n\nconvictions.\n\n                                               II.\n\n                All     three       appellants       argue     that     the   evidence     is\n\ninsufficient to sustain their conspiracy or attempt convictions.\n\nWe   review       such      challenges        de   novo,      \"drawing    all     reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the verdict, to ascertain if a rational jury\n\ncould have found that the government proved each element of the\n\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"                     Rodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d at\n\n12   (quotation             marks     and     citation        omitted).           Appellants\n\ncollectively5 raise four different arguments in support of their\n\ninsufficiency claims: (1) the parties never mentioned \"cocaine\" or\n\n\"kilos,\" but rather were negotiating for the sale of computers; (2)\n\n\n\n         5\n      To be precise, Pinillos argues the first and third points,\nCampusano argues the second, and Rodriguez argues the fourth. That\neach appellant forfeited the issues that he did not himself raise\nturns out not to matter since each argument fails on its merits.\n\n                                               -11-\n\feven       if    appellants    actually    intended    to    arrange    the    sale   of\n\ncocaine, no agreement was reached because the parties could not\n\nagree       on    how   much   to   sell   or   how   to    structure    a    two-phase\n\ntransaction; (3) any desire to purchase drugs was inchoate and\n\nwould be impeded by factual impossibility since appellants lacked\n\nthe money to purchase anywhere near the quantities of cocaine\n\nalleged; and (4) if an agreement was reached, appellant Rodriguez\n\nwas not present when it was reached, and if an attempt was made, he\n\nwas not present when it was made.                 We address each in turn.\n\nA.               Cocaine versus \"Computers\"\n\n                 This argument is readily dispatched.              Both Rafa and Toro\n\ntestified         extensively       on   the    use   of    code     words    in   drug\n\ntransactions, and the jury was entitled to believe the government\n\nwitnesses over Pinillos, who insisted that it was all some sort of\n\nmisunderstanding arising from a failed negotiation over Compaq\n\nPresario laptops.6             Furthermore, it is not quite true that the\n\nparties never mentioned \"cocaine\" or \"kilos.\"                      During its cross-\n\nexamination of Pinillos, the government confronted him with the\n\ntranscript of a telephone conversation in which he told Rafa\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      We also note that both Campusano and Rodriguez testified that\nthey knew nothing about computers, which would tend to support the\ngovernment's version.\n\n                                           -12-\n\f\"[t]hat they stole from me six, one.                There's my kilo, brother.\n\nThere's my kilo.\"7\n\nB.             Alleged Lack of Agreement\n\n               This argument (which is addressed only to the conspiracy\n\ncharge, since attempt does not require an agreement) also fails.\n\nFirst, a rational jury could conclude from the evidence at trial\n\nthat, despite initial disagreements about the logistics of the\n\ntransaction, the group eventually reached an agreement during the\n\nsecond      meeting.      Rafa   and   Toro    testified   that   Pinillos   and\n\nCampusano, in communication with Rodriguez, agreed with them to a\n\ndetailed and somewhat complicated protocol involving two cars, a\n\nhostage, and opportunities to inspect both money and drugs before\n\nthe final exchange.\n\n               But even if that evidence were somehow insufficient, the\n\njury       could   have   convicted    based   on   an   agreement   among   the\n\ndefendants themselves.           The jury could have found an agreement\n\namong the three defendants (or even two separate interlocking\n\nagreements between pairs of defendants) even if defendants never\n\nreached any agreement with the government agents. The testimony of\n\nthe government witnesses regarding the conduct of the defendants at\n\nthe various meetings was a sufficient basis for the jury to\n\n\n       7\n      While the term \"kilobyte\" may be used in reference to\ncomputers, the jury was entitled to infer that \"kilos\" meant\nkilograms of cocaine, not kilobytes. Moreover, Pinillos did not\noffer any explanation of his remark about \"kilos\" other than to\ndeny that he said it.\n\n                                       -13-\n\fconclude that the defendants had agreed amongst themselves to\n\nobtain at least five kilograms of cocaine.              See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Martinez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105, 113-14 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(\"The jury may infer an agreement circumstantially by evidence of,\n\ninter alia, a common purpose (such as a purpose to sell illicit\n\ndrugs), overlap of participants, and interdependence of various\n\nelements in the overall plan.\").\n\nC.         Lack of Money\n\n           To be sure, the fact that the government never recovered\n\nanything near the funds necessary to pay for even one kilogram of\n\ncocaine was a factual weakness.        But it was not a fatal weakness.\n\nPinillos   repeatedly    assured    the    government   witnesses   (before\n\narriving in Puerto Rico, at the España Bakery, and at the final\n\nmeeting) not only that the money was available, but that he had\n\nseen it.   The jury was entitled to believe these statements, and to\n\ninfer   that   the   money   was   secreted   somewhere   unknown   to   the\n\ngovernment.\n\nD.         Rodriguez's Connection\n\n           Finally, Rodriguez argues that, even if there was a\n\nconspiracy and an attempt, his involvement was too peripheral to\n\nlink him to either.          But the government witnesses provided a\n\nsufficient basis to link him to both charges. All three government\n\nwitnesses testified that, at the España Bakery meeting, Rodriguez\n\nwas acting as the leader and decisionmaker; Rafa testified that\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fRodriguez was introduced as such.            Both Toro and Rafa testified\n\nthat Pinillos and/or Campusano took direction from Rodriguez by\n\ncell   phone    at   the    second   meeting,   and   all   three   government\n\nwitnesses confirmed that, according to the usual protocol, the\n\nleader would only be present for the initial meeting, and certainly\n\nnot for the actual handoff.          Thus, the jury was entitled to infer\n\nthat he was a member of the conspiracy, and either that he directly\n\naided or abetted the other two defendants in their attempt, or was\n\nliable    for   their      foreseeable   acts   within   the   scope   of   the\n\nconspiracy.      See Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 647\n\n(1946).\n\n            For these reasons, we reject appellants' argument that\n\nthe evidence was legally insufficient to support the verdict.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            Appellants argue that the district court committed three\n\nerrors during the course of the trial.          All three appellants argue\n\nthat the district court allowed improper and unfairly prejudicial\n\nexpert testimony when it permitted Toro to testify, without any\n\nevidence of violence or guns in this case, that drug organizations\n\nare dangerous and keep their drugs near their firearms.             Rodriguez\n\nmakes two further arguments: (1) that the jury instructions failed\n\nto state that the jury could only convict a defendant of conspiracy\n\nif it found that the defendant conspired with at least one person\n\nwho was not a government agent; and (2) that the instructions\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\ffailed   to    incorporate   certain   principles   from   the   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines regarding calculation of drug quantity in a reverse\n\nsting.   We reject all of these arguments.\n\nA.            Toro's Testimony\n\n              1.     The Challenged Testimony\n\n              Before trial, Pinillos moved in limine to exclude expert\n\ntestimony regarding the topic of coded references to drugs and drug\n\ntrafficking, on the ground that the government had not complied\n\nwith its obligation to disclose expert testimony under Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 16(a)(1)(E) (2002).8          The government explained that it\n\nplanned to ask both Toro and Rafa to testify about the use of code\n\nphrases in drug deals, and suggested that this was lay opinion\n\ntestimony.      The district court denied Pinillos's motion, but held\n\nthat the proposed testimony would be \"regarded as expert testimony\"\n\nand ordered the government to disclose \"any information that is\n\nrelevant to qualifying [a witness] as an expert to testify as to\n\nthe meaning of drug related or coded drug phrases.\"\n\n              Despite the pretrial wrangling, the government never\n\nactually moved to qualify Toro as an expert witness.              Instead,\n\nearly in its direct examination, after eliciting Toro's background\n\nand experience, it began asking general questions about the nature\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      That provision has subsequently been renumbered Fed. R. Crim.\nP. 16(a)(1)(G) (2005), but the 2002 version is otherwise virtually\nidentical to the present version.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fof drug organizations and, in particular, their violent nature.\n\n(No questions had yet been asked concerning code words.)\n\n           The first substantive question that the government asked\n\nof Toro was, \"What is your experience with how drug organizations\n\noperate as far as how do they maintain control of drugs or the\n\nguns?\"    (Emphasis    added).   After    a   defense9   objection,       the\n\ngovernment rephrased the question without reference to guns, and\n\nToro answered that drug organizations had members \"who are engaged\n\nin safekeeping and protecting the drugs.\"            The government then\n\nasked, \"And how do they protect the drugs?\"              Over a defense\n\nobjection, Toro was permitted to answer that the drugs \"are kept in\n\na hidden place where they are protected with firearms.\"10\n\n           Testimony     about   the     dangerous    nature   of        drug\n\norganizations recurred later in Toro's direct examination, when he\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      Typically, in a multi-defendant case the district court will\nprovide by standing order, or from the bench, that an objection\nmade by one defendant will suffice to preserve the issue for all\ndefendants. Cf. D.P.R. Crim. R. 117(b)(10) (providing that counsel\nshould be prepared to discuss these issues at pretrial conference).\nThe record is not clear as to whether that happened here. However,\nthe government has advised us that, despite the apparent absence of\nan applicable order from the district court, it is the general\npractice in the District of Puerto Rico to treat an objection by\none defendant as applicable to all defendants.      Because of the\nuncertainty, we give appellants the benefit of the doubt. We do,\nhowever, advise future litigants to seek a ruling on the record\nregarding such matters.\n     10\n      The court then sustained defendants' objection                to    the\ngovernment's question, \"How dangerous is your job?\"\n\n                                 -17-\n\fopined as to why the leader of a drug organization would not be\n\nphysically present for the actual handoff:\n\n          The most crucial and dangerous moment during\n          the work of an undercover agent and everyone\n          engaged in drug business is that time when the\n          drugs and the money are handed over. Based on\n          my experience, this is the point in time when\n          any of the people involved, for any reason at\n          that point in time, may lose his or her life.\n\nDefendants     objected    on   the   ground   that   the   testimony   was\n\ninflammatory; the objection was overruled.\n\n          When discussing the meeting at the España Bakery, the\n\ngovernment asked Toro whether, in his experience, drug traffickers\n\nbring innocent people to negotiations for the sale of drugs.            Toro\n\nanswered that they do not.       The following discussion ensued:\n\n          Q.       Why would you not bring in innocent\n                   people?\n          A.       Because it could cause the life of that\n                   innocent person, to be in a drug\n                   transaction.\n\n                   MS. PLAZA: Objection, Your Honor.\n                   THE COURT: Overruled.\n          . . .\n\n          Q.       So when these drug deals happen, is it\n                   dangerous?\n\n                   MS.    PLAZA:      Objection.\n                   MS.    LIZARRIBAR: Objection.\n                   THE    COURT: Overruled.\n                   THE    WITNESS:   Yes, sir.\n\n          BY MR. SCHULTE:\n\n          Q.       Why is it dangerous?\n          A.       Because when you are involved in a drug\n                   transaction, you have drugs and money\n                   involved. No one wants to have their\n\n                                      -18-\n\f                   drugs stolen; no one wants to have\n                   their   money   stolen,    and that's\n                   practically [sic] when there is large\n                   amounts of money involved and large\n                   amounts of drugs involved.\n\nLater, when discussing the second meeting at the Plaza Carolina,\n\nToro explained that if he \"had not demanded to see the money, it\n\ncould look as though we were cops and things could get dangerous.\"\n\nThe prosecutor asked for clarification, and Toro explained:\n\n           In a drug transaction where you have agents --\n           law enforcement agents from Puerto Rico and\n           people who are engaged in drug trafficking,\n           should these people become aware that we are\n           agents, as has happened, it could cost us our\n           lives.\n\nThe defense objected \"as to what has happened in other cases,\" and\n\nthe court sustained that objection, allowing into evidence, in the\n\ncourt's words, \"that if these people find out that they are law\n\nenforcement, it could cost their lives.\"\n\n           The   final   contested   statements   came   during   Toro's\n\nexplanation as to why he felt \"insecure\" and \"unsure\" in the car\n\nwith Pinillos at the delivery site.      Toro explained that at that\n\ntime he \"didn't know if Campusano and Pinillos were with other\n\npeople.\"   The government asked for clarification as follows:\n\n           Q.      What do you   mean with other people?\n           A.      Maybe they    were accompanied by other\n                   members of     their organization which\n                   could place   --\n\n                  MS.    PLAZA: Objection, Your Honor.\n                  THE    COURT: Overruled.\n                  THE    WITNESS: -- which could place at\n           stake both    the informant's life and my life.\n\n                                  -19-\n\f          2.     Analysis\n\n          Appellants argue that these statements were erroneously\n\nadmitted because (1) they were not a proper subject of expert\n\ntestimony, see Fed. R. Evid. 702, and (2) they created a risk of\n\nunfair prejudice that substantially outweighed any probative value,\n\nsee Fed. R. Evid. 403.    The government, perhaps missing the thrust\n\nof appellants' argument on appeal (which is not directed at the\n\ntestimony regarding code words, but rather at that regarding\n\nviolence), responds that code words are an appropriate subject for\n\nexpert testimony, and the code word testimony was not prejudicial.11\n\nIt also argues that Toro's testimony would have been admissible as\n\nlay opinion testimony under Fed. R. Evid. 701.         We review the\n\ncourt's decision to admit the testimony for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Ayala-Pizarro, 407 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Appellants' argument under Rule 702 is easily dispatched.\n\n\"It require[s] no special expertise for [an officer] to conclude,\n\nbased on his observations, that places which sell drugs are often\n\nprotected by people with weapons.\"      Ayala-Pizarro, 407 F.3d at 29\n\n(rejecting challenge to admission of such testimony as improper\n\nexpert testimony).   That type of testimony is admissible as lay\n\nopinion under Rule 701.   See Ayala-Pizarro, 407 F.3d at 28-29.   The\n\nsame reasoning applies to the other testimony to which appellants\n\n\n     11\n      Since appellants do not challenge on appeal (and did not\ncontemporaneously object to) the code word testimony, we do not\naddress it.\n\n                                 -20-\n\fobject, e.g., that the moment when the drugs and money are handed\n\nover is the most dangerous part of the work of an undercover agent.\n\nAs in Ayala-Pizarro, these matters were \"well founded on personal\n\nknowledge       and    susceptible       to    cross-examination,\"      id.   at    28\n\n(quotation marks and citation omitted), and appropriate for lay\n\nopinion testimony.\n\n            Nor was the testimony inadmissible under Rule 403, under\n\nwhich    evidence       \"may   be    excluded        if   its   probative   value    is\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"                       Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 403.         \"Trial judges enjoy wide latitude in making Rule 403\n\nrulings and are only overturned after a showing of an egregious\n\nerror.\"     United States v. Kornegay, 410 F.3d 89, 96 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    The challenged statements had considerable probative value\n\nregarding, respectively, why the government might come to a drug\n\ntransaction in which it planned to sell drugs without the actual\n\ndrugs;    why    the     leader     of   a    drug    organization    would   not   be\n\nphysically present for the actual handoff; why it would be unlikely\n\nthat any defendant who was present at the España Bakery meeting\n\nwould be a mere innocent bystander; why it was important for the\n\ngovernment agents to demand to see the money during the Plaza\n\nCarolina meeting; and why Toro called in the arrest before the\n\n\"sale\" had been consummated.                  To a significant extent, Toro's\n\ntestimony about the dangerousness of drug transactions simply\n\nhelped to explain his own conduct.\n\n\n                                             -21-\n\f           At the same time, any danger of unfair prejudice was\n\nsubstantially dissipated.          The first four of the five disputed\n\nreferences to guns or violence were general statements about how\n\ndrug   organizations     typically    operate,     offered     principally     to\n\nexplain Toro's own actions; only the last statement suggested that\n\nthese particular defendants might potentially have some involvement\n\nwith violence.     All five statements were counterbalanced by the\n\ngovernment's   open    concession     (and    Toro's      admission   on    cross-\n\nexamination) that no weapons were ever found on or near any\n\ndefendant in this case.      We do not discount that the testimony may\n\nhave   increased   the    impact    of   Toro's    testimony     in   a     manner\n\nunfavorable to appellants.           But that is not enough to make a\n\nviolation of Rule 403.      \"Virtually all evidence is prejudicial --\n\nif the truth be told, that is almost always why the proponent seeks\n\nto introduce it -- but it is only unfair prejudice against which\n\nthe law protects.\"       United States v. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).    The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nconcluding that the danger of unfair prejudice from the disputed\n\ntestimony did not substantially outweigh its probative value.\n\nB.         Instructions Regarding Conspiracy with Government Agent\n\n           Both    before   and    after     the   jury    charge,    all    three\n\ndefendants requested an instruction that a jury can only convict a\n\ndefendant of conspiracy if it finds that he conspired with at least\n\none person who was not a government agent.             In other words, there\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fmust be at least two true conspirators, and \"government agents do\n\nnot count.\"      United States v. Giry, 818 F.2d 120, 126 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).   The district court denied the request on the ground that\n\nthe instruction is only applicable when the facts support the\n\ninference that the defendant and one or more government agents were\n\nthe only participants in the agreement, and that scenario was not\n\neven the defense's theory of this case, let alone a reasonable\n\ninference from the facts.       On appeal, Rodriguez maintains that the\n\nrefusal to grant this instruction requires a new trial.\n\n              The parties spar over the standard of review, but we need\n\nnot resolve that controversy.             Instead, we will assume, in the\n\nappellant's favor, that the de novo standard applies.                 In order to\n\nconclude that Rodriguez had formed an agreement to possess with\n\nintent   to    distribute   cocaine,      but     that   he    had   reached    this\n\nagreement solely with government agents, the jury would have had to\n\naccept   an    unlikely   hybrid     of   Rodriguez's         testimony   and    the\n\ngovernment's theory of the case. Nevertheless, as unlikely as this\n\nversion of events may be, we will also assume for argument's sake\n\nthat the district court erred in denying the instruction.\n\n              In all events, the error was harmless in this case.                See\n\nUnited States v. Duff, 76 F.3d 122, 127-28 (7th Cir. 1996) (where\n\ntestimony showed that defendant \"participated in many of the [drug]\n\norganization's     activities   as    one    of    its   supervisors\"     whereas\n\ngovernment agent \"entered at the bottom[,] . . . . [n]o reasonable\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fjury would have thought that [defendant] agreed only with [the\n\ngovernment   agent]\"    and   therefore   the   failure   to   give   the\n\ninstruction was harmless).      In order for the instruction to have\n\nmade a difference, the jury would have had to believe the following\n\nversion of events.     Rodriguez, who lives in Miami, flew to Puerto\n\nRico.    The next day, he visited Campusano -- who also lived in\n\nMiami and whom he had known for about a year and a half -- at his\n\nhotel.   Campusano introduced Rodriguez to Pinillos, with whom he\n\nwas staying. At no point did Rodriguez agree with either Campusano\n\nor Pinillos to obtain cocaine for distribution.           The next day,\n\nRodriguez accompanied Campusano and Pinillos to the España Bakery.\n\nSo far, Rodriguez had not agreed with anyone to obtain cocaine.        At\n\nthe bakery, all three defendants met with all three government\n\nagents, but Rodriguez still had not, by either words or conduct,\n\nagreed with either Campusano or Pinillos to obtain cocaine. Later,\n\nall three defendants stepped outside and talked with Rafa. At this\n\npoint, and not before, Rodriguez reached an agreement to obtain\n\ncocaine -- with Rafa alone, because Campusano and Pinillos were\n\nmerely   bystanders.     Finally,   Rodriguez   either    never   relayed\n\ninstructions to Campusano at the Plaza Carolina mall via mobile\n\nphone, or did it in such a way that he did not bring Campusano (let\n\nalone Pinillos) into the agreement.\n\n           As noted, this is an unlikely scenario, to put it mildly.\n\nAt the same time, the evidence for the government's version of\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fevents was considerably stronger.            Indeed, the theory of the case\n\nunder which the instruction could have made a difference was never\n\nadvanced by Rodriguez or any other witness, and was less plausible\n\nthan the theory of innocence that Rodriguez actually professed. To\n\naccept the hybrid version of events under which the instruction\n\nmight have mattered, the jury would have had to disbelieve both the\n\ngovernment witnesses (who testified that Rodriguez participated\n\nwith Campusano and Pinillos in reaching an agreement) and Rodriguez\n\nhimself (who testified that he was not involved in any discussions\n\nrelating to the purchase of anything).            Because the evidence for\n\nthe government's version of events was so much stronger than the\n\nevidence for the version of events under which an error could have\n\naffected the verdict, we are easily satisfied that any such error\n\n\"does   not    affect   substantial    rights    [and    therefore]   must    be\n\ndisregarded.\"      Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a).         Cf. Gillespie v. Sears,\n\nRoebuck & Co., 386 F.3d 21, 30 (1st Cir. 2004) (in civil cases,\n\n\"[r]ecognizing that a jury is likely to prefer a better supported\n\ntheory to one less supported, we have generously applied the\n\nharmless   error    concept   to   rescue     verdicts   where   we   could   be\n\nreasonably sure that the jury in fact relied upon a theory with\n\nadequate evidentiary support\").\n\nC.            Instructions Regarding Drug Quantity Calculation\n\n              The district court required the jury to answer a question\n\non a special verdict form: \"Do you unanimously agree by proof\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fbeyond reasonable doubt that the quantity of cocaine involved in\n\nthe conspiracy charged in count 1 was more than five kilograms as\n\ncharged in the indictment?\"    A similar question was applied to the\n\nattempt charge.    The jury answered yes to each question for each\n\ndefendant.\n\n          Rodriguez   argues   that    the   jury   instructions   were\n\ndefective because they did not incorporate certain standards found\n\nin the Sentencing Guidelines for determination of drug quantity in\n\na reverse sting:\n\n          In an offense involving an agreement to sell a\n          controlled substance, the agreed-upon quantity\n          of the controlled substance shall be used to\n          determine the offense level unless the sale is\n          completed and the amount delivered more\n          accurately reflects the scale of the offense.\n          . . . [I]n a reverse sting, the agreed-upon\n          quantity of the controlled substance would\n          more accurately reflect the scale of the\n          offense because the amount actually delivered\n          is controlled by the government, not by the\n          defendant.   If,   however,    the   defendant\n          establishes that he or she did not intend to\n          provide, or was not reasonably capable of\n          providing, the agreed-upon quantity of the\n          controlled substance, the court shall exclude\n          from the offense level determination the\n          amount of controlled substance that the\n          defendant establishes that he or she did not\n          intend to provide or was not reasonably\n          capable of providing.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, cmt. n.12 (2002).12\n\n\n\n\n     12\n      This was the version of application note 12 available at the\ntime of trial. It has since been amended slightly.\n\n                                -26-\n\f           Rodriguez argues that application note 12 should have\n\nbeen incorporated into the jury charge, and that the jury might\n\nhave found that since there was no evidence that he had even a\n\ntenth of the money needed to buy five kilograms of cocaine, he was\n\nnot reasonably capable of purchasing five kilograms.                Because\n\nRodriguez did not request this instruction below, we review for\n\nplain error.   United States v. Medina-Martinez, 396 F.3d 1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 2005). Under this rigorous standard, Rodriguez must show that\n\n\"(1) an error occurred, (2) the error was clear or obvious, (3) the\n\nerror affected his substantial rights, and (4) the error also\n\nseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"     Id.\n\n           It may seem unusual to suggest that a principle from the\n\nSentencing Guidelines, which are applied by the court (even under\n\nthe   post-Booker    advisory    regime),   should   govern   a   statutory\n\ndetermination.      Indeed, Rodriguez has not cited any case from any\n\ncourt holding that any aspect of the Sentencing Guidelines must be\n\nincorporated into jury instructions. He does, however, cite United\n\nStates v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1160 (1st Cir. 1996), for the\n\nproposition that \"[a]pplication note 12 applies for the purposes of\n\nboth the Sentencing Guidelines and the statutory penalties under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b).\"      But Rodriguez has cited no case, and we have\n\nfound none, suggesting that Lindia has any applicability to jury\n\n\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fquantity determinations, or that application note 12 must be\n\nincorporated into jury instructions.13\n\n          That said, we need not decide whether it would have been\n\ncorrect to grant a request to instruct the jury that it should\n\nexclude \"the amount of controlled substance that the defendant\n\nestablishes   that   the   defendant   did   not   intend   to   provide   or\n\npurchase or was not reasonably capable of providing or purchasing\"\n\nif the defendant had requested such an instruction, nor whether it\n\nwould have been error to deny a timely request for such an\n\ninstruction, nor even whether it was error to fail to so instruct\n\nsua sponte.   The error, if any, was not \"clear or obvious,\" and\n\ntherefore Rodriguez's challenge fails under plain error review.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n          Although    the    appellants      allege   various    errors    in\n\nsentencing, we need not address their claims. All three defendants\n\nchallenged the district court's calculation of the drug quantity as\n\n100 kilograms.   The government concedes that all three defendants\n\npreserved claims at sentencing under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530\n\nU.S. 466, 490 (2000), which in turn suffices to preserve claims\n\nunder United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).            See United\n\nStates v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005).                 We\n\naccept those concessions without further inquiry.           The government\n\n\n     13\n      We also note, but do not rely upon, the fact that other\naspects of Lindia have been called into doubt. See United States\nv. Eirby, 262 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                  -28-\n\ffurther conceded at oral argument that it cannot show that the\n\nerror       was   harmless,    and       therefore       remand      is    appropriate.\n\nConsequently, all three appellants' sentences will be remanded for\n\nresentencing in light of Booker.14\n\n                                           V.\n\n              The government cross-appeals from the district court's\n\nrefusal to impose upon Rodriguez a mandatory life sentence based on\n\nits conclusion that he had inadequate notice of the government's\n\nintent to seek that sentence.             If the prosecution intends to seek\n\nan    enhanced     sentence    under      21    U.S.C.    §    841   based    on    prior\n\nconvictions, it must \"before trial . . . file[] an information with\n\nthe court (and serve[] a copy of such information on the person or\n\ncounsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions\n\nto be relied upon.\"          21 U.S.C. § 851(a)(1).\n\n              There is no dispute that the prosecution filed and served\n\na § 851 information on October 17, 2002, the first day of trial.\n\nThe   question      is   whether    it    was    served       \"before     trial.\"     The\n\ngovernment        contends   that    it   filed    and     personally       served    the\n\ninformation on October 17, 2002, the morning that the trial began,\n\njust before jury selection started.                  \"While such cliff-hanging\n\npractices are not wise,\" if \"the filing was made before jury\n\n\n       14\n      Because we vacate appellants' sentences in their entirety,\nwe need not decide appellants' claims that the district court\nerroneously (1) determined role in the offense for Campusano and\nRodriguez, (2) calculated the drug quantity under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1,\ncmt. n.12, or (3) set the conditions of supervised release.\n\n                                          -29-\n\fselection, [then] that is all that was required.\" United States v.\n\nCartagena-Carrasquillo, 70 F.3d 706, 715 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n             According to the courtroom deputy's notes for the morning\n\nof October 17, 2002, jury selection was delayed because Campusano's\n\nattorney was in a hearing in a different courtroom.                  The notes\n\nrecord that Campusano's attorney arrived at 10:45 A.M. and joined\n\na bench conference already in progress.               Jury selection began\n\nseveral      minutes    later,   after      the   bench   conference     ended.\n\nCritically, the notes indicate that the information was filed at\n\n10:45 A.M. -- the same time that Campusano's attorney arrived, and\n\na few minutes before jury selection began.                That notation was\n\nconsistent     with    the   prosecutor's    statement    at   the   sentencing\n\nhearing that he personally filed the § 851 information, and handed\n\ncopies to Rodriguez and his counsel, shortly before jury selection\n\nbegan.     However, while the notes suggest that the information was\n\ntimely filed, they say nothing about when it was served.15\n\n             On March 18, 2003, the district court found that the\n\ninformation was timely filed and served, and denied Rodriguez's\n\nmotion to strike the information.            Rodriguez's sentencing hearing\n\nwas   held    later    that    same   day,    and   his   counsel     requested\n\nreconsideration.        Counsel disputed the government's version of\n\n\n\n\n      15\n      The government also served the information by mail on October\n17, 2002. Again, the date on the certificate of service does not\nindicate the time of service.\n\n                                      -30-\n\fevents, and noted that there was nothing in the record stating that\n\nRodriguez had received the information.   He further argued:\n\n          A lot of times what the U.S. Attorney will do,\n          Judge, is they'll stand up and announce, to\n          make sure there's no problem, they'll stand up\n          and announce in open court that notice has\n          been filed, and the judge will voir dire the\n          defendant to make sure that the defendant is\n          aware of the fact that this has been filed.\n          It's kind of like a prophylactic remedy to\n          make sure that these types of issues do not\n          occur.    I'm not aware of anything in the\n          record   to   suggest  that   the   government\n          announced this in open court and that Mr.\n          Rodriguez was voir dired to make sure that he\n          was aware of the filing.\n\nShortly afterwards, the court conducted a bench conference, then\n\nstated for the record:\n\n                  At sidebar the Court was discussing\n          with the attorneys whether the lack of voir\n          dire by the Court directly with the defendant\n          would preclude the enhancement because of\n          prior convictions. We were discussing whether\n          it is a requirement for the Court to voir dire\n          the defendant as to the information that has\n          been filed in Court, by informing him that\n          this information has been filed in which the\n          allegations as to prior convictions are such-\n          and-such, and then asking him if he affirms or\n          denies that he was previously convicted or\n          that the convictions were invalid.\n                  That did not occur, and in all fairness\n          to the defendant, I will state that for the\n          record.    We were waiting for [Campusano's\n          counsel] to come, and the matter of the\n          information was taken up at the informal\n          sidebar conference, where the government had\n          filed it and defendant counsel had previously\n          been given notice and so had the defendant.\n          On that I'm very clear, that he received --\n          the filing was done before, the notice was\n          done before the actual selection of the jury\n          and voir dire.\n\n                               -31-\n\f                     However, if the dialogue of the Court\n              with the defendant is a requirement is\n              something that I don't have an answer to right\n              now.\n\nThe court then took a brief recess, and during the recess issued a\n\nwritten order stating:\n\n              Although the Court is convinced, as stated in\n              its previous Order, that the filing of the\n              Information    certifying    that    defendant\n              committed this offense after two prior\n              convictions was made before the selection of\n              the jury commenced and that he was notified of\n              the Information before voir dire started, the\n              Court acknowledges that it did not conduct any\n              inquiry directly with defendant as to his\n              awareness   of   such   filing   and  of   the\n              allegations of the Information, nor whether he\n              affirmed or denied his previous convictions or\n              claimed their invalidity. Since this is the\n              practice followed by the Court in other cases,\n              its absence in this case casts doubt on\n              whether defendant [Rodriguez] was fully aware\n              of the consequences of the filing of the\n              Information and was able to rethink his\n              decision to stand trial. For these reasons,\n              the Court will not apply the enhancement based\n              on his prior convictions.\n\n              The court's final order could be read in two ways.        The\n\ngovernment interprets it to state, as a matter of law, that § 851\n\nnotice is not complete unless the court addresses the defendant\n\nconcerning the information before trial begins.16         If so, it would\n\nbe an incorrect statement of law; there is no basis for such a\n\nrequirement.      However, Rodriguez argues that the court was simply\n\nmaking    a   factual   inference:   since   this   district   court   judge\n\n\n     16\n      Such a colloquy before trial would be entirely separate from\nthe post-conviction, pre-sentencing colloquy required by § 851(b).\n\n                                     -32-\n\fconsistently, in other cases, discusses the information with the\n\ndefendant on the record, the fact that no such discussion occurred\n\nin this case is evidence suggesting that the information may not\n\nhave been timely served on Rodriguez.           In other words, under this\n\nlatter view, the absence of colloquy is relevant as part of a\n\nfactual determination, not a legal requirement in itself.\n\n            The final written order is at least susceptible to the\n\nreading    that   Rodriguez   advocates.        However,    the    government's\n\ninterpretation seems more consistent with the district court's\n\nstatement at the sentencing hearing that it was \"very clear, that\n\n[Rodriguez] received -- the filing was done before, the notice was\n\ndone before the actual selection of the jury and voir dire,\" and\n\nits expression of uncertainty only as to whether \"the dialogue of\n\nthe Court with the defendant is a requirement.\"\n\n            Because   the   stakes   of     construing     the    court's   order\n\nincorrectly are potentially high, and a remand is already warranted\n\nunder Booker, we decline to interpret the order.                     Rather, we\n\nsuggest that the district court, on resentencing, clarify its\n\noriginal ruling.      If the court initially declined to impose the\n\nenhanced   sentence   based   solely      on   the   conclusion     that    §   851\n\nrequires a colloquy before trial -- a conclusion we have now\n\nrejected -- then the court should impose the enhanced sentence.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the court correctly recognized that § 851\n\ndoes not require a colloquy before trial, and its written order\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\freflected a factual determination of the events of October 17,\n\n2002, or if there were other valid grounds for the order not\n\napparent to us, the court need not impose a life sentence.\n\n                                       VI.\n\n            The    convictions    of   appellants   are   affirmed.     Their\n\nsentences    of    imprisonment    are    vacated   and   remanded    for   re-\n\nsentencing in light of Booker.           For Rodriguez, the court should\n\nfurther determine whether a mandatory life sentence under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A) applies.     Whatever its intention, the court should,\n\nhowever,    make    reasonably    specific    findings    that   clarify    its\n\nthinking.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\f",

Nelson \"Rafa\" Rodr&#237;guez, an experienced government informant of Colombian origin, first met defendant-appellant Jaime Pinillos-Prieto (\"Pinillos\") in Colombia in early 2001. In this meeting, Rafa<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> represented himself as a drug trafficker.

Rafa asked Pinillos if the customer had the money &#8212; approximately $1.4 million, since the going rate was about $13,500 per kilo. Pinillos confirmed that the buyer had the money. During this telephone call, as in other communications, Rafa and Pinillos did not use the terms \"cocaine\" or \"kilos,\" but rather the terms \"laptops\" and \"computers,\" which, Rafa later testified, were code words designed to obscure their conversation in case law enforcement officers overheard them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rafa contacted his case agent at the Drug Enforcement Administration, who authorized him to proceed with a \"reverse sting\" operation.

The subsequent conversation was videotaped from outside the bakery, but no sound was recorded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After initial introductions, Pinillos assured the sellers that he had $700,000 ready for the purchase.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> However, he stated that his friends wanted first to buy one kilo and test its quality before committing to a larger purchase. Rafa and Princesa refused, saying they were there for a multi-kilo deal. Princesa pointed out that cocaine was traded wholesale in 25-kilo packages, and she would not open up a package just to extract one kilo. Rafa further noted that Pinillos's proposal was not in the buyers' interests, since the sellers could easily provide a high-quality test kilo and then sell them 99 low-quality kilos. Rafa suggested instead that the buyers purchase an entire 25-kilo package, and the buyers could test one kilo from that package while remaining assured that the other 24 kilos were of equal quality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pinillos then went to another table and conferred with two other men whom the \"sellers\" had not met, defendants-appellants Nolgie Rodriguez-Zamot (\"Rodriguez\") and Rodrigo Campusano. Pinillos shortly returned and related that his friends had rejected the 25-kilo proposal because that type of deal was how undercover police agents did business. Rafa and Princesa then suggested that, instead of communicating through Pinillos as an intermediary, they should talk directly to the buyers themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pinillos led Rafa, Princesa, and Toro to meet Rodriguez and Campusano, who were sitting at a nearby table, and introduced the group. Rodriguez was the owner of the money and therefore the principal on the buyers' side. Campusano was identified as the liaison between Rodriguez and Pinillos. The group then resumed negotiations. Rodriguez insisted that he wanted to buy just one kilo, and proceed from there if he was satisfied with the quality. Princesa (who, as leader of the \"sellers,\" was Rodriguez's counterpart) refused and made a counteroffer, which the buyers rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez and Campusano then abruptly left the bakery. Pinillos and Rafa followed them outside; Toro and Princesa remained behind. Rodriguez explained that he disliked doing business with women, and the way that Princesa wanted to arrange the deal was characteristic of a police sting. Outside the bakery, negotiations continued for another 15 or 20 minutes. Rodriguez was interested in making the purchase, but the two sides could not agree on various logistical details. The parties agreed to meet later that afternoon to continue talking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That afternoon, the group met at the parking lot of the Plaza Carolina shopping mall. By established protocol, the leaders (Rodriguez and Princesa) would not attend this or later meetings. Thus, the buyers were represented by Pinillos and Campusano, and the \"sellers\" by Rafa and Toro. During this meeting, Campusano spoke via mobile phone with Rodriguez, who insisted on receiving the drugs and testing the quality before delivering the money. The buyers continued to argue that the sellers' proposals were how undercover police do business; the \"sellers\" countered that the buyers' proposals were how thieves do business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the group reached an agreement. The transaction would involve two cars. First, Campusano would drive a car containing the money to the handoff site. After Rafa counted the money, the buyers would drive the car offsite. Then Rafa would signal for a car containing the drugs to come to the site. Campusano would drive that car away, leaving Pinillos with the \"sellers\" as a guarantee, i.e., a hostage. Once the buyers had verified the quantity and quality of the drugs, they would return with the \"money\" car; the sellers would take the money and Pinillos would be released. Pinillos and Rafa later agreed that this transaction would take place on July 11, 2001 at the parking lot of the Metropol Restaurant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the appointed time, Rafa and Toro arrived in the parking lot and waited. Pinillos arrived first and the group waited for Campusano to come with the \"money\" car. Pinillos appeared somewhat nervous but assured Rafa and Toro that everything was in order &#8212; he had seen the money, and the buyers were not planning to rob the \"sellers.\" Rafa sensed that something was not right and asked Pinillos to call Campusano, but Pinillos replied that Campusano would not be available by telephone. Rafa then asked whether the buyers were going to pay for one kilo or 25 kilos. Pinillos did not answer, but appeared anxious. Both Rafa and Toro grew concerned that the transaction was not proceeding as planned and that their lives might be at risk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Campusano arrived at the parking lot on foot. Toro decided that this was a bad sign. He called nearby agents, who surrounded the vehicle and arrested Pinillos and Campusano. Rodriguez was later arrested after a brief car chase. No drugs, money, or weapons were ever found on or near any defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 24, 2001, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Pinillos, Campusano, and Rodriguez. Count I charged that defendants conspired to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. Count II charged that defendants, aiding and abetting each other, attempted to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2(a) and 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). <i>See also</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II) (defining penalties for violations involving five or more kilograms of cocaine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants were represented separately but tried together. Rafa, Toro, and Princesa testified for the prosecution, presenting essentially identical accounts of the conversations at the three meetings (minus Princesa for the last two meetings). Rafa and Toro further testified on the use of code words in drug transactions, based on their experience investigating such deals. All three defendants testified and offered innocent explanations for their business in Puerto Rico: Pinillos was there to broker a computer sale; Rodriguez was visiting family; and Campusano was there as a favor to Pinillos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury instructions &#8212; to which the defendants did not object &#8212; required the jury to find, first, whether the defendants conspired and/or attempted to possess with intent to distribute cocaine; then, by special verdict form, whether \"the quantity of cocaine involved [in each count] was more than five kilograms as charged in the indictment?\" The jury found all defendants guilty on both counts, and that the amount involved was more than five kilograms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-sentence report computed the defendants' offense levels on the basis that the conspiracy involved 100 kilograms of cocaine. This led to a base offense level of 36. All three defendants objected to the 100 kilogram figure, arguing that they were not reasonably capable of purchasing that amount of cocaine because they did not have nearly enough money for such a purchase. The district court disagreed and found that the drug offenses involved 100 kilograms of cocaine. It therefore applied a base offense level of 36 for each defendant. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For Pinillos and Campusano, the court then applied a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 38.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> That total offense level led to guideline ranges of 235-293 months, and the court sentenced both Pinillos and Campusano to two concurrent terms of 235 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For Rodriguez, there was an additional issue. The government argued that Rodriguez's prior convictions mandated a sentence of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A), which states that \"[i]f any person commits a violation of this subparagraph . . . after two or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense have become final, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without release.\" However, a question arose as to whether Rodriguez had properly been notified that the government intended to introduce prior convictions to seek an enhanced sentence under &#167; 841. Prior convictions may not be used to increase the sentence for a drug offense \"unless before trial . . . the United States attorney files an information with the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a)(1). The record indicated that the government had, just minutes before jury selection, filed an information alleging Rodriguez's prior convictions, but it was not clear whether the information had been timely served.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court apparently concluded that Rodriguez had not received adequate notice, and therefore declined to consider Rodriguez's criminal history for purposes of the mandatory life sentence provision. Instead, it applied a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and a two-level enhancement for being a leader or manager under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), resulting in a total offense level of 40. Combined with his career offender status, that offense level led to a guideline range of 360 months to life. The court sentenced Rodriguez to two concurrent terms of 360 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants timely appealed their convictions and sentences. The government cross-appealed from the court's denial of a mandatory life sentence for Rodriguez under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). We begin with appellants' challenges to their convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three appellants argue that the evidence is insufficient to sustain their conspiracy or attempt convictions. We review such challenges <i>de novo,</i> \"drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, to ascertain if a rational jury could have found that the government proved each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 12 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Appellants collectively<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> raise four different arguments in support of their insufficiency claims: (1) the parties never mentioned \"cocaine\" or \"kilos,\" but rather were negotiating for the sale of computers; (2) even if appellants actually intended to arrange the sale of cocaine, no agreement was reached because the parties could not agree on how much to sell or how to structure a two-phase transaction; (3) any desire to purchase drugs was inchoate and would be impeded by factual impossibility since appellants lacked the money to purchase anywhere near the quantities of cocaine alleged; and (4) if an agreement was reached, appellant Rodriguez was not present when it was reached, and if an attempt was made, he was not present when it was made. We address each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Cocaine versus \"Computers\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is readily dispatched. Both Rafa and Toro testified extensively on the use of code words in drug transactions, and the jury was entitled to believe the government witnesses over Pinillos, who insisted that it was all some sort of misunderstanding arising from a failed negotiation over Compaq Presario laptops.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Furthermore, it is not quite true that the parties never mentioned \"cocaine\" or \"kilos.\" During its cross-examination of Pinillos, the government confronted him with the transcript of a telephone conversation in which he told Rafa \"[t]hat they stole from me six, one. There's my kilo, brother. There's my kilo.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Alleged Lack of Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument (which is addressed only to the conspiracy charge, since attempt does not require an agreement) also fails. First, a rational jury could conclude from the evidence at trial that, despite initial disagreements about the logistics of the transaction, the group eventually reached an agreement during the second meeting. Rafa and Toro testified that Pinillos and Campusano, in communication with Rodriguez, agreed with them to a detailed and somewhat complicated protocol involving two cars, a hostage, and opportunities to inspect both money and drugs before the final exchange.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if that evidence were somehow insufficient, the jury could have convicted based on an agreement among the defendants themselves. The jury could have found an agreement among the three defendants (or even two separate interlocking agreements between pairs of defendants) even if defendants never reached any agreement with the government agents. The testimony of the government witnesses regarding the conduct of the defendants at the various meetings was a sufficient basis for the jury to conclude that the defendants had agreed amongst themselves to obtain at least five kilograms of cocaine. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d 105, 113-14 (1st Cir.2002) (\"The jury may infer an agreement circumstantially by evidence of, <i>inter alia,</i> a common purpose (such as a purpose to sell illicit drugs), overlap of participants, and interdependence of various elements in the overall plan.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Lack of Money</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the fact that the government never recovered anything near the funds necessary to pay for even one kilogram of cocaine was a factual weakness. But it was not a fatal weakness. Pinillos repeatedly assured the government witnesses (before arriving in Puerto Rico, at the Espa&#241;a Bakery, and at the final meeting) not only that the money was available, but that he had seen it. The jury was entitled to believe these statements, and to infer that the money was secreted somewhere unknown to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Rodriguez's Connection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rodriguez argues that, even if there was a conspiracy and an attempt, his involvement was too peripheral to link him to either. But the government witnesses provided a sufficient basis to link him to both charges. All three government witnesses testified that, at the Espa&#241;a Bakery meeting, Rodriguez was acting as the leader and decisionmaker; Rafa testified that Rodriguez was introduced as such. Both Toro and Rafa testified that Pinillos and/or Campusano took direction from Rodriguez by cell phone at the second meeting, and all three government witnesses confirmed that, according to the usual protocol, the leader would only be present for the initial meeting, and certainly not for the actual handoff. Thus, the jury was entitled to infer that he was a member of the conspiracy, and either that he directly aided or abetted the other two defendants in their attempt, or was liable for their foreseeable acts within the scope of the conspiracy. <i>See Pinkerton v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 640, 647, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we reject appellants' argument that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the district court committed three errors during the course of the trial. All three appellants argue that the district court allowed improper and unfairly prejudicial expert testimony when it permitted Toro to testify, without any evidence of violence or guns in this case, that drug organizations are dangerous and keep their drugs near their firearms. Rodriguez makes two further arguments: (1) that the jury instructions failed to state that the jury could only convict a defendant of conspiracy if it found that the defendant conspired with at least one person who was not a government agent; and (2) that the instructions failed to incorporate certain principles from the Sentencing Guidelines regarding calculation of drug quantity in a reverse sting. We reject all of these arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Toro's Testimony</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Challenged Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Pinillos moved <i>in limine</i> to exclude expert testimony regarding the topic of coded references to drugs and drug trafficking, on the ground that the government had not complied with its obligation to disclose expert testimony under Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(E) (2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The government explained that it planned to ask both Toro and Rafa to testify about the use of code phrases in drug deals, and suggested that this was lay opinion testimony. The district court denied Pinillos's motion, but held that the proposed testimony would be \"regarded as expert testimony\" and ordered the government to disclose \"any information that is relevant to qualifying [a witness] as an expert to testify as to the meaning of drug related or coded drug phrases.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the pretrial wrangling, the government never actually moved to qualify Toro as an expert witness. Instead, early in its direct examination, after eliciting Toro's background and experience, it began asking general questions about the nature of drug organizations and, in particular, their violent nature. (No questions had yet been asked concerning code words.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first substantive question that the government asked of Toro was, \"What is your experience with how drug organizations operate as far as how do they maintain control of drugs <i>or the guns</i>?\" (Emphasis added). After a defense<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> objection, the government rephrased the question without reference to guns, and Toro answered that drug organizations had members \"who are engaged in safekeeping and protecting the drugs.\" The government then asked, \"And how do they protect the drugs?\" Over a defense objection, Toro was permitted to answer that the drugs \"are kept in a hidden place where they are protected with firearms.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony about the dangerous nature of drug organizations recurred later in Toro's direct examination, when he opined as to why the leader of a drug organization would not be physically present for the actual handoff:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most crucial and dangerous moment during the work of an undercover agent and everyone engaged in drug business is that time when the drugs and the money are handed over. Based on my experience, this is the point in time when any of the people involved, for any reason at that point in time, may lose his or her life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants objected on the ground that the testimony was inflammatory; the objection was overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When discussing the meeting at the Espa&#241;a Bakery, the government asked Toro whether, in his experience, drug traffickers bring innocent people to negotiations for the sale of drugs. Toro answered that they do not. The following discussion ensued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.

Why is it dangerous?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Because when you are involved in a drug transaction, you have drugs and money involved. No one wants to have their drugs stolen; no one wants to have their money stolen, and that's practically [sic] when there is large amounts of money involved and large amounts of drugs involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, when discussing the second meeting at the Plaza Carolina, Toro explained that if he \"had not demanded to see the money, it could look as though we were cops and things could get dangerous.\" The prosecutor asked for clarification, and Toro explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a drug transaction where you have agents &#8212; law enforcement agents from Puerto Rico and people who are engaged in drug trafficking, should these people become aware that we are agents, as has happened, it could cost us our lives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense objected \"as to what has happened in other cases,\" and the court sustained that objection, allowing into evidence, in the court's words, \"that if these people find out that they are law enforcement, it could cost their lives.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final contested statements came during Toro's explanation as to why he felt \"insecure\" and \"unsure\" in the car with Pinillos at the delivery site. Toro explained that at that time he \"didn't know if Campusano and Pinillos were with other people.\" The government asked for clarification as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.

Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that these statements were erroneously admitted because (1) they were not a proper subject of expert testimony, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702, and (2) they created a risk of unfair prejudice that substantially outweighed any probative value, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403. The government, perhaps missing the thrust of appellants' argument on appeal (which is not directed at the testimony regarding code words, but rather at that regarding violence), responds that code words are an appropriate subject for expert testimony, and the code word testimony was not prejudicial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> It also argues that Toro's testimony would have been admissible as lay opinion testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 701. We review the court's decision to admit the testimony for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Ayala-Pizarro,</i> 407 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' argument under Rule 702 is easily dispatched. \"It require[s] no special expertise for [an officer] to conclude, based on his observations, that places which sell drugs are often protected by people with weapons.\" <i>Ayala-Pizarro,</i> 407 F.3d at 29 (rejecting challenge to admission of such testimony as improper expert testimony). That type of testimony is admissible as lay opinion under Rule 701. <i>See Ayala-Pizarro,</i> 407 F.3d at 28-29. The same reasoning applies to the other testimony to which appellants object, e.g., that the moment when the drugs and money are handed over is the most dangerous part of the work of an undercover agent. As in <i>Ayala-Pizarro,</i> these matters were \"well founded on personal knowledge and susceptible to cross-examination,\" <i>id.</i> at 28 (quotation marks and citation omitted), and appropriate for lay opinion testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was the testimony inadmissible under Rule 403, under which evidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403. \"Trial judges enjoy wide latitude in making Rule 403 rulings and are only overturned after a showing of an egregious error.\" <i>United States v. Kornegay,</i> 410 F.3d 89, 96 (1st Cir.2005). The challenged statements had considerable probative value regarding, respectively, why the government might come to a drug transaction in which it planned to sell drugs without the actual drugs; why the leader of a drug organization would not be physically present for the actual handoff; why it would be unlikely that any defendant who was present at the Espa&#241;a Bakery meeting would be a mere innocent bystander; why it was important for the government agents to demand to see the money during the Plaza Carolina meeting; and why Toro called in the arrest before the \"sale\" had been consummated. To a significant extent, Toro's testimony about the dangerousness of drug transactions simply helped to explain his own conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, any danger of unfair prejudice was substantially dissipated. The first four of the five disputed references to guns or violence were general statements about how drug organizations typically operate, offered principally to explain Toro's own actions; only the last statement suggested that these particular defendants might potentially have some involvement with violence. All five statements were counterbalanced by the government's open concession (and Toro's admission on cross-examination) that no weapons were ever found on or near any defendant in this case. We do not discount that the testimony may have increased the impact of Toro's testimony in a manner unfavorable to appellants. But that is not enough to make a violation of Rule 403. \"Virtually all evidence is prejudicial &#8212; if the truth be told, that is almost always why the proponent seeks to introduce it &#8212; but it is only <i>unfair</i> prejudice against which the law protects.\" <i>United States v. Pitrone,</i> 115 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1997). The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the danger of unfair prejudice from the disputed testimony did not substantially outweigh its probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Instructions Regarding Conspiracy with Government Agent</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both before and after the jury charge, all three defendants requested an instruction that a jury can only convict a defendant of conspiracy if it finds that he conspired with at least one person who was <i>not</i> a government agent. In other words, there must be at least two true conspirators, and \"government agents do not count.\" <i>United States v. Giry,</i> 818 F.2d 120, 126 (1st Cir. 1987). The district court denied the request on the ground that the instruction is only applicable when the facts support the inference that the defendant and one or more government agents were the <i>only</i> participants in the agreement, and that scenario was not even the defense's theory of this case, let alone a reasonable inference from the facts. On appeal, Rodriguez maintains that the refusal to grant this instruction requires a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties spar over the standard of review, but we need not resolve that controversy. Instead, we will assume, in the appellant's favor, that the <i>de novo</i> standard applies. In order to conclude that Rodriguez had formed an agreement to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, but that he had reached this agreement solely with government agents, the jury would have had to accept an unlikely hybrid of Rodriguez's testimony and the government's theory of the case. Nevertheless, as unlikely as this version of events may be, we will also assume for argument's sake that the district court erred in denying the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the error was harmless in this case. <i>See United States v. Duff,</i> 76 F.3d 122, 127-28 (7th Cir. 1996) (where testimony showed that defendant \"participated in many of the [drug] organization's activities as one of its supervisors\" whereas government agent \"entered at the bottom[,] . . . . [n]o reasonable jury would have thought that [defendant] agreed only with [the government agent]\" and therefore the failure to give the instruction was harmless). In order for the instruction to have made a difference, the jury would have had to believe the following version of events. Rodriguez, who lives in Miami, flew to Puerto Rico. The next day, he visited Campusano &#8212; who also lived in Miami and whom he had known for about a year and a half &#8212; at his hotel. Campusano introduced Rodriguez to Pinillos, with whom he was staying. At no point did Rodriguez agree with either Campusano or Pinillos to obtain cocaine for distribution. The next day, Rodriguez accompanied Campusano and Pinillos to the Espa&#241;a Bakery. So far, Rodriguez had not agreed with anyone to obtain cocaine. At the bakery, all three defendants met with all three government agents, but Rodriguez still had not, by either words or conduct, agreed with either Campusano or Pinillos to obtain cocaine. Later, all three defendants stepped outside and talked with Rafa. At this point, and not before, Rodriguez reached an agreement to obtain cocaine &#8212; with Rafa alone, because Campusano and Pinillos were merely bystanders. Finally, Rodriguez either never relayed instructions to Campusano at the Plaza Carolina mall via mobile phone, or did it in such a way that he did not bring Campusano (let alone Pinillos) into the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, this is an unlikely scenario, to put it mildly. At the same time, the evidence for the government's version of events was considerably stronger. Indeed, the theory of the case under which the instruction could have made a difference was never advanced by Rodriguez or any other witness, and was less plausible than the theory of innocence that Rodriguez actually professed. To accept the hybrid version of events under which the instruction might have mattered, the jury would have had to disbelieve <i>both</i> the government witnesses (who testified that Rodriguez participated with Campusano and Pinillos in reaching an agreement) <i>and</i> Rodriguez himself (who testified that he was not involved in any discussions relating to the purchase of anything). Because the evidence for the government's version of events was so much stronger than the evidence for the version of events under which an error could have affected the verdict, we are easily satisfied that any such error \"does not affect substantial rights [and therefore] must be disregarded.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a). <i>Cf. Gillespie v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 386 F.3d 21, 30 (1st Cir. 2004) (in civil cases, \"[r]ecognizing that a jury is likely to prefer a better supported theory to one less supported, we have generously applied the harmless error concept to rescue verdicts where we could be <i>reasonably sure</i> that the jury in fact relied upon a theory with adequate evidentiary support\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Instructions Regarding Drug Quantity Calculation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court required the jury to answer a question on a special verdict form: \"Do you unanimously agree by proof beyond reasonable doubt that the quantity of cocaine involved in the conspiracy charged in count 1 was more than five kilograms as charged in the indictment?\" A similar question was applied to the attempt charge. The jury answered yes to each question for each defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez argues that the jury instructions were defective because they did not incorporate certain standards found in the Sentencing Guidelines for determination of drug quantity in a reverse sting:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an offense involving an agreement to sell a controlled substance, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance shall be used to determine the offense level unless the sale is completed and the amount delivered more accurately reflects the scale of the offense. . . . [I]n a reverse sting, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance would more accurately reflect the scale of the offense because the amount actually delivered is controlled by the government, not by the defendant. If, however, the defendant establishes that he or she did not intend to provide, or was not reasonably capable of providing, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance, the court shall exclude from the offense level determination the amount of controlled substance that the defendant establishes that he or she did not intend to provide or was not reasonably capable of providing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12 (2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez argues that application note 12 should have been incorporated into the jury charge, and that the jury might have found that since there was no evidence that he had even a tenth of the money needed to buy five kilograms of cocaine, he was not reasonably capable of purchasing five kilograms. Because Rodriguez did not request this instruction below, we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Medina-Martinez,</i> 396 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2005). Under this rigorous standard, Rodriguez must show that \"(1) an error occurred, (2) the error was clear or obvious, (3) the error affected his substantial rights, and (4) the error also seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may seem unusual to suggest that a principle from the Sentencing Guidelines, which are applied by the court (even under the post-<i>Booker</i> advisory regime), should govern a statutory determination. Indeed, Rodriguez has not cited any case from any court holding that any aspect of the Sentencing Guidelines must be incorporated into jury instructions. He does, however, cite <i>United States v. Lindia,</i> 82 F.3d 1154, 1160 (1st Cir. 1996), for the proposition that \"[a]pplication note 12 applies for the purposes of both the Sentencing Guidelines and the statutory penalties under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b).\" But Rodriguez has cited no case, and we have found none, suggesting that <i>Lindia</i> has any applicability to <i>jury</i> quantity determinations, or that application note 12 must be incorporated into jury instructions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we need not decide whether it would have been <i>correct</i> to <i>grant</i> a request to instruct the jury that it should exclude \"the amount of controlled substance that the defendant establishes that the defendant did not intend to provide or purchase or was not reasonably capable of providing or purchasing\" if the defendant <i>had</i> requested such an instruction, nor whether it would have been error to <i>deny</i> a timely request for such an instruction, nor even whether it was error to fail to so instruct <i>sua sponte.</i> The error, if any, was not \"clear or obvious,\" and therefore Rodriguez's challenge fails under plain error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellants allege various errors in sentencing, we need not address their claims. All three defendants challenged the district court's calculation of the drug quantity as 100 kilograms. The government concedes that all three defendants preserved claims at sentencing under <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which in turn suffices to preserve claims under <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005). We accept those concessions without further inquiry. The government further conceded at oral argument that it cannot show that the error was harmless, and therefore remand is appropriate. Consequently, all three appellants' sentences will be remanded for resentencing in light of <i>Booker.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cross-appeals from the district court's refusal to impose upon Rodriguez a mandatory life sentence based on its conclusion that he had inadequate notice of the government's intent to seek that sentence. If the prosecution intends to seek an enhanced sentence under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 based on prior convictions, it must \"before trial . . . file[] an information with the court (and serve[] a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that the prosecution filed and served a &#167; 851 information on October 17, 2002, the first day of trial. The question is whether it was served \"before trial.\" The government contends that it filed and personally served the information on October 17, 2002, the morning that the trial began, just before jury selection started. \"While such cliff-hanging practices are not wise,\" if \"the filing was made before jury selection, [then] that is all that was required.\" <i>United States v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo,</i> 70 F.3d 706, 715 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the courtroom deputy's notes for the morning of October 17, 2002, jury selection was delayed because Campusano's attorney was in a hearing in a different courtroom. The notes record that Campusano's attorney arrived at 10:45 A.M. and joined a bench conference already in progress. Jury selection began several minutes later, after the bench conference ended. Critically, the notes indicate that the information was filed at 10:45 A.M. &#8212; the same time that Campusano's attorney arrived, and a few minutes before jury selection began. That notation was consistent with the prosecutor's statement at the sentencing hearing that he personally filed the &#167; 851 information, and handed copies to Rodriguez and his counsel, shortly before jury selection began. However, while the notes suggest that the information was timely <i>filed,</i> they say nothing about when it was <i>served.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 18, 2003, the district court found that the information was timely filed and served, and denied Rodriguez's motion to strike the information. Rodriguez's sentencing hearing was held later that same day, and his counsel requested reconsideration. Counsel disputed the government's version of events, and noted that there was nothing in the record stating that Rodriguez had received the information. He further argued: A lot of times what the U.S. Attorney will do, Judge, is they'll stand up and announce, to make sure there's no problem, they'll stand up and announce in open court that notice has been filed, and the judge will voir dire the defendant to make sure that the defendant is aware of the fact that this has been filed. It's kind of like a prophylactic remedy to make sure that these types of issues do not occur. I'm not aware of anything in the record to suggest that the government announced this in open court and that Mr. Rodriguez was voir dired to make sure that he was aware of the filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly afterwards, the court conducted a bench conference, then stated for the record:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sidebar the Court was discussing with the attorneys whether the lack of voir dire by the Court directly with the defendant would preclude the enhancement because of prior convictions. We were discussing whether it is a requirement for the Court to voir dire the defendant as to the information that has been filed in Court, by informing him that this information has been filed in which the allegations as to prior convictions are such-and-such, and then asking him if he affirms or denies that he was previously convicted or that the convictions were invalid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That did not occur, and in all fairness to the defendant, I will state that for the record. We were waiting for [Campusano's counsel] to come, and the matter of the information was taken up at the informal sidebar conference, where the government had filed it and defendant counsel had previously been given notice and so had the defendant. On that I'm very clear, that he received &#8212; the filing was done before, the notice was done before the actual selection of the jury and voir dire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, if the dialogue of the Court with the defendant is a requirement is something that I don't have an answer to right now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then took a brief recess, and during the recess issued a written order stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Court is convinced, as stated in its previous Order, that the filing of the Information certifying that defendant committed this offense after two prior convictions was made before the selection of the jury commenced and that he was notified of the Information before voir dire started, the Court acknowledges that it did not conduct any inquiry directly with defendant as to his awareness of such filing and of the allegations of the Information, nor whether he affirmed or denied his previous convictions or claimed their invalidity. Since this is the practice followed by the Court in other cases, its absence in this case casts doubt on whether defendant [Rodriguez] was fully aware of the consequences of the filing of the Information and was able to rethink his decision to stand trial. For these reasons, the Court will not apply the enhancement based on his prior convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's final order could be read in two ways. The government interprets it to state, as a matter of law, that &#167; 851 notice is not complete unless the court addresses the defendant concerning the information before trial begins.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> If so, it would be an incorrect statement of law; there is no basis for such a requirement. However, Rodriguez argues that the court was simply making a factual inference: since this district court judge consistently, in other cases, discusses the information with the defendant on the record, the fact that no such discussion occurred in this case is evidence suggesting that the information may not have been timely served on Rodriguez. In other words, under this latter view, the absence of colloquy is relevant as part of a factual determination, not a legal requirement in itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final written order is at least susceptible to the reading that Rodriguez advocates. However, the government's interpretation seems more consistent with the district court's statement at the sentencing hearing that it was \"very clear, that [Rodriguez] received &#8212; the filing was done before, the notice was done before the actual selection of the jury and voir dire,\" and its expression of uncertainty only as to whether \"the dialogue of the Court with the defendant is a requirement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the stakes of construing the court's order incorrectly are potentially high, and a remand is already warranted under <i>Booker,</i> we decline to interpret the order. Rather, we suggest that the district court, on resentencing, clarify its original ruling. If the court initially declined to impose the enhanced sentence based <i>solely</i> on the conclusion that &#167; 851 requires a colloquy before trial &#8212; a conclusion we have now rejected &#8212; then the court should impose the enhanced sentence. If, on the other hand, the court correctly recognized that &#167; 851 does not require a colloquy before trial, and its written order reflected a factual determination of the events of October 17, 2002, or if there were other valid grounds for the order not apparent to us, the court need not impose a life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The convictions of appellants are <i>affirmed.</i> Their sentences of imprisonment are <i>vacated</i> and <i>remanded</i> for re-sentencing in light of <i>Booker.</i> For Rodriguez, the court should further determine whether a mandatory life sentence under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) applies. Whatever its intention, the court should, however, make reasonably specific findings that clarify its thinking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We refer to Rafa by alias mainly to avoid confusion with appellant Rodriguez-Zamot, but also because all witnesses so referred to him at trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Rafa and Pinillos had previously discussed paying $700,000 (half the purchase price) up front in Puerto Rico, and the remainder in New York when the drugs were actually delivered</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The basis for the obstruction of justice enhancement was perjury at trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> For perjury at trial<i>See supra</i> note 3.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> To be precise, Pinillos argues the first and third points, Campusano argues the second, and Rodriguez argues the fourth.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></span> (2005). Nelson \"Rafa\" Rodr&#237;guez, an experienced government informant of Colombian origin, first met defendant-appellant Jaime Pinillos-Prieto (\"Pinillos\") in Colombia in early 2001. In this meeting, Rafa<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> represented himself as a drug trafficker. Pinillos, in turn, represented himself as a facilitator of sorts who had access to potential cocaine buyers in the United States and the ability to launder drug money by using it to buy computers, which could then be imported legally into Colombia and sold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 2001, Pinillos telephoned Rafa (who was in Puerto Rico at the time) from Miami and said that he had a customer to buy 100 kilograms (kilos) of cocaine. Rafa asked Pinillos if the customer had the money &#8212; approximately $1.4 million, since the going rate was about $13,500 per kilo. Pinillos confirmed that the buyer had the money. During this telephone call, as in other communications, Rafa and Pinillos did not use the terms \"cocaine\" or \"kilos,\" but rather the terms \"laptops\" and \"computers,\" which, Rafa later testified, were code words designed to obscure their conversation in case law enforcement officers overheard them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rafa contacted his case agent at the Drug Enforcement Administration, who authorized him to proceed with a \"reverse sting\" operation. In a classic sting, government agents attempt to buy drugs from persons suspected of being drug sellers. In a reverse sting, government agents offer to sell drugs to persons suspected of being drug <i>buyers.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this reverse sting, Rafa would be part of a three-person team of \"sellers,\" and would serve as the negotiator and principal liaison to the buyers. Nataya \"Princesa\" Posada, a Colombian national and occasional government informant, would pose as the owner of the drugs. Special Agent Anthony Toro-Zambrana (\"Toro\") of the Special Investigations Bureau of the Puerto Rico Department of Justice, an undercover narcotics agent, would pose as Princesa's bodyguard and, as a Puerto Rican, one who was familiar with Puerto Rico and could arrange certain logistics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rafa and Pinillos arranged to meet on July 9, 2001 in the Espa&#241;a Bakery in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico to finalize a sale of 100 kilos at the market rate. At the appointed time, Rafa, Princesa, and Toro arrived at the bakery. Pinillos was already there, and joined them after they entered. The subsequent conversation was videotaped from outside the bakery, but no sound was recorded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After initial introductions, Pinillos assured the sellers that he had $700,000 ready for the purchase.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> However, he stated that his friends wanted first to buy one kilo and test its quality before committing to a larger purchase. Rafa and Princesa refused, saying they were there for a multi-kilo deal. Princesa pointed out that cocaine was traded wholesale in 25-kilo packages, and she would not open up a package just to extract one kilo. Rafa further noted that Pinillos's proposal was not in the buyers' interests, since the sellers could easily provide a high-quality test kilo and then sell them 99 low-quality kilos. Rafa suggested instead that the buyers purchase an entire 25-kilo package, and the buyers could test one kilo from that package while remaining assured that the other 24 kilos were of equal quality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pinillos then went to another table and conferred with two other men whom the \"sellers\" had not met, defendants-appellants Nolgie Rodriguez-Zamot (\"Rodriguez\") and Rodrigo Campusano. Pinillos shortly returned and related that his friends had rejected the 25-kilo proposal because that type of deal was how undercover police agents did business. Rafa and Princesa then suggested that, instead of communicating through Pinillos as an intermediary, they should talk directly to the buyers themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pinillos led Rafa, Princesa, and Toro to meet Rodriguez and Campusano, who were sitting at a nearby table, and introduced the group. Rodriguez was the owner of the money and therefore the principal on the buyers' side. Campusano was identified as the liaison between Rodriguez and Pinillos. The group then resumed negotiations. Rodriguez insisted that he wanted to buy just one kilo, and proceed from there if he was satisfied with the quality. Princesa (who, as leader of the \"sellers,\" was Rodriguez's counterpart) refused and made a counteroffer, which the buyers rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez and Campusano then abruptly left the bakery. Pinillos and Rafa followed them outside; Toro and Princesa remained behind. Rodriguez explained that he disliked doing business with women, and the way that Princesa wanted to arrange the deal was characteristic of a police sting. Outside the bakery, negotiations continued for another 15 or 20 minutes. Rodriguez was interested in making the purchase, but the two sides could not agree on various logistical details. The parties agreed to meet later that afternoon to continue talking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That afternoon, the group met at the parking lot of the Plaza Carolina shopping mall. By established protocol, the leaders (Rodriguez and Princesa) would not attend this or later meetings. Thus, the buyers were represented by Pinillos and Campusano, and the \"sellers\" by Rafa and Toro. During this meeting, Campusano spoke via mobile phone with Rodriguez, who insisted on receiving the drugs and testing the quality before delivering the money. The buyers continued to argue that the sellers' proposals were how undercover police do business; the \"sellers\" countered that the buyers' proposals were how thieves do business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the group reached an agreement. The transaction would involve two cars. First, Campusano would drive a car containing the money to the handoff site. After Rafa counted the money, the buyers would drive the car offsite. Then Rafa would signal for a car containing the drugs to come to the site. Campusano would drive that car away, leaving Pinillos with the \"sellers\" as a guarantee, i.e., a hostage. Once the buyers had verified the quantity and quality of the drugs, they would return with the \"money\" car; the sellers would take the money and Pinillos would be released. Pinillos and Rafa later agreed that this transaction would take place on July 11, 2001 at the parking lot of the Metropol Restaurant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the appointed time, Rafa and Toro arrived in the parking lot and waited. Pinillos arrived first and the group waited for Campusano to come with the \"money\" car. Pinillos appeared somewhat nervous but assured Rafa and Toro that everything was in order &#8212; he had seen the money, and the buyers were not planning to rob the \"sellers.\" Rafa sensed that something was not right and asked Pinillos to call Campusano, but Pinillos replied that Campusano would not be available by telephone. Rafa then asked whether the buyers were going to pay for one kilo or 25 kilos. Pinillos did not answer, but appeared anxious. Both Rafa and Toro grew concerned that the transaction was not proceeding as planned and that their lives might be at risk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Campusano arrived at the parking lot on foot. Toro decided that this was a bad sign. He called nearby agents, who surrounded the vehicle and arrested Pinillos and Campusano. Rodriguez was later arrested after a brief car chase. No drugs, money, or weapons were ever found on or near any defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 24, 2001, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Pinillos, Campusano, and Rodriguez. Count I charged that defendants conspired to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. Count II charged that defendants, aiding and abetting each other, attempted to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2(a) and 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). <i>See also</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II) (defining penalties for violations involving five or more kilograms of cocaine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants were represented separately but tried together. Rafa, Toro, and Princesa testified for the prosecution, presenting essentially identical accounts of the conversations at the three meetings (minus Princesa for the last two meetings). Rafa and Toro further testified on the use of code words in drug transactions, based on their experience investigating such deals. All three defendants testified and offered innocent explanations for their business in Puerto Rico: Pinillos was there to broker a computer sale; Rodriguez was visiting family; and Campusano was there as a favor to Pinillos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury instructions &#8212; to which the defendants did not object &#8212; required the jury to find, first, whether the defendants conspired and/or attempted to possess with intent to distribute cocaine; then, by special verdict form, whether \"the quantity of cocaine involved [in each count] was more than five kilograms as charged in the indictment?\" The jury found all defendants guilty on both counts, and that the amount involved was more than five kilograms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-sentence report computed the defendants' offense levels on the basis that the conspiracy involved 100 kilograms of cocaine. This led to a base offense level of 36. All three defendants objected to the 100 kilogram figure, arguing that they were not reasonably capable of purchasing that amount of cocaine because they did not have nearly enough money for such a purchase. The district court disagreed and found that the drug offenses involved 100 kilograms of cocaine. It therefore applied a base offense level of 36 for each defendant. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For Pinillos and Campusano, the court then applied a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 38.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> That total offense level led to guideline ranges of 235-293 months, and the court sentenced both Pinillos and Campusano to two concurrent terms of 235 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For Rodriguez, there was an additional issue. The government argued that Rodriguez's prior convictions mandated a sentence of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A), which states that \"[i]f any person commits a violation of this subparagraph . . . after two or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense have become final, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without release.\" However, a question arose as to whether Rodriguez had properly been notified that the government intended to introduce prior convictions to seek an enhanced sentence under &#167; 841. Prior convictions may not be used to increase the sentence for a drug offense \"unless before trial . . . the United States attorney files an information with the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a)(1). The record indicated that the government had, just minutes before jury selection, filed an information alleging Rodriguez's prior convictions, but it was not clear whether the information had been timely served.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court apparently concluded that Rodriguez had not received adequate notice, and therefore declined to consider Rodriguez's criminal history for purposes of the mandatory life sentence provision. Instead, it applied a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and a two-level enhancement for being a leader or manager under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), resulting in a total offense level of 40. Combined with his career offender status, that offense level led to a guideline range of 360 months to life. The court sentenced Rodriguez to two concurrent terms of 360 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants timely appealed their convictions and sentences. The government cross-appealed from the court's denial of a mandatory life sentence for Rodriguez under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). We begin with appellants' challenges to their convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All three appellants argue that the evidence is insufficient to sustain their conspiracy or attempt convictions. We review such challenges <i>de novo,</i> \"drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, to ascertain if a rational jury could have found that the government proved each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 12 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Appellants collectively<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> raise four different arguments in support of their insufficiency claims: (1) the parties never mentioned \"cocaine\" or \"kilos,\" but rather were negotiating for the sale of computers; (2) even if appellants actually intended to arrange the sale of cocaine, no agreement was reached because the parties could not agree on how much to sell or how to structure a two-phase transaction; (3) any desire to purchase drugs was inchoate and would be impeded by factual impossibility since appellants lacked the money to purchase anywhere near the quantities of cocaine alleged; and (4) if an agreement was reached, appellant Rodriguez was not present when it was reached, and if an attempt was made, he was not present when it was made. We address each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Cocaine versus \"Computers\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is readily dispatched. Both Rafa and Toro testified extensively on the use of code words in drug transactions, and the jury was entitled to believe the government witnesses over Pinillos, who insisted that it was all some sort of misunderstanding arising from a failed negotiation over Compaq Presario laptops.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Furthermore, it is not quite true that the parties never mentioned \"cocaine\" or \"kilos.\" During its cross-examination of Pinillos, the government confronted him with the transcript of a telephone conversation in which he told Rafa \"[t]hat they stole from me six, one. There's my kilo, brother. There's my kilo.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Alleged Lack of Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument (which is addressed only to the conspiracy charge, since attempt does not require an agreement) also fails. First, a rational jury could conclude from the evidence at trial that, despite initial disagreements about the logistics of the transaction, the group eventually reached an agreement during the second meeting. Rafa and Toro testified that Pinillos and Campusano, in communication with Rodriguez, agreed with them to a detailed and somewhat complicated protocol involving two cars, a hostage, and opportunities to inspect both money and drugs before the final exchange.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if that evidence were somehow insufficient, the jury could have convicted based on an agreement among the defendants themselves. The jury could have found an agreement among the three defendants (or even two separate interlocking agreements between pairs of defendants) even if defendants never reached any agreement with the government agents. The testimony of the government witnesses regarding the conduct of the defendants at the various meetings was a sufficient basis for the jury to conclude that the defendants had agreed amongst themselves to obtain at least five kilograms of cocaine. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Medina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776396\"><a href=\"/opinion/776396/united-states-v-marcos-martinez-medina-united-states-of-america-v-manuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 113-14 (1st Cir.2002) (\"The jury may infer an agreement circumstantially by evidence of, <i>inter alia,</i> a common purpose (such as a purpose to sell illicit drugs), overlap of participants, and interdependence of various elements in the overall plan.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Lack of Money</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the fact that the government never recovered anything near the funds necessary to pay for even one kilogram of cocaine was a factual weakness. But it was not a fatal weakness. Pinillos repeatedly assured the government witnesses (before arriving in Puerto Rico, at the Espa&#241;a Bakery, and at the final meeting) not only that the money was available, but that he had seen it. The jury was entitled to believe these statements, and to infer that the money was secreted somewhere unknown to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Rodriguez's Connection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rodriguez argues that, even if there was a conspiracy and an attempt, his involvement was too peripheral to link him to either. But the government witnesses provided a sufficient basis to link him to both charges. All three government witnesses testified that, at the Espa&#241;a Bakery meeting, Rodriguez was acting as the leader and decisionmaker; Rafa testified that Rodriguez was introduced as such. Both Toro and Rafa testified that Pinillos and/or Campusano took direction from Rodriguez by cell phone at the second meeting, and all three government witnesses confirmed that, according to the usual protocol, the leader would only be present for the initial meeting, and certainly not for the actual handoff. Thus, the jury was entitled to infer that he was a member of the conspiracy, and either that he directly aided or abetted the other two defendants in their attempt, or was liable for their foreseeable acts within the scope of the conspiracy. <i>See Pinkerton v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 647, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

All three appellants argue that the district court allowed improper and unfairly prejudicial expert testimony when it permitted Toro to testify, without any evidence of violence or guns in this case, that drug organizations are dangerous and keep their drugs near their firearms. Rodriguez makes two further arguments: (1) that the jury instructions failed to state that the jury could only convict a defendant of conspiracy if it found that the defendant conspired with at least one person who was not a government agent; and (2) that the instructions failed to incorporate certain principles from the Sentencing Guidelines regarding calculation of drug quantity in a reverse sting. We reject all of these arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Toro's Testimony</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Challenged Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Pinillos moved <i>in limine</i> to exclude expert testimony regarding the topic of coded references to drugs and drug trafficking, on the ground that the government had not complied with its obligation to disclose expert testimony under Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(E) (2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The government explained that it planned to ask both Toro and Rafa to testify about the use of code phrases in drug deals, and suggested that this was lay opinion testimony. The district court denied Pinillos's motion, but held that the proposed testimony would be \"regarded as expert testimony\" and ordered the government to disclose \"any information that is relevant to qualifying [a witness] as an expert to testify as to the meaning of drug related or coded drug phrases.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the pretrial wrangling, the government never actually moved to qualify Toro as an expert witness. Instead, early in its direct examination, after eliciting Toro's background and experience, it began asking general questions about the nature of drug organizations and, in particular, their violent nature. (No questions had yet been asked concerning code words.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first substantive question that the government asked of Toro was, \"What is your experience with how drug organizations operate as far as how do they maintain control of drugs <i>or the guns</i>?\" (Emphasis added). After a defense<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> objection, the government rephrased the question without reference to guns, and Toro answered that drug organizations had members \"who are engaged in safekeeping and protecting the drugs.\" The government then asked, \"And how do they protect the drugs?\" Over a defense objection, Toro was permitted to answer that the drugs \"are kept in a hidden place where they are protected with firearms.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony about the dangerous nature of drug organizations recurred later in Toro's direct examination, when he opined as to why the leader of a drug organization would not be physically present for the actual handoff:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most crucial and dangerous moment during the work of an undercover agent and everyone engaged in drug business is that time when the drugs and the money are handed over.

Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that these statements were erroneously admitted because (1) they were not a proper subject of expert testimony, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702, and (2) they created a risk of unfair prejudice that substantially outweighed any probative value, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403. The government, perhaps missing the thrust of appellants' argument on appeal (which is not directed at the testimony regarding code words, but rather at that regarding violence), responds that code words are an appropriate subject for expert testimony, and the code word testimony was not prejudicial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> It also argues that Toro's testimony would have been admissible as lay opinion testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 701. We review the court's decision to admit the testimony for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Ayala-Pizarro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201579\"><a href=\"/opinion/201579/united-states-v-ayala-pizarro/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' argument under Rule 702 is easily dispatched. \"It require[s] no special expertise for [an officer] to conclude, based on his observations, that places which sell drugs are often protected by people with weapons.\" <i>Ayala-Pizarro,</i> 407 F.3d at 29 (rejecting challenge to admission of such testimony as improper expert testimony). That type of testimony is admissible as lay opinion under Rule 701. <i>See Ayala-Pizarro,</i> 407 F.3d at 28-29. The same reasoning applies to the other testimony to which appellants object, e.g., that the moment when the drugs and money are handed over is the most dangerous part of the work of an undercover agent. As in <i>Ayala-Pizarro,</i> these matters were \"well founded on personal knowledge and susceptible to cross-examination,\" <i>id.</i> at 28 (quotation marks and citation omitted), and appropriate for lay opinion testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was the testimony inadmissible under Rule 403, under which evidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403. \"Trial judges enjoy wide latitude in making Rule 403 rulings and are only overturned after a showing of an egregious error.\" <i>United States v. Kornegay,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201633\"><a href=\"/opinion/201633/united-states-v-kornegay/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 96 (1st Cir.2005). The challenged statements had considerable probative value regarding, respectively, why the government might come to a drug transaction in which it planned to sell drugs without the actual drugs; why the leader of a drug organization would not be physically present for the actual handoff; why it would be unlikely that any defendant who was present at the Espa&#241;a Bakery meeting would be a mere innocent bystander; why it was important for the government agents to demand to see the money during the Plaza Carolina meeting; and why Toro called in the arrest before the \"sale\" had been consummated. To a significant extent, Toro's testimony about the dangerousness of drug transactions simply helped to explain his own conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, any danger of unfair prejudice was substantially dissipated. The first four of the five disputed references to guns or violence were general statements about how drug organizations typically operate, offered principally to explain Toro's own actions; only the last statement suggested that these particular defendants might potentially have some involvement with violence. All five statements were counterbalanced by the government's open concession (and Toro's admission on cross-examination) that no weapons were ever found on or near any defendant in this case. We do not discount that the testimony may have increased the impact of Toro's testimony in a manner unfavorable to appellants. But that is not enough to make a violation of Rule 403. \"Virtually all evidence is prejudicial &#8212; if the truth be told, that is almost always why the proponent seeks to introduce it &#8212; but it is only <i>unfair</i> prejudice against which the law protects.\" <i>United States v. Pitrone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197373\"><a href=\"/opinion/197373/united-states-v-pitrone/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1997). The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the danger of unfair prejudice from the disputed testimony did not substantially outweigh its probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Instructions Regarding Conspiracy with Government Agent</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both before and after the jury charge, all three defendants requested an instruction that a jury can only convict a defendant of conspiracy if it finds that he conspired with at least one person who was <i>not</i> a government agent. In other words, there must be at least two true conspirators, and \"government agents do not count.\" <i>United States v. Giry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488024\"><a href=\"/opinion/488024/united-states-v-pierre-michel-henri-giry-and-steven-seward/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 126 (1st Cir. 1987). The district court denied the request on the ground that the instruction is only applicable when the facts support the inference that the defendant and one or more government agents were the <i>only</i> participants in the agreement, and that scenario was not even the defense's theory of this case, let alone a reasonable inference from the facts. On appeal, Rodriguez maintains that the refusal to grant this instruction requires a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties spar over the standard of review, but we need not resolve that controversy. Instead, we will assume, in the appellant's favor, that the <i>de novo</i> standard applies. In order to conclude that Rodriguez had formed an agreement to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, but that he had reached this agreement solely with government agents, the jury would have had to accept an unlikely hybrid of Rodriguez's testimony and the government's theory of the case. Nevertheless, as unlikely as this version of events may be, we will also assume for argument's sake that the district court erred in denying the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the error was harmless in this case. <i>See United States v. Duff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712266\"><a href=\"/opinion/712266/united-states-v-michael-anthony-duff-mason-p-peck-thomas-lee-ridley/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span>, 127-28 (7th Cir. 1996) (where testimony showed that defendant \"participated in many of the [drug] organization's activities as one of its supervisors\" whereas government agent \"entered at the bottom[,] . . . . [n]o reasonable jury would have thought that [defendant] agreed only with [the government agent]\" and therefore the failure to give the instruction was harmless). In order for the instruction to have made a difference, the jury would have had to believe the following version of events. Rodriguez, who lives in Miami, flew to Puerto Rico. The next day, he visited Campusano &#8212; who also lived in Miami and whom he had known for about a year and a half &#8212; at his hotel. Campusano introduced Rodriguez to Pinillos, with whom he was staying. At no point did Rodriguez agree with either Campusano or Pinillos to obtain cocaine for distribution. The next day, Rodriguez accompanied Campusano and Pinillos to the Espa&#241;a Bakery. So far, Rodriguez had not agreed with anyone to obtain cocaine. At the bakery, all three defendants met with all three government agents, but Rodriguez still had not, by either words or conduct, agreed with either Campusano or Pinillos to obtain cocaine. Later, all three defendants stepped outside and talked with Rafa. At this point, and not before, Rodriguez reached an agreement to obtain cocaine &#8212; with Rafa alone, because Campusano and Pinillos were merely bystanders. Finally, Rodriguez either never relayed instructions to Campusano at the Plaza Carolina mall via mobile phone, or did it in such a way that he did not bring Campusano (let alone Pinillos) into the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, this is an unlikely scenario, to put it mildly. At the same time, the evidence for the government's version of events was considerably stronger. Indeed, the theory of the case under which the instruction could have made a difference was never advanced by Rodriguez or any other witness, and was less plausible than the theory of innocence that Rodriguez actually professed. To accept the hybrid version of events under which the instruction might have mattered, the jury would have had to disbelieve <i>both</i> the government witnesses (who testified that Rodriguez participated with Campusano and Pinillos in reaching an agreement) <i>and</i> Rodriguez himself (who testified that he was not involved in any discussions relating to the purchase of anything). Because the evidence for the government's version of events was so much stronger than the evidence for the version of events under which an error could have affected the verdict, we are easily satisfied that any such error \"does not affect substantial rights [and therefore] must be disregarded.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a). <i>Cf.

Consequently, all three appellants' sentences will be remanded for resentencing in light of <i>Booker.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cross-appeals from the district court's refusal to impose upon Rodriguez a mandatory life sentence based on its conclusion that he had inadequate notice of the government's intent to seek that sentence. If the prosecution intends to seek an enhanced sentence under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 based on prior convictions, it must \"before trial . . . file[] an information with the court (and serve[] a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that the prosecution filed and served a &#167; 851 information on October 17, 2002, the first day of trial. The question is whether it was served \"before trial.\" The government contends that it filed and personally served the information on October 17, 2002, the morning that the trial began, just before jury selection started. \"While such cliff-hanging practices are not wise,\" if \"the filing was made before jury selection, [then] that is all that was required.\" <i>United States v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196443\"><a href=\"/opinion/196443/united-states-v-carrasquillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 715 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the courtroom deputy's notes for the morning of October 17, 2002, jury selection was delayed because Campusano's attorney was in a hearing in a different courtroom. The notes record that Campusano's attorney arrived at 10:45 A.M. and joined a bench conference already in progress. Jury selection began several minutes later, after the bench conference ended. Critically, the notes indicate that the information was filed at 10:45 A.M. &#8212; the same time that Campusano's attorney arrived, and a few minutes before jury selection began. That notation was consistent with the prosecutor's statement at the sentencing hearing that he personally filed the &#167; 851 information, and handed copies to Rodriguez and his counsel, shortly before jury selection began. However, while the notes suggest that the information was timely <i>filed,</i> they say nothing about when it was <i>served.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 18, 2003, the district court found that the information was timely filed and served, and denied Rodriguez's motion to strike the information. Rodriguez's sentencing hearing was held later that same day, and his counsel requested reconsideration. Counsel disputed the government's version of events, and noted that there was nothing in the record stating that Rodriguez had received the information. He further argued: A lot of times what the U.S. Attorney will do, Judge, is they'll stand up and announce, to make sure there's no problem, they'll stand up and announce in open court that notice has been filed, and the judge will voir dire the defendant to make sure that the defendant is aware of the fact that this has been filed. It's kind of like a prophylactic remedy to make sure that these types of issues do not occur. I'm not aware of anything in the record to suggest that the government announced this in open court and that Mr. Rodriguez was voir dired to make sure that he was aware of the filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly afterwards, the court conducted a bench conference, then stated for the record:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sidebar the Court was discussing with the attorneys whether the lack of voir dire by the Court directly with the defendant would preclude the enhancement because of prior convictions. We were discussing whether it is a requirement for the Court to voir dire the defendant as to the information that has been filed in Court, by informing him that this information has been filed in which the allegations as to prior convictions are such-and-such, and then asking him if he affirms or denies that he was previously convicted or that the convictions were invalid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That did not occur, and in all fairness to the defendant, I will state that for the record. We were waiting for [Campusano's counsel] to come, and the matter of the information was taken up at the informal sidebar conference, where the government had filed it and defendant counsel had previously been given notice and so had the defendant. On that I'm very clear, that he received &#8212; the filing was done before, the notice was done before the actual selection of the jury and voir dire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, if the dialogue of the Court with the defendant is a requirement is something that I don't have an answer to right now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then took a brief recess, and during the recess issued a written order stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Court is convinced, as stated in its previous Order, that the filing of the Information certifying that defendant committed this offense after two prior convictions was made before the selection of the jury commenced and that he was notified of the Information before voir dire started, the Court acknowledges that it did not conduct any inquiry directly with defendant as to his awareness of such filing and of the allegations of the Information, nor whether he affirmed or denied his previous convictions or claimed their invalidity. Since this is the practice followed by the Court in other cases, its absence in this case casts doubt on whether defendant [Rodriguez] was fully aware of the consequences of the filing of the Information and was able to rethink his decision to stand trial. For these reasons, the Court will not apply the enhancement based on his prior convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's final order could be read in two ways. The government interprets it to state, as a matter of law, that &#167; 851 notice is not complete unless the court addresses the defendant concerning the information before trial begins.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> If so, it would be an incorrect statement of law; there is no basis for such a requirement. However, Rodriguez argues that the court was simply making a factual inference: since this district court judge consistently, in other cases, discusses the information with the defendant on the record, the fact that no such discussion occurred in this case is evidence suggesting that the information may not have been timely served on Rodriguez. In other words, under this latter view, the absence of colloquy is relevant as part of a factual determination, not a legal requirement in itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final written order is at least susceptible to the reading that Rodriguez advocates. However, the government's interpretation seems more consistent with the district court's statement at the sentencing hearing that it was \"very clear, that [Rodriguez] received &#8212; the filing was done before, the notice was done before the actual selection of the jury and voir dire,\" and its expression of uncertainty only as to whether \"the dialogue of the Court with the defendant is a requirement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the stakes of construing the court's order incorrectly are potentially high, and a remand is already warranted under <i>Booker,</i> we decline to interpret the order. Rather, we suggest that the district court, on resentencing, clarify its original ruling. If the court initially declined to impose the enhanced sentence based <i>solely</i> on the conclusion that &#167; 851 requires a colloquy before trial &#8212; a conclusion we have now rejected &#8212; then the court should impose the enhanced sentence. If, on the other hand, the court correctly recognized that &#167; 851 does not require a colloquy before trial, and its written order reflected a factual determination of the events of October 17, 2002, or if there were other valid grounds for the order not apparent to us, the court need not impose a life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The convictions of appellants are <i>affirmed.</i> Their sentences of imprisonment are <i>vacated</i> and <i>remanded</i> for re-sentencing in light of <i>Booker.</i> For Rodriguez, the court should further determine whether a mandatory life sentence under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) applies. Whatever its intention, the court should, however, make reasonably specific findings that clarify its thinking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We refer to Rafa by alias mainly to avoid confusion with appellant Rodriguez-Zamot, but also because all witnesses so referred to him at trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Rafa and Pinillos had previously discussed paying $700,000 (half the purchase price) up front in Puerto Rico, and the remainder in New York when the drugs were actually delivered</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The basis for the obstruction of justice enhancement was perjury at trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> For perjury at trial<i>See supra</i> note 3.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> To be precise, Pinillos argues the first and third points, Campusano argues the second, and Rodriguez argues the fourth.

However, the government has advised us that, despite the apparent absence of an applicable order from the district court, it is the general practice in the District of Puerto Rico to treat an objection by one defendant as applicable to all defendants. Because of the uncertainty, we give appellants the benefit of the doubt.
