The Compulsory Liability Joint\n\nUnderwriting Association of Puerto Rico (\"JUA\"), a Commonwealth-\n\ncreated entity, filed a lawsuit against Juan A. Flores Galarza\n\n(\"Flores Galarza\" or \"Secretary\"), then the Secretary of the\n\nTreasury of the Commonwealth, in both his official and personal\n\ncapacities,1 claiming that he violated the Takings Clause of the\n\nUnited   States   Constitution   by   withholding     from    the     JUA   and\n\nappropriating     insurance   premiums    generated   by     Puerto    Rico's\n\ncompulsory liability insurance law to alleviate the cash-flow\n\nproblems of the Commonwealth. Flores Galarza moved for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings, claiming that the forms of relief sought by the\n\nplaintiff (declaratory, injunctive, and damages) were barred by the\n\nEleventh Amendment and the doctrine of qualified immunity.                  The\n\n\n\n\n1\n  During the pendency of this case, Juan Carlos Méndez replaced\nFlores Galarza as Secretary of the Treasury. As a matter of law,\nMéndez was automatically substituted as a party for Flores Galarza\nin his official capacity as Secretary.       See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n25(d)(1) (\"When a public officer is a party to an action in his\nofficial capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or\notherwise ceases to hold office, the action does not abate and the\nofficer's successor is automatically substituted as a party.\").\nFlores Galarza remains a party in his personal capacity.       See,\ne.g., Batistini v. Aquino, 890 F.2d 535, 536 n.1 (1989). While the\nparties' briefs do not acknowledge this substitution, these\nmisnomers do not affect the substantial rights of the parties and,\ntherefore, we disregard them.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d)(1)\n(\"[M]isnomer[s] not affecting the substantial rights of the parties\nshall be disregarded.\").    For the sake of consistency with the\nparties' briefs, we use the name of the former Secretary of the\nTreasury, Flores Galarza, when referring to the official-capacity\nsuit against the Secretary.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fdistrict       court   denied    that   motion.         We    have   before    us    an\n\ninterlocutory appeal from that denial.\n\n               Among other complexities, this case tests the sometimes\n\nuncertain boundary between official- and personal-capacity claims\n\nagainst    a    government      official,       and   the    applicability    of    the\n\nqualified immunity doctrine to an unusual takings claim.                      For the\n\nreasons set forth below, after concluding that the JUA has standing\n\nto sue Flores Galarza, we conclude that, consistent with the\n\nEleventh Amendment, Flores Galarza is amenable to suit in his\n\nofficial capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief, but is\n\nprotected from damages in his personal capacity by the doctrine of\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n                                           I.\n\nA.   Law 253:      The Compulsory Liability Insurance System\n\n               The following facts are drawn from the complaint and,\n\nwhere noted, from relevant statutory and case law. On December 27,\n\n1995, in response to financial losses from uncompensated damages to\n\nmotor vehicles in traffic accidents, the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico   (\"Commonwealth\")          enacted     the      Compulsory     Motor    Vehicle\n\nLiability Insurance Act, Act No. 253 (\"Law 253\"), codified at P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 8051-61.             Under Law 253, liability insurance\n\ncoverage is required for all motor vehicles that travel on public\n\nthoroughfares.         Law 253 \"provides each insured vehicle owner with\n\n$3000 of coverage for damages caused to third parties per accident\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fin exchange for a uniform premium, initially set at $99 for each\n\nprivate passenger vehicle and $148 for each commercial vehicle.\"\n\nArroyo-Melecio v. P.R. Am. Ins. Co., 398 F.3d 56, 60-61 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 8052(j), 8056(a)).\n\n            All \"private insurers\" – defined under Law 253 as those\n\nwith more than 1% of the total volume of vehicle liability premiums\n\nin Puerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 8052(b) – are required to\n\nprovide compulsory liability insurance in one of two ways.         First,\n\nprivate insurers are \"bound to provide the compulsory liability\n\ninsurance to those motor vehicle owners that request it,\" id. §\n\n8054(a), unless those owners meet certain statutory criteria, most\n\nof which \"identify applicants who are bad drivers or otherwise of\n\nhigh risk,\" Arroyo-Melecio, 398 F.3d at 61.             Second, private\n\ninsurers are required to provide compulsory liability insurance as\n\nmembers of the JUA, to which they must belong.            The JUA is an\n\nassociation of all private insurers in Puerto Rico, which \"provides\n\ncompulsory liability insurance to all drivers, including those\n\nhigh-risk   drivers   whom   private   insurers   are   not   required   to\n\ninsure.\"    Id. (footnote omitted).      \"Through the JUA, the risk of\n\ninsuring these high-risk drivers is thus spread among all the\n\nprivate insurers.\"    Id. at 62.\n\n            Every vehicle owner must either: (1) pay the premium for\n\ncompulsory liability insurance to the Secretary of the Treasury at\n\nthe time that the owner acquires or renews a vehicle license,\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\feffectively as part of the license payment; or (2) opt out of the\n\ncompulsory   liability   insurance   scheme   by   privately   purchasing\n\nliability insurance with comparable or better coverage.         Id. at 61\n\nn.2 (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 8061).2       In the case of those\n\nvehicle owners who pay the Secretary for compulsory liability\n\ninsurance, \"[t]he [JUA] shall receive from the Secretary of the\n\nTreasury the total amount of the compulsory liability insurance\n\npremiums received by said official, for its eventual distribution\n\namong the private insurers and the [JUA] itself, as the case may\n\nbe.\"   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 8055(c).     The JUA's administrative\n\nand operating expenses are \"charged to the amount received from the\n\ncorresponding premiums according to this distribution.\"         Id.\n\n             If a vehicle owner does not present a Certificate of\n\nCompliance proving that he carries traditional liability insurance,\n\nhe must pay the compulsory liability insurance premium on the date\n\n\n2\n  Section 8061(a) states that motor vehicle owners with sufficient\n\"traditional\" liability insurance may rely on that coverage to\ncomply with Law 253. \"Traditional liability insurance\" is defined\nby Law 253 as standard vehicle insurance, which in turn is defined\nin P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 407(1) as, inter alia, insurance\nprotecting against both personal and property damage \"resulting\nfrom or incident to ownership, maintenance, or use of any . . .\nvehicle.\"\n     According to the JUA's website, individuals who have the\nrequisite amount of traditional liability insurance may obtain a\nCertificate of Compliance from their insurer to present when they\nobtain or renew licenses, and may thereby avoid paying the\ncompulsory insurance premium to the Secretary. See P.R. Laws Ann.\ntit. 26, § 8061(b) (empowering the Insurance Commissioner to\nestablish regulations \"so that motor vehicle owners who comply with\nthe insurance requirements of subsection (a) of this section may\npresent attesting proof of . . . compliance\").\n\n                                 -5-\n\fof issuance or renewal of the vehicle license, and may then seek\n\nreimbursement directly from the JUA or from his insurer, who will,\n\nin turn, seek reimbursement from the JUA.3                  Thus, the funds\n\ntransferred from the Secretary to the JUA appear to consist of: (1)\n\npremium payments from individuals seeking to purchase insurance\n\nthrough the JUA who paid the Secretary, as required by the statute,\n\nwhen they obtained or renewed their vehicle licenses, (2) duplicate\n\npremium payments from individuals who are purchasing the compulsory\n\ninsurance   directly   from   a   private   insurer,    but   who    paid   the\n\ncompulsory assessment to the Secretary along with their license\n\nfees (and who thus are eligible for a refund from the JUA), and (3)\n\nduplicate premium payments from individuals who have adequate\n\ntraditional   liability   coverage,       but   who   did   not   obtain    the\n\nCertificate of Compliance that would have exempted them from the\n\ncompulsory assessment (who also are eligible for a refund).                 The\n\nJUA is responsible for distributing the premiums it receives from\n\nthe Secretary to its member insurers for the coverage they provide.\n\nArroyo-Melecio, 398 F.3d at 61 n.2.4\n\n\n3\n  The statute does not indicate whether individuals who privately\npurchase only the compulsory coverage – and not the more\ncomprehensive traditional liability coverage – may avoid the\npremium payment to the Secretary by presenting proof of coverage.\nFor purposes of this appeal, we assume that they may not, and that,\nconsequently, this group of vehicle owners must seek later\nreimbursement of their duplicate payments.\n4\n  Although the JUA's member insurers provide the                    compulsory\ncoverage, \"every vehicle for which the requisite                    compulsory\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            The JUA is required to file an annual statement with the\n\nInsurance    Commissioner   detailing    its   financial   condition,\n\ntransactions, and affairs for the preceding calendar year. Because\n\na portion of the total amount of premiums received by the JUA may\n\nbe owed to third parties who seek refunds for duplicate payments –\n\ni.e., vehicle owners who bought insurance from a private insurer\n\nbut also paid the compulsory liability premium when obtaining\n\nlicenses, or private insurers who have reimbursed their insureds\n\nfor payment of the compulsory premium – the JUA is required by\n\nregulation to set aside these premiums and accumulate them in a\n\nseparate reserve account (\"Reserve\").5\n\n\n\n\nliability insurance premium has been paid is considered to be\ninsured by the JUA unless the owner of the vehicle opts out by\nselecting a private insurer or purchasing a traditional insurance\npolicy.\" Arroyo-Melecio, 398 F.3d at 61 n.2.\n5\n  Pursuant to the general provisions of Puerto Rico's Insurance\nCode, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 2603-2607, the JUA's obligation to\nreimburse these so-called \"unearned premiums\" lasts seven years,\nafter which time the premiums lapse to the Insurance Commissioner\nand are then deposited in the general fund of the Commonwealth\nTreasury.    Although the JUA did not reference this general\nprovision in either its brief before us or at oral argument, Puerto\nRico's Insurance Code makes clear that this general provision\napplies to the compulsory liability insurance system under Law 253.\nSee id. § 2612 (\"The [general provision governing unclaimed funds]\nshall prevail over the provisions of any other chapter present or\nfuture which may be in conflict herewith.\").        Flores Galarza\ninvokes this statutory provision in his brief.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fB.    The Secretary's Withholding of Funds\n\n            Since the effective date of the compulsory liability\n\ninsurance system on January 1, 1998,6 the JUA has been unable to\n\ndetermine exactly how many registered motor vehicles in Puerto Rico\n\nare covered by private liability insurance.            The JUA initially\n\nestimated that 25% of all vehicles were covered by policies from\n\nprivate insurers, and, accordingly, set aside 25% of all premiums\n\nreceived and accumulated them in the Reserve.        By 2001, experience\n\nand   additional   data   revealed    that   the   actual   proportion   of\n\nprivately insured registered motor vehicles was closer to 17%.           As\n\na result, the Reserve as disclosed in the December 2001 annual\n\nstatement – approximately $73 million – exceeded the actual amount\n\nowed to third parties by approximately $10 million (\"Overstated\n\nReserve Funds\"). In other words, the JUA set aside and accumulated\n\nin the Reserve approximately $10 million more than was actually\n\nowed to privately insured vehicle owners and their insurers who\n\nwould be seeking reimbursement for the purchase of duplicative\n\ncompulsory liability insurance. In 2001, the JUA sought permission\n\nfrom the Insurance Commissioner to adjust the Reserve to the\n\naccumulated level that it would have been if only 17% of all\n\n\n6\n  While Law 253 was enacted in 1995, the compulsory liability\ninsurance system established under Law 253 did not take effect\nuntil January 1, 1998. 1995 P.R. Laws 253, § 16.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fpremiums had been set aside, rather than 25%.        The Insurance\n\nCommissioner agreed to allow the JUA to adjust the Reserve for the\n\n2001 fiscal year, but did not allow any adjustments for the\n\npreceding fiscal years.\n\n           In 1998 and 1999, the Secretary collected the insurance\n\npremiums and transferred them to the JUA in accordance with Law\n\n253.7   The JUA then set aside a portion of these premiums in the\n\nReserve.   Beginning in 2000, however, the Secretary discontinued\n\nthe transfer of compulsory liability insurance premiums to the JUA\n\nin an attempt to ease the Commonwealth's cash-flow problems.8   On\n\n\n\n\n7\n  At oral argument, counsel for the JUA explained that \"[p]rior to\nthe year 2000, the premiums were being turned over [by the\nSecretary] . . . in a term of about 30-60 days,\" which the JUA\nfound \"reasonable, given the bureaucratic process\" involved with\nsuch transfers.\n8\n  The record contains conflicting information about when the\nSecretary began withholding the compulsory insurance premiums. At\noral argument before us, in their appellate brief, and in their\nopposition to Flores Galarza's motion for judgment on the\npleadings, the JUA states that the Secretary withheld the insurance\npremiums beginning in 2000. In the complaint, the JUA likewise\nstates that it was forced to liquidate its investments as early as\nJanuary 2000 \"[a]s a result of the [Secretary's] failure to\ntransfer th[e premiums].\" Elsewhere in the complaint, however, the\nJUA states that the Secretary withheld premiums \"[d]uring the past\ntwo years,\" which would mean that the alleged withholding began in\napproximately February 2001, based on the February 2003 filing date\nof the complaint. Flores Galarza argues that \"although not alleged\nin the complaint, the supposed withholding of the transfers would\nhave started on March 2001.\" While our analysis does not require\nthat we resolve this discrepancy, we use for our analysis the\nearliest date that Flores Galarza is alleged to have withheld the\npremiums (January 2000), which date is supported by the record at\nthis stage of the proceedings.\n\n                                -9-\n\fMay 30, 2002, the JUA filed a petition for mandamus against the\n\nSecretary in the Puerto Rico Superior Court, requesting an order\n\nthat the Secretary transfer to the JUA the withheld compulsory\n\nliability insurance premiums. By September 2002, the Secretary had\n\nwithheld approximately $173 million in premiums from the JUA.\n\nBecause of the Secretary's failure to transfer the insurance\n\npremiums, the JUA was forced to liquidate approximately $98 million\n\nof investments in order to comply with its own cash-flow needs.\n\nThe liquidation of the JUA's investments, together with the lost\n\nopportunity to invest new premiums, resulted in a loss to the JUA\n\nof $14.2 million in interest.         Despite the Secretary's withholding\n\nof premiums, the JUA continued to reimburse privately insured\n\nmotorists and their insurers from its own funds. From January 2002\n\nthrough September 2002, the JUA reimbursed third parties out-of-\n\npocket a total of $13.6 million (\"Out-of-Pocket Funds\").\n\nC.   The 2002 Amendment to Law 253\n\n            On   September    11,    2002,   the     Puerto   Rico   Legislature\n\namended Law 253, 2002 P.R. Laws 230 (\"2002 Amendment\"), to require\n\nthe JUA to turn over to the Secretary all funds held in the Reserve\n\nas of December 31, 2001 (i.e., $73 million), and to continue\n\nproviding   such   funds     every    two    years    thereafter.      The   2002\n\nAmendment requires the Secretary to keep these funds in a fiduciary\n\ncapacity for five years, to be reimbursed to owners of privately\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\finsured motor vehicles and their insurers who seek refunds, after\n\nwhich time the funds become the property of the Commonwealth and\n\npass to the general fund of the Commonwealth Treasury.9                   The 2002\n\nAmendment also provides that any excess funds in the Reserve, that\n\nis, any funds included in the Reserve based on estimates which\n\nexceed the actual amount owed to third parties (the Overstated\n\nReserve Funds), shall be immediately available for use by the\n\nCommonwealth.       Income generated from the funds provided to the\n\nSecretary shall also be immediately available for use by the\n\nCommonwealth. Lastly, while the Secretary continues to transfer to\n\nthe   JUA    the   total     amount     of   compulsory     liability    insurance\n\npremiums, the 2002 Amendment allows the Secretary to deduct from\n\nthese premiums a fee for the collection service it performs.\n\nD.    The 2002 Settlement\n\n             In November 2002, pursuant to a settlement stipulation in\n\nthe   mandamus     action    in   the    Puerto     Rico   Superior     Court,   the\n\nSecretary transferred to the JUA a significant portion of the $173\n\nmillion     in   insurance    premiums       that   had    been   withheld   (\"2002\n\nSettlement\").10     Rather than transferring the full amount of funds\n\n9\n  The 2002 Amendment thus allocates the seven-year period provided\nby the general provisions of Puerto Rico's Insurance Code, P.R.\nLaws Ann. tit. 26, § 2603, among the JUA (which holds the funds for\ntwo years) and the Secretary (who holds the funds for five\nadditional years), after which time the funds lapse to the general\nfund of the Commonwealth Treasury.\n10\n  In his answer to the JUA's complaint, Flores Galarza asserts\nthat, by November 2002, he had paid the JUA approximately $85.8\n\n                                         -11-\n\fwithheld, however, the Secretary retained approximately $73 million\n\n– an amount corresponding to the amount of funds in the Reserve as\n\nof December 2001, which the JUA was required to turn over to the\n\nSecretary pursuant to the 2002 Amendment.\n\n                               II.\n\n          In February 2003, the JUA filed a complaint under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 against Flores Galarza in his personal capacity and\n\nin his official capacity as Secretary of the Treasury.11    In the\n\ncomplaint, the JUA alleged that Flores Galarza took the JUA's\n\n\nmillion ($8,576,709.37 on October 23, 2002 and $77,190,384.31 on\nNovember 13, 2002), which amount represented \"all the moneys\" owed\nto the [JUA].\" While the JUA's complaint suggests that the amount\npaid by Flores Galarza was closer to $100 million, what matters for\npurposes of our analysis is the amount which Flores Galarza did not\npay – $73 million. The parties do not dispute that these funds\nwere never paid to the JUA.\n11\n  Defendant-Appellant Annabelle Rodríguez, then the Secretary of\nJustice of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is not listed as a\ndefendant in either the complaint or in the district court order\nthat is the subject of this appeal. The first mention of Rodríguez\ncomes in the Notice of Interlocutory Appeal, which references her\nby political office only, not by name.       The parties refer to\nRodríguez again – this time, in her official capacity as Secretary\nof Justice – in the caption on their briefs before us, but neither\nparty makes any argument respecting her. Assuming that Rodríguez\nwas properly joined as a party to this action, she ceased to be a\nparty when she left her post as Secretary of Justice in 2004 and\nwas succeeded by William Vazquez Irizarry, who was, in turn,\nsucceeded by the present Secretary of Justice, Roberto J. Sánchez\nRamos.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d).     We therefore do not reach\nRodríguez's interests here.      Furthermore, since neither the\ncomplaint nor the district court order lists the Secretary of\nJustice as a party, and since neither party argues that we should\nadjudicate the interests of the Secretary of Justice in this\nappeal, we do not reach the interests of Sánchez Ramos. On remand,\nit will be important for the district court to clarify Sánchez\nRamos's status in this litigation.\n\n                               -12-\n\fproperty without just compensation and deprived the JUA of its\n\nproperty   without   due   process    in    violation   of   the   Fifth   and\n\nFourteenth Amendments and § 1983.12         Specifically, the JUA contends\n\nthat \"in order to alleviate the Commonwealth's cash-flow problems,\"\n\nFlores Galarza temporarily withheld \"for [an] unreasonable period[]\n\nof time\" (i.e., from January 2000 through November 2002) $173\n\nmillion in insurance premiums, which are \"the private property of\n\nthe [JUA]\" and \"which [Flores Galarza] was bound by law to transfer\n\nto JUA.\"    By temporarily withholding these premiums, the JUA\n\nargues, Flores Galarza also wrongfully appropriated $14.2 million\n\nin \"interest generated by those premiums [which is] also the\n\nprivate property of the [JUA].\"       While Flores Galarza subsequently\n\npaid to the JUA a large portion of the withheld premiums pursuant\n\nto the 2002 Settlement, the JUA argues that by retaining $73\n\nmillion, an amount of funds equal to the Reserve as of December\n\n2001, Flores Galarza wrongfully appropriated the following amounts:\n\napproximately $10 million13 in Overstated Reserve Funds which do not\n\n\n12\n   For the sake of clarity, we note that § 1983 cannot be\n\"violated,\" as the JUA suggests in the complaint. \"Section 1983\ndoes not confer substantive rights but merely provides a means to\nvindicate rights conferred by the Constitution or laws of the\nUnited States.\"   Wilson v. Spain, 209 F.3d 713, 715 (8th Cir.\n2000). Here, the JUA seeks to vindicate its right under the Fifth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to be free from an uncompensated taking.\n13\n   The JUA uses two different percentages to calculate the\nOverstated Reserve Funds, and therefore arrives at two different\ntotals for such funds.      As noted above, the JUA originally\nestimated that 25% of all registered motor vehicles were privately\ninsured, and so set aside 25% of all premiums received and\n\n                                     -13-\n\fbelong to third parties and therefore constitute the JUA's private\n\nproperty; and approximately $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds\n\nwhich the JUA was forced to pay to third parties from its own funds\n\nwhen Flores Galarza withheld $173 million in insurance premiums to\n\nmeet the cash-flow needs of the Commonwealth.14\n\n\n\n\naccumulated them in the Reserve. In its complaint, the JUA argues\nthat the number of privately insured motor vehicles as of 2001 was\nactually 17.4%, which means that the JUA overstated the Reserve by\napproximately $10 million.    In its brief before us and at oral\nargument, however, the JUA argues that the number of privately\ninsured motor vehicles in 2001 was actually 19.3%, which means that\nthe Reserve was overstated by approximately $8 million. Counsel\nfor the JUA also explained at oral argument that the Insurance\nCommissioner used the higher percentage in adjusting the Reserve\nfor fiscal year 2001.     The Secretary says nothing about this\ndiscrepancy. Because we must draw all reasonable inferences in\nfavor of the non-movant when considering a motion for judgment on\nthe pleadings, and because the 17% figure set forth in the\ncomplaint would presumably yield a higher damages award for the JUA\nthan the 19% figure, i.e., $10 million as opposed to $8 million, we\nuse the lower percentage yielding the higher damages amount for\npurposes of our analysis.\n     We note that even that amount might understate the damages\nfigure.   If, as the JUA indicates, the Reserve is based on the\nestimated total number of privately insured vehicles – in an\nattempt to reflect the greatest number of owners who might be\nentitled to a refund – the Reserve would contain more than the\namount needed for reimbursement to the extent that any of the\nprivately insured owners had avoided payment of the compulsory\ninsurance premium by presenting a Certificate of Compliance. Such\nowners would not be entitled to a refund, but the Reserve would\ninclude enough to reimburse them based on their private insurance\nstatus.\n14\n  The record does not contain the 2002 Settlement. Therefore, it\nis not clear whether the JUA is suing for more than they agreed to\nin the settlement. Because the record does not permit us to answer\nthis question, and because Flores Galarza does not raise the issue,\nwe do not address it.\n\n                               -14-\n\f              The JUA requested relief in the form of a declaratory\n\njudgment that Flores Galarza \"infringed upon the rights guaranteed\n\nunder the Takings Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process\n\nClause\" by temporarily withholding the insurance premiums and\n\npermanently taking the interest generated by those premiums, the\n\nOverstated Reserve Funds, and the Out-of-Pocket Funds. Because the\n\nJUA   does    not    argue   that   Flores      Galarza's    taking      of   property\n\nviolated its substantive or procedural due process rights under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, the JUA appears to invoke the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment only for purposes of bringing a Fifth Amendment Takings\n\nclaim against Flores Galarza.            See Chi., Burlington & Quincy R.R.\n\nCo. v. City of Chi., 166 U.S. 226, 239 (1897) (holding that the\n\nTakings Clause of the Fifth Amendment is applicable to the states\n\nthrough      the    Fourteenth   Amendment).        Our     Fourteenth        Amendment\n\ninquiry is therefore limited to the JUA's takings claim.\n\n              The JUA also sought injunctive relief enjoining Flores\n\nGalarza, in his official capacity, from \"engaging in violations of\n\nJUA's [constitutional] rights,\" that is, from withholding any more\n\ninsurance premiums.15         In addition, it sought to enjoin him from\n\n\"[a]ttempting        to   enforce   or    impose    upon     JUA   the    terms    and\n\nconditions of [the 2002 Amendment] . . . inasmuch as they amount to\n\n\n\n15\n  The JUA conceded at oral argument that the Secretary resumed\ntransfer of the insurance premiums following the filing of this\naction in February 2003, thereby \"correct[ing]\" the \"situation\nwhich caused this problem . . . for the time being.\"\n\n                                         -15-\n\fan unconstitutional taking,\" that is, from requiring the JUA to\n\ntransfer funds accumulating in the Reserve to the Secretary every\n\ntwo years (which funds must be retained by the Secretary for an\n\nadditional five years before lapsing to the general fund),16 and\n\nfrom retaining interest income accruing on the Reserve funds as\n\nwell as any excess Reserve funds, i.e., the Overstated Reserve\n\nFunds that are not actually owed to third parties (which funds\n\nshall lapse immediately to the general fund).              Finally, the JUA\n\nsought from Flores Galarza, in his personal capacity, approximately\n\n$38 million in damages:        $10 million in Overstated Reserve Funds,\n\n$13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds, and $14.2 million in lost\n\ninterest as a result of Flores Galarza's taking of the insurance\n\npremiums.\n\n            Flores   Galarza    filed   a   motion   for   judgment   on   the\n\npleadings pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), arguing that:            the JUA\n\nlacked standing to sue Flores Galarza in any capacity; Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity barred the JUA from suing Flores Galarza in his\n\nofficial capacity; and the doctrine of qualified immunity barred\n\nthe JUA from suing Flores Galarza in his personal capacity.                The\n\ndistrict court denied Flores Galarza's motion, holding that the JUA\n\n16\n  While the JUA seeks to enjoin the Secretary from enforcing the\nterms of the 2002 Amendment, which requires the JUA to transfer\nfunds in the Reserve to the Secretary every two years, the JUA does\nnot challenge the general provisions of Puerto Rico's Insurance\nCode, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 2601-2607, which require that any\npremiums not claimed within seven years must be paid to the\nInsurance Commissioner.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fwas not an arm of the state and therefore was not precluded from\n\nsuing Flores Galarza;17 that Flores Galarza was not entitled to\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity because the declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief sought by the JUA was prospective, as was the JUA's claimed\n\nright to \"money allegedly unconstitutionally attached\" by Flores\n\nGalarza, i.e., \"the insurance premiums for the compulsory liability\n\ninsurance [and] . . . certain funds belonging to JUA\"; and that\n\nFlores Galarza was not entitled to qualified immunity because the\n\nJUA alleged a constitutional violation that was well established at\n\nthe time of the alleged conduct.      Flores Galarza filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration that was also denied.        This interlocutory appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                  III.\n\n            We address in this section various preliminary issues,\n\nincluding    the   JUA's   standing   and   the   rationale   supporting\n\ninterlocutory review.      We raised two issues sua sponte, mindful of\n\nour obligation to consider the basis of appellate jurisdiction,\n\neven if the parties have assumed its existence.           See Espinal-\n\nDominguez v. Puerto Rico, 352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir. 2003).       After\n\n\n17\n  The court denied Flores Galarza's arm-of-the-state claim without\nprejudice, noting that Flores Galarza could \"present the issue\nagain via summary disposition[,] providing evidence as to whether\nthe state bore legal liability for the entities['] debts or the\nrisk that the damages will be paid from the public treasury.\"\nInstead of moving for summary judgment or providing any new\nevidence, Flores Galarza filed this interlocutory appeal because of\nthe court's immunity rulings.\n\n                                  -17-\n\foral argument, we asked the parties to submit supplemental briefs\n\naddressing the following questions: (1) whether the JUA's claim\n\nmeets the prudential ripeness requirements of the Supreme Court's\n\njurisprudence on takings, and (2) whether the res judicata doctrine\n\nbars our review.      As we discuss below, neither of those doctrines\n\nprecludes      our   jurisdiction.         Nor   do    we   find    any   other\n\njurisdictional barriers to this interlocutory appeal.\n\nA.   Availability of Interlocutory Review\n\n              Generally speaking, appeals are permitted only from final\n\njudgments of the district court.            28 U.S.C. § 1291.       There are,\n\nhowever, several exceptions.         \"Chief among these is the so-called\n\ncollateral order doctrine,\" by which \"an order may be appealed\n\nimmediately if it 'finally determine[s] claims of right separable\n\nfrom,   and    collateral   to,   rights    asserted   in   the    action,   too\n\nimportant to be denied review and too independent of the cause\n\nitself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until\n\nthe whole case is adjudicated.'\"            Espinal-Dominguez, 352 F.3d at\n\n495 (quoting Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541,\n\n546 (1949)).\n\n              Orders denying claims of Eleventh Amendment immunity and\n\nqualified immunity, to the extent they turn on issues of law, fall\n\nwithin the ambit of this exception, and are thus immediately\n\nappealable to this Court.          See P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v.\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fMetcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 143 (1993) (\"[O]rders denying\n\nindividual officials' claims of . . . qualified immunity are among\n\nthose   that       fall    within      the   ambit    of   [the    collateral      order\n\ndoctrine]. . . .           [W]e agree[] that the same rationale ought to\n\napply to claims of Eleventh Amendment immunity made by States and\n\nstate entities possessing a claim to share in that immunity.\")\n\n(citations and footnote omitted); Pagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16,\n\n26 (1st Cir. 2006) (stating that denial of qualified immunity is an\n\nappealable final decision).              Flores Galarza claims that, even on\n\nthe facts construed in the light most favorable to the JUA, he is\n\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity in his official capacity\n\nand qualified immunity in his personal capacity as a matter of law.\n\nThe district court's denial of these claims thus falls within the\n\ncollateral order doctrine.\n\nB.   Ripeness\n\n              A    plaintiff     frequently         must   scale   \"two   independent\n\nprudential hurdles\" before bringing a takings claim against state\n\nentities in federal court.             Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency,\n\n520 U.S. 725, 733-34 (1997).                   The Supreme Court explained in\n\nWilliamson County Reg'l Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson\n\nCity,   473       U.S.    172,   194   (1985),      that   such    a   plaintiff    must\n\ndemonstrate that he has both received a final decision from the\n\nstate on the use of his property and \"sought 'compensation through\n\n\n                                             -19-\n\fthe procedures the State has provided for doing so,'\" Suitum, 520\n\nU.S. at 734 (quoting Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 194).\n\n          The plaintiff in Williamson County had alleged that the\n\napplication of various zoning laws and regulations to its property\n\nin Tennessee amounted to a taking of that property.      The Supreme\n\nCourt held that the claim was not ripe because the plaintiff had\n\n\"not yet obtained a final decision regarding the application of the\n\nzoning ordinance and subdivision regulations to its property, nor\n\nutilized the procedures Tennessee provides for obtaining just\n\ncompensation.\"   473 U.S. at 186.   The Court noted that the Board of\n\nZoning Appeals had the power to approve variances to the zoning\n\nordinance, and the Planning Commission could grant variances from\n\nthe subdivision regulations.        The plaintiff, however, had not\n\nsought such variances, and thus, \"respondent has not yet obtained\n\na final decision regarding how it will be allowed to develop its\n\nproperty.\"    Id. at 190.\n\n          The Court held that the claim also was not ripe for a\n\nsecond reason: the plaintiff had not sought recovery through the\n\nstate's inverse condemnation procedure, under which a property\n\nowner may seek just compensation for an alleged taking of property\n\neffected by restrictive zoning laws or development regulations.\n\nId. at 196.   The Court explained that, because the Fifth Amendment\n\nproscribes not the taking of property, but takings without just\n\ncompensation, \"[if] the government has provided an adequate process\n\n\n                                -20-\n\ffor obtaining compensation, and if resort to that process 'yield[s]\n\njust compensation,' then the property owner 'has no claim against\n\nthe Government' for a taking.\"                   Id. at 194-95 (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1013\n\nn.21 (1984)).        Because the plaintiff in Williamson County \"ha[d]\n\nnot shown that the inverse condemnation procedure is unavailable or\n\ninadequate,\" the takings claim was premature \"until it has utilized\n\nthat procedure,\" id. at 197.                Cf. González-Álvarez v. Rivero-\n\nCubano, 426 F.3d 422, 427 (1st Cir. 2005) (finding no Williamson\n\nCounty ripeness barriers where plaintiffs claimed that cancellation\n\nof their milk production quotas violated the Takings Clause: \"Since\n\nin   this    case,    the   state   has    always     clearly   denied   that   any\n\ncompensation would be due and there is no state remedy available\n\nfor seeking compensation, the second hurdle falls away.\").\n\n             For multiple reasons, the Williamson County prudential\n\nripeness concerns are inapposite here.                First, to the extent that\n\nthe JUA is making a facial statutory challenge, its takings claim\n\nneed   not    be     brought   first      to     a   Commonwealth   body,   either\n\nadministrative or judicial.               See Suitum, 520 U.S. at 736 n.10\n\n(\"'[F]acial' challenges to regulation are generally ripe the moment\n\nthe challenged regulation or ordinance is passed, but face an\n\n'uphill battle,' since it is difficult to demonstrate that '\"mere\n\nenactment\"' of a piece of legislation 'deprived [the owner] of\n\neconomically viable use of [his] property.'\") (citations omitted);\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fYee v. City of Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 534 (1992) (finding\n\npetitioners' facial challenge ripe because it \"does not depend on\n\nthe extent to which petitioners are deprived of the economic use of\n\ntheir particular pieces of property or the extent to which these\n\nparticular petitioners are compensated\"); Quicken Loans, Inc. v.\n\nWood, 449 F.3d 944, 953 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that a facial\n\ntakings claim was ripe when the challenged statutes were enacted);\n\nPharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n v. Rowe, 429 F.3d 294, 307 (1st      Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"[A] facial challenge is usually ripe 'the moment the challenged\n\nregulation or ordinance is passed,'\" but \"'face[s] an uphill\n\nbattle.'\" (alterations in original)(citations omitted)).          The JUA\n\narguably has stated two facial challenges: (1) that Law 253 effects\n\na taking in failing to provide for the transfer to the JUA of\n\ninterest earned on its money during the time the Commonwealth holds\n\nthe funds; and (2) that the 2002 Amendment effects a taking by\n\nrequiring transfer to the Commonwealth of the excess reserve funds,\n\nsome of which belong to the JUA, and by explicitly \"taking\" the\n\ninterest on those funds to use for Commonwealth operations.\n\n           More   significantly,    however,   the   Williamson    County\n\nrequirements are not fully applicable to the type of taking alleged\n\nhere.   The Court in Suitum noted that Williamson County identified\n\n\"two independent prudential hurdles to a regulatory takings claim\n\nbrought against a state entity in federal court.\"      520 U.S. at 733-\n\n34 (emphasis added).   This is not a regulatory takings case.        The\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fJUA    has   alleged   a     physical    taking   –   \"a   direct   government\n\nappropriation . . . of private property,\" Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A.\n\nInc., 544 U.S. 528, 537 (2005) – and the analysis for such a claim\n\ndiffers from that of a regulatory taking.               See infra at Section\n\nV(A)(2).      We previously have held that the finality prong of\n\nWilliamson County is inapplicable to physical takings and that only\n\nthe \"just compensation\" prong remains. See Pascoag Reservoir & Dam\n\nLLC v. Rhode Island, 337 F.3d 87, 91-92 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"In a\n\nphysical taking case, the final decision requirement is relieved or\n\nassumed . . . .        However, . . . '[c]ompensation must first be\n\nsought from the state if adequate procedures are available.'\")\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n             Even if both Williamson County prerequisites applied,\n\nhowever, they would not foreclose our jurisdiction.             The case law\n\naddressing the first \"hurdle\" focuses on whether the administrative\n\nbody   responsible     for    applying    the   challenged   regulations   has\n\ncompleted    discretionary      review    of    the   plaintiff's   particular\n\nsituation.     Here, there is no pending administrative process that\n\ncould, through a variance, waiver or other discretionary decision,\n\nmodify the statute's impact on the JUA.18\n\n\n18\n  The Court in Williamson County emphasized the distinction between\nthe finality requirement it was describing and the need to exhaust\nremedies, which is not a prerequisite to a suit brought under §\n1983. The Court explained:\n\n       While the policies underlying the two concepts often\n       overlap, the finality requirement is concerned with\n\n                                        -23-\n\f          Nor   does   the   second   \"hurdle\"   –   the   need   to   seek\n\ncompensation through procedures provided by the state – pose a\n\nbarrier here.   See Suitum, 520 U.S. at 734 (\"The second hurdle\n\nstems from the Fifth Amendment's proviso that only takings without\n\n\n     whether the initial decisionmaker has arrived at a\n     definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual,\n     concrete injury; the exhaustion requirement generally\n     refers to administrative and judicial procedures by which\n     an injured party may seek review of an adverse decision\n     and obtain a remedy if the decision is found to be\n     unlawful or otherwise inappropriate. . . .\n          The difference is best illustrated by comparing the\n     procedure for seeking a variance with the procedures\n     that, under Patsy[v. Florida Board of Regents, 457 U.S.\n     496 (1982)], respondent would not be required to exhaust.\n     While it appears that the State provides procedures by\n     which an aggrieved property owner may seek a declaratory\n     judgment regarding the validity of zoning and planning\n     actions taken by county authorities, respondent would not\n     be required to resort to those procedures before bringing\n     its § 1983 action, because those procedures clearly are\n     remedial. Similarly, respondent would not be required to\n     appeal the Commission's rejection of the preliminary plat\n     to the Board of Zoning Appeals, because the Board was\n     empowered, at most, to review that rejection, not to\n     participate in the Commission's decisionmaking.\n          Resort to those procedures would result in a\n     judgment whether the Commission's actions violated any of\n     respondent's rights.      In contrast, resort to the\n     procedure for obtaining variances would result in a\n     conclusive determination by the Commission whether it\n     would allow respondent to develop the subdivision in the\n     manner respondent proposed. The Commission's refusal to\n     approve the preliminary plat does not determine that\n     issue; it . . . leaves open the possibility that\n     respondent may develop the subdivision according to its\n     plat after obtaining the variances.        In short, the\n     Commission's denial of approval does not conclusively\n     determine whether respondent will be denied all\n     reasonable beneficial use of its property, and therefore\n     is not a final, reviewable decision.\n\n473 U.S. at 193-94 (citations omitted).\n\n                                 -24-\n\f'just compensation' infringe that Amendment; 'if a State provides\n\nan adequate procedure for seeking just compensation, the property\n\nowner cannot claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause\n\nuntil    it     has   used       the     procedure       and    been       denied      just\n\ncompensation.'\" (quoting Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 195)).\n\nMost commonly in regulatory takings cases – which typically involve\n\nland-use      regulation     –   such     a   procedure        is   a    state   inverse\n\ncondemnation proceeding.19             See, e.g., Williamson County, 473 U.S.\n\nat 196; Urban Developers LLC v.

Rather, a\n       \"condemnation\" proceeding is commonly understood to be an\n       action brought by a condemning authority such as the\n       Government in the exercise of its power of eminent\n       domain. . . .\n\n       . . . .\n\n            . . . The phrase \"inverse condemnation\" appears to\n       be one that was coined simply as a shorthand description\n       of the manner in which a landowner recovers just\n       compensation for a taking of his property when\n       condemnation proceedings have not been instituted.\n\nUnited States v. Clarke, 445 U.S. 253, 255-57 (1980).\n\n                                          -25-\n\freferring specifically to an inverse condemnation remedy).                        For\n\ntakings   claims     asserted      against    the    federal     government,      the\n\napplicable procedure is a claim brought under the Tucker Act.\n\nWilliamson County, 473 U.S. at 195 (\"[T]aking claims against the\n\nFederal Government are premature until the property owner has\n\navailed   itself   of    the    process      provided     by    the   Tucker   Act.\"\n\n(citation omitted)); see also Student Loan Mktg. Ass'n v. Riley,\n\n104 F.3d 397, 401          (D.C. Cir. 1997) (\"Normally a taking claim\n\nagainst the federal government must be brought as a suit for money\n\ndamages   (i.e.,   the     'just    compensation'        that   the   Constitution\n\nassures) under the Tucker Act . . . .\") (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1491).\n\n           The key component of this prong of Williamson County is\n\nthe   availability    of    a   process   that      is   particularly     aimed    at\n\nproviding compensation when government action effects a taking.\n\nSee, e.g., McNamara v. City of Rittman, 473 F.3d 633, 638 (6th Cir.\n\n2007) (noting that \"the critical inquiry\" after Williamson County\n\nis whether the state has \"'reasonable, certain[] and adequate'\"\n\ncompensation procedures, and identifying mandamus as the vehicle\n\navailable to Ohio landowners who were not provided the required\n\n\"appropriation proceeding\") (citations omitted).20                    In our view,\n\n\n20\n  Under Ohio law, a government actor seeking to take property must\nbring a statutory \"appropriation proceeding\" against the landowner.\nColes v. Granville, 448 F.3d 853, 865 (6th Cir. 2006). Because\nOhio has no \"inverse condemnation or other direct, statutory cause\nof action for plaintiffs seeking just compensation for a taking,\"\nthe state's courts over time concluded that property owners who\nbelieve a taking has occurred without the statutory process could\n\n                                      -26-\n\fsuch procedures do not include litigation of a state takings claim\n\nor any general remedial cause of action under state law.          Rather,\n\nthe Supreme Court must have had in mind only those procedures\n\nspecifically designed by the state to avoid constitutional injury\n\nin the first instance by providing a means for a plaintiff to\n\nobtain compensation for the government's taking of property.\n\n           An inverse condemnation cause of action is a classic\n\nexample of such a particularized procedure; it gives a property\n\nowner aggrieved by government conduct the opportunity to obtain\n\ncompensation,   thereby    avoiding       an   unconstitutional       taking.\n\nRequiring plaintiffs to avail themselves of such a procedure before\n\nbringing a federal takings claim protects the state's opportunity\n\nto use the scheme it designed specifically to avoid constitutional\n\ninjury.   By contrast, requiring plaintiffs to invoke any generally\n\navailable state procedure that might provide a remedy for an\n\nuncompensated   taking    before   bringing     a   federal   claim    would\n\n\"transform[] Williamson County's finality rule into a rule of\n\nexhaustion,\" Washlefske v. Winston, 234 F.3d 179, 183 (4th Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n           This result would be in diametric opposition\n           to a foundational decision of modern § 1983\n           jurisprudence, Monroe v. Pape, which held that\n\n\ninitiate a mandamus action \"to force the government actor into the\ncorrect appropriation proceeding.\"     Id.   In Ohio, therefore,\nmandamus as a vehicle to obtain an appropriation proceeding\neffectively substitutes for the more common inverse condemnation\nprocess.\n\n                                   -27-\n\f            \"[t]he federal remedy is supplementary to the\n            State remedy, and the latter need not be first\n            sought and refused before the federal one is\n            invoked.\"\n\nId.

The risk of preclusion\n\n                                     -28-\n\fbecomes a reality when, in the course of ruling on the plaintiff's\n\ncompensation claim, the state court reaches federal constitutional\n\nissues.    See San Remo Hotel, 545 U.S. at 342-43; see also Torromeo\n\nv. Town of Fremont, 438 F.3d 113, 117 (1st Cir. 2006) (affirming\n\nres judicata dismissal of federal takings claim where claim \"was\n\nactually litigated to a final judgment on the merits in the state\n\ncourt\") (emphasis in original).         At least some of the commentary\n\nassumes that federal takings plaintiffs would need to pursue an\n\navailable state takings claim, among other procedures, to meet the\n\nWilliamson County requirements – which almost inevitably would lead\n\nto   an   overlap   with   federal   principles.   See,   e.g.,   Judicial\n\nJurisdiction Stripping, supra at 204-05.\n\n            We consider a state takings claim to be remedial in\n\nnature, however, and not a \"procedure[] the State has provided for\n\n[seeking compensation],\" Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 194.          See\n\nid. at 194 n.13 (contrasting review procedures with \"procedures\n\nthat allow a property owner to obtain compensation for a taking\").\n\nA takings claim seeks damages for the unconstitutional taking of\n\nproperty without due compensation.          By contrast – as discussed\n\nabove – an inverse condemnation proceeding is designed to enable\n\nplaintiffs to obtain compensation – which, if granted, would avoid\n\nthe alleged constitutional violation that the takings claim is\n\nintended to remedy.        This is a subtle, but important distinction.\n\nAs with more general remedial provisions, requiring a state takings\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fclaim as a prerequisite to a federal takings claim effectively\n\nwould impose an exhaustion requirement – which the Supreme Court\n\nexplicitly said it did not do in Williamson County.       Moreover,\n\nalthough we have not done a survey, we suspect that, like Puerto\n\nRico, most state constitutions have takings provisions.    See P.R.\n\nConst. Art. II, §9.   We thus think it likely that the Supreme Court\n\nwould have made explicit reference to a state takings claim if it\n\ndeemed such a cause of action a relevant \"procedure\" for purposes\n\nof the second prong of Williamson County.21\n\n\n21\n  In his concurrence, our colleague notes that the Supreme Court\naddressed exhaustion in the context of the finality requirement\nbut did not suggest a similar limitation on the state litigation\nprong.   Although the Court's primary discussion of exhaustion\noccurred with respect to finality, it reiterated that review\nprocedures need not be exhausted when explaining the need for \"a\nproperty owner [to] utilize procedures for obtaining compensation.\"\n473 U.S. at 194 n.13.\n     We note, in addition, that at least some of the cases\nidentified in the concurrence as rejecting our limitation on the\nlitigation requirement are not wholly in conflict with our view\nthat Williamson County requires resort to a procedure akin to\ninverse condemnation. For example, in Villager Pond, Inc. v. Town\nof Darien, 56 F.3d 375 (2d Cir. 1995), the court relied on a\nConnecticut state court decision that had held that the state's\ntakings clause \"may be used as the basis of an inverse condemnation\naction to recover compensation for property taken from private\nindividuals, even in the absence of a separate statutory remedy.\"\nId. at 380.     See also id. at 381 (\"The inverse condemnation\nrequirement of Williamson applies whenever compensation is sought\nfor land that is taken . . . .\"). Similarly, in Austin v. City &\nCounty of Honolulu, 840 F.2d 678, 681 (9th Cir. 1987), the court\nnoted that, \"[u]ntil the state courts establish that landowners may\nnot obtain just compensation through an inverse condemnation action\nunder any circumstances [including under the state constitution's\ntakings provision], Hawaii procedures are adequate within the terms\nof Williamson County and [plaintiff's] failure to use them cannot\nbe excused.\"   Our view does not exclude the possibility that a\nstate explicitly could create a non-statutory inverse condemnation\n\n                                -30-\n\f            Here, no Commonwealth administrative process or cause of\n\naction has been identified through which a claimant is expected to\n\nseek   compensation   in   the    unusual   circumstance           of   an   alleged\n\nunconstitutional taking arising from the government's appropriation\n\nof funds.    Cf. González-Álvarez, 426 F.3d at 427 (noting the lack\n\nof   an   available   state    process   for     seeking         compensation    for\n\ncancellation of milk production quotas); SFW Arecibo, 415 F.3d at\n\n139 (noting Puerto Rico's inverse condemnation procedure for land-\n\nbased takings claims).\n\n            Indeed,    another       line      of        cases     suggests     the\n\ninapplicability of the Williamson County prerequisites to a taking\n\nthat involves the direct appropriation of funds.                        In Eastern\n\nEnterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498 (1998) (plurality opinion), the\n\nSupreme   Court   considered     a   challenge      to    the    Coal   Act,   which\n\nestablished a mechanism for funding health care benefits for coal\n\nindustry retirees.      Id. at 504.         Under the Act, private coal\n\noperators were required to contribute to the payment of premiums to\n\n\nprocedure. Cf. Southview Assocs., Ltd. v. Bongartz, 980 F.2d 84,\n99 (2d Cir. 1992) (rejecting the \"contention that only a statutory\ncompensation scheme can suffice\").     We disagree with the Ninth\nCircuit's implication, however, that a federal takings claim is\nunripe if a plaintiff has not litigated a state claim where the\nstate has not specifically utilized its takings clause to establish\na compensatory process (and no other compensatory process has been\nidentified).\n     As our discussion and the difference of opinion among our own\npanel members indicate, there is substantial tension among the\nvarious doctrines at issue in this context – ripeness, exhaustion\nand preclusion – and further guidance from the Supreme Court seems\nnecessary to resolve the uncertainties.\n\n                                     -31-\n\ffund such benefits.       One such operator, Eastern, brought suit\n\nclaiming that the Act, either on its face or as applied, violated\n\nsubstantive due process and constituted a taking of its property in\n\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment.         The Supreme Court considered\n\nwhether the takings claim needed to be asserted first under the\n\nTucker Act, which, as noted above, usually must be a preliminary\n\nstep in a takings action against the federal government.\n\n          The plurality observed that Eastern was not seeking\n\ncompensation from the government; it was requesting declaratory and\n\ninjunctive   relief     against   enforcement    of   the   act   by   the\n\nCommissioner of Social Security.         The Justices noted conflicting\n\nlower court precedent on whether a claim for equitable relief under\n\nthe Takings Clause, even without a request for damages, must be\n\nbrought first under the Tucker Act.       Id. at 520-21.    The plurality\n\nrejected such a prerequisite, stating that \"Congress could not have\n\ncontemplated that the Treasury would compensate coal operators for\n\ntheir liability under the Act, for '[e]very dollar paid pursuant to\n\na statute would be presumed to generate a dollar of Tucker Act\n\ncompensation.'\"       Id. at 521 (quoting In re Chateaugay Corp., 53\n\nF.3d 478, 493 (2d Cir. 1995)).      The Court plurality continued:\n\n          Accordingly, the \"presumption of Tucker Act\n          availability must be reversed where the\n          challenged statute, rather than burdening real\n          or physical property, requires a direct\n          transfer of funds\" mandated by the Government.\n          [In re Chateaugay, 53 F.3d at 493.] In that\n          situation, a claim for compensation \"would\n          entail   an    utterly   pointless    set   of\n\n                                  -32-\n\f           activities.\" Student Loan Marketing Ass'n v.\n           Riley, 104 F.3d 397, 401 [(D.C. Cir. 1997)].\n           Instead, . . . the Declaratory Judgment Act\n           \"allows individuals threatened with a taking\n           to seek a declaration of the constitutionality\n           of the disputed governmental action before\n           potentially    uncompensable    damages    are\n           sustained.\"\n\nId. (citation omitted).          Five members of the Court went on to\n\nconclude   that   the     Coal    Act's    application     to   Eastern    was\n\nunconstitutional, but Justice Kennedy relied on due process, rather\n\nthan takings, principles.        See id. at 537, 539.\n\n           This   case    differs   from     Apfel   because,   among     other\n\ndistinctions, it does not involve the federal government and the\n\nTucker Act.     Nonetheless, the nature of the claim – that Puerto\n\nRico's   Secretary   of    the    Treasury    improperly    withheld      money\n\nbelonging to the JUA so that it may be used for public purposes –\n\nstrikes us as equivalent to the complaints about the \"direct\n\ntransfer of funds\" at issue in Apfel and the decisions it cites.\n\nApplication of the Williamson County prerequisites here similarly\n\ncould only \"'entail an utterly pointless set of activities.'\"              For\n\nthat reason, and the others we have noted, we conclude that\n\nWilliamson County's prudential factors do not prevent our review of\n\nthe JUA's takings claim.\n\nC.   Standing\n\n           Flores Galarza challenges the JUA's statutory standing,\n\narguing that the JUA, as a \"state-created entity,\" lacks standing\n\nto \"challenge actions taken by the state that created it [because]\n\n                                    -33-\n\fit is [not] absolutely clear from the enabling statute that such\n\naccess was expressly intended by the state legislature.\"              The JUA\n\ncontends that, while it was \"created via an official act of the\n\nstate,\"    the   JUA   is   not   an     \"arm   of   the   state   [with]    no\n\nconstitutional rights to assert against the state which created\n\nit.\"22\n\n            Flores Galarza's argument is precluded by our case law.\n\nIn Arroyo-Melecio, we stated that, while \"[t]he JUA is under some\n\ndirection by the commonwealth,\" it is \"private in nature\" and is\n\ntherefore \"not an agency of the commonwealth.\"             398 F.3d at 62.    A\n\nprivate corporation may allege a constitutional violation under §\n\n1983.    See Ill. Clean Energy Cmty. Found. v. Filan, 392 F.3d 934,\n\n936-37 (7th Cir. 2004) (holding that state-created foundation was\n\nnot a state agency and therefore could sue the state for taking its\n\nproperty); Advocates for the Arts v. Thomson, 532 F.2d 792, 794\n\n(1st Cir. 1976) (\"That [plaintiff] is a corporation has no bearing\n\non its standing to assert violations of the first and fourteenth\n\n\n\n22\n   Neither Flores Galarza nor the JUA addresses the threshold\nquestion of whether we may consider Flores Galarza's standing\nchallenge in this interlocutory appeal. Although not all circuits\nagree, see, e.g., Triad Assocs., Inc. v. Robinson, 10 F.3d 492, 496\nn.2 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"[T]hat we have jurisdiction to review the\ndistrict court's denial of qualified immunity is not sufficient to\nconfer on us jurisdiction to review [standing challenges] presented\nto the district court.\" (citation omitted)), we previously have\nheld that appellate jurisdiction extends to issues of standing on\ninterlocutory appeal of a denial of immunity. See Pagán, 448 F.3d\nat 26-27. We therefore may review Flores Galarza's challenge to\nthe JUA's standing.\n\n                                       -34-\n\famendments under 42 U.S.C. [§] 1983.\").          The JUA is therefore a\n\nproper plaintiff in this case.\n\n\n\n\nD.   Res Judicata\n\n           In his supplemental brief, Flores Galarza asserts that\n\nthe JUA seeks \"exactly the same remedy that it previously sought\"\n\n– and failed to receive – in the Commonwealth court, and argues\n\nthat the doctrine of res judicata bars the federal court from\n\nreaching a different outcome on identical claims involving the same\n\nparties.    In   response,   the   JUA    emphasizes   that   both   of   the\n\nCommonwealth court's rulings – the Partial Judgment issued in July\n\n2003 and the Judgment issued in September 2003 – were \"without\n\nprejudice,\" and it argues that, under Puerto Rico law, a judgment\n\nwithout prejudice is not an adjudication on the merits that would\n\ntrigger res judicata consequences. See Pueblo Int'l, Inc. v. Cruz,\n\n17 P.R. Offic. Trans. 275 (1986) (Hernandez Denton, J., concurring\n\nand dissenting) (citing Fresh-O-Baking Co. v. Molinos de P.R., 103\n\nD.P.R. 509, 514 (1975)).\n\n           We do not reach the substantive res judicata question,\n\nhowever, because we conclude that it is outside the limited sphere\n\nof this interlocutory appeal. Although we have not previously held\n\nexplicitly that res judicata, unlike standing, may not be reviewed\n\nalong with immunity issues, we intimated as much in Nieves-Márquez\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fv. Puerto     Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 123 (1st Cir. 2003), where we\n\nconsidered the scope of an interlocutory appeal from the denial of\n\na motion to dismiss based on Eleventh Amendment immunity. We cited\n\nthere the Supreme Court's decision in Swint v. Chambers County\n\nComm'n, 514 U.S. 35 (1995), where the Court held that a court of\n\nappeals does not have discretion to exercise pendent appellate\n\njurisdiction in an interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified\n\nimmunity    unless    \"the     otherwise    unappealable   issue     is   []\n\n'inextricably intertwined' with the issue on collateral order\n\nappeal.\"    353 F.3d at 123 (quoting Swint, 514 U.S. at 48-51).           We\n\nconcluded that the question whether a cause of action for damages\n\nexists is \"inextricably intertwined with the issue of Eleventh\n\nAmendment   immunity\"    and    therefore   could   be   addressed   in   an\n\ninterlocutory appeal.        Id.\n\n            In so ruling, however, we noted the Third Circuit's\n\ndecision in Bell Atlantic-Pennsylvania, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Public\n\nUtilities Commission, 273 F.3d 337, 343-45 (3d Cir. 2001), on the\n\n\"very different issue[]\" of whether denial of a motion to dismiss\n\non res judicata grounds was immediately appealable under the\n\ncollateral order doctrine. The Third Circuit held that it was not,\n\nand we observed that, \"[l]ike the Third Circuit, we agree that not\n\nevery issue raised by the denial of a pre-trial motion to dismiss\n\nmay be reached on collateral order appeal; indeed most may not be.\"\n\n353 F.3d at 124.     We construe that observation as an endorsement of\n\n\n                                    -36-\n\fthe   Third    Circuit's       refusal    to    address      res    judicata      in    an\n\ninterlocutory appeal.          Moreover, we find a similar perspective in\n\nthe Supreme Court's decision in Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop\n\nDirect, Inc., 511 U.S. 863 (1994).              In that case, the Court listed\n\npreclusion among a collection of claims that arguably relate to a\n\n\"right not to stand trial\" and therefore could plausibly warrant\n\ninterlocutory appellate review.                 See id. at 873.             The Court,\n\nhowever,      cautioned    that    such     claims      must       be    viewed   \"with\n\nskepticism,     if   not   a    jaundiced       eye,\"   to     avoid       emasculating\n\nCongress's final decision rule.             Id. at 871-73.              Consistent with\n\nthis precedent, we conclude that res judicata is not properly\n\naddressed at this stage of the case.              See, e.g., Timpanogos Tribe\n\nv. Conway, 286 F.3d 1195, 1200 (10th Cir. 2002) (finding no basis\n\nto review pendent res judicata claim with Eleventh Amendment\n\ninterlocutory claim); Garramone v. Romo, 94 F.3d 1446, 1452 (10th\n\nCir. 1996) (holding that district court's res judicata ruling could\n\nnot be reviewed in interlocutory appeal on immunity issues).

Summary of Claims\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\f           Before turning to an analysis of the Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity and qualified immunity claims, we pause to summarize the\n\nvaried claims for relief made by the JUA.          We do so because we must\n\nbe clear about the precise nature of those claims in conducting the\n\nimmunity analyses.     As noted above, the JUA seeks three kinds of\n\nrelief. First, the JUA seeks a declaratory judgment against Flores\n\nGalarza in his official capacity, declaring that he violated the\n\nJUA's constitutional rights by:\n\n           (1)    withholding $173 million in insurance premiums for\n\nan extended period so that the funds could be used to ease the\n\nCommonwealth's cash flow problems, before transferring a large\n\nportion   of   those   premiums   to   the   JUA   pursuant   to   the   2002\n\nSettlement; and\n\n           (2)    permanently appropriating:         (a) $14.2 million in\n\ninterest on lost or forgone investments as a result of Flores\n\nGalarza's taking of the insurance premiums; (b) $10 million in\n\nOverstated Reserve Funds that do not belong to third parties and\n\ntherefore should have been deducted from the $73 million retained\n\nby Flores Galarza; and (c) $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds\n\nthat the JUA was forced to pay to third parties from its own funds\n\nand therefore should have been deducted from the $73 million\n\nretained by Flores Galarza.23\n\n\n23\n   Flores Galarza helpfully        summarizes      the   alleged   permanent\nappropriations as follows:\n\n                                   -38-\n\f            Second, the JUA seeks injunctive relief from Flores\n\nGalarza in his official capacity, enjoining him from:\n\n            (1)   withholding any more insurance premiums; and\n\n            (2)   enforcing the terms of the 2002 Amendment, that\n\nis, from requiring the JUA to transfer Reserve funds to the\n\nSecretary every two years, and from retaining interest income\n\nearned on the Reserve funds and any Overstated Reserve Funds (i.e.,\n\nfunds included in the Reserve that are not actually owed to third\n\nparties).\n\n            Third, the JUA seeks approximately $38 million in damages\n\nfrom Flores Galarza in his personal capacity, that is:         (1) $14.2\n\nmillion in lost interest as a result of Flores Galarza's taking of\n\nthe insurance premiums; (2) $10 million in Overstated Reserve\n\nFunds; and (3) $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds.          These items\n\nof   damage   mirror    the   items   identified   in   the     permanent\n\nappropriation portion of the demand for declaratory relief.\n\nB.   Standard of Review\n\n\n\n\n     The JUA claims that when the Reserve Account was\n     retained, the [Secretary] took its property without just\n     compensation because it withheld the [Overstated Reserve\n     Funds], and did not allow the [Out-of-Pocket Funds] to be\n     debited from the Reserve Account. The JUA also claims\n     that it is entitled to just compensation for the period\n     of time during which the [Secretary] withheld the\n     transfers of the premiums without transmitting these to\n     the JUA.\n\n                                 -39-\n\f              Where a district court's denial of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity and qualified immunity turns upon purely legal questions,\n\nour review is de novo. See Rodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González, 438\n\nF.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir. 2006) (reviewing de novo denial of qualified\n\nimmunity); Redondo Constr. Corp. v. P.R. Highway & Transp. Auth.,\n\n357 F.3d 124, 126 (1st Cir. 2004) (reviewing de novo denial of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity).         \"The standard for evaluating a Rule\n\n12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same\n\nas that for deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.              '[T]he trial court\n\nmust accept all of the nonmovant's well-pleaded factual averments\n\nas true, and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.'\" Pasdon\n\nv. City of Peabody, 417 F.3d 225, 226 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting\n\nRivera-Gomez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n\"Judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) may not be entered\n\nunless it appears beyond a doubt that the nonmoving party can prove\n\nno set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to\n\nrelief.\"      Feliciano v. Rhode Island, 160 F.3d 780, 788 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\nC.    Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n\n              Flores Galarza argues that the Eleventh Amendment bars\n\nthe   JUA's    suit   against   him   in     his   official   capacity.24   He\n\n\n24\n   The Eleventh Amendment states that \"[t]he Judicial power             of the\nUnited States shall not be construed to extend to any suit              in law\nor equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United            States\nby Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects                of any\n\n                                      -40-\n\femphasizes that the JUA seeks damages of $10 million in Overstated\n\nReserve Funds, $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds, and $14.2\n\nmillion in lost interest during the period in which the insurance\n\npremiums were retained, all of which \"[are] clearly retrospective\n\nin nature.\"   Flores Galarza misapprehends the JUA's argument.\n\nWhile the complaint is not a model of clarity on this point,25 the\n\nJUA explained in its argument to us and to the district court that\n\n\n\n\nForeign State.\" U.S. Const. amend. XI. \"[N]otwithstanding its\nplain language,\" the Eleventh Amendment \"prohibit[s federal courts]\nfrom hearing most suits brought against a state by citizens of that\nor any other state.\" Metcalf & Eddy, Inc. v. P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer\nAuth., 991 F.2d 935, 938 (1st Cir. 1993). \"[D]espite the absence\nof any express reference,\" the Eleventh Amendment \"pertains to\nPuerto Rico in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if\nPuerto Rico were a State.\" De Leon Lopez v. Corporacion Insular de\nSeguros, 931 F.2d 116, 121 (1st Cir. 1991).\n25\n  The complaint states that the \"JUA respectfully requests that\nthis Honorable Court order the Secretary of the Treasury to pay the\nJUA the amount of $38,321,556.83 in order to return to JUA its\nprivate property and to compensate JUA for the opportunity cost it\nhas suffered due to the Secretary of the Treasury's violations of\nJUA's constitutional rights.\"     However, the complaint does not\nstate whether the JUA's request is directed at Flores Galarza in\nhis official capacity, his personal capacity, or both. The JUA's\nrequest that Flores Galarza \"return [] its private property,\" on\nthe one hand, and \"compensate\" the JUA, on the other, contributes\nto this confusion, suggesting that the JUA seeks the return of\ncertain funds in the Commonwealth Treasury from Flores Galarza in\nhis official capacity, and seeks damages from Flores Galarza in his\npersonal capacity.    As the JUA indicated in its brief to the\ndistrict court, and as it made clear at oral argument before us,\nthe JUA seeks damages for the taking of the funds at issue from\nFlores Galarza in his personal capacity – the JUA is \"not asking to\nhave any money returned to it\" by the Commonwealth.      Given the\ncomplaint's lack of precision, we understand Flores Galarza's\nmisapprehension of the nature of the JUA's claims.\n\n                               -41-\n\fit is not seeking damages from Flores Galarza in his official\n\ncapacity.\n\n            The JUA states that, while it \"seeks damages against Mr.\n\nFlores-Galarza in his personal capacity,\" it seeks only prospective\n\ninjunctive relief from Flores Galarza in his official capacity –\n\n\"enjoin[ing him] from continuing to engage in the unconstitutional\n\nconduct.\"    (Emphasis added.)   At oral argument before us, the JUA\n\nstated that it merely seeks to compel the transfer of compulsory\n\nliability insurance premiums in the future – a remedy that it\n\nargues \"is clearly a prospective one.\" The JUA further argues that\n\n\"[t]he fact that funds would have to be transferred [in the future]\n\nas a result of the injunction requested does not create an Eleventh\n\nAmendment bar to the issuance of the injunction\" because these\n\nfunds do not constitute damages, but rather \"belong to the JUA and\n\nare held by [the Secretary] in a fiduciary capacity.\"\n\n            In many instances, a suit against a state official is a\n\nsuit against the state, thereby triggering Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity.   See Muirhead v. Mecham, 427 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"[A] suit, although nominally aimed at an official, will be\n\nconsidered one against the sovereign 'if the judgment sought would\n\nexpend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with\n\nthe public administration, or if the effect of the judgment would\n\nbe to restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to\n\n\n                                 -42-\n\fact.'\" (quoting Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 620 (1963)).                     While\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment prohibits a party from bringing suit against\n\na state in federal court, see De Leon Lopez, 931 F.2d at 121, it\n\ndoes not prohibit a party from bringing suit against a state\n\nofficer in federal court for prospective declaratory or injunctive\n\nrelief under federal law.26         Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 155\n\n(1908).    See generally Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction\n\n§ 7.5, at 424 (4th ed. 2003) (distinguishing prospective injunctive\n\nrelief against a state officer, which the Eleventh Amendment does\n\nnot forbid, from \"retroactive relief – damages to compensate past\n\ninjuries,\" which the Eleventh Amendment does forbid).\n\n           In Ex parte Young, the Supreme Court created an exception\n\nto    Eleventh   Amendment    immunity         \"for    suits    challenging    the\n\nconstitutionality of a state official's action, on the theory that\n\nsince the state cannot authorize such an unconstitutional action,\n\nthe   officer    is   'stripped    of    his    official       or   representative\n\ncharacter and . . . subjected in his person to the consequences of\n\nhis   individual      conduct.'\"        Parents       for   Quality   Educ.   With\n\nIntegration, Inc. v. Indiana, 977 F.2d 1207, 1209 (7th Cir. 1992)\n\n\n26\n  As we noted in Díaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico, 451 F.3d 13 (1st Cir.\n2006), \"[Ex parte Young] does not allow injunctive relief against\nstate officials for violation of state law . . . because '[a]\nfederal court's grant of relief against state officials on the\nbasis of state law, whether prospective or retroactive, does not\nvindicate the supreme authority of federal law.'\"        Id. at 43\n(quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,\n106 (1984)).\n\n                                    -43-\n\f(quoting Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 102).          Ex parte Young thus \"allows\n\na way around the bar to federal jurisdiction . . . in cases where\n\nprospective      declaratory    or   injunctive   relief     is   sought    under\n\nfederal law.\"      Mills v. Maine, 118 F.3d 37, 54 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nHere, the JUA seeks a declaration that the taking of insurance\n\npremiums by Flores Galarza in his official capacity violates the\n\nConstitution      and   an   injunction   enjoining    Flores     Galarza    from\n\nenforcing the terms of the 2002 Amendment – that is, from requiring\n\nthe   JUA   to   transfer    Reserve   funds   every   two   years    and   from\n\nretaining either the interest earned on those funds or any excess\n\nReserve funds not owed to traditionally insured vehicle owners or\n\ntheir insurers.         We agree with the district court that these\n\nrequests are for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief that\n\nis not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.27         Therefore, the district\n\ncourt's denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity to Flores Galarza in\n\nhis official capacity was correct.\n\nD.    Official- Versus Personal-Capacity Suits\n\n\n\n27\n  In addition to finding that \"[the JUA's] request for injunctive\nand declaratory relief is prospective,\" the district court found\nthat \"the retention of money allegedly unconstitutionally attached\nis equitable and subject to injunctive relief exempt from the\nEleventh Amendment bar.\" To the extent that this latter statement\nmay be understood as affording the JUA the right to sue Flores\nGalarza in his official capacity for damages, we reject this\nproposition.   As discussed above, the JUA does not make this\nargument and, therefore, neither we nor the district court need\nreach it. Because we otherwise arrive at the same result as the\ndistrict court on Eleventh Amendment immunity, any potential error\non the part of the district court in its analysis was harmless.\n\n                                       -44-\n\f            The JUA argues that Flores Galarza, in his personal\n\ncapacity,    temporarily    withheld   approximately    $173   million   in\n\ncompulsory    liability    insurance   premiums   for   an   \"unreasonable\n\nperiod[] of time,\" and, in so doing, appropriated $14.2 million in\n\ninterest generated by those premiums.        The JUA also argues that\n\nFlores Galarza personally appropriated $10 million in Overstated\n\nReserve Funds and $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds.\n\n            However, the JUA does not seek to hold Flores Galarza\n\npersonally liable for the full $173 million in withheld insurance\n\npremiums, most of which was subsequently paid to the JUA pursuant\n\nto the 2002 Settlement, nor does the JUA seek to hold Flores\n\nGalarza personally liable for the full $73 million in Reserve funds\n\nretained by Flores Galarza after the 2002 Settlement. Instead, the\n\nJUA seeks to hold Flores Galarza personally liable for interest\n\nlost on the $173 million plus two portions of the $73 million\n\nReserve – i.e., the Overstated Reserve Funds and Out-of-Pocket\n\nReserve Funds. The total amount sought by the JUA is approximately\n\n$38 million, that is, roughly $14.2 million in lost interest, $10\n\nmillion in Overstated Reserve Funds, and $13.6 million in Out-of-\n\nPocket Funds.   Flores Galarza contends that he is not liable in his\n\npersonal capacity based on qualified immunity.\n\n            Before analyzing whether Flores Galarza is entitled to\n\nqualified immunity, we pause to note the unusual nature of this\n\npersonal-capacity suit.      We are troubled by the notion that the\n\n                                  -45-\n\fpersonal-capacity claim against Flores Galarza, by which the JUA\n\nseeks enormous personal damages from him, is really a subterfuge\n\nfor   an   official-capacity    suit    that   seeks   payment   from   the\n\nCommonwealth Treasury.   Certainly the line between personal assets\n\nand the Commonwealth fisc seems indistinct.         The JUA has sued the\n\nSecretary of the Treasury; the JUA claims that the Secretary\n\ntemporarily withheld and permanently appropriated the JUA's funds\n\nfor the benefit of the Commonwealth; and some of the damages sought\n\nby the JUA correspond to funds accumulated in the general fund\n\npursuant to the 2002 Amendment.        \"'[W]hen the action is in essence\n\none for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the\n\nreal, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its\n\nsovereign immunity from suit. . . .'\"          Metcalf, 991 F.2d at 939\n\n(quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Dep't of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 464\n\n(1945), overruled on other grounds by Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of\n\nUniv. Syst. of Ga., 535 U.S. 613 (2002)).          There is a plausible\n\nview of this case that the demand for damages from Flores Galarza\n\nis, in essence, a demand for the recovery of money from the\n\nCommonwealth.\n\n            In considering that possibility, we have looked closely\n\nat Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21 (1991), a case in which the Supreme\n\nCourt tried to clarify the distinction between official- and\n\npersonal-capacity suits.       There, the plaintiffs sued the auditor\n\ngeneral of Pennsylvania, Hafer, after she fired them from their\n\n                                   -46-\n\fjobs,   alleging   that   they   were    fired   for   personal      reasons   in\n\nviolation of the First Amendment; they sought monetary damages from\n\nHafer personally.    The claims against Hafer had nothing to do with\n\nher handling of funds in the state treasury, nor did the damages\n\nsought bear any relationship to funds accumulated in the state\n\ntreasury.   Id. at 23.\n\n            However, the principles set forth in Hafer make the\n\nfactual   distinctions    between       this   case    and   Hafer    seemingly\n\nirrelevant.    There, the Court said that \"the phrase 'acting in\n\ntheir official capacities' is best understood as a reference to the\n\ncapacity in which the state officer is sued, not the capacity in\n\nwhich the officer inflicts the alleged injury.\"              Id. at 26.    Even\n\nearlier, the Supreme Court had suggested that in determining\n\nwhether a suit involves a personal- or official-capacity claim, we\n\nshould be guided by the complaint or, if not clearly specified in\n\nthe complaint, by the \"[t]he course of proceedings.\"              Kentucky v.\n\nGraham, 473 U.S. 159, 167 n.14 (1985).\n\n            Here, the complaint, in combination with the course of\n\nproceedings, see supra note 25, establishes that Flores Galarza is\n\nbeing sued for damages in his personal capacity.             If the JUA wishes\n\nto seek a personal judgment against Flores Galarza in a ruinous and\n\nprobably uncollectible amount for actions that he took as the\n\n\n                                    -47-\n\fCommonwealth Treasurer to serve the interests of the Commonwealth,\n\nthey are entitled to do that.              See generally Chemerinsky, supra,\n\n§ 7.5.2, at 430 (\"[T]he fact that a government officer is acting in\n\nthe scope of official duties is not enough to bar a suit as being\n\nin 'official capacity'.\").            If such a judgment might induce the\n\nCommonwealth to indemnify Flores Galarza from the Commonwealth\n\nTreasury to spare him from ruin, that likelihood is irrelevant to\n\nthe personal-capacity determination.              See Berman Enters., Inc. v.\n\nJorling, 3 F.3d 602, 606 (2d Cir. 1993) (\"Whether or not a state\n\nwould    choose      to     reimburse      an    official    for     damages   for\n\nconstitutional harm he caused in his individual capacity is a\n\nmatter   of   no    concern      to   a   federal      court.\").    See   generally\n\nChemerinsky,       supra,    §   7.5.2,    at    423   (\"State     indemnification\n\npolicies are irrelevant for Eleventh Amendment analysis and do not\n\nprevent federal court relief against individual officers.\").28                  In\n\nshort, in a suit \"against an officer for money damages when the\n\nrelief would come from the officer's own pocket, there is no\n\nEleventh Amendment bar even though the conduct was part of the\n\n\n28\n   As we noted in Díaz-Fonseca, the Commonwealth \"generally\nindemnifies its officials for suits against them in their personal\ncapacities.\" 451 F.3d at 37 n.26 (citing P.R.

We\n\nturn, therefore, to Flores Galarza's qualified immunity defense.\n\n                                 V.\n\n          Our starting point is the principle that \"government\n\nofficials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded\n\nfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not\n\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of\n\nwhich a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n\n457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).   We have used a three-prong analysis for\n\nevaluating qualified immunity claims.     Thus, we must determine:\n\n          (1)   whether  the   claimant   has  alleged   the\n          deprivation of an actual constitutional right; (2)\n          whether the right was clearly established at the\n          time of the alleged action or inaction; and (3) if\n          both of these questions are answered in the\n          affirmative, whether an objectively reasonable\n          official would have believed that the action taken\n          violated that clearly established constitutional\n          right.\n\nWilson v. City of Boston, 421 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nA. First Prong: Alleged Deprivation of Constitutional Right\n\n          Here we ask whether the facts, \"[t]aken in the light most\n\nfavorable to the party asserting       the injury . . . show the\n\nofficer's conduct violated a constitutional right[.]\"     Saucier v.\n\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).       As we have noted, \"[t]he first\n\nprong inquiry at this 12(b)(6) stage is unlikely to be very\n\nspecific, given that federal civil practice is based on notice\n\n\n                                -49-\n\fpleading, where great specificity is not required, and that there\n\nis no heightened pleading requirement for civil rights cases.\"\n\nRiverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare, 392 F.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(citations omitted).       The JUA argues that Flores Galarza took its\n\nprivate property without compensation in violation of the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments, by physically appropriating the insurance\n\npremiums, the interest lost as a result of the withholding of those\n\npremiums, the Overstated Reserve Funds, and the Out-of-Pocket\n\nFunds.      This alleged violation of its constitutionally protected\n\nproperty rights, the JUA argues, is thus sufficient to satisfy the\n\nfirst prong of the qualified immunity analysis.                  Flores Galarza\n\nargues that the JUA fails to allege a taking of its property in\n\nsatisfaction of the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis\n\nfor two reasons:       first, the JUA is a state-created entity, which,\n\nlike the state itself, lacks the capacity to allege a taking under\n\n§ 1983; and second, the complaint does not allege the elements of\n\na successful takings claim.\n\n             1. Capacity to Allege Constitutional Deprivation\n\n             Flores Galarza's argument that the JUA, as a state-\n\ncreated entity, \"simply does not enjoy constitutional rights\" and\n\nthus   is    \"wholly   incapable\"    of   setting   forth    a    violation   of\n\nconstitutionally       protected    property   rights,      is    his   standing\n\nchallenge recast in qualified immunity terms.                We have already\n\n\n\n\n                                     -50-\n\frejected this standing argument.          The JUA has the capacity to\n\nallege an unconstitutional taking of its property.\n\n            2. Elements of a Takings Violation\n\n            The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that\n\n\"private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just\n\ncompensation.\"     U.S. Const. amend. V.      Takings claims involve a\n\ntwo-step inquiry.      \"To make a cognizable claim of a taking in\n\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment, the plaintiffs must first show\n\nthat they possess a recognized property interest which may be\n\nprotected by the Fifth Amendment.         The plaintiffs must point to\n\ncredible sources for their claimed property interest . . . 'such as\n\nstate law-rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and\n\nthat support claims of entitlement to those benefits.'\"             Wash.\n\nLegal Found. v. Mass. Bar Found., 993 F.2d 962, 973 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(quoting Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)); see\n\nalso Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys., 173 F.3d 46,\n\n58   (1st   Cir.   1999)    (\"[P]laintiffs   must   first   establish   an\n\nindependent property right before they can argue that the state has\n\ntaken that right without just compensation.\").\n\n            Assuming   that     the    plaintiff     can    establish    a\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest, the plaintiff must\n\nnext show that the challenged action \"cause[d] an illegal taking of\n\nth[at] interest[].\"        Wash. Legal Found., 993 F.2d at 974.         The\n\nSupreme Court has recognized two types of takings:               physical\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\ftakings and regulatory takings.                   See Brown v. Legal Found. of\n\nWash., 538 U.S. 216, 233 (2003).             As already noted, the JUA asserts\n\na physical taking, and we therefore confine our analysis to that\n\nstrand of takings law.29\n\n            \"A    physical        taking    occurs    either   when     there    is   a\n\ncondemnation or a physical appropriation of property.\"                          Philip\n\nMorris, Inc. v. Reilly, 312 F.3d 24, 33 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc).\n\nPhysical     takings        challenges       \"involve[]    the    straightforward\n\napplication      of   per    se    rules,\"    which    means   that     \"[w]hen    the\n\ngovernment physically takes possession of an interest in property\n\nfor some public purpose, it has a categorical duty to compensate\n\nthe former owner.\" Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg'l\n\nPlanning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 322 (2002); see also Lingle v.\n\nChevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 537 (2005) (\"The paradigmatic\n\ntaking     requiring    just       compensation       is   a   direct    government\n\nappropriation or physical invasion of private property.\").\n\n\"Temporary [physical] takings . . . are not different in kind from\n\npermanent takings, for which the Constitution clearly requires\n\ncompensation.\" First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County\n\nof L.A., 482 U.S. 304, 318 (1987) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n29\n  Regulatory takings challenges involve a multiple-factor test that\nwas set forth in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New\nYork, 438 U.S. 104 (1978). We note that Flores Galarza's brief\nincorrectly invokes regulatory takings principles in response to\nthe JUA's physical takings argument.\n\n                                           -52-\n\f               For   purposes    of    satisfying      the     first    prong      of   the\n\nqualified immunity analysis, the JUA need not prove the taking of\n\na constitutionally protected property interest; it need only allege\n\nsuch a taking.         See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201 (stating that the\n\nfirst prong of the qualified immunity analysis is satisfied where\n\na    constitutional      right       \"would    have    been     violated      were      the\n\nallegations established\"); Mihos v. Swift, 358 F.3d 91, 98 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (\"For a plaintiff to overcome a qualified immunity\n\ndefense, he must show that his allegations, if true, establish a\n\nconstitutional violation . . . .\").                  In accordance with our two-\n\nstep approach to takings claims, the JUA must first allege a\n\nconstitutionally protected property right to the funds in dispute.\n\nThe JUA argues that, pursuant to Law 253 and the 2002 Amendment,\n\n\"[t]he premiums collected and withheld by [Flores Galarza],\" the\n\n\"interest derived from the withheld premiums,\" and the Overstated\n\nReserve Funds and Out-of-Pocket Funds – \"are the private property\n\nof the [JUA].\"         Second, the JUA must allege a taking of that\n\nproperty.       The JUA argues that Flores Galarza's appropriation of\n\nthe   funds     in   dispute    is    equivalent      to   a   \"permanent       physical\n\noccupation and a per se taking for which just compensation must be\n\npaid.\"\n\n               Flores Galarza, on the other hand, argues that the JUA's\n\ntakings claim fails both prongs of the takings analysis. According\n\nto    Flores    Galarza,   \"the       JUA   cannot    establish        that   it    has   a\n\n\n                                            -53-\n\frecognizable property interest\" in any of the funds in dispute or\n\nthat Flores Galarza's appropriation of these funds constitutes a\n\ntaking.\n\n          Taking all facts in the light most favorable to the party\n\nasserting the injury, as we must at this threshold stage of the\n\nqualified immunity analysis, Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201, we find that\n\nthe JUA alleges the taking of a constitutionally protected property\n\ninterest in most, but not all, of the funds in dispute under Law\n\n253 and the 2002 Amendment.\n\n          3.   The Insurance Premiums\n\n                 a. The Earned Premiums\n\n          The JUA argues that \"the premiums collected and withheld\n\nby the [Secretary] are the private property of the [JUA]\" under the\n\nplain language of Law 253.    According to the JUA, although the\n\npremiums pass through Flores Galarza's hands before reaching the\n\nJUA, the premiums are never funds of the Commonwealth.        To the\n\ncontrary, the JUA argues, given that the JUA's responsibility for\n\nthe compulsory insurance comes into effect at the time the premiums\n\nare paid to the Secretary of the Treasury, \"the premium has to\n\nbelong to the [JUA] at that time.\"    Flores Galarza, the JUA argues,\n\nis thus merely a fiduciary who holds the premiums for the benefit\n\nof the JUA, as demonstrated by the 2002 Amendment's reference to\n\nthe Secretary of the Treasury's \"collection service performed in\n\nfavor of the [JUA].\"   P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 8055(c).     Flores\n\n\n                               -54-\n\fGalarza, on the other hand, contends that Law 253 \"does not entitle\n\nJUA      to   ownership     of    the   collected     premiums    until   they     are\n\ntransferred to it by [Flores Galarza].\"               Therefore, Flores Galarza\n\nargues, because Law 253 does not state \"when\" the Secretary must\n\ntransfer the insurance premiums to the JUA, his retention of the\n\n$173 million in premiums was not a withholding of private property\n\n– it was merely a \"temporary retention or delay\" in the transfer of\n\nfunds which did not yet belong to the JUA.\n\n                In our view, Law 253 supports the JUA's claim of a\n\nproperty right to that portion of the insurance premiums not owed\n\nto       privately   insured       motorists     or   their   insurers       (\"Earned\n\nPremiums\"30).        Law 253 created the JUA for \"[t]he main purpose of\n\n.    .    .   provid[ing]   the    compulsory     liability      insurance    to   the\n\napplicants for said insurance that have been rejected by private\n\ninsurers.\"        Id. § 8055(b).        As an insurer, the JUA is entitled to\n\nthe Earned Premiums.             Law 253 gives the JUA the power to hold\n\nproperty, and provides that the JUA \"shall receive\" premiums from\n\nthe      Secretary    and   that    the   Secretary     \"shall    transfer\"    these\n\npremiums to the JUA.             While the Secretary collects the insurance\n\npremiums and holds them for some unspecified amount of time before\n\n\n\n30\n  By \"Earned Premiums,\" we mean the compulsory liability insurance\npremiums paid by vehicle owners who are obtaining the required\ncoverage through the JUA rather than from a private insurer. We do\nnot use this term in its strict definitional sense, that is, \"[t]he\nportion of an insurance premium applicable to the coverage period\nthat has already expired.\" Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004).\n\n                                          -55-\n\frelinquishing them to the JUA, the Secretary is not an insurer – he\n\nis merely the custodian of these funds.                      As a custodian, the\n\nSecretary has no entitlement to the premiums, and his woefully\n\nundeveloped argument that the premiums do not vest in the JUA until\n\nthe Secretary transfers them does not convince us otherwise.                       Cf.\n\nWebb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 162\n\n(1980) (\"[T]he State's having mandated the accrual of interest does\n\nnot mean the State or its designate is entitled to assume ownership\n\nof   the   interest.\").       The     JUA       has   successfully       alleged    an\n\nentitlement to the Earned Premiums under Law 253, and therefore a\n\nproperty interest in those funds.                See id. at 161 (recognizing\n\ninterest earned on private funds as property entitled to protection\n\nunder Fifth Amendment); see also Brown, 538 U.S. at 235; Phillips\n\nv. Wash. Legal Found., 524 U.S. 156, 170-72 (1998).\n\n            We    thus   proceed    to    the    second     step   of   the    takings\n\nanalysis (i.e., whether the property was taken).                      The JUA argues\n\nthat   Flores     Galarza's    withholding            of   the     Earned     Premiums\n\nconstituted a \"permanent physical occupation and a per se taking\n\nfor which just compensation must be paid.\"                  Specifically, the JUA\n\ncontends that Flores Galarza physically took, albeit temporarily,\n\n$173 million of its insurance premiums, before transferring a large\n\nportion    of    those   premiums    to    the    JUA      pursuant     to   the   2002\n\nSettlement.      The JUA's assertion of a property right in the Earned\n\nPremiums, together with its allegation of a physical appropriation\n\n\n                                         -56-\n\fof   those    funds,     is    sufficient      to    allege      the   taking   of    a\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest in those premiums\n\nunder the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis.                            See\n\nWebb's, 449 U.S. at 164-65 (holding that taking of interest earned\n\non private funds was a taking).\n\n                     b. Reserve Fund: the Duplicate Premiums\n\n             While the JUA's alleged property right to the Earned\n\nPremiums is supported by Law 253, the same cannot be said for the\n\nJUA's alleged property right to the duplicate premiums paid by\n\nthose already covered by privately obtained insurance policies\n\n(\"Duplicate Premiums\").          These premiums, Flores Galarza argues,\n\n\"constitute     a   double     payment   for        the   same    insurance,\"     and,\n\ntherefore, do not belong to the JUA, but rather belong to privately\n\ninsured      motorists    or    their    insurers         who    are   entitled      to\n\nreimbursement.      We agree.\n\n             Based on the law in effect at the time the premiums were\n\nwithheld, the JUA was obliged to return the Duplicate Premiums to\n\nthose requesting reimbursement.             If no claim was made to these\n\npremiums after seven years, that money would lapse to the general\n\nfund of the Commonwealth Treasury.             See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§\n\n2603, 2606-2607.         Thus, even if no one claimed the Duplicate\n\nPremiums within the requisite seven years, these funds became the\n\nproperty of the Commonwealth – not the JUA.                 Just as the Secretary\n\nis a custodian of the Earned Premiums for the benefit of the JUA,\n\n\n                                        -57-\n\fthe JUA is a custodian of the Duplicate Premiums for the benefit of\n\neither those entitled to reimbursement or, if the premiums go\n\nunclaimed, the Commonwealth.\n\n          The 2002 Amendment, which requires the JUA to transfer\n\nthe Duplicate Premiums to the Secretary after just two years,\n\nexplicitly recognizes the JUA's lack of a property right to the\n\nDuplicate Premiums. The \"Statement of Motives\" section of the 2002\n\nAmendment states that\n\n          during the existence of the Association,\n          certain funds have been accumulated that do\n          not belong to it . . . [which] results from\n          the fact that a great number of [privately\n          insured] consumers . . . pay the corresponding\n          [compulsory liability insurance] premium . . .\n          when they obtain the motor vehicle license for\n          the first time or when they renew it, but they\n          do not request the Association to reimburse\n          the money as is their right.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n          Although   claiming   a    right   to   all   of   the   insurance\n\npremiums, the JUA concedes that a portion of the premiums collected\n\nby the Secretary (i.e., the Duplicate Premiums placed in the\n\nReserve) \"may belong to third parties: either motor vehicle owners\n\nwith private insurance or private insurers who reimbursed their\n\ninsureds.\"   The JUA consequently admits that a large portion of\n\nthe $73 million Reserve is the property of others.           Given the lack\n\nof support for the JUA's claimed property right to the Duplicate\n\nPremiums, the JUA fails to allege a taking of this portion of the\n\npremiums under the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis.\n\n                                    -58-\n\f                      c. Reserve Fund: the Overstated Funds\n\n            Our determination that the JUA has not alleged a property\n\ninterest in the Duplicate Premiums does not extend to the remainder\n\nof the Reserve Fund – the \"Overstated Reserve Funds\" – which\n\nconsists of the cushion set aside by the JUA to ensure that the\n\nReserve    was   large       enough    to    meet    all   of    the    requests     for\n\nreimbursement by insurers who purchased private insurance.                           As\n\nnoted     earlier,     the     $73    million       Reserve     held   back   by     the\n\nCommonwealth     allegedly       contained      approximately        $10   million   in\n\nexcess funds – money that, as it turned out, was not needed for\n\nreimbursement        because     fewer      individuals       than     estimated     had\n\npurchased their own policies, which meant, in turn, that less of\n\nthe Reserve than anticipated constituted Duplicate Premiums.\n\n            According to the JUA, \"since the [Overstated Reserve\n\nFunds] came from the [JUA] and do not, in fact, belong to others,\n\nthey should have been accounted for as income for the [JUA].\"\n\nFlores Galarza contends that since these funds are merely portions\n\nof the Reserve, which, in turn, \"is merely an accounting tool\" for\n\nallocating the Duplicate Premiums, \"the JUA has no proprietary\n\ninterest[] in the[se] moneys.\"\n\n            The \"Statement of Motives\" section of the 2002 Amendment,\n\nwhich was in place prior to Flores Galarza's appropriation of the\n\nOverstated Reserve Funds in November 2002, explicitly provides that\n\nthe $73 million Reserve consists of funds \"that do not belong to it\n\n\n                                         -59-\n\f[the JUA]\" as the result of the double payment of insurance\n\npremiums by some drivers.        The 2002 Amendment therefore requires\n\nthe JUA to immediately transfer to the Secretary \"the funds known\n\nin its annual statement as 'Funds Retained by the Insurer Belonging\n\nto Others'\" – that is, the $73 million Reserve – and to continue\n\ndoing so every two years.       There is, however, no carve-out for the\n\n\"cushion\" portion of the Reserve that consists of Overstated Funds.\n\nIn   fact,   the   2002   Amendment   provides    that   the   Reserve   funds\n\ntransferred to the Secretary necessarily include any \"reserve\n\nexcess,\" and that this reserve excess \"may be used as resources in\n\nthe General Fund.\"        P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 8055(l).\n\n             The JUA argues, in essence, that to the extent the\n\nAmendment directs the transfer of the Overstated Reserve Funds to\n\nthe Commonwealth, the provision effects a taking of the JUA's\n\nproperty.    Under Law 253, the JUA is obliged to insure drivers who\n\nmight otherwise be uninsurable; the premiums for that insurance are\n\ninitially collected by the Secretary.           The JUA argues that all of\n\nthose   collected     funds,    other    than    the   Duplicate   Premiums,\n\nconstitute the \"Earned Premiums\" and thus belong to it.              Indeed,\n\nthe Insurance Commissioner's adjustment of the Reserve percentage\n\nin 2001 to more accurately reflect the percentage of traditionally\n\ninsured vehicle owners indicates the Commonwealth's recognition\n\nthat the JUA is entitled to any funds above the amount representing\n\nDuplicate Premiums. Notably, the Amendment identifies the funds to\n\n\n                                      -60-\n\fbe   transferred   to   the   Commonwealth      every    two   years   as    funds\n\n\"Belonging to Others.\"         Presumably, any such funds that do not\n\nbelong to others belong to the JUA.           We therefore conclude that the\n\nJUA has alleged the taking of a constitutionally protected property\n\ninterest in the Overstated Reserve Funds.\n\n           4.   The Out-of-Pocket Funds\n\n           When    Flores     Galarza    stopped      transferring     insurance\n\npremiums to the JUA in 2000 in order to meet the cash-flow needs of\n\nthe Commonwealth, the JUA had to reimburse privately insured\n\ndrivers and their insurers out of its own pocket.                While the JUA\n\npresumably   recouped    some    of     its   costs   pursuant   to    the    2002\n\nSettlement, the JUA alleges that there was still $13.6 million\n\noutstanding – an amount which the JUA argues should have been set\n\noff against the $73 million retained by Flores Galarza.                 The JUA\n\nalleges that the $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds \"used to\n\nreimburse insurance premiums from January to September 2002 [is]\n\nthe private property of the [JUA].\"\n\n           The parties do not dispute that the Out-of-Pocket funds\n\nused by the JUA to reimburse third parties belonged to the JUA.\n\nAccordingly, the JUA alleges a property right in the Out-of-Pocket\n\nFunds.   Turning to the second step of the takings analysis, the JUA\n\nalleges that Flores Galarza physically appropriated $13.6 million\n\nin Out-of-Pocket Funds from the JUA by retaining the full $73\n\nmillion in Reserve funds.       At this stage of the qualified immunity\n\n\n                                      -61-\n\fanalysis, the JUA's assertion of a property right to the Out-of-\n\nPocket Funds, together with its allegation of a physical invasion\n\nof   those    funds,   is   sufficient    to   allege   the   taking   of    a\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest in those funds.\n\n             5.   The Interest\n\n             Our determination that the JUA alleges a property right\n\nto the Earned Premiums, the Overstated Reserve Funds and the Out-\n\nof-Pocket Funds compels a similar conclusion with respect to the\n\ninterest lost as a result of the withholding of those monies.               In\n\nPhillips, the Supreme Court held that interest income generated by\n\nclient funds in IOLTA accounts was the private property of the\n\nclient under the common law rule that \"interest follows principal.\"\n\n524 U.S. at 165-72; see also Webb's, 449 U.S. at 162 (\"The usual\n\nand general rule is that any interest . . . follows the principal\n\nand is to be allocated to those who are ultimately to be the owners\n\nof that principal.\"). The fact that the Secretary is authorized to\n\nhold the Earned Premiums for some time before turning them over to\n\nthe JUA is of no consequence.      See Webb's, 449 U.S. at 162 (\"That\n\nlack of immediate right . . . does not automatically bar a claimant\n\nultimately determined to be entitled to all or a share of the fund\n\nfrom claiming a proper share of the interest, the fruit of the\n\nfund's use, that is realized in the interim.\").               By alleging a\n\nproperty right in the Earned Premiums, the Overstated Reserve Funds\n\n\n\n\n                                   -62-\n\fand the Out-of-Pocket Funds, the JUA also has alleged a property\n\nright in the resulting lost interest.31\n\n            Turning to the second step of the takings analysis with\n\nrespect     to   interest,    the   JUA     alleges   that   by   temporarily\n\nwithholding the Earned Premiums, Flores Galarza physically took\n\n$14.2 million in interest generated by them. See Parella, 173 F.3d\n\nat 59 n.10 (stating that in order to demonstrate a taking of\n\ninterest, \"plaintiffs have the burden of proving that they had a\n\nconstitutional     right     both   to    the   principal    (i.e.,    withheld\n\nbenefits) and to the interest on that principal\").                    The JUA's\n\nassertion of a property right in the interest generated by the\n\nEarned Premiums, together with its allegation of a physical taking\n\nof that interest, is sufficient to allege the unconstitutional\n\ntaking of that interest under the first prong of the qualified\n\nimmunity analysis.     See Brown, 538 U.S. at 235; Webb's, 449 U.S. at\n\n164-65.32\n\n\n31\n  It follows, of course, that the JUA does not possess a property\nright to the interest lost as a result of the withholding of the\nDuplicate Premiums, which we have held do not belong to the JUA.\nSee Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys., 173 F.3d 46,\n62 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that defendant's refusal to pay\ninterest on withheld benefits was not a taking because plaintiffs\ndid not demonstrate property right to benefits).\n32\n  The allegation that Flores Galarza took the interest on the full\namount of the $173 million in Earned Premiums that was withheld\ncovers at least a portion of the interest generated by the\nOverstated Reserve Funds and the Out-of-Pocket Funds, which were\npart of that $173 million total. It appears that the $14.2 million\nin claimed interest also includes the interest on the Overstated\nReserve and Out-of-Pocket Funds that were retained after the\n\n                                     -63-\n\f          6. Summary of Analysis of      the   First   Prong   of    the\n          Qualified Immunity Doctrine\n\n          The JUA has successfully alleged that Flores Galarza\n\ncommitted a constitutional violation by taking its Earned Premiums,\n\nOverstated Reserve Funds, Out-of-Pocket Funds, and the interest\n\ngenerated thereon.   The JUA has failed to allege a taking of the\n\nDuplicate Premiums or the interest generated thereon.     Therefore,\n\nas we turn to the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis\n\n(i.e., whether the impermissibility of the taking was clearly\n\nestablished at the time of the violation), we exclude from our\n\nanalysis the Duplicate Premiums and the related interest.\n\nB. Second Prong: Constitutional Right was \"Clearly Established\" at\n   Time of Violation\n\n          \"The second question [of the qualified immunity analysis]\n\ndeals with fair warning; it asks whether the law was clearly\n\nestablished at the time of the constitutional violation.\"      Savard\n\nv. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir. 2003) (en banc).         This\n\nrequirement ensures that \"officers are on notice that their conduct\n\nis unlawful\" before subjecting them to suit.   Saucier, 533 U.S. at\n\n206.   One way of determining whether a constitutional right was\n\nclearly established at the time of the alleged violation \"is to ask\n\nwhether existing case law gave the defendants fair warning that\n\ntheir conduct violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\"\n\n\nSettlement. Such interest also is embraced within our conclusion\nthat the JUA adequately alleged an unconstitutional taking of the\ninterest.\n\n                               -64-\n\fSuboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office of Suffolk, 298 F.3d 81, 93 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).   In conducting this inquiry, \"[t]he court must canvass\n\ncontrolling authority in its own jurisdiction and, if none exists,\n\nattempt to fathom whether there is a consensus of persuasive\n\nauthority elsewhere.\"   Savard, 338 F.3d at 28.\n\n           Significantly, \"[t]his inquiry 'must be undertaken in\n\nlight of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general\n\nproposition.'\"   Wilson, 421 F.3d at 56 (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S.\n\nat 201).   As we have noted, \"[c]ourts must be careful not to permit\n\nan artful pleader to convert the doctrine of qualified immunity\n\ninto a hollow safeguard simply by alleging a violation of an\n\nexceedingly nebulous right.\"33    Limone v. Condon, 372 F.3d 39, 46\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           On the other hand, \"[t]his exploration is not limited to\n\ncases directly on point . . . .         '[O]fficials can still be on\n\nnotice that their conduct violates established law even in novel\n\nfactual circumstances' . . . .\"     Savard, 338 F.3d at 28 (quoting\n\nHope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002)).         In striking this\n\nbalance, we have noted that\n\n     the relevant legal rights and obligations must be\n     particularized enough that a reasonable official can be\n     expected to extrapolate from them and conclude that a\n     certain course of conduct will violate the law.\n\n\n33\n  We note that, given the required specificity, \"the bases for\nthe[] determinations [under the second and third prongs of the\nqualified immunity analysis] often overlap.\" Savard, 338 F.3d at\n27.\n\n                                 -65-\n\f     Consequently, if the operative legal principles are\n     clearly established only at a level of generality so high\n     that officials cannot fairly anticipate the legal\n     consequences of specific actions, then the requisite\n     notice is lacking. The bottom line is that the qualified\n     immunity defense prevails unless the unlawfulness of the\n     challenged conduct is \"apparent.\"\n\nSavard, 338 F.3d at 28 (citation omitted) (quoting Anderson v.\n\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)).\n\n          The JUA argues that \"[t]he contours of the Takings Clause\n\n. . . are very straightforward in the case where the government\n\ntakes property from an individual for public use,\" as alleged here.\n\nRelying   upon     cases   which     hold   that   uncompensated    physical\n\nappropriations of private property – including interest – are\n\nunconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment, the JUA contends that\n\nits \"right to be justly compensated for the taking of its property\"\n\nwas \"clearly established\" at the time of the challenged conduct.\n\n          Not surprisingly, Flores Galarza disagrees.              While \"it\n\n[i]s clearly established that the taking of a property interest\n\nwithout just compensation [i]s unconstitutional,\" he argues that\n\nthis proposition is too broad to satisfy the second prong of the\n\nqualified immunity analysis.         \"The property rights claimed by the\n\nJUA,\" Flores Galarza contends, \"cannot be easily read into the law\n\nenabling the JUA and the Compulsory Liability Insurance,\" and,\n\ntherefore,   are    not    clearly   established.      We   now    test   that\n\nproposition.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -66-\n\f          1.   The Earned Premiums and Interest34\n\n          We already have concluded that the JUA, under Law 253,\n\nalleges a property interest in the Earned Premiums and the interest\n\ngenerated by those premiums.   Because Law 253 was on the books at\n\nthe time Flores Galarza withheld the Earned Premiums and interest,\n\nwe conclude that the JUA's alleged property interest in those funds\n\nwas clearly established.   Flores Galarza essentially acknowledged\n\nas much (at least with respect to the Earned Premiums) by returning\n\nthe Earned Premiums to the JUA pursuant to the 2002 Settlement.\n\n          The law was not so clear, however, that Flores Galarza's\n\nalleged withholding of the Earned Premiums and interest was a\n\ntaking.   Law 253 does not establish when the Secretary must\n\ntransfer the premiums to the JUA.     As noted by Flores Galarza,\n\n          [t]he compulsory insurance law is completely\n          devoid of a timetable that controls the\n          transfer of the premiums collected by the\n          Secretary of the Treasury to the JUA.     The\n          statute simply states that the transfers must\n          be made. However, when these transfers must\n          be made is an entirely different question.\n          The JUA has never pointed to any substantive\n\n\n\n34\n  The JUA does not explicitly allege a separate property right in\nthe interest on the Overstated Reserve and Out-of-Pocket Funds,\npresumably because such an allegation is largely subsumed within\nits interest allegation concerning the Earned Premiums. See supra\nnote 32. We therefore address interest in this section and the\nnext only in the context of the Earned Premiums. To the extent\ninterest on the Overstated Reserve and Out-of-Pocket Funds is not\ncovered by that discussion – i.e., for interest accruing on those\nfunds after the Settlement amount was transferred to the JUA – our\ndiscussion of the principal amounts suffices to dispose of the\ninterest.\n\n                               -67-\n\f              source that establishes its entitlement to a\n              prompt transfer of the premiums.\n\n(Citation omitted.)         Under the second prong of the qualified\n\nimmunity analysis, it is not enough for the JUA to argue that\n\nFlores Galarza physically took the Earned Premiums to which the JUA\n\nwas entitled under Law 253.             Here, the JUA must demonstrate that\n\nLaw 253 entitled the JUA to the Earned Premiums within a specified\n\namount of time, such that the unlawfulness of Flores Galarza's\n\ntemporary withholding of the premiums was \"apparent.\"                  This it\n\ncannot do.     Indeed, even if we imported into Law 253 a requirement\n\nthat the Secretary transfer the premiums to the JUA within a\n\nreasonable period of time, that reasonableness requirement would be\n\ntoo indefinite to allow us to conclude that the alleged taking was\n\nclearly      established.        The    unlawfulness    of   Flores   Galarza's\n\ntemporary withholding of the Earned Premiums, therefore, was not\n\n\"apparent\" under the statute. The right to interest inescapably is\n\ntied to the JUA's entitlement to the premiums and therefore also\n\nwas not clearly established.\n\n              2.   The Overstated Reserve Funds\n\n              The lack of clarity is even more apparent with respect to\n\nthe Overstated Reserve Funds, which was the portion of the Reserve\n\nin excess of the amount necessary to reimburse insureds or insurers\n\nwho already had paid for coverage.             Certainly after enactment of\n\nthe   2002     Amendment    to    the    compulsory    insurance   law,   which\n\nspecifically required the JUA to transfer to the Secretary all\n\n                                        -68-\n\ffunds held in the Reserve as of December 31, 2001, the law did not\n\nclearly establish that the JUA had a property right in the $10\n\nmillion of Overstated Reserve Funds or, indeed, that withholding\n\nany   of    the     designated     Reserve      of    $73   million    was   an\n\nunconstitutional taking.          Whether, and how much, of that $10\n\nmillion is in fact \"excess\" remains a matter of debate.\n\n            Although the Secretary began withholding the Overstated\n\nReserve    Funds    in   2000,   along   with   the    Earned   and   Duplicate\n\nPremiums, the alleged $10 million excess was undifferentiated from\n\nthe balance of the Earned Premiums.              As noted earlier, the JUA\n\nessentially claims that the $10 million should be considered Earned\n\nPremiums in which it holds a property right, and as such that money\n\nis encompassed within our prior discussion. Therefore, the law was\n\nnot clearly established either before or after the 2002 Amendment\n\nthat the Secretary's retention of the Overstated Reserve Funds was\n\nan unconstitutional taking.\n\n            3.     The Out-of-Pocket Funds\n\n            The JUA argues that it has a clearly established right to\n\nthe $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds, which Flores Galarza\n\nallegedly should have deducted from the $73 million Reserve he took\n\non behalf of the Commonwealth.           Since it is undisputed that the\n\nOut-of-Pocket funds belong to the JUA, the JUA's alleged property\n\nright in the Out-of-Pocket Funds is clearly established.                It also\n\nwas clearly established that the physical taking of property,\n\n\n                                     -69-\n\fwithout compensation, violated the Constitution. See Tahoe-Sierra,\n\n535 U.S. at 322-23 (noting that the Supreme Court's \"jurisprudence\n\ninvolving condemnations and physical takings is as old as the\n\nRepublic\").   We therefore conclude that Flores Galarza's alleged\n\nphysical taking of the Out-of-Pocket Funds alleged a violation of\n\nclearly established law.35\n\n          4. Summary of Analysis of the Second Prong of the\n          Qualified Immunity Doctrine\n\n          The JUA has successfully alleged that Flores Galarza's\n\ntaking of the Out-of-Pocket Funds violated clearly established\n\nconstitutional law.    The JUA has failed to allege a clearly\n\nestablished violation of law with respect to the Earned Premiums,\n\nthe interest generated by those premiums, or the Overstated Reserve\n\nFunds.   Therefore, as we turn to the third prong of the qualified\n\nimmunity analysis (whether a reasonable officer would have believed\n\nthat the alleged conduct violated clearly established law), we\n\nfocus only on the alleged taking of the Out-of-Pocket Funds.\n\nC. Third Prong: Reasonable Official Would Believe that Action\n   Violated Clearly Established Right\n\n\n\n\n35\n  While we note that the law was \"clearly established,\" we take no\nposition on whether Flores Galarza's alleged appropriation of the\nOut-of-Pocket Funds was, in fact, a taking without compensation.\n\"The inquiry into qualified immunity is separate and distinct from\nthe inquiry into the merits.\" Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos, 151 F.3d 1,\n7 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\n\n                               -70-\n\f             \"The final prong of the qualified immunity analysis,\n\noften the most difficult one for the plaintiff to prevail upon, is\n\n'whether an objectively reasonable official would have believed\n\nthat   the    action   taken   violated     that   clearly     established\n\nconstitutional    right.'\"     Wilson,    421   F.3d   at   57-58   (quoting\n\nStarlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto, 253 F.3d 137, 141 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\nThe qualified immunity inquiry recognizes that \"[i]t is not always\n\nevident at the time an official takes an action that a clearly\n\nestablished right is involved.     For example, the factual situation\n\nmight be ambiguous or the application of the legal standard to the\n\nprecise facts at issue might be difficult.\"        Riverdale Mills Corp.\n\nv. Pimpare, 392 F.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir. 2004).                So long as an\n\n\"officer's mistake as to what the law requires is reasonable,\"\n\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 205, the officer will be entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity.\n\n             The JUA argues that \"[t]he fact that the [JUA's] property\n\nwas taken without any compensation whatsoever – and actually, to a\n\nvery large cost to the [JUA] – would have alerted any reasonable\n\nofficial that he was violating [the JUA's] rights under the Takings\n\nClause.\"     We disagree.\n\n             After the Secretary discontinued the transfer of premiums\n\nin 2000, the JUA was forced to pay out a total of $13.6 million of\n\nits own funds to third parties seeking reimbursement.               The 2002\n\nAmendment was subsequently enacted, which required the JUA to pay\n\n\n                                  -71-\n\fto the Secretary $73 million in Reserve funds.     One month later,\n\npursuant to the 2002 Settlement, Flores Galarza made a \"massive\n\ntransfer of all the funds [he] had retained since [he] stopped\n\nmaking the transfers,\" but he held back the $73 million in Reserve\n\nfunds that the JUA was required to pay the Secretary under the 2002\n\nAmendment. As Flores Galarza argues, a reasonable officer in these\n\ncircumstances would have believed that he \"had a law mandate,\n\nstemming from the [2002 Amendment], to retain for use by the\n\nDepartment of Treasury the Reserve Fund recognized by JUA as of\n\nDecember 31, 2001.   Any officer in his shoes would have acted as he\n\ndid in immediately retaining the full Reserve Fund amount without\n\nany compensation\" to the JUA.       Nothing in the 2002 Amendment\n\nsuggests that funds owed to the JUA had to be deducted from the $73\n\nmillion Reserve, and that the failure to do so would constitute a\n\ntaking. As Flores Galarza argues, \"money [is] fungible in nature.\"\n\nThus, a reasonable officer could have believed that the 2002\n\nAmendment required \"the JUA [] to replenish the Reserve Fund\" and\n\nthen debit the Out-of-Pocket Funds \"from this 'new' Reserve Fund\n\n. . . and not from the [$73 million] Reserve allocation recognized\n\nas of December 31, 2001.\"   In that way, the JUA would be made whole\n\nwith respect to the Out-of-Pocket Funds.      Because a reasonable\n\nofficer would not have believed that retaining $13.6 million in\n\nOut-of-Pocket Funds violated the JUA's clearly established rights,\n\n\n\n\n                                -72-\n\fwe conclude that Flores Galarza is entitled to qualified immunity\n\non this claim.\n\n                                        VI.\n\n            We summarize the essential points of our analysis.                The\n\nJUA has standing to sue Flores Galarza under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and\n\nthe Supreme Court's prudential ripeness requirements for takings\n\nclaims pose no barrier to our consideration of the case.                   We may\n\nnot, however, address res judicata issues in this interlocutory\n\nappeal.        Flores Galarza is amenable to suit in his official\n\ncapacity   under       the   Eleventh   Amendment    because   the   JUA    seeks\n\nprospective declaratory and injunctive relief against him in that\n\ncapacity, namely: a declaration that his taking of insurance\n\npremiums, interest, and other funds to alleviate the cash-flow\n\nproblems of the Commonwealth violates the Constitution; and an\n\ninjunction enjoining him from withholding insurance premiums and\n\nfrom enforcing the terms of the 2002 Amendment to the extent they\n\namount    to    an     unconstitutional    taking.      Notwithstanding       the\n\nindistinct      line    between   official-    and   personal-capacity      suits\n\nagainst government officials, we conclude that the JUA seeks to\n\nhold Flores Galarza liable in his personal capacity for damages.\n\nWe conclude, however, that he is immune from such liability.\n\nSpecifically, because the law was not clearly established that\n\nFlores Galarza effected an unconstitutional taking of the withheld\n\ninsurance premiums, the interest generated by those premiums, or\n\n\n                                        -73-\n\fthe Overstated Reserve Funds, he is entitled to qualified immunity\n\non these claims.   Additionally, because a reasonable officer would\n\nnot have believed that the failure to reimburse the JUA for the\n\nOut-of-Pocket Funds violated the JUA's rights, qualified immunity\n\nforecloses a damages remedy against him on that claim as well.\n\n          In conclusion, we affirm the district court's decision\n\nthat the JUA has standing to sue Flores Galarza, and that Flores\n\nGalarza is amenable to suit in his official capacity under the\n\nEleventh Amendment.   We reverse the district court's decision that\n\nFlores Galarza is not entitled to qualified immunity from suit in\n\nhis personal capacity.    Each party shall bear its own costs of\n\nappeal.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n                   - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                                -74-\n\f          HOWARD, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.   One\n\npart of this appeal concerns a takings claim under the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments of the federal Constitution against Juan\n\nFlores Galarza, a state official acting in his individual capacity,\n\nfor withholding millions of dollars from the JUA, a state-created\n\npool of insurers. The lead opinion concludes that a viable takings\n\nclaim may exist against state officials acting in their individual\n\ncapacities, but that Flores Galarza is entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity because his withholding funds was reasonable in light of\n\nthe unique circumstances present.     Ante at 67-69.     I am not\n\nentirely convinced that federal takings claims may ever properly\n\nlie against state officials acting in their individual capacities.\n\nCf. Monell v.

But we should\n\nnot be resolving this difficult question here because the JUA's\n\nindividual capacity claim against Flores Galarza is not ripe under\n\n\n\n\n                               -75-\n\fWilliamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of\n\nJohnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 195 (1985).\n\n            In Williamson County, the Supreme Court held that a\n\nfederal takings claim is not ripe until the claimant has met two\n\npreconditions.      See 473 U.S. at 186, 194-95.         First, in    regulatory\n\ntakings cases, the claimant must show that the government entity\n\ncharged with enforcing the regulation at issue has rendered a final\n\ndecision on the regulation's meaning (\"the finality requirement\").\n\nSee id. at 186; Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC v. Rhode Island, 337\n\nF.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that the finality requirement\n\ndoes not apply in physical takings cases).             Second, in regulatory\n\nand physical takings cases, the claimant must pursue compensation\n\nfor the alleged taking through state processes, so long as the\n\nstate provides a \"reasonable, certain and adequate provision for\n\nobtaining compensation\" (\"the litigation requirement\"). Williamson\n\nCounty,    473   U.S.   at   194-95;    Pascoag,   337    F.3d   at   92.    The\n\nlitigation requirement follows from the principle that no federal\n\ntakings violation occurs until \"just compensation\" has been denied\n\nby the state.     See Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 520 U.S.\n\n725,   733 (1997).\n\n            My disagreement with the lead opinion's treatment of the\n\nripeness    issue    concerns    its     application      of   the    litigation\n\n\n\n\n                                       -76-\n\frequirement.36    According to the lead opinion, claimants must avail\n\nthemselves only of state process to recover compensation if the\n\nstate has adopted a process \"particularly aimed at providing\n\ncompensation when government action effects a taking\" and that\n\n\"such [process does] not include litigation of a state takings\n\nclaim [under the state constitution] or any general remedial cause\n\nof action under state law.\"            Ante at 26 & 28.       Based on this\n\nreasoning, the JUA's claim against Flores Galarza is deemed ripe\n\nbecause Puerto Rico does not offer a specific administrative\n\nprocess or cause of action to seek \"compensation in the unusual\n\ncircumstance of an alleged unconstitutional taking arising from the\n\ngovernment's appropriation of funds.\"          Id. at 29.\n\n            There is no support in Supreme Court precedent for the\n\nconclusion    that   claimants     are    relieved      of   the   litigation\n\nrequirement    unless   the    state    has   adopted   specific    processes\n\n(presumably by way of statute) through which such compensation may\n\nbe   recovered.      Indeed,   Williamson      County   suggests    just   the\n\nopposite.    The Williamson County Court derived the litigation rule\n\nfrom procedural due process cases holding that a plaintiff does not\n\nhave a due process claim \"unless or until the state fails to\n\nprovide an adequate remedy for the property loss.\"                 Id. at 195\n\n(citing Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 532 n.12 (1984)).              In the\n\n\n36\n  The finality requirement does not apply because the JUA seeks\ncompensation for a physical, rather than a regulatory, taking.\nPascoag, 337 F.3d at 91.\n\n                                   -77-\n\fdue process context, the Court has held that common-law remedies\n\navailable in state-court actions are adequate.            Hudson, 468 U.S.\n\n534-35.   Yet the causes of action recognized as adequate in Hudson\n\nare exactly the sort of \"general remedial causes of action under\n\nstate law\" that the lead opinion deems insufficient here.           Ante at\n\n26.\n\n           Several other federal courts have rejected my colleagues'\n\nlimitation on the litigation requirement.         The Second Circuit has\n\nheld that a federal takings claim was not ripe under Williamson\n\nCounty because the claimant had not brought a state-court action\n\nseeking recovery under the takings clause of the Connecticut\n\nConstitution.    Villager Pond, Inc. v. Town of Darien, 56 F.3d 375,\n\n379-80 (2d Cir. 1995); see also Southview Assocs. v. Bongartz, 980\n\nF.2d 84, 100 (2d Cir. 1992) (concluding that takings case was not\n\nripe   because   plaintiff   did    not   bring   claim     under   Vermont\n\nConstitution's takings clause seeking compensation).37          Similarly,\n\nthe Ninth Circuit ordered dismissal of a federal takings claim as\n\nnot ripe where the claimant did not bring an action for recovery\n\nunder the Hawaii Constitution's takings clause.           Austin v. City &\n\nCounty of Honolulu, 840 F.2d 678, 681 (9th Cir. 1988).              And the\n\nFifth Circuit rejected a takings claim on ripeness grounds where\n\n\n\n37\n   Indeed, in Southview, 980 F.2d at 100, the court explicitly\nrejected the argument that Williamson County's litigation\nrequirement mandated the claimant to pursue state processes only if\nthe state provided a specific statutory avenue of relief.\n\n                                   -78-\n\fthe claimant could have, but did not, bring a state-court nuisance\n\naction to obtain compensation.          See Samaad v. City of Dallas, 940\n\nF.2d 925, 935 (5th Cir. 1991); accord Wiltzius v. Town of New\n\nMilford, 453 F. Supp. 2d 421, 431 (D. Conn. 2006) (takings claim\n\nnot ripe because claimant did not bring state court action under\n\nstate constitution to seek compensation); Franco v. Dist. of\n\nColumbia, 456 F. Supp. 2d 35, 42 (D.D.C. 2006) (takings claim not\n\nripe where claimant failed to bring contract action in state court\n\nto obtain compensation); Bender v. City of Clearwater, 2006 WL\n\n1046944, at *23 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 19, 2006) (\"Plaintiff must look to\n\nstate remedies for compensation for the alleged taking, whether\n\nthat remedy is titled 'an inverse condemnation' claim or something\n\nelse, such as a suit for damages or trespass, before he can pursue\n\nhis   takings    claim   in   federal     court.\").      These    cases    amply\n\ndemonstrate     that   adequate   state     process    under    the    litigation\n\nrequirement     encompasses   more   than    just     those    state   processes\n\n\"particularly aimed at providing compensation\" for a government\n\ntaking.38   Ante at 26.\n\n\n38\n  I understand that the lead opinion seeks to limit the litigation\nrequirement because of its concern that preclusion principles will\nprevent takings claims from being litigated in federal court, if\nclaimants must pursue state remedies in state court. See ante at\n28. This was the view of four Justices of the Supreme Court in San\nRemo Hotel v. City & County of San Francisco, 545 U.S. 323, 349\n(Rehnquist C.J., concurring) who proposed revisiting the litigation\nrequirement. The majority, however, disagreed, concluding that \"it\nis hardly a radical notion to recognize that . . . a significant\nnumber of plaintiffs will necessarily litigate their federal\ntakings claims in state courts.\" Id. at 347.      As the Court has\n\n                                     -79-\n\f          In    light   of   this   understanding    of   the   litigation\n\nrequirement, the remaining question is whether Puerto Rico provides\n\n\"an adequate procedure\" for the JUA to seek compensation.              The\n\nburden of proving that no adequate state process is available rests\n\nwith the JUA.   See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. La. Dep't of Ins., 62\n\nF.3d 115, 117 (5th Cir. 1995).       It is not enough to show only that\n\nthe adequacy of state process remains unsure and undeveloped; it\n\nmust be shown to be unavailable.           See Culebras Enters. Corp. v.\n\nRivera Rios, 813 F.2d 506, 513-15 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding that\n\ntaking claimant was required to seek compensation from the Puerto\n\nRico courts even though the Puerto Rico Supreme Court had never\n\nawarded damages in an inverse condemnation action); accord, e.g.,\n\n\n\n\nrejected this concern as a basis for revisiting the litigation\nrequirement, it does not serve as an adequate basis for\nsubstantially limiting it in this circuit.\n\n     The lead opinion also supports its limiting construction of\nthe litigation requirement by suggesting that requiring claimants\nto pursue state constitutional takings claims or other general\ncauses of action would require claimants to exhaust state remedies,\nwhich is inconsistent with Supreme Court caselaw interpreting 42\nU.S.C. § 1983. E.g., Pasty v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 457 U.S. 496\n(1982)   The Williamson County Court accepted this argument for\npurposes of the finality requirement, by holding that a claimant\nneed not exhaust judicial review after a state agency has\ndefinitively interpreted a regulation. 473 U.S. at 192-93. But\nthe Court did not endorse a similar limiting principle for the\nlitigation requirement. Moreover, Washlefske v. Winston, 234 F.3d\n179, 183 (9th Cir. 2000), relied on by the lead opinion for its\nexhaustion analysis, states that exhaustion is not required to meet\nthe finality requirement; it says nothing about the scope of the\nlitigation requirement.\n\n                                    -80-\n\fVillager Pond, 56 F.3d at 380; S. Pac. Transp. Co. v. City of Los\n\nAngeles, 922 F.2d 498, 505 n.8 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\n          Puerto Rico's Constitution includes a takings provision,\n\nSee P.R. Const. Art. II, § 9, and Flores Galarza suggests that the\n\nJUA could seek compensation through a mandamus action.                     It is not\n\nentirely clear that the JUA could obtain the compensation that it\n\nseeks   through    either      an        action     under     the    Commonwealth's\n\nConstitution or some other cause of action.                   But it has not been\n\nshown   that   such     relief      is    unavailable        either.       In   these\n\ncircumstances,    the    JUA   was       required    to     pursue   its   state-law\n\nremedies before turning to the federal Constitution for relief.\n\nE.g., Southview Assocs., 980 F.2d at 100.                 Because the JUA did not\n\npursue compensation through the state system, its federal claim\n\nagainst Flores Galarza, in his individual capacity, should have\n\nbeen dismissed on ripeness grounds.39\n\n\n\n\n39\n  I agree that, to the extent the JUA is pursuing facial challenges\nto Puerto Rico statutes, the litigation requirement is not\nimplicated.

Flores Galarza moved for judgment on the pleadings, claiming that the forms of relief sought by the plaintiff (declaratory, injunctive, and damages) were barred by the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of qualified immunity.

For the reasons set forth below, after concluding that the JUA has standing to sue Flores Galarza, we conclude that, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, Flores Galarza is amenable to suit in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief, but is protected from damages in his personal capacity by the doctrine of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

On December 27, 1995, in response to financial losses from uncompensated damages to motor vehicles in traffic accidents, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"Commonwealth\") enacted the Compulsory Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Act, Act No. 253 (\"Law 253\"), codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 8051-61. Under Law 253, liability insurance coverage is required for all motor vehicles that travel on public thoroughfares. Law 253 \"provides each insured vehicle owner with $3000 of coverage for damages caused to third parties per accident in exchange for a uniform premium, initially set at $99 for each private passenger vehicle and $148 for each commercial vehicle.\" <i>Arroyo-Melecio v. P.R. Am. Ins. Co.,</i> 398 F.3d 56, 60-61 (1st Cir.2005) (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 8052(j), 8056(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All \"private insurers\" &#8212; defined under Law 253 as those with more than 1% of the total volume of vehicle liability premiums in Puerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 8052(b) &#8212; are required to provide compulsory liability insurance in one of two ways. First, private insurers are \"bound to provide the compulsory liability insurance to those motor vehicle owners that request it,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 8054(a), unless those owners meet certain statutory criteria, most of which \"identify applicants who are bad drivers or otherwise of high risk,\" <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 61. Second, private insurers are required to provide compulsory liability insurance as members of the JUA, to which they must belong. The JUA is an association of all private insurers in Puerto Rico, which \"provides compulsory liability insurance to all drivers, including those high-risk drivers whom private insurers are not required to insure.\" <i>Id.</i> (footnote omitted). \"Through the JUA, the risk of insuring these high-risk drivers is thus spread among all the private insurers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every vehicle owner must either: (1) pay the premium for compulsory liability insurance to the Secretary of the Treasury at the time that the owner acquires or renews a vehicle license, effectively as part of the license payment; or (2) opt out of the compulsory liability insurance scheme by privately purchasing liability insurance with comparable or better coverage. <i>Id.</i> at 61 n. 2 (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 8061).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In the case of those vehicle owners who pay the Secretary for compulsory liability insurance, \"[t]he [JUA] shall receive from the Secretary of the Treasury the total amount of the compulsory liability insurance premiums received by said official, for its eventual distribution among the private insurers and the [JUA] itself, as the case may be.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 8055(c). The JUA's administrative and operating expenses are \"charged to the amount received from the corresponding premiums according to this distribution.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a vehicle owner does not present a Certificate of Compliance proving that he carries traditional liability insurance, he must pay the compulsory liability insurance premium on the date of issuance or renewal of the vehicle license, and may then seek reimbursement directly from the JUA or from his insurer, who will, in turn, seek reimbursement from the JUA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, the funds transferred from the Secretary to the JUA appear to consist of: (1) premium payments from individuals seeking to purchase insurance through the JUA who paid the Secretary, as required by the statute, when they obtained or renewed their vehicle licenses, (2) duplicate premium payments from individuals who are purchasing the compulsory insurance directly from a private insurer, but who paid the compulsory assessment to the Secretary along with their license fees (and who thus are eligible for a refund from the JUA), and (3) duplicate premium payments from individuals who have adequate traditional liability coverage, but who did not obtain the Certificate of Compliance that would have exempted them from the compulsory assessment (who also are eligible for a refund). The JUA is responsible for distributing the premiums it receives from the Secretary to its member insurers for the coverage they provide. <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 61 n. 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA is required to file an annual statement with the Insurance Commissioner detailing its financial condition, transactions, and affairs for the preceding calendar year. Because a portion of the total amount of premiums received by the JUA may be owed to third parties who seek refunds for duplicate payments &#8212; i.e., vehicle owners who bought insurance from a private insurer but also paid the compulsory liability premium when obtaining licenses, or private insurers who have reimbursed their insureds for payment of the compulsory premium &#8212; the JUA is required by regulation to set aside these premiums and accumulate them in a separate reserve account (\"Reserve\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Secretary's Withholding of Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the effective date of the compulsory liability insurance system on January 1, 1998,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the JUA has been unable to determine exactly how many registered motor vehicles in Puerto Rico are covered by private liability insurance. The JUA initially estimated that 25% of all vehicles were covered by policies from private insurers, and, accordingly, set aside 25% of all premiums received and accumulated them in the Reserve. By 2001, experience and additional data revealed that the actual proportion of privately insured registered motor vehicles was closer to 17%. As a result, the Reserve as disclosed in the December 2001 annual statement &#8212; approximately $73 million &#8212; exceeded the actual amount owed to third parties by approximately $10 million (\"Overstated Reserve Funds\"). In other words, the JUA set aside and accumulated in the Reserve approximately $10 million more than was actually owed to privately insured vehicle owners and their insurers who would be seeking reimbursement for the purchase of duplicative compulsory liability insurance. In 2001, the JUA sought permission from the Insurance Commissioner to adjust the Reserve to the accumulated level that it would have been if only 17% of all premiums had been set aside, rather than 25%. The Insurance Commissioner agreed to allow the JUA to adjust the Reserve for the 2001 fiscal year, but did not allow any adjustments for the preceding fiscal years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998 and 1999, the Secretary collected the insurance premiums and transferred them to the JUA in accordance with Law 253.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The JUA then set aside a portion of these premiums in the Reserve. Beginning in 2000, however, the Secretary discontinued the transfer of compulsory liability insurance premiums to the JUA in an attempt to ease the Commonwealth's cash-flow problems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> On May 30, 2002, the JUA filed a petition for mandamus against the Secretary in the Puerto Rico Superior Court, requesting an order that the Secretary transfer to the JUA the withheld compulsory liability insurance premiums. By September 2002, the Secretary had withheld approximately $173 million in premiums from the JUA. Because of the Secretary's failure to transfer the insurance premiums, the JUA was forced to liquidate approximately $98 million of investments in order to comply with its own cash-flow needs. The liquidation of the JUA's investments, together with the lost opportunity to invest new premiums, resulted in a loss to the JUA of $14.2 million in interest. Despite the Secretary's withholding of premiums, the JUA continued to reimburse privately insured motorists and their insurers from its own funds. From January 2002 through September 2002, the JUA reimbursed third parties out-of-pocket a total of $13.6 million (\"Out-of-Pocket Funds\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The 2002 Amendment to Law 253</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 11, 2002, the Puerto Rico Legislature amended Law 253, 2002 P.R. Laws 230 (\"2002 Amendment\"), to require the JUA to turn over to the Secretary all funds held in the Reserve as of December 31, 2001 (i.e., $73 million), and to continue providing such funds every two years thereafter. The 2002 Amendment requires the Secretary to keep these funds in a fiduciary capacity for five years, to be reimbursed to owners of privately insured motor vehicles and their insurers who seek refunds, after which time the funds become the property of the Commonwealth and pass to the general fund of the Commonwealth Treasury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The 2002 Amendment also provides that any excess funds in the Reserve, that is, any funds included in the Reserve based on estimates which exceed the actual amount owed to third parties (the Overstated Reserve Funds), shall be immediately available for use by the Commonwealth. Income generated from the funds provided to the Secretary shall also be immediately available for use by the Commonwealth. Lastly, while the Secretary continues to transfer to the JUA the total amount of compulsory liability insurance premiums, the 2002 Amendment allows the Secretary to deduct from these premiums a fee for the collection service it performs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

Because the JUA does not argue that Flores Galarza's taking of property violated its substantive or procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, the JUA appears to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment only for purposes of bringing a Fifth Amendment Takings claim against Flores Galarza. <i>See Chi., Burlington &amp; Quincy R.R. Co. v. City of Chi.,</i> 166 U.S. 226, 239, 17 S.Ct. 581, 41 L.Ed. 979 (1897) (holding that the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment).

Finally, the JUA sought from Flores Galarza, in his personal capacity, approximately $38 million in damages: $10 million in Overstated Reserve Funds, $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds, and $14.2 million in lost interest as a result of Flores Galarza's taking of the insurance premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores Galarza filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(c), arguing that: the JUA lacked standing to sue Flores Galarza in any capacity; Eleventh Amendment immunity barred the JUA from suing Flores Galarza in his official capacity; and the doctrine of qualified immunity barred the JUA from suing Flores Galarza in his personal capacity. The district court denied Flores Galarza's motion, holding that the JUA was not an arm of the state and therefore was not precluded from suing Flores Galarza;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> that Flores Galarza was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity because the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by the JUA was prospective, as was the JUA's claimed right to \"money allegedly unconstitutionally attached\" by Flores Galarza, i.e., \"the insurance premiums for the compulsory liability insurance [and] . . . certain funds belonging to JUA\"; and that Flores Galarza was not entitled to qualified immunity because the JUA alleged a constitutional violation that was well established at the time of the alleged conduct. Flores Galarza filed a motion for reconsideration that was also denied.

We raised two issues <i>sua sponte,</i> mindful of our obligation to consider the basis of appellate jurisdiction, even if the parties have assumed its existence. <i>See Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir.2003). After oral argument, we asked the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the following questions: (1) whether the JUA's claim meets the prudential ripeness requirements of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on takings, and (2) whether the res judicata doctrine bars our review. As we discuss below, neither of those doctrines precludes our jurisdiction. Nor do we find any other jurisdictional barriers to this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Availability of Interlocutory Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking, appeals are permitted only from final judgments of the district court. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. There are, however, several exceptions. \"Chief among these is the so-called collateral order doctrine,\" by which \"an order may be appealed immediately if it `finally determine[s] claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.'\" <i>Espinal-Dominguez,</i> 352 F.3d at 495 (quoting <i>Cohen v.

Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> 506 U.S. 139, 143, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993) (\"[O]rders denying individual officials' claims of . . . qualified immunity are among those that fall within the ambit of [the collateral order doctrine]. . . .

Calder&#243;n,</i> 448 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir.2006) (stating that denial of qualified immunity is an appealable final decision). Flores Galarza claims that, even on the facts construed in the light most favorable to the JUA, he is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity in his official capacity and qualified immunity in his personal capacity as a matter of law. The district court's denial of these claims thus falls within the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Ripeness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff frequently must scale \"two independent prudential hurdles\" before bringing a takings claim against state entities in federal court. <i>Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency,</i> 520 U.S. 725, 733-34, 117 S.Ct. 1659, 137 L.Ed.2d 980 (1997). The Supreme Court explained in <i>Williamson County Reg'l Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City,</i> 473 U.S. 172, 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985), that such a plaintiff must demonstrate that he has both received a final decision from the state on the use of his property and \"sought `compensation through the procedures the State has provided for doing so,'\" <i>Suitum,</i> 520 U.S. at 734, 117 S.Ct. 1659 (quoting <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff in <i>Williamson County</i> had alleged that the application of various zoning laws and regulations to its property in Tennessee amounted to a taking of that property. The Supreme Court held that the claim was not ripe because the plaintiff had \"not yet obtained a final decision regarding the application of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations to its property, nor utilized the procedures Tennessee provides for obtaining just compensation.\" 473 U.S. at 186, 105 S.Ct. 3108. The Court noted that the Board of Zoning Appeals had the power to approve variances to the zoning ordinance, and the Planning Commission could grant variances from the subdivision regulations. The plaintiff, however, had not sought such variances, and thus, \"respondent has not yet obtained a final decision regarding how it will be allowed to develop its property.\" <i>Id.</i> at 190, 105 S.Ct. 3108.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court held that the claim also was not ripe for a second reason: the plaintiff had not sought recovery through the state's inverse condemnation procedure, under which a property owner may seek just compensation for an alleged taking of property effected by restrictive zoning laws or development regulations. <i>Id.</i> at 196, 105 S.Ct. 3108. The Court explained that, because the Fifth Amendment proscribes not the taking of property, but takings <i>without just compensation,</i> \"[if] the government has provided an adequate process for obtaining compensation, and if resort to that process `yield[s] just compensation,' then the property owner `has no claim against the Government' for a taking.\" <i>Id.</i> at 194-95, 105 S.Ct. 3108 (alteration in original) (quoting <i>Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.,</i> 467 U.S. 986, 1013 n. 21, 104 S.Ct. 2862, 81 L.Ed.2d 815 (1984)). Because the plaintiff in <i>Williamson County</i> \"ha[d] not shown that the inverse condemnation procedure is unavailable or inadequate,\" the takings claim was premature \"until it has utilized that procedure,\" <i>id.</i> at 197, 105 S.Ct. 3108. <i>Cf. Gonz&#225;lez-&#193;lvarez v. Rivero-Cubano,</i> 426 F.3d 422, 427 (1st Cir.2005) (finding no <i>Williamson County</i> ripeness barriers where plaintiffs claimed that cancellation of their milk production quotas violated the Takings Clause: \"Since in this case, the state has always clearly denied that any compensation would be due and there is no state remedy available for seeking compensation, the second hurdle falls away.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For multiple reasons, the <i>Williamson County</i> prudential ripeness concerns are inapposite here. First, to the extent that the JUA is making a facial statutory challenge, its takings claim need not be brought first to a Commonwealth body, either administrative or judicial. <i>See Suitum,</i> 520 U.S. at 736 n. 10, 117 S.Ct. 1659 (\"`[F]acial' challenges to regulation are generally ripe the moment the challenged regulation or ordinance is passed, but face an `uphill battle,' since it is difficult to demonstrate that `\"mere enactment\"' of a piece of legislation `deprived [the owner] of economically viable use of [his] property.'\") (citations omitted); <i>Yee v. City of Escondido,</i> 503 U.S. 519, 534, 112 S.Ct. 1522, 118 L.Ed.2d 153 (1992) (finding petitioners' facial challenge ripe because it \"does not depend on the extent to which petitioners are deprived of the economic use of their particular pieces of property or the extent to which these particular petitioners are compensated\"); <i>Quicken Loans, Inc. v. Wood,</i> 449 F.3d 944, 953 (9th Cir.2006) (finding that a facial takings claim was ripe when the challenged statutes were enacted); <i>Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n v. Rowe,</i> 429 F.3d 294, 307 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[A] facial challenge is usually ripe `the moment the challenged regulation or ordinance is passed,'\" but \"`face[s] an uphill battle.'\" (alterations in original) (citations omitted)). The JUA arguably has stated two facial challenges: (1) that Law 253 effects a taking in failing to provide for the transfer to the JUA of interest earned on its money during the time the Commonwealth holds the funds; and (2) that the 2002 Amendment effects a taking by requiring transfer to the Commonwealth of the <i>excess</i> reserve funds, some of which belong to the JUA, and by explicitly \"taking\" the interest on those funds to use for Commonwealth operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More significantly, however, the <i>Williamson County</i> requirements are not fully applicable to the type of taking alleged here. The Court in <i>Suitum</i> noted that <i>Williamson County</i> identified \"two independent prudential hurdles to a <i>regulatory</i> takings claim brought against a state entity in federal court.\" 520 U.S. at 733-34, 117 S.Ct. 1659 (emphasis added). This is not a regulatory takings case. The JUA has alleged a physical taking &#8212; \"a direct government appropriation . . . of private property,\" <i>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.,</i> 544 U.S. 528, 537, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876 (2005) &#8212; and the analysis for such a claim differs from that of a regulatory taking. <i>See infra</i> at Section V(A)(2). We previously have held that the finality prong of <i>Williamson County</i> is inapplicable to physical takings and that only the \"just compensation\" prong remains. <i>See Pascoag Reservoir &amp; Dam LLC v. Rhode Island,</i> 337 F.3d 87, 91-92 (1st Cir.2003) (\"In a physical taking case, the final decision requirement is relieved or assumed. . . . However, . . . `[c]ompensation must first be sought from the state if adequate procedures are available.'\") (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if both <i>Williamson County</i> prerequisites applied, however, they would not foreclose our jurisdiction. The case law addressing the first \"hurdle\" focuses on whether the administrative body responsible for applying the challenged regulations has completed discretionary review of the plaintiff's particular situation. Here, there is no pending administrative process that could, through a variance, waiver or other discretionary decision, modify the statute's impact on the JUA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the second \"hurdle\" &#8212; the need to seek compensation through procedures provided by the state &#8212; pose a barrier here. <i>See Suitum,</i> 520 U.S. at 734, 117 S.Ct. 1659 (\"The second hurdle stems from the Fifth Amendment's proviso that only takings without `just compensation' infringe that Amendment; `if a State provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation, the property owner cannot claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.'\" (quoting <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 195, 105 S.Ct. 3108)). Most commonly in regulatory takings cases &#8212; which typically involve land-use regulation &#8212; such a procedure is a state inverse condemnation proceeding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> <i>See, e.g., Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 196, 105 S.Ct. 3108; <i>Urban Developers LLC v. City of Jackson,</i> 468 F.3d 281, 295 (5th Cir.2006); <i>SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v. Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 415 F.3d 135, 139 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that \"[a]dequate procedures for seeking just compensation are available under Puerto Rico law,\" and referring specifically to an inverse condemnation remedy). For takings claims asserted against the federal government, the applicable procedure is a claim brought under the Tucker Act. <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 195, 105 S.Ct. 3108 (\"[T]aking claims against the Federal Government are premature until the property owner has availed itself of the process provided by the Tucker Act.\" (citation omitted)); <i>see also Student Loan Mktg. Ass'n v. Riley,</i> 104 F.3d 397, 401 (D.C.Cir. 1997) (\"Normally a taking claim against the federal government must be brought as a suit for money damages (i.e., the `just compensation' that the Constitution assures) under the Tucker Act . . . .\") (citing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1491).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key component of this prong of <i>Williamson County</i> is the availability of a process that is particularly aimed at providing compensation when government action effects a taking. <i>See, e.g., McNamara v. City of Rittman,</i> 473 F.3d 633, 638 (6th Cir.2007) (noting that \"the critical inquiry\" after <i>Williamson County</i> is whether the state has \"`reasonable, certain[] and adequate'\" compensation procedures, and identifying mandamus as the vehicle available to Ohio landowners who were not provided the required \"appropriation proceeding\") (citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> In our view, such procedures do not include litigation of a state takings claim or any general remedial cause of action under state law. Rather, the Supreme Court must have had in mind only those procedures specifically designed by the state to avoid constitutional injury in the first instance by providing a means for a plaintiff to obtain compensation for the government's taking of property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An inverse condemnation cause of action is a classic example of such a particularized procedure; it gives a property owner aggrieved by government conduct the opportunity to obtain compensation, thereby avoiding an unconstitutional taking. Requiring plaintiffs to avail themselves of such a procedure before bringing a federal takings claim protects the state's opportunity to use the scheme it designed specifically to avoid constitutional injury. By contrast, requiring plaintiffs to invoke any generally available state procedure that might provide a remedy for an uncompensated taking before bringing a federal claim would \"transform[] <i>Williamson County's</i> finality rule into a rule of exhaustion,\" <i>Washlefske v. Winston,</i> 234 F.3d 179, 183 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result would be in diametric opposition to a foundational decision of modern &#167; 1983 jurisprudence, <i>Monroe v.

Brown,</i> 380 F.3d 793, 797-98 (5th Cir.2004) (noting that \"the exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not an independent federal law prerequisite to a federal takings claim,\" but that plaintiff was obliged to seek compensation in an inverse condemnation action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The holding in <i>Williamson County</i> that a federal takings claim is not ripe until the plaintiff has sought compensation through state procedures has drawn substantial criticism, including from Chief Justice Rehnquist in his concurring opinion in <i>San Remo Hotel v. City of San Francisco,</i> 545 U.S. 323, 125 S.Ct. 2491, 162 L.Ed.2d 315 (2005), because of the risk that preclusion law will result in barring \"litigants who go to state court to seek compensation . . . [from] assert[ing] their federal takings claims in federal court,\" <i>id.</i> at 351, 125 S.Ct. 2491. <i>See also, e.g.,</i> J. David Breemer, You Can Check Out But You Can Never Leave: The Story of <i>San Remo Hotel</i> &#8212; the Supreme Court Relegates Federal Takings Claims to State Courts Under A Rule Intended to Ripen the Claims for Federal Review, 33 B.C. Envtl. Aff.

L.Rev. 199 (2006) (\"Judicial Jurisdiction Stripping\"). The risk of preclusion becomes a reality when, in the course of ruling on the plaintiff's compensation claim, the state court reaches federal constitutional issues. <i>See San Remo Hotel,</i> 545 U.S. at 342-43, 125 S.Ct. 2491; <i>see also Torromeo v. Town of Fremont,</i> 438 F.3d 113, 117 (1st Cir.2006) (affirming res judicata dismissal of federal takings claim where claim \"<i>was</i> actually litigated to a final judgment on the merits in the state court\") (emphasis in original). At least some of the commentary assumes that federal takings plaintiffs would need to pursue an available <i>state</i> takings claim, among other procedures, to meet the <i>Williamson County</i> requirements &#8212; which almost inevitably would lead to an overlap with federal principles. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Judicial Jurisdiction Stripping, <i>supra</i> at 204-05.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider a state takings claim to be remedial in nature, however, and not a \"procedure[] the State has provided for [seeking compensation],\" <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108. <i>See id.</i> at 194 n. 13, 105 S.Ct. 3108 (contrasting review procedures with \"procedures that allow a property owner to obtain compensation for a taking\"). A takings claim seeks damages for the unconstitutional taking of property without due compensation. By contrast &#8212; as discussed above &#8212; an inverse condemnation proceeding is designed to enable plaintiffs to obtain compensation &#8212; which, if granted, would <i>avoid</i> the alleged constitutional violation that the takings claim is intended to remedy. This is a subtle, but important distinction. As with more general remedial provisions, requiring a state takings claim as a prerequisite to a federal takings claim effectively would impose an exhaustion requirement &#8212; which the Supreme Court explicitly said it did not do in <i>Williamson County.</i> Moreover, although we have not done a survey, we suspect that, like Puerto Rico, most state constitutions have takings provisions. <i>See</i> P.R. Const. Art. II, &#167; 9. We thus think it likely that the Supreme Court would have made explicit reference to a state takings claim if it deemed such a cause of action a relevant \"procedure\" for purposes of the second prong of <i>Williamson County.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, no Commonwealth administrative process or cause of action has been identified through which a claimant is expected to seek compensation in the unusual circumstance of an alleged unconstitutional taking arising from the government's appropriation of funds. <i>Cf. Gonz&#225;lez-&#193;lvarez,</i> 426 F.3d at 427 (noting the lack of an available state process for seeking compensation for cancellation of milk production quotas); <i>SFW Arecibo,</i> 415 F.3d at 139 (noting Puerto Rico's inverse condemnation procedure for land-based takings claims).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, another line of cases suggests the inapplicability of the <i>Williamson County</i> prerequisites to a taking that involves the direct appropriation of funds. In <i>Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel,</i> 524 U.S. 498, 118 S.Ct. 2131, 141 L.Ed.2d 451 (1998) (plurality opinion), the Supreme Court considered a challenge to the Coal Act, which established a mechanism for funding health care benefits for coal industry retirees. <i>Id.</i> at 504, 118 S.Ct. 2131. Under the Act, private coal operators were required to contribute to the payment of premiums to fund such benefits. One such operator, Eastern, brought suit claiming that the Act, either on its face or as applied, violated substantive due process and constituted a taking of its property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court considered whether the takings claim needed to be asserted first under the Tucker Act, which, as noted above, usually must be a preliminary step in a takings action against the federal government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plurality observed that Eastern was not seeking compensation from the government; it was requesting declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the act by the Commissioner of Social Security. The Justices noted conflicting lower court precedent on whether a claim for equitable relief under the Takings Clause, even without a request for damages, must be brought first under the Tucker Act. <i>Id.</i> at 520-21, 118 S.Ct. 2131. The plurality rejected such a prerequisite, stating that \"Congress could not have contemplated that the Treasury would compensate coal operators for their liability under the Act, for `[e]very dollar paid pursuant to a statute would be presumed to generate a dollar of Tucker Act compensation.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 521, 118 S.Ct. 2131 (quoting <i>In re Chateaugay Corp.,</i> 53 F.3d 478, 493 (2d Cir.1995)). The Court plurality continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the \"presumption of Tucker Act availability must be reversed where the challenged statute, rather than burdening real or physical property, requires a direct transfer of funds\" mandated by the Government. [<i>In re Chateaugay,</i> 53 F.3d at 493.] In that situation, a claim for compensation \"would entail an utterly pointless set of activities.\" <i>Student Loan Marketing Ass'n v. Riley,</i> 104 F.3d 397, 401 [(D.C.Cir.1997)]. Instead, . . . the Declaratory Judgment Act \"allows individuals threatened with a taking to seek a declaration of the constitutionality of the disputed governmental action before potentially uncompensable damages are sustained.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). Five members of the Court went on to conclude that the Coal Act's application to Eastern was unconstitutional, but Justice Kennedy relied on due process, rather than takings, principles. <i>See id.</i> at 537, 539, 118 S.Ct. 2131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case differs from <i>Apfel</i> because, among other distinctions, it does not involve the federal government and the Tucker Act. Nonetheless, the nature of the claim&#8212;that Puerto Rico's Secretary of the Treasury improperly withheld money belonging to the JUA so that it may be used for public purposes&#8212;strikes us as equivalent to the complaints about the \"direct transfer of funds\" at issue in <i>Apfel</i> and the decisions it cites. Application of the <i>Williamson County</i> prerequisites here similarly could only \"`entail an utterly pointless set of activities.'\" For that reason, and the others we have noted, we conclude that <i>Williamson County's</i> prudential factors do not prevent our review of the JUA's takings claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores Galarza challenges the JUA's statutory standing, arguing that the JUA, as a \"state-created entity,\" lacks standing to \"challenge actions taken by the state that created it [because] it is [not] absolutely clear from the enabling statute that such access was expressly intended by the state legislature.\" The JUA contends that, while it was \"created via an official act of the state,\" the JUA is not an \"arm of the state [with] no constitutional rights to assert against the state which created it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores Galarza's argument is precluded by our case law. In <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> we stated that, while \"[t]he JUA is under some direction by the commonwealth,\" it is \"private in nature\" and is therefore \"not an agency of the commonwealth.\" 398 F.3d at 62. A private corporation may allege a constitutional violation under &#167; 1983. <i>See Ill. Clean Energy</i> <i>Cmty. Found. v. Filan,</i> 392 F.3d 934, 936-37 (7th Cir.2004) (holding that state-created foundation was not a state agency and therefore could sue the state for taking its property); <i>Advocates for the Arts v. Thomson,</i> 532 F.2d 792, 794 (1st Cir.1976) (\"That [plaintiff] is a corporation has no bearing on its standing to assert violations of the first and fourteenth amendments under 42 U.S.C. [&#167;] 1983.\"). The JUA is therefore a proper plaintiff in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Res Judicata</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his supplemental brief, Flores Galarza asserts that the JUA seeks \"exactly the same remedy that it previously sought\"&#8212; and failed to receive&#8212;in the Commonwealth court, and argues that the doctrine of res judicata bars the federal court from reaching a different outcome on identical claims involving the same parties. In response, the JUA emphasizes that both of the Commonwealth court's rulings&#8212;the Partial Judgment issued in July 2003 and the Judgment issued in September 2003&#8212; were \"without prejudice,\" and it argues that, under Puerto Rico law, a judgment without prejudice is not an adjudication on the merits that would trigger res judicata consequences. <i>See Pueblo Int'l, Inc. v. Cruz,</i> 17 P.R. Offic. Trans. 275, 1986 WL 376796 (1986) (Hernandez Denton, J., concurring and dissenting) (citing <i>Fresh-O-Baking Co. v. Molinos de P.R.,</i> 103 D.P.R. 509, 514, 1975 WL 38832 (1975)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not reach the substantive res judicata question, however, because we conclude that it is outside the limited sphere of this interlocutory appeal. Although we have not previously held explicitly that res judicata, unlike standing, may not be reviewed along with immunity issues, we intimated as much in <i>Nieves-M&#225;rquez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 353 F.3d 108, 123 (1st Cir.2003), where we considered the scope of an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss based on Eleventh Amendment immunity. We cited there the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n,</i> 514 U.S. 35, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995), where the Court held that a court of appeals does not have discretion to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction in an interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity unless \"the otherwise unappealable issue is [] `inextricably intertwined' with the issue on collateral order appeal.\" 353 F.3d at 123 (quoting <i>Swint,</i> 514 U.S. at 48-51, 115 S.Ct. 1203). We concluded that the question whether a cause of action for damages exists is \"inextricably intertwined with the issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity\" and therefore could be addressed in an interlocutory appeal. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so ruling, however, we noted the Third Circuit's decision in <i>Bell Atlantic-Pennsylvania, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission,</i> 273 F.3d 337, 343-45 (3d Cir.2001), on the \"very different issue[]\" of whether denial of a motion to dismiss on res judicata grounds was immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine. The Third Circuit held that it was not, and we observed that, \"[l]ike the Third Circuit, we agree that not every issue raised by the denial of a pre-trial motion to dismiss may be reached on collateral order appeal; indeed most may not be.\" 353 F.3d at 124. We construe that observation as an endorsement of the Third Circuit's refusal to address res judicata in an interlocutory appeal. Moreover, we find a similar perspective in the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc.,</i> 511 U.S. 863, 114 S.Ct. 1992, 128 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994). In that case, the Court listed preclusion among a collection of claims that arguably relate to a \"right not to stand trial\" and therefore could plausibly warrant interlocutory appellate review. <i>See id.</i> at 873, 114 S.Ct. 1992. The Court, however, cautioned that such claims must be viewed \"with skepticism, if not a jaundiced eye,\" to avoid emasculating Congress's final decision rule. <i>Id.</i> at 871-73, 114 S.Ct. 1992. Consistent with this precedent, we conclude that res judicata is not properly addressed at this stage of the case. <i>See, e.g., Timpanogos Tribe v. Conway,</i> 286 F.3d 1195, 1200 (10th Cir.2002) (finding no basis to review pendent res judicata claim with Eleventh Amendment interlocutory claim); <i>Garramone v. Romo,</i> 94 F.3d 1446, 1452 (10th Cir.1996) (holding that district court's res judicata ruling could not be reviewed in interlocutory appeal on immunity issues). <i>See generally</i> 15A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 3911.4 at 424-26 (2d ed. 1992) (\"[C]ollateral order appeal is not automatically available to review . . . rejection of an argument that repetitious litigation is barred by res judicata....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Summary of Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before turning to an analysis of the Eleventh Amendment immunity and qualified immunity claims, we pause to summarize the varied claims for relief made by the JUA. We do so because we must be clear about the precise nature of those claims in conducting the immunity analyses. As noted above, the JUA seeks three kinds of relief. First, the JUA seeks a declaratory judgment against Flores Galarza in his official capacity, declaring that he violated the JUA's constitutional rights by:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) withholding $173 million in insurance premiums for an extended period so that the funds could be used to ease the Commonwealth's cash flow problems, before transferring a large portion of those premiums to the JUA pursuant to the 2002 Settlement; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) permanently appropriating: (a) $14.2 million in interest on lost or forgone investments as a result of Flores Galarza's taking of the insurance premiums; (b) $10 million in Overstated Reserve Funds that do not belong to third parties and therefore should have been deducted from the $73 million retained by Flores Galarza; and (c) $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds that the JUA was forced to pay to third parties from its own funds and therefore should have been deducted from the $73 million retained by Flores Galarza.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the JUA seeks injunctive relief from Flores Galarza in his official capacity, enjoining him from:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) withholding any more insurance premiums; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) enforcing the terms of the 2002 Amendment, that is, from requiring the JUA to transfer Reserve funds to the Secretary every two years, and from retaining interest income earned on the Reserve funds and any Overstated Reserve Funds (i.e., funds included in the Reserve that are not actually owed to third parties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the JUA seeks approximately $38 million in damages from Flores Galarza in his personal capacity, that is: (1) $14.2 million in lost interest as a result of Flores Galarza's taking of the insurance premiums; (2) $10 million in Overstated Reserve Funds; and (3) $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds. These items of damage mirror the items identified in the permanent appropriation portion of the demand for declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a district court's denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity and qualified immunity turns upon purely legal questions, our review is de novo. <i>See Rodr&#237;guez-Mar&#237;n v. Rivera-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 438 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir.2006) (reviewing de novo denial of qualified immunity); <i>Redondo Constr. Corp. v. P.R. Highway &amp; Transp. Auth.,</i> 357 F.3d 124, 126 (1st Cir. 2004) (reviewing de novo denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity). \"The standard for evaluating a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that for deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. `[T]he trial court must accept all of the nonmovant's well-pleaded factual averments as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.'\" <i>Pasdon v. City of Peabody,</i> 417 F.3d 225, 226 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro,</i> 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir.1988)). \"Judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) may not be entered unless it appears beyond a doubt that the nonmoving party can prove no set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief.\" <i>Feliciano v. Rhode Island,</i> 160 F.3d 780, 788 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Eleventh Amendment Immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores Galarza argues that the Eleventh Amendment bars the JUA's suit against him in his official capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> He emphasizes that the JUA seeks damages of $10 million in Overstated Reserve Funds, $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds, and $14.2 million in lost interest during the period in which the insurance premiums were retained, all of which \"[are] clearly retrospective in nature.\" Flores Galarza misapprehends the JUA's argument. While the complaint is not a model of clarity on this point,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> the JUA explained in its argument to us and to the district court that it is not seeking damages from Flores Galarza in his official capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA states that, while it \"seeks damages against Mr. Flores Galarza in his personal capacity,\" it seeks only prospective injunctive relief from Flores Galarza in his official capacity&#8212;\"enjoin[ing him] from <i>continuing</i> to engage in the unconstitutional conduct.\" (Emphasis added.) At oral argument before us, the JUA stated that it merely seeks to compel the transfer of compulsory liability insurance premiums in the future&#8212;a remedy that it argues \"is clearly a prospective one.\" The JUA further argues that \"[t]he fact that funds would have to be transferred [in the future] as a result of the injunction requested does not create an Eleventh Amendment bar to the issuance of the injunction\" because these funds do not constitute damages, but rather \"belong to the JUA and are held by [the Secretary] in a fiduciary capacity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In many instances, a suit against a state official is a suit against the state, thereby triggering Eleventh Amendment immunity. <i>See Muirhead v. Mecham,</i> 427 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[A] suit, although nominally aimed at an official, will be considered one against the sovereign `if the judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public administration, or if the effect of the judgment would be to restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.'\") (quoting <i>Dugan v. Rank,</i> 372 U.S. 609, 620, 83 S.Ct. 999, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963)). While the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a party from bringing suit against a state in federal court, <i>see De Leon Lopez,</i> 931 F.2d at 121, it does not prohibit a party from bringing suit against a state officer in federal court for prospective declaratory or injunctive relief under federal law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 155, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). <i>See generally</i> Erwin Chemerinsky, <i>Federal Jurisdiction</i> &#167; 7.5, at 424 (4th ed.2003) (distinguishing prospective injunctive relief against a state officer, which the Eleventh Amendment does not forbid, from \"retroactive relief&#8212; damages to compensate past injuries,\" which the Eleventh Amendment does forbid).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Ex parte Young,</i> the Supreme Court created an exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity \"for suits challenging the constitutionality of a state official's action, on the theory that since the state cannot authorize such an unconstitutional action, the officer is `stripped of his official or representative character and ... subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.'\" <i>Parents for Quality Educ. With Integration, Inc. v. Indiana,</i> 977 F.2d 1207, 1209 (7th Cir.1992) (quoting <i>Pennhurst,</i> 465 U.S. at 102, 104 S.Ct. 900). <i>Ex parte Young</i> thus \"allows a way around the bar to federal jurisdiction ... in cases where prospective declaratory or injunctive relief is sought under federal law.\" <i>Mills v. Maine,</i> 118 F.3d 37, 54 (1st Cir. 1997). Here, the JUA seeks a declaration that the taking of insurance premiums by Flores Galarza in his official capacity violates the Constitution and an injunction enjoining Flores Galarza from enforcing the terms of the 2002 Amendment&#8212;that is, from requiring the JUA to transfer Reserve funds every two years and from retaining either the interest earned on those funds or any excess Reserve funds not owed to traditionally insured vehicle owners or their insurers. We agree with the district court that these requests are for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief that is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> Therefore, the district court's denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity to Flores Galarza in his official capacity was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Official Versus Personal-Capacity Suits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA argues that Flores Galarza, in his personal capacity, temporarily withheld approximately $173 million in compulsory liability insurance premiums for an \"unreasonable period[] of time,\" and, in so doing, appropriated $14.2 million in interest generated by those premiums. The JUA also argues that Flores Galarza personally appropriated $10 million in Overstated Reserve Funds and $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the JUA does not seek to hold Flores Galarza personally liable for the full $173 million in withheld insurance premiums, most of which was subsequently paid to the JUA pursuant to the 2002 Settlement, nor does the JUA seek to hold Flores Galarza personally liable for the full $73 million in Reserve funds retained by Flores Galarza after the 2002 Settlement. Instead, the JUA seeks to hold Flores Galarza personally liable for interest lost on the $173 million plus two portions of the $73 million Reserve&#8212;i.e., the Overstated Reserve Funds and Out-of-Pocket Reserve Funds. The total amount sought by the JUA is approximately $38 million, that is, roughly $14.2 million in lost interest, $10 million in Overstated Reserve Funds, and $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds. Flores Galarza contends that he is not liable in his personal capacity based on qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before analyzing whether Flores Galarza is entitled to qualified immunity, we pause to note the unusual nature of this personal-capacity suit. We are troubled by the notion that the personal-capacity claim against Flores Galarza, by which the JUA seeks enormous personal damages from him, is really a subterfuge for an official-capacity suit that seeks payment from the Commonwealth Treasury. Certainly the line between personal assets and the Commonwealth fisc seems indistinct. The JUA has sued the Secretary of the Treasury; the JUA claims that the Secretary temporarily withheld and permanently appropriated the JUA's funds for the benefit of the Commonwealth; and some of the damages sought by the JUA correspond to funds accumulated in the general fund pursuant to the 2002 Amendment. \"`[W]hen the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit....'\" <i>Metcalf,</i> 991 F.2d at 939 (quoting <i>Ford Motor Co. v. Dep't of Treasury,</i> 323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945), <i>overruled on other grounds by Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Syst. of Ga.,</i> 535 U.S. 613, 122 S.Ct. 1640, 152 L.Ed.2d 806 (2002)). There is a plausible view of this case that the demand for damages from Flores Galarza is, in essence, a demand for the recovery of money from the Commonwealth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering that possibility, we have looked closely at <i>Hafer v. Melo,</i> 502 U.S. 21, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991), a case in which the Supreme Court tried to clarify the distinction between official- and personal-capacity suits. There, the plaintiffs sued the auditor general of Pennsylvania, Hafer, after she fired them from their jobs, alleging that they were fired for personal reasons in violation of the First Amendment; they sought monetary damages from Hafer personally. The claims against Hafer had nothing to do with her handling of funds in the state treasury, nor did the damages sought bear any relationship to funds accumulated in the state treasury. <i>Id.</i> at 23, 112 S.Ct. 358.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the principles set forth in <i>Hafer</i> make the factual distinctions between this case and <i>Hafer</i> seemingly irrelevant. There, the Court said that \"the phrase `acting in their official capacities' is best understood as a reference to the capacity in which the state officer is sued, not the capacity in which the officer inflicts the alleged injury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 26, 112 S.Ct. 358. Even earlier, the Supreme Court had suggested that in determining whether a suit involves a personal- or official-capacity claim, we should be guided by the complaint or, if not clearly specified in the complaint, by the \"[t]he course of proceedings.\" <i>Kentucky v. Graham,</i> 473 U.S. 159, 167 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the complaint, in combination with the course of proceedings, <i>see supra</i> note 25, establishes that Flores Galarza is being sued for damages in his personal capacity. If the JUA wishes to seek a personal judgment against Flores Galarza in a ruinous and probably uncollectible amount for actions that he took as the Commonwealth Treasurer to serve the interests of the Commonwealth, they are entitled to do that. <i>See generally Chemerinsky, supra,</i> &#167; 7.5.2, at 430 (\"[T]he fact that a government officer is acting in the scope of official duties is not enough to bar a suit as being in `official capacity'.\"). If such a judgment might induce the Commonwealth to indemnify Flores Galarza from the Commonwealth Treasury to spare him from ruin, that likelihood is irrelevant to the personal-capacity determination. <i>See Berman Enters., Inc. v. Jorling,</i> 3 F.3d 602, 606 (2d Cir.1993) (\"Whether or not a state would choose to reimburse an official for damages for constitutional harm he caused in his individual capacity is a matter of no concern to a federal court.\"). <i>See generally Chemerinsky, supra,</i> &#167; 7.5.2, at 423 (\"State indemnification policies are irrelevant for Eleventh Amendment analysis and do not prevent federal court relief against individual officers.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> In short, in a suit \"against an officer for money damages when the relief would come from the officer's own pocket, there is no Eleventh Amendment bar even though the conduct was part of the officer's official duties. In such a suit, the officer could claim absolute or qualified immunity as a defense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 429. We turn, therefore, to Flores Galarza's qualified immunity defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our starting point is the principle that \"government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" <i>Harlow v.

Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). As we have noted, \"[t]he first prong inquiry at this 12(b)(6) stage is unlikely to be very specific, given that federal civil practice is based on notice pleading, where great specificity is not required, and that there is no heightened pleading requirement for civil rights cases.\" <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> 392 F.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir.2004) (citations omitted). The JUA argues that Flores Galarza took its private property without compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, by physically appropriating the insurance premiums, the interest lost as a result of the withholding of those premiums, the Overstated Reserve Funds, and the Out-of-Pocket Funds. This alleged violation of its constitutionally protected property rights, the JUA argues, is thus sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis. Flores Galarza argues that the JUA fails to allege a taking of its property in satisfaction of the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis for two reasons: first, the JUA is a state-created entity, which, like the state itself, lacks the capacity to allege a taking under &#167; 1983; and second, the complaint does not allege the elements of a successful takings claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

V. Takings claims involve a two-step inquiry. \"To make a cognizable claim of a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment, the plaintiffs must first show that they possess a recognized property interest which may be protected by the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs must point to credible sources for their claimed property interest . . . `such as state law-rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.'\" <i>Wash.

Legal Found.,</i> 993 F.2d at 974. The Supreme Court has recognized two types of takings: physical takings and regulatory takings. <i>See Brown v. Legal Found. of Wash.,</i> 538 U.S. 216, 233, 123 S.Ct. 1406, 155 L.Ed.2d 376 (2003). As already noted, the JUA asserts a physical taking, and we therefore confine our analysis to that strand of takings law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A physical taking occurs either when there is a condemnation or a physical appropriation of property.\" <i>Philip Morris, Inc. v.

Swift,</i> 358 F.3d 91, 98 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"For a plaintiff to overcome a qualified immunity defense, he must show that his allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation....\"). In accordance with our two-step approach to takings claims, the JUA must first allege a constitutionally protected property right to the funds in dispute. The JUA argues that, pursuant to Law 253 and the 2002 Amendment, \"[t]he premiums collected and withheld by [Flores Galarza],\" the \"interest derived from the withheld premiums,\" and the Overstated Reserve Funds and Out-of-Pocket Funds&#8212;\"are the private property of the [JUA].\" Second, the JUA must allege a taking of that property. The JUA argues that Flores Galarza's appropriation of the funds in dispute is equivalent to a \"permanent physical occupation and a <i>per se</i> taking for which just compensation must be paid.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores Galarza, on the other hand, argues that the JUA's takings claim fails both prongs of the takings analysis. According to Flores Galarza, \"the JUA cannot establish that it has a recognizable property interest\" in any of the funds in dispute or that Flores Galarza's appropriation of these funds constitutes a taking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking all facts in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, as we must at this threshold stage of the qualified immunity analysis, <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, we find that the JUA alleges the taking of a constitutionally protected property interest in most, but not all, of the funds in dispute under Law 253 and the 2002 Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Insurance Premiums</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>a. The Earned Premiums</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA argues that \"the premiums collected and withheld by the [Secretary] are the private property of the [JUA]\" under the plain language of Law 253. According to the JUA, although the premiums pass through Flores Galarza's hands before reaching the JUA, the premiums are never funds of the Commonwealth. To the contrary, the JUA argues, given that the JUA's responsibility for the compulsory insurance comes into effect at the time the premiums are paid to the Secretary of the Treasury, \"the premium has to belong to the [JUA] at that time.\" Flores Galarza, the JUA argues, is thus merely a fiduciary who holds the premiums for the benefit of the JUA, as demonstrated by the 2002 Amendment's reference to the Secretary of the Treasury's \"collection service performed in favor of the [JUA].\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 8055(c). Flores Galarza, on the other hand, contends that Law 253 \"does not entitle JUA to ownership of the collected premiums until they are transferred to it by [Flores Galarza].\" Therefore, Flores Galarza argues, because Law 253 does not state \"when\" the Secretary must transfer the insurance premiums to the JUA, his retention of the $173 million in premiums was not a withholding of private property&#8212;it was merely a \"temporary retention or delay\" in the transfer of funds which did not yet belong to the JUA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, Law 253 supports the JUA's claim of a property right to that portion of the insurance premiums not owed to privately insured motorists or their insurers (\"Earned Premiums\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>). Law 253 created the JUA for \"[t]he main purpose of ... provid[ing] the compulsory liability insurance to the applicants for said insurance that have been rejected by private insurers.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 8055(b). As an insurer, the JUA is entitled to the Earned Premiums. Law 253 gives the JUA the power to hold property, and provides that the JUA \"shall receive\" premiums from the Secretary and that the Secretary \"shall transfer\" these premiums to the JUA. While the Secretary collects the insurance premiums and holds them for some unspecified amount of time before relinquishing them to the JUA, the Secretary is not an insurer&#8212;he is merely the custodian of these funds. As a custodian, the Secretary has no entitlement to the premiums, and his woefully undeveloped argument that the premiums do not vest in the JUA until the Secretary transfers them does not convince us otherwise. <i>Cf. Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith,</i> 449 U.S. 155, 162, 101 S.Ct. 446, 66 L.Ed.2d 358 (1980) (\"[T]he State's having mandated the accrual of interest does not mean the State or its designate is entitled to assume ownership of the interest.\"). The JUA has successfully alleged an entitlement to the Earned Premiums under Law 253, and therefore a property interest in those funds. <i>See id.</i> at 161, 101 S.Ct. 446 (recognizing interest earned on private funds as property entitled to protection under Fifth Amendment); <i>see also Brown,</i> 538 U.S. at 235, 123 S.Ct. 1406; <i>Phillips v. Wash. Legal Found.,</i> 524 U.S. 156, 170-72, 118 S.Ct. 1925, 141 L.Ed.2d 174 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus proceed to the second step of the takings analysis (i.e., whether the property was taken). The JUA argues that Flores Galarza's withholding of the Earned Premiums constituted a \"permanent physical occupation and a <i>per se</i> taking for which just compensation must be paid.\" Specifically, the JUA contends that Flores Galarza physically took, albeit temporarily, $173 million of its insurance premiums, before transferring a large portion of those premiums to the JUA pursuant to the 2002 Settlement. The JUA's assertion of a property right in the Earned Premiums, together with its allegation of a physical appropriation of those funds, is sufficient to allege the taking of a constitutionally protected property interest in those premiums under the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis. <i>See Webb's,</i> 449 U.S. at 164-65, 101 S.Ct. 446 (holding that taking of interest earned on private funds was a taking).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>b. Reserve Fund: the Duplicate Premiums</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the JUA's alleged property right to the Earned Premiums is supported by Law 253, the same cannot be said for the JUA's alleged property right to the duplicate premiums paid by those already covered by privately obtained insurance policies (\"Duplicate Premiums\"). These premiums, Flores Galarza argues, \"constitute a double payment for the same insurance,\" and, therefore, do not belong to the JUA, but rather belong to privately insured motorists or their insurers who are entitled to reimbursement. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the law in effect at the time the premiums were withheld, the JUA was obliged to return the Duplicate Premiums to those requesting reimbursement. If no claim was made to these premiums after seven years, that money would lapse to the general fund of the Commonwealth Treasury. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 2603, 2606-2607. Thus, even if no one claimed the Duplicate Premiums within the requisite seven years, these funds became the property of the Commonwealth&#8212;not the JUA. Just as the Secretary is a custodian of the Earned Premiums for the benefit of the JUA, the JUA is a custodian of the Duplicate Premiums for the benefit of either those entitled to reimbursement or, if the premiums go unclaimed, the Commonwealth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 2002 Amendment, which requires the JUA to transfer the Duplicate Premiums to the Secretary after just two years, explicitly recognizes the JUA's lack of a property right to the Duplicate Premiums. The \"Statement of Motives\" section of the 2002 Amendment states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">during the existence of the Association, certain funds have been accumulated that <i>do not belong to it</i> . . . [which] results from the fact that a great number of [privately insured] consumers ... pay the corresponding [compulsory liability insurance] premium . . . when they obtain the motor vehicle license for the first time or when they renew it, but they do not request the Association to reimburse the money as is their right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although claiming a right to all of the insurance premiums, the JUA concedes that a portion of the premiums collected by the Secretary (i.e., the Duplicate Premiums placed in the Reserve) \"may belong to third parties: either motor vehicle owners with private insurance or private insurers who reimbursed their insureds.\" The JUA consequently admits that a large portion of the $73 million Reserve is the property of others. Given the lack of support for the JUA's claimed property right to the Duplicate Premiums, the JUA fails to allege a taking of this portion of the premiums under the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>c. Reserve Fund: the Overstated Funds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that the JUA has not alleged a property interest in the Duplicate Premiums does not extend to the remainder of the Reserve Fund&#8212;the \"Overstated Reserve Funds\"&#8212;which consists of the cushion set aside by the JUA to ensure that the Reserve was large enough to meet all of the requests for reimbursement by insureds who purchased private insurance. As noted earlier, the $73 million Reserve held back by the Commonwealth allegedly contained approximately $10 million in excess funds&#8212;money that, as it turned out, was not needed for reimbursement because fewer individuals than estimated had purchased their own policies, which meant, in turn, that less of the Reserve than anticipated constituted Duplicate Premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the JUA, \"since the [Overstated Reserve Funds] came from the [JUA] and do not, in fact, belong to others, they should have been accounted for as income for the [JUA].\" Flores Galarza contends that since these funds are merely portions of the Reserve, which, in turn, \"is merely an accounting tool\" for allocating the Duplicate Premiums, \"the JUA has no proprietary interest[] in the[se] moneys.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"Statement of Motives\" section of the 2002 Amendment, which was in place prior to Flores Galarza's appropriation of the Overstated Reserve Funds in November 2002, explicitly provides that the $73 million Reserve consists of funds \"that <i>do not belong to it</i> [the JUA]\" as the result of the double payment of insurance premiums by some drivers. The 2002 Amendment therefore requires the JUA to immediately transfer to the Secretary \"the funds known in its annual statement as `Funds Retained by the Insurer Belonging to Others'\"&#8212; that is, the $73 million Reserve&#8212;and to continue doing so every two years. There is, however, no carve-out for the \"cushion\" portion of the Reserve that consists of Overstated Funds. In fact, the 2002 Amendment provides that the Reserve funds transferred to the Secretary necessarily include any \"reserve excess,\" and that this reserve excess \"may be used as resources in the General Fund.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 8055(l).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA argues, in essence, that to the extent the Amendment directs the transfer of the Overstated Reserve Funds to the Commonwealth, the provision effects a taking of the JUA's property. Under Law 253, the JUA is obliged to insure drivers who might otherwise be uninsurable; the premiums for that insurance are initially collected by the Secretary. The JUA argues that all of those collected funds, other than the Duplicate Premiums, constitute the \"Earned Premiums\" and thus belong to it. Indeed, the Insurance Commissioner's adjustment of the Reserve percentage in 2001 to more accurately reflect the percentage of traditionally insured vehicle owners indicates the Commonwealth's recognition that the JUA is entitled to any funds above the amount representing Duplicate Premiums. Notably, the Amendment identifies the funds to be transferred to the Commonwealth every two years as funds \"Belonging to Others.\" Presumably, any such funds that do <i>not</i> belong to others belong to the JUA. We therefore conclude that the JUA has alleged the taking of a constitutionally protected property interest in the Overstated Reserve Funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. The Out-of-Pocket Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Flores Galarza stopped transferring insurance premiums to the JUA in 2000 in order to meet the cash-flow needs of the Commonwealth, the JUA had to reimburse privately insured drivers and their insurers out of its own pocket. While the JUA presumably recouped some of its costs pursuant to the 2002 Settlement, the JUA alleges that there was still $13.6 million outstanding&#8212;an amount which the JUA argues should have been set off against the $73 million retained by Flores Galarza. The JUA alleges that the $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds \"used to reimburse insurance premiums from January to September 2002[is] the private property of the [JUA].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not dispute that the Out-of-Pocket funds used by the JUA to reimburse third parties belonged to the JUA. Accordingly, the JUA alleges a property right in the Out-of-Pocket Funds. Turning to the second step of the takings analysis, the JUA alleges that Flores Galarza physically appropriated $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds from the JUA by retaining the full $73 million in Reserve funds. At this stage of the qualified immunity analysis, the JUA's assertion of a property right to the Out-of-Pocket Funds, together with its allegation of a physical invasion of those funds, is sufficient to allege the taking of a constitutionally protected property interest in those funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. The Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that the JUA alleges a property right to the Earned Premiums, the Overstated Reserve Funds and the Out-of-Pocket Funds compels a similar conclusion with respect to the interest lost as a result of the withholding of those monies. In <i>Phillips,</i> the Supreme Court held that interest income generated by client funds in IOLTA accounts was the private property of the client under the common law rule that \"interest follows principal.\" 524 U.S. at 165-72, 118 S.Ct. 1925; <i>see also Webb's,</i> 449 U.S. at 162, 101 S.Ct. 446 (\"The usual and general rule is that any interest ... follows the principal and is to be allocated to those who are ultimately to be the owners of that principal.\"). The fact that the Secretary is authorized to hold the Earned Premiums for some time before turning them over to the JUA is of no consequence. <i>See Webb's,</i> 449 U.S. at 162, 101 S.Ct. 446 (\"That lack of immediate right ... does not automatically bar a claimant ultimately determined to be entitled to all or a share of the fund from claiming a proper share of the interest, the fruit of the fund's use, that is realized in the interim.\"). By alleging a property right in the Earned Premiums, the Overstated Reserve Funds and the Out-of-Pocket Funds, the JUA also has alleged a property right in the resulting lost interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the second step of the takings analysis with respect to interest, the JUA alleges that by temporarily withholding the Earned Premiums, Flores Galarza physically took $14.2 million in interest generated by them. <i>See Parella,</i> 173 F.3d at 59 n. 10 (stating that in order to demonstrate a taking of interest, \"plaintiffs have the burden of proving that they had a constitutional right both to the principal (i.e., withheld benefits) and to the interest on that principal\"). The JUA's assertion of a property right in the interest generated by the Earned Premiums, together with its allegation of a physical taking of that interest, is sufficient to allege the unconstitutional taking of that interest under the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis. <i>See Brown,</i> 538 U.S. at 235, 123 S.Ct. 1406; <i>Webb's,</i> 449 U.S. at 164-65, 101 S.Ct. 446.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6.

Consequently, if the operative legal principles are clearly established only at a level of generality so high that officials cannot fairly anticipate the legal consequences of specific actions, then the requisite notice is lacking. The bottom line is that the qualified immunity defense prevails unless the unlawfulness of the challenged conduct is \"apparent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Savard,</i> 338 F.3d at 28 (citation omitted) (quoting <i>Anderson v. Creighton,</i> 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA argues that \"[t]he contours of the Takings Clause . . . are very straightforward in the case where the government takes property from an individual for public use,\" as alleged here. Relying upon cases which hold that uncompensated physical appropriations of private property&#8212;including interest&#8212;are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment, the JUA contends that its \"right to be justly compensated for the taking of its property\" was \"clearly established\" at the time of the challenged conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Flores Galarza disagrees. While \"it [i]s clearly established that the taking of a property interest without just compensation [i]s unconstitutional,\" he argues that this proposition is too broad to satisfy the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis. \"The property rights claimed by the JUA,\" Flores Galarza contends, \"cannot be easily read into the law enabling the JUA and the Compulsory Liability Insurance,\" and, therefore, are not clearly established. We now test that proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Earned Premiums and Interest<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We already have concluded that the JUA, under Law 253, alleges a property interest in the Earned Premiums and the interest generated by those premiums. Because Law 253 was on the books at the time Flores Galarza withheld the Earned Premiums and interest, we conclude that the JUA's alleged property interest in those funds was clearly established. Flores Galarza essentially acknowledged as much (at least with respect to the Earned Premiums) by returning the Earned Premiums to the JUA pursuant to the 2002 Settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law was not so clear, however, that Flores Galarza's alleged withholding of the Earned Premiums and interest was a taking. Law 253 does not establish when the Secretary must transfer the premiums to the JUA. As noted by Flores Galarza,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he compulsory insurance law is completely devoid of a timetable that controls the transfer of the premiums collected by the Secretary of the Treasury to the JUA. The statute simply states that the transfers must be made. However, <i>when</i> these transfers must be made is an entirely different question. The JUA has never pointed to any substantive source that establishes its entitlement to a prompt transfer of the premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Citation omitted.) Under the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis, it is not enough for the JUA to argue that Flores Galarza physically took the Earned Premiums to which the JUA was entitled under Law 253. Here, the JUA must demonstrate that Law 253 entitled the JUA to the Earned Premiums within a specified amount of time, such that the unlawfulness of Flores Galarza's temporary withholding of the premiums was \"apparent.\" This it cannot do. Indeed, even if we imported into Law 253 a requirement that the Secretary transfer the premiums to the JUA within a reasonable period of time, that reasonableness requirement would be too indefinite to allow us to conclude that the alleged taking was clearly established. The unlawfulness of Flores Galarza's temporary withholding of the Earned Premiums, therefore, was not \"apparent\" under the statute. The right to interest inescapably is tied to the JUA's entitlement to the premiums and therefore also was not clearly established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Overstated Reserve Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lack of clarity is even more apparent with respect to the Overstated Reserve Funds, which was the portion of the Reserve in excess of the amount necessary to reimburse insureds or insurers who already had paid for coverage. Certainly after enactment of the 2002 Amendment to the compulsory insurance law, which specifically required the JUA to transfer to the Secretary all funds held in the Reserve as of December 31, 2001, the law did not clearly establish that the JUA had a property right in the $10 million of Overstated Reserve Funds or, indeed, that withholding any of the designated Reserve of $73 million was an unconstitutional taking. Whether, and how much, of that $10 million is in fact \"excess\" remains a matter of debate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Secretary began withholding the Overstated Reserve Funds in 2000, along with the Earned and Duplicate Premiums, the alleged $10 million excess was undifferentiated from the balance of the Earned Premiums. As noted earlier, the JUA essentially claims that the $10 million should be considered Earned Premiums in which it holds a property right, and as such that money is encompassed within our prior discussion. Therefore, the law was not clearly established either before or after the 2002 Amendment that the Secretary's retention of the Overstated Reserve Funds was an unconstitutional taking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Out-of-Pocket Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA argues that it has a clearly established right to the $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds, which Flores Galarza allegedly should have deducted from the $73 million Reserve he took on behalf of the Commonwealth. Since it is undisputed that the Out-of-Pocket funds belong to the JUA, the JUA's alleged property right in the Out-of-Pocket Funds is clearly established. It also was clearly established that the physical taking of property, without compensation, violated the Constitution. <i>See Tahoe-Sierra,</i> 535 U.S. at 322-23, 122 S.Ct. 1465 (noting that the Supreme Court's \"jurisprudence involving condemnations and physical takings is as old as the Republic\"). We therefore conclude that Flores Galarza's alleged physical taking of the Out-of-Pocket Funds alleged a violation of clearly established law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4.

The JUA has failed to allege a clearly established violation of law with respect to the Earned Premiums, the interest generated by those premiums, or the Overstated Reserve Funds. Therefore, as we turn to the third prong of the qualified immunity analysis (whether a reasonable officer would have believed that the alleged conduct violated clearly established law), we focus only on the alleged taking of the Out-of-Pocket Funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Third Prong: Reasonable Official Would Believe that Action Violated Clearly Established Right</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The final prong of the qualified immunity analysis, often the most difficult one for the plaintiff to prevail upon, is `whether an objectively reasonable official would have believed that the action taken violated that clearly established constitutional right.'\" <i>Wilson,</i> 421 F.3d at 57-58 (quoting <i>Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto,</i> 253 F.3d 137, 141 (1st Cir.2001)). The qualified immunity inquiry recognizes that \"[i]t is not always evident at the time an official takes an action that a clearly established right is involved. For example, the factual situation might be ambiguous or the application of the legal standard to the precise facts at issue might be difficult.\" <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> 392 F.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir.2004). So long as an \"officer's mistake as to what the law requires is reasonable,\" <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151, the officer will be entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA argues that \"[t]he fact that the [JUA's] property was taken without any compensation whatsoever&#8212;and actually, to a very large cost to the [JUA]&#8212;would have alerted any reasonable official that he was violating [the JUA's] rights under the Takings Clause.\" We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Secretary discontinued the transfer of premiums in 2000, the JUA was forced to pay out a total of $13.6 million of its own funds to third parties seeking reimbursement. The 2002 Amendment was subsequently enacted, which required the JUA to pay to the Secretary $73 million in Reserve funds. One month later, pursuant to the 2002 Settlement, Flores Galarza made a \"massive transfer of all the funds [he] had retained since [he] stopped making the transfers,\" but he held back the $73 million in Reserve funds that the JUA was required to pay the Secretary under the 2002 Amendment. As Flores Galarza argues, a reasonable officer in these circumstances would have believed that he \"had a law mandate, stemming from the [2002 Amendment], to retain for use by the Department of Treasury the Reserve Fund recognized by JUA as of December 31, 2001. Any officer in his shoes would have acted as he did in immediately retaining the full Reserve Fund amount without any compensation\" to the JUA. Nothing in the 2002 Amendment suggests that funds owed to the JUA had to be deducted from the $73 million Reserve, and that the failure to do so would constitute a taking. As Flores Galarza argues, \"money [is] fungible in nature.\" Thus, a reasonable officer could have believed that the 2002 Amendment required \"the JUA [] to replenish the Reserve Fund\" and then debit the Out-of-Pocket Funds \"from this `new' Reserve Fund ... and not from the [$73 million] Reserve allocation recognized as of December 31, 2001.\" In that way, the JUA would be made whole with respect to the Out-of-Pocket Funds. Because a reasonable officer would not have believed that retaining $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds violated the JUA's clearly established rights, we conclude that Flores Galarza is entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize the essential points of our analysis. The JUA has standing to sue Flores Galarza under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and the Supreme Court's prudential ripeness requirements for takings claims pose no barrier to our consideration of the case. We may not, however, address res judicata issues in this interlocutory appeal. Flores Galarza is amenable to suit in his official capacity under the Eleventh Amendment because the JUA seeks prospective declaratory and injunctive relief against him in that capacity, namely: a declaration that his taking of insurance premiums, interest, and other funds to alleviate the cash-flow problems of the Commonwealth violates the Constitution; and an injunction enjoining him from withholding insurance premiums and from enforcing the terms of the 2002 Amendment to the extent they amount to an unconstitutional taking. Notwithstanding the indistinct line between official- and personal-capacity suits against government officials, we conclude that the JUA seeks to hold Flores Galarza liable in his personal capacity for damages. We conclude, however, that he is immune from such liability. Specifically, because the law was not clearly established that Flores Galarza effected an unconstitutional taking of the withheld insurance premiums, the interest generated by those premiums, or the Overstated Reserve Funds, he is entitled to qualified immunity on these claims. Additionally, because a reasonable officer would not have believed that the failure to reimburse the JUA for the Out-of-Pocket Funds violated the JUA's rights, qualified immunity forecloses a damages remedy against him on that claim as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's decision that the JUA has standing to sue Flores Galarza, and that Flores Galarza is amenable to suit in his official capacity under the Eleventh Amendment. We <i>reverse</i> the district court's decision that Flores Galarza is not entitled to qualified immunity from suit in his personal capacity.

Although the JUA did not reference this general provision in either its brief before us or at oral argument, Puerto Rico's Insurance Code makes clear that this general provision applies to the compulsory liability insurance system under Law 253<i>See id.</i> &#167; 2612 (\"The [general provision governing unclaimed funds] shall prevail over the provisions of any other chapter present or future which may be in conflict herewith.\").

In the complaint, the JUA likewise states that it was forced to liquidate its investments as early as January 2000 \"[a]s a result of the [Secretary's] failure to transfer th[e premiums].\" Elsewhere in the complaint, however, the JUA states that the Secretary withheld premiums \"[d]uring the past two years,\" which would mean that the alleged withholding began in approximately February 2001, based on the February 2003 filing date of the complaint. Flores Galarza argues that \"although not alleged in the complaint, the supposed withholding of the transfers would have started on March 2001.\" While our analysis does not require that we resolve this discrepancy, we use for our analysis the earliest date that Flores Galarza is alleged to have withheld the premiums (January 2000), which date is supported by the record at this stage of the proceedings</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The 2002 Amendment thus allocates the seven-year period provided by the general provisions of Puerto Rico's Insurance Code, P.R.

While the JUA's complaint suggests that the amount paid by Flores Galarza was closer to $100 million, what matters for purposes of our analysis is the amount which Flores Galarza did<i>not</i> pay &#8212; $73 million.

The first mention of Rodr&#237;guez comes in the Notice of Interlocutory Appeal, which references her by political office only, not by name. The parties refer to Rodr&#237;guez again &#8212; this time, in her official capacity as Secretary of Justice &#8212; in the caption on their briefs before us, but neither party makes any argument respecting her. Assuming that Rodr&#237;guez was properly joined as a party to this action, she ceased to be a party when she left her post as Secretary of Justice in 2004 and was succeeded by William Vazquez Irizarry, who was, in turn, succeeded by the present Secretary of Justice, Roberto J. S&#225;nchez Ramos<i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d). We therefore do not reach Rodr&#237;guez's interests here. Furthermore, since neither the complaint nor the district court order lists the Secretary of Justice as a party, and since neither party argues that we should adjudicate the interests of the Secretary of Justice in this appeal, we do not reach the interests of S&#225;nchez Ramos.

Spain,</i> 209 F.3d 713, 715 (8th Cir. 2000). Here, the JUA seeks to vindicate its right under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to be free from an uncompensated taking.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The JUA uses two different percentages to calculate the Overstated Reserve Funds, and therefore arrives at two different totals for such funds. As noted above, the JUA originally estimated that 25% of all registered motor vehicles were privately insured, and so set aside 25% of all premiums received and accumulated them in the Reserve. In its complaint, the JUA argues that the number of privately insured motor vehicles as of 2001 was actually 17.4%, which means that the JUA overstated the Reserve by approximately $10 million. In its brief before us and at oral argument, however, the JUA argues that the number of privately insured motor vehicles in 2001 was actually 19.3%, which means that the Reserve was overstated by approximately $8 million. Counsel for the JUA also explained at oral argument that the Insurance Commissioner used the higher percentage in adjusting the Reserve for fiscal year 2001. The Secretary says nothing about this discrepancy. Because we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant when considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and because the 17% figure set forth in the complaint would presumably yield a higher damages award for the JUA than the 19% figure, i.e., $10 million as opposed to $8 million, we use the lower percentage yielding the higher damages amount for purposes of our analysis</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We note that even that amount might understate the damages figure.

The Court explained:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">While the policies underlying the two concepts often overlap, the finality requirement is concerned with whether the initial decisionmaker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual, concrete injury; the exhaustion requirement generally refers to administrative and judicial procedures by which an injured party may seek review of an adverse decision and obtain a remedy if the decision is found to be unlawful or otherwise inappropriate. . . .</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The difference is best illustrated by comparing the procedure for seeking a variance with the procedures that, under <i>Patsy</i> [<i>v. Florida Board of Regents,</i> 457 U.S. 496, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982)], respondent would not be required to exhaust. While it appears that the State provides procedures by which an aggrieved property owner may seek a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of zoning and planning actions taken by county authorities, respondent would not be required to resort to those procedures before bringing its &#167; 1983 action, because those procedures clearly are remedial. Similarly, respondent would not be required to appeal the Commission's rejection of the preliminary plat to the Board of Zoning Appeals, because the Board was empowered, at most, to review that rejection, not to participate in the Commission's decisionmaking.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Resort to those procedures would result in a judgment whether the Commission's actions violated any of respondent's rights. In contrast, resort to the procedure for obtaining variances would result in a conclusive determination by the Commission whether it would allow respondent to develop the subdivision in the manner respondent proposed. The Commission's refusal to approve the preliminary plat does not determine that issue; it . . . leaves open the possibility that respondent may develop the subdivision according to its plat after obtaining the variances. In short, the Commission's denial of approval does not conclusively determine whether respondent will be denied all reasonable beneficial use of its property, and therefore is not a final, reviewable decision.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">473 U.S. at 193-94, 105 S.Ct. 3108 (citations omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The Supreme Court explained the \"important legal and practical differences between an inverse condemnation suit and a condemnation proceeding\" as follows:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Although a landowner's action to recover just compensation for a taking by physical intrusion has come to be referred to as \"inverse\" or \"reverse\" condemnation, the simple terms \"condemn\" and \"condemnation\" are not commonly used to describe such an action.

Because Ohio has no \"inverse condemnation or other direct, statutory cause of action for plaintiffs seeking just compensation for a taking,\" the state's courts over time concluded that property owners who believe a taking has occurred without the statutory process could initiate a mandamus action \"to force the government actor into the correct appropriation proceeding.\" <i>Id.</i> In Ohio, therefore, mandamus as a vehicle to obtain an appropriation proceeding effectively substitutes for the more common inverse condemnation process.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> In his concurrence, our colleague notes that the Supreme Court addressed exhaustion in the context of the finality requirement but did not suggest a similar limitation on the state litigation prong.

For example, in <i>Villager Pond, Inc. v. Town of Darien,</i> 56 F.3d 375 (2d Cir.1995), the court relied on a Connecticut state court decision that had held that the state's takings clause \"may be used as the basis of an inverse condemnation action to recover compensation for property taken from private individuals, even in the absence of a separate statutory remedy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 380. <i>See also id.</i> at 381 (\"The inverse condemnation requirement of <i>Williamson</i> applies whenever compensation is sought for land that is taken....\"). Similarly, in <i>Austin v. City &amp; County of Honolulu,</i> 840 F.2d 678, 681 (9th Cir.1988), the court noted that, \"[u]ntil the state courts establish that landowners may not obtain just compensation through an inverse condemnation action under any circumstances [including under the state constitution's takings provision], Hawaii procedures are adequate within the terms of <i>Williamson County</i> and [plaintiff's] failure to use them cannot be excused.\" Our view does not exclude the possibility that a state explicitly could create a non-statutory inverse condemnation procedure. <i>Cf. Southview Assocs., Ltd. v. Bongartz,</i> 980 F.2d 84, 99 (2d Cir.1992) (rejecting the \"contention that only a statutory compensation scheme can suffice\"). We disagree with the Ninth Circuit's implication, however, that a federal takings claim is unripe if a plaintiff has not litigated a state claim where the state has not specifically utilized its takings clause to establish a compensatory process (and no other compensatory process has been identified).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">As our discussion and the difference of opinion among our own panel members indicate, there is substantial tension among the various doctrines at issue in this context&#8212; ripeness, exhaustion and preclusion&#8212;and further guidance from the Supreme Court seems necessary to resolve the uncertainties.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Neither Flores Galarza nor the JUA addresses the threshold question of whether we may consider Flores Galarza's standing challenge in this interlocutory appeal.

First, in regulatory takings cases, the claimant must show that the government entity charged with enforcing the regulation at issue has rendered a final decision on the regulation's meaning (\"the finality requirement\"). <i>See id.</i> at 186, 105 S.Ct. 3108; <i>Pascoag Reservoir &amp; Dam, LLC v.

These cases amply demonstrate that adequate state process under the litigation requirement encompasses more than just those state processes \"particularly aimed at providing compensation\" for a government taking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> <i>Ante</i> at 79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this understanding of the litigation requirement, the remaining question is whether Puerto Rico provides \"an adequate procedure\" for the JUA to seek compensation. The burden of proving that no adequate state process is available rests with the JUA. <i>See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. La. Dep't of Ins.,</i> 62 F.3d 115, 117 (5th Cir.1995). It is not enough to show only that the adequacy of state process remains unsure and undeveloped; it must be shown to be unavailable. <i>See Culebras Enters. Corp. v. Rivera Rios,</i> 813 F.2d 506, 513-15 (1st Cir.1987) (holding that taking claimant was required to seek compensation from the Puerto Rico courts even though the Puerto Rico Supreme Court had never awarded damages in an inverse condemnation action); <i>accord, e.g., Villager Pond,</i> 56 F.3d at 380; <i>S. Pac. Transp. Co. v. City of Los Angeles,</i> 922 F.2d 498, 505 n. 8 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's Constitution includes a takings provision, <i>See</i> P.R. Const. Art. II, &#167; 9, and Flores Galarza suggests that the JUA could seek compensation through a mandamus action. It is not entirely clear that the JUA could obtain the compensation that it seeks through either an action under the Commonwealth's Constitution or some other cause of action. But it has not been shown that such relief is unavailable either. In these circumstances, the JUA was required to pursue its state-law remedies before turning to the federal Constitution for relief. <i>E.g., Southview Assocs.,</i> 980 F.2d at 100. Because the JUA did not pursue compensation through the state system, its federal claim against Flores Galarza, in his individual capacity, should have been dismissed on ripeness grounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn36\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36_ref\">36</a>\n        <p> The finality requirement does not apply because the JUA seeks compensation for a physical, rather than a regulatory, taking<i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 91.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn37\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37_ref\">37</a>\n        <p> Indeed, in<i>Southview,</i> 980 F.2d at 100, the court explicitly rejected the argument that <i>Williamson County's</i> litigation requirement mandated the claimant to pursue state processes only if the state provided a specific statutory avenue of relief.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn38\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38_ref\">38</a>\n        <p> I understand that the lead opinion seeks to limit the litigation requirement because of its concern that preclusion principles will prevent takings claims from being litigated in federal court, if claimants must pursue state remedies in state court<i>See ante</i> at 80. This was the view of four Justices of the Supreme Court in <i>San Remo Hotel v. City &amp; County of San Francisco,</i> 545 U.S. 323, 349, 125 S.Ct. 2491, 162 L.Ed.2d 315 (Rehnquist C.J., concurring) who proposed revisiting the litigation requirement. The majority, however, disagreed, concluding that \"it is hardly a radical notion to recognize that . . . a significant number of plaintiffs will necessarily litigate their federal takings claims in state courts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 347, 125 S.Ct. 2491. As the Court has rejected this concern as a basis for revisiting the litigation requirement, it does not serve as an adequate basis for substantially limiting it in this circuit.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The lead opinion also supports its limiting construction of the litigation requirement by suggesting that requiring claimants to pursue state constitutional takings claims or other general causes of action would require claimants to exhaust state remedies, which is inconsistent with Supreme Court caselaw interpreting 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. <i>E.g., Pasty v. Fla. Bd. of Regents,</i> 457 U.S. 496, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982) The <i>Williamson County</i> Court accepted this argument for purposes of the finality requirement, by holding that a claimant need not exhaust judicial review after a state agency has definitively interpreted a regulation. 473 U.S. at 192-93, 105 S.Ct. 3108. But the Court did not endorse a similar limiting principle for the litigation requirement. Moreover, <i>Washlefske v. Winston,</i> 234 F.3d 179, 183 (4th Cir.2000), relied on by the lead opinion for its exhaustion analysis, states that exhaustion is not required to meet the finality requirement; it says nothing about the scope of the litigation requirement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn39\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39_ref\">39</a>\n        <p> I agree that, to the extent the JUA is pursuing facial challenges to Puerto Rico statutes, the litigation requirement is not implicated<i>San Remo,</i> 545 U.S. at 345-46, 125 S.Ct. 2491.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Flores Galarza (\"Flores Galarza\" or \"Secretary\"), then the Secretary of the Treasury of the Commonwealth, in both his official and personal capacities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> claiming that he violated the Takings Clause of the United States Constitution by withholding from the JUA and appropriating insurance premiums generated by Puerto Rico's compulsory liability insurance law to alleviate the cash-flow problems of the Commonwealth. Flores Galarza moved for judgment on the pleadings, claiming that the forms of relief sought by the plaintiff (declaratory, injunctive, and damages) were barred by the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of qualified immunity.

For the reasons set forth below, after concluding that the JUA has standing to sue Flores Galarza, we conclude that, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, Flores Galarza is amenable to suit in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief, but is protected from damages in his personal capacity by the doctrine of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

On December 27, 1995, in response to financial losses from uncompensated damages to motor vehicles in traffic accidents, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"Commonwealth\") enacted the Compulsory Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Act, Act No. 253 (\"Law 253\"), codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 8051-61. Under Law 253, liability insurance coverage is required for all motor vehicles that travel on public thoroughfares. Law 253 \"provides each insured vehicle owner with $3000 of coverage for damages caused to third parties per accident in exchange for a uniform premium, initially set at $99 for each private passenger vehicle and $148 for each commercial vehicle.\" <i>Arroyo-Melecio v.

Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 8052(j), 8056(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All \"private insurers\" &#8212; defined under Law 253 as those with more than 1% of the total volume of vehicle liability premiums in Puerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 8052(b) &#8212; are required to provide compulsory liability insurance in one of two ways. First, private insurers are \"bound to provide the compulsory liability insurance to those motor vehicle owners that request it,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 8054(a), unless those owners meet certain statutory criteria, most of which \"identify applicants who are bad drivers or otherwise of high risk,\" <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 61. Second, private insurers are required to provide compulsory liability insurance as members of the JUA, to which they must belong. The JUA is an association of all private insurers in Puerto Rico, which \"provides compulsory liability insurance to all drivers, including those high-risk drivers whom private insurers are not required to insure.\" <i>Id.</i> (footnote omitted). \"Through the JUA, the risk of insuring these high-risk drivers is thus spread among all the private insurers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every vehicle owner must either: (1) pay the premium for compulsory liability insurance to the Secretary of the Treasury at the time that the owner acquires or renews a vehicle license, effectively as part of the license payment; or (2) opt out of the compulsory liability insurance scheme by privately purchasing liability insurance with comparable or better coverage. <i>Id.</i> at 61 n. 2 (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 8061).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In the case of those vehicle owners who pay the Secretary for compulsory liability insurance, \"[t]he [JUA] shall receive from the Secretary of the Treasury the total amount of the compulsory liability insurance premiums received by said official, for its eventual distribution among the private insurers and the [JUA] itself, as the case may be.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 8055(c). The JUA's administrative and operating expenses are \"charged to the amount received from the corresponding premiums according to this distribution.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a vehicle owner does not present a Certificate of Compliance proving that he carries traditional liability insurance, he must pay the compulsory liability insurance premium on the date of issuance or renewal of the vehicle license, and may then seek reimbursement directly from the JUA or from his insurer, who will, in turn, seek reimbursement from the JUA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, the funds transferred from the Secretary to the JUA appear to consist of: (1) premium payments from individuals seeking to purchase insurance through the JUA who paid the Secretary, as required by the statute, when they obtained or renewed their vehicle licenses, (2) duplicate premium payments from individuals who are purchasing the compulsory insurance directly from a private insurer, but who paid the compulsory assessment to the Secretary along with their license fees (and who thus are eligible for a refund from the JUA), and (3) duplicate premium payments from individuals who have adequate traditional liability coverage, but who did not obtain the Certificate of Compliance that would have exempted them from the compulsory assessment (who also are eligible for a refund). The JUA is responsible for distributing the premiums it receives from the Secretary to its member insurers for the coverage they provide. <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 61 n. 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA is required to file an annual statement with the Insurance Commissioner detailing its financial condition, transactions, and affairs for the preceding calendar year. Because a portion of the total amount of premiums received by the JUA may be owed to third parties who seek refunds for duplicate payments &#8212; i.e., vehicle owners who bought insurance from a private insurer but also paid the compulsory liability premium when obtaining licenses, or private insurers who have reimbursed their insureds for payment of the compulsory premium &#8212; the JUA is required by regulation to set aside these premiums and accumulate them in a separate reserve account (\"Reserve\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Secretary's Withholding of Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the effective date of the compulsory liability insurance system on January 1, 1998,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the JUA has been unable to determine exactly how many registered motor vehicles in Puerto Rico are covered by private liability insurance. The JUA initially estimated that 25% of all vehicles were covered by policies from private insurers, and, accordingly, set aside 25% of all premiums received and accumulated them in the Reserve. By 2001, experience and additional data revealed that the actual proportion of privately insured registered motor vehicles was closer to 17%. As a result, the Reserve as disclosed in the December 2001 annual statement &#8212; approximately $73 million &#8212; exceeded the actual amount owed to third parties by approximately $10 million (\"Overstated Reserve Funds\"). In other words, the JUA set aside and accumulated in the Reserve approximately $10 million more than was actually owed to privately insured vehicle owners and their insurers who would be seeking reimbursement for the purchase of duplicative compulsory liability insurance. In 2001, the JUA sought permission from the Insurance Commissioner to adjust the Reserve to the accumulated level that it would have been if only 17% of all premiums had been set aside, rather than 25%. The Insurance Commissioner agreed to allow the JUA to adjust the Reserve for the 2001 fiscal year, but did not allow any adjustments for the preceding fiscal years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998 and 1999, the Secretary collected the insurance premiums and transferred them to the JUA in accordance with Law 253.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The JUA then set aside a portion of these premiums in the Reserve. Beginning in 2000, however, the Secretary discontinued the transfer of compulsory liability insurance premiums to the JUA in an attempt to ease the Commonwealth's cash-flow problems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> On May 30, 2002, the JUA filed a petition for mandamus against the Secretary in the Puerto Rico Superior Court, requesting an order that the Secretary transfer to the JUA the withheld compulsory liability insurance premiums. By September 2002, the Secretary had withheld approximately $173 million in premiums from the JUA. Because of the Secretary's failure to transfer the insurance premiums, the JUA was forced to liquidate approximately $98 million of investments in order to comply with its own cash-flow needs. The liquidation of the JUA's investments, together with the lost opportunity to invest new premiums, resulted in a loss to the JUA of $14.2 million in interest. Despite the Secretary's withholding of premiums, the JUA continued to reimburse privately insured motorists and their insurers from its own funds. From January 2002 through September 2002, the JUA reimbursed third parties out-of-pocket a total of $13.6 million (\"Out-of-Pocket Funds\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The 2002 Amendment to Law 253</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 11, 2002, the Puerto Rico Legislature amended Law 253, 2002 P.R. Laws 230 (\"2002 Amendment\"), to require the JUA to turn over to the Secretary all funds held in the Reserve as of December 31, 2001 (i.e., $73 million), and to continue providing such funds every two years thereafter. The 2002 Amendment requires the Secretary to keep these funds in a fiduciary capacity for five years, to be reimbursed to owners of privately insured motor vehicles and their insurers who seek refunds, after which time the funds become the property of the Commonwealth and pass to the general fund of the Commonwealth Treasury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The 2002 Amendment also provides that any excess funds in the Reserve, that is, any funds included in the Reserve based on estimates which exceed the actual amount owed to third parties (the Overstated Reserve Funds), shall be immediately available for use by the Commonwealth. Income generated from the funds provided to the Secretary shall also be immediately available for use by the Commonwealth. Lastly, while the Secretary continues to transfer to the JUA the total amount of compulsory liability insurance premiums, the 2002 Amendment allows the Secretary to deduct from these premiums a fee for the collection service it performs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The 2002 Settlement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2002, pursuant to a settlement stipulation in the mandamus action in the Puerto Rico Superior Court, the Secretary transferred to the JUA a significant portion of the $173 million in insurance premiums that had been withheld (\"2002 Settlement\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Rather than transferring the full amount of funds withheld, however, the Secretary retained approximately $73 million &#8212; an amount corresponding to the amount of funds in the Reserve as of December 2001, which the JUA was required to turn over to the Secretary pursuant to the 2002 Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2003, the JUA filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against Flores Galarza in his personal capacity and in his official capacity as Secretary of the Treasury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> In the complaint, the JUA alleged that Flores Galarza took the JUA's property without just compensation and deprived the JUA of its property without due process in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and &#167; 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Specifically, the JUA contends that \"in order to alleviate the Commonwealth's cash-flow problems,\" Flores Galarza temporarily withheld \"for [an] unreasonable period[] of time\" (i.e., from January 2000 through November 2002) $173 million in insurance premiums, which are \"the private property of the [JUA]\" and \"which [Flores Galarza] was bound by law to transfer to JUA.\" By temporarily withholding these premiums, the JUA argues, Flores Galarza also wrongfully appropriated $14.2 million in \"interest generated by those premiums [which is] also the private property of the [JUA].\" While Flores Galarza subsequently paid to the JUA a large portion of the withheld premiums pursuant to the 2002 Settlement, the JUA argues that by retaining $73 million, an amount of funds equal to the Reserve as of December 2001, Flores Galarza wrongfully appropriated the following amounts: approximately $10 million<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> in Overstated Reserve Funds which do not belong to third parties and therefore constitute the JUA's private property; and approximately $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds which the JUA was forced to pay to third parties from its own funds when Flores Galarza withheld $173 million in insurance premiums to meet the cash-flow needs of the Commonwealth.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA requested relief in the form of a declaratory judgment that Flores Galarza \"infringed upon the rights guaranteed under the Takings Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause\" by temporarily withholding the insurance premiums and permanently taking the interest generated by those premiums, the Overstated Reserve Funds, and the Out-of-Pocket Funds. Because the JUA does not argue that Flores Galarza's taking of property violated its substantive or procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, the JUA appears to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment only for purposes of bringing a Fifth Amendment Takings claim against Flores Galarza. <i>See Chi., Burlington &amp; Quincy R.R.

Finally, the JUA sought from Flores Galarza, in his personal capacity, approximately $38 million in damages: $10 million in Overstated Reserve Funds, $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds, and $14.2 million in lost interest as a result of Flores Galarza's taking of the insurance premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flores Galarza filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Fed.

The district court denied Flores Galarza's motion, holding that the JUA was not an arm of the state and therefore was not precluded from suing Flores Galarza;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> that Flores Galarza was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity because the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by the JUA was prospective, as was the JUA's claimed right to \"money allegedly unconstitutionally attached\" by Flores Galarza, i.e., \"the insurance premiums for the compulsory liability insurance [and] . . . certain funds belonging to JUA\"; and that Flores Galarza was not entitled to qualified immunity because the JUA alleged a constitutional violation that was well established at the time of the alleged conduct.

A takings claim seeks damages for the unconstitutional taking of property without due compensation. By contrast &#8212; as discussed above &#8212; an inverse condemnation proceeding is designed to enable plaintiffs to obtain compensation &#8212; which, if granted, would <i>avoid</i> the alleged constitutional violation that the takings claim is intended to remedy. This is a subtle, but important distinction. As with more general remedial provisions, requiring a state takings claim as a prerequisite to a federal takings claim effectively would impose an exhaustion requirement &#8212; which the Supreme Court explicitly said it did not do in <i>Williamson County.</i> Moreover, although we have not done a survey, we suspect that, like Puerto Rico, most state constitutions have takings provisions. <i>See</i> P.R.

One such operator, Eastern, brought suit claiming that the Act, either on its face or as applied, violated substantive due process and constituted a taking of its property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court considered whether the takings claim needed to be asserted first under the Tucker Act, which, as noted above, usually must be a preliminary step in a takings action against the federal government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plurality observed that Eastern was not seeking compensation from the government; it was requesting declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the act by the Commissioner of Social Security. The Justices noted conflicting lower court precedent on whether a claim for equitable relief under the Takings Clause, even without a request for damages, must be brought first under the Tucker Act. <i>Id.</i> at 520-21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118239\"><a href=\"/opinion/118239/eastern-enterprises-v-apfel/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Application of the <i>Williamson County</i> prerequisites here similarly could only \"`entail an utterly pointless set of activities.'\" For that reason, and the others we have noted, we conclude that <i>Williamson County's</i> prudential factors do not prevent our review of the JUA's takings claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

In response, the JUA emphasizes that both of the Commonwealth court's rulings&#8212;the Partial Judgment issued in July 2003 and the Judgment issued in September 2003&#8212; were \"without prejudice,\" and it argues that, under Puerto Rico law, a judgment without prejudice is not an adjudication on the merits that would trigger res judicata consequences. <i>See Pueblo Int'l, Inc. v.

We construe that observation as an endorsement of the Third Circuit's refusal to address res judicata in an interlocutory appeal.

We agree with the district court that these requests are for prospective declaratory and injunctive relief that is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> Therefore, the district court's denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity to Flores Galarza in his official capacity was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Official Versus Personal-Capacity Suits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA argues that Flores Galarza, in his personal capacity, temporarily withheld approximately $173 million in compulsory liability insurance premiums for an \"unreasonable period[] of time,\" and, in so doing, appropriated $14.2 million in interest generated by those premiums. The JUA also argues that Flores Galarza personally appropriated $10 million in Overstated Reserve Funds and $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the JUA does not seek to hold Flores Galarza personally liable for the full $173 million in withheld insurance premiums, most of which was subsequently paid to the JUA pursuant to the 2002 Settlement, nor does the JUA seek to hold Flores Galarza personally liable for the full $73 million in Reserve funds retained by Flores Galarza after the 2002 Settlement. Instead, the JUA seeks to hold Flores Galarza personally liable for interest lost on the $173 million plus two portions of the $73 million Reserve&#8212;i.e., the Overstated Reserve Funds and Out-of-Pocket Reserve Funds. The total amount sought by the JUA is approximately $38 million, that is, roughly $14.2 million in lost interest, $10 million in Overstated Reserve Funds, and $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds. Flores Galarza contends that he is not liable in his personal capacity based on qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before analyzing whether Flores Galarza is entitled to qualified immunity, we pause to note the unusual nature of this personal-capacity suit. We are troubled by the notion that the personal-capacity claim against Flores Galarza, by which the JUA seeks enormous personal damages from him, is really a subterfuge for an official-capacity suit that seeks payment from the Commonwealth Treasury. Certainly the line between personal assets and the Commonwealth fisc seems indistinct. The JUA has sued the Secretary of the Treasury; the JUA claims that the Secretary temporarily withheld and permanently appropriated the JUA's funds for the benefit of the Commonwealth; and some of the damages sought by the JUA correspond to funds accumulated in the general fund pursuant to the 2002 Amendment. \"`[W]hen the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit....'\" <i>Metcalf,</i> 991 F.2d at 939 (quoting <i>Ford Motor Co. v.

There, the plaintiffs sued the auditor general of Pennsylvania, Hafer, after she fired them from their jobs, alleging that they were fired for personal reasons in violation of the First Amendment; they sought monetary damages from Hafer personally.

The JUA argues that Flores Galarza took its private property without compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, by physically appropriating the insurance premiums, the interest lost as a result of the withholding of those premiums, the Overstated Reserve Funds, and the Out-of-Pocket Funds. This alleged violation of its constitutionally protected property rights, the JUA argues, is thus sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis. Flores Galarza argues that the JUA fails to allege a taking of its property in satisfaction of the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis for two reasons: first, the JUA is a state-created entity, which, like the state itself, lacks the capacity to allege a taking under &#167; 1983; and second, the complaint does not allege the elements of a successful takings claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

According to the JUA, although the premiums pass through Flores Galarza's hands before reaching the JUA, the premiums are never funds of the Commonwealth. To the contrary, the JUA argues, given that the JUA's responsibility for the compulsory insurance comes into effect at the time the premiums are paid to the Secretary of the Treasury, \"the premium has to belong to the [JUA] at that time.\" Flores Galarza, the JUA argues, is thus merely a fiduciary who holds the premiums for the benefit of the JUA, as demonstrated by the 2002 Amendment's reference to the Secretary of the Treasury's \"collection service performed in favor of the [JUA].\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 8055(c). Flores Galarza, on the other hand, contends that Law 253 \"does not entitle JUA to ownership of the collected premiums until they are transferred to it by [Flores Galarza].\" Therefore, Flores Galarza argues, because Law 253 does not state \"when\" the Secretary must transfer the insurance premiums to the JUA, his retention of the $173 million in premiums was not a withholding of private property&#8212;it was merely a \"temporary retention or delay\" in the transfer of funds which did not yet belong to the JUA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, Law 253 supports the JUA's claim of a property right to that portion of the insurance premiums not owed to privately insured motorists or their insurers (\"Earned Premiums\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>). Law 253 created the JUA for \"[t]he main purpose of ... provid[ing] the compulsory liability insurance to the applicants for said insurance that have been rejected by private insurers.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 8055(b). As an insurer, the JUA is entitled to the Earned Premiums. Law 253 gives the JUA the power to hold property, and provides that the JUA \"shall receive\" premiums from the Secretary and that the Secretary \"shall transfer\" these premiums to the JUA. While the Secretary collects the insurance premiums and holds them for some unspecified amount of time before relinquishing them to the JUA, the Secretary is not an insurer&#8212;he is merely the custodian of these funds. As a custodian, the Secretary has no entitlement to the premiums, and his woefully undeveloped argument that the premiums do not vest in the JUA until the Secretary transfers them does not convince us otherwise. <i>Cf.

The JUA argues that Flores Galarza's withholding of the Earned Premiums constituted a \"permanent physical occupation and a <i>per se</i> taking for which just compensation must be paid.\" Specifically, the JUA contends that Flores Galarza physically took, albeit temporarily, $173 million of its insurance premiums, before transferring a large portion of those premiums to the JUA pursuant to the 2002 Settlement. The JUA's assertion of a property right in the Earned Premiums, together with its allegation of a physical appropriation of those funds, is sufficient to allege the taking of a constitutionally protected property interest in those premiums under the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis. <i>See Webb's,</i> 449 U.S. at 164-65, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110362\"><a href=\"/opinion/110362/webbs-fabulous-pharmacies-inc-v-beckwith/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

These premiums, Flores Galarza argues, \"constitute a double payment for the same insurance,\" and, therefore, do not belong to the JUA, but rather belong to privately insured motorists or their insurers who are entitled to reimbursement. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the law in effect at the time the premiums were withheld, the JUA was obliged to return the Duplicate Premiums to those requesting reimbursement. If no claim was made to these premiums after seven years, that money would lapse to the general fund of the Commonwealth Treasury. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167;&#167; 2603, 2606-2607. Thus, even if no one claimed the Duplicate Premiums within the requisite seven years, these funds became the property of the Commonwealth&#8212;not the JUA. Just as the Secretary is a custodian of the Earned Premiums for the benefit of the JUA, the JUA is a custodian of the Duplicate Premiums for the benefit of either those entitled to reimbursement or, if the premiums go unclaimed, the Commonwealth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 2002 Amendment, which requires the JUA to transfer the Duplicate Premiums to the Secretary after just two years, explicitly recognizes the JUA's lack of a property right to the Duplicate Premiums.

Given the lack of support for the JUA's claimed property right to the Duplicate Premiums, the JUA fails to allege a taking of this portion of the premiums under the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>c. Reserve Fund: the Overstated Funds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that the JUA has not alleged a property interest in the Duplicate Premiums does not extend to the remainder of the Reserve Fund&#8212;the \"Overstated Reserve Funds\"&#8212;which consists of the cushion set aside by the JUA to ensure that the Reserve was large enough to meet all of the requests for reimbursement by insureds who purchased private insurance. As noted earlier, the $73 million Reserve held back by the Commonwealth allegedly contained approximately $10 million in excess funds&#8212;money that, as it turned out, was not needed for reimbursement because fewer individuals than estimated had purchased their own policies, which meant, in turn, that less of the Reserve than anticipated constituted Duplicate Premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the JUA, \"since the [Overstated Reserve Funds] came from the [JUA] and do not, in fact, belong to others, they should have been accounted for as income for the [JUA].\" Flores Galarza contends that since these funds are merely portions of the Reserve, which, in turn, \"is merely an accounting tool\" for allocating the Duplicate Premiums, \"the JUA has no proprietary interest[] in the[se] moneys.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"Statement of Motives\" section of the 2002 Amendment, which was in place prior to Flores Galarza's appropriation of the Overstated Reserve Funds in November 2002, explicitly provides that the $73 million Reserve consists of funds \"that <i>do not belong to it</i> [the JUA]\" as the result of the double payment of insurance premiums by some drivers. The 2002 Amendment therefore requires the JUA to immediately transfer to the Secretary \"the funds known in its annual statement as `Funds Retained by the Insurer Belonging to Others'\"&#8212; that is, the $73 million Reserve&#8212;and to continue doing so every two years. There is, however, no carve-out for the \"cushion\" portion of the Reserve that consists of Overstated Funds. In fact, the 2002 Amendment provides that the Reserve funds transferred to the Secretary necessarily include any \"reserve excess,\" and that this reserve excess \"may be used as resources in the General Fund.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 8055(l).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA argues, in essence, that to the extent the Amendment directs the transfer of the Overstated Reserve Funds to the Commonwealth, the provision effects a taking of the JUA's property. Under Law 253, the JUA is obliged to insure drivers who might otherwise be uninsurable; the premiums for that insurance are initially collected by the Secretary. The JUA argues that all of those collected funds, other than the Duplicate Premiums, constitute the \"Earned Premiums\" and thus belong to it. Indeed, the Insurance Commissioner's adjustment of the Reserve percentage in 2001 to more accurately reflect the percentage of traditionally insured vehicle owners indicates the Commonwealth's recognition that the JUA is entitled to any funds above the amount representing Duplicate Premiums. Notably, the Amendment identifies the funds to be transferred to the Commonwealth every two years as funds \"Belonging to Others.\" Presumably, any such funds that do <i>not</i> belong to others belong to the JUA. We therefore conclude that the JUA has alleged the taking of a constitutionally protected property interest in the Overstated Reserve Funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. The Out-of-Pocket Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Flores Galarza stopped transferring insurance premiums to the JUA in 2000 in order to meet the cash-flow needs of the Commonwealth, the JUA had to reimburse privately insured drivers and their insurers out of its own pocket. While the JUA presumably recouped some of its costs pursuant to the 2002 Settlement, the JUA alleges that there was still $13.6 million outstanding&#8212;an amount which the JUA argues should have been set off against the $73 million retained by Flores Galarza. The JUA alleges that the $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds \"used to reimburse insurance premiums from January to September 2002[is] the private property of the [JUA].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not dispute that the Out-of-Pocket funds used by the JUA to reimburse third parties belonged to the JUA. Accordingly, the JUA alleges a property right in the Out-of-Pocket Funds. Turning to the second step of the takings analysis, the JUA alleges that Flores Galarza physically appropriated $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds from the JUA by retaining the full $73 million in Reserve funds.

Relying upon cases which hold that uncompensated physical appropriations of private property&#8212;including interest&#8212;are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment, the JUA contends that its \"right to be justly compensated for the taking of its property\" was \"clearly established\" at the time of the challenged conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Flores Galarza disagrees. While \"it [i]s clearly established that the taking of a property interest without just compensation [i]s unconstitutional,\" he argues that this proposition is too broad to satisfy the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis. \"The property rights claimed by the JUA,\" Flores Galarza contends, \"cannot be easily read into the law enabling the JUA and the Compulsory Liability Insurance,\" and, therefore, are not clearly established. We now test that proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Earned Premiums and Interest<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We already have concluded that the JUA, under Law 253, alleges a property interest in the Earned Premiums and the interest generated by those premiums. Because Law 253 was on the books at the time Flores Galarza withheld the Earned Premiums and interest, we conclude that the JUA's alleged property interest in those funds was clearly established. Flores Galarza essentially acknowledged as much (at least with respect to the Earned Premiums) by returning the Earned Premiums to the JUA pursuant to the 2002 Settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law was not so clear, however, that Flores Galarza's alleged withholding of the Earned Premiums and interest was a taking. Law 253 does not establish when the Secretary must transfer the premiums to the JUA. As noted by Flores Galarza,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he compulsory insurance law is completely devoid of a timetable that controls the transfer of the premiums collected by the Secretary of the Treasury to the JUA. The statute simply states that the transfers must be made. However, <i>when</i> these transfers must be made is an entirely different question. The JUA has never pointed to any substantive source that establishes its entitlement to a prompt transfer of the premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Citation omitted.) Under the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis, it is not enough for the JUA to argue that Flores Galarza physically took the Earned Premiums to which the JUA was entitled under Law 253. Here, the JUA must demonstrate that Law 253 entitled the JUA to the Earned Premiums within a specified amount of time, such that the unlawfulness of Flores Galarza's temporary withholding of the premiums was \"apparent.\" This it cannot do. Indeed, even if we imported into Law 253 a requirement that the Secretary transfer the premiums to the JUA within a reasonable period of time, that reasonableness requirement would be too indefinite to allow us to conclude that the alleged taking was clearly established. The unlawfulness of Flores Galarza's temporary withholding of the Earned Premiums, therefore, was not \"apparent\" under the statute. The right to interest inescapably is tied to the JUA's entitlement to the premiums and therefore also was not clearly established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Overstated Reserve Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lack of clarity is even more apparent with respect to the Overstated Reserve Funds, which was the portion of the Reserve in excess of the amount necessary to reimburse insureds or insurers who already had paid for coverage. Certainly after enactment of the 2002 Amendment to the compulsory insurance law, which specifically required the JUA to transfer to the Secretary all funds held in the Reserve as of December 31, 2001, the law did not clearly establish that the JUA had a property right in the $10 million of Overstated Reserve Funds or, indeed, that withholding any of the designated Reserve of $73 million was an unconstitutional taking. Whether, and how much, of that $10 million is in fact \"excess\" remains a matter of debate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Secretary began withholding the Overstated Reserve Funds in 2000, along with the Earned and Duplicate Premiums, the alleged $10 million excess was undifferentiated from the balance of the Earned Premiums. As noted earlier, the JUA essentially claims that the $10 million should be considered Earned Premiums in which it holds a property right, and as such that money is encompassed within our prior discussion. Therefore, the law was not clearly established either before or after the 2002 Amendment that the Secretary's retention of the Overstated Reserve Funds was an unconstitutional taking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Out-of-Pocket Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA argues that it has a clearly established right to the $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds, which Flores Galarza allegedly should have deducted from the $73 million Reserve he took on behalf of the Commonwealth. Since it is undisputed that the Out-of-Pocket funds belong to the JUA, the JUA's alleged property right in the Out-of-Pocket Funds is clearly established. It also was clearly established that the physical taking of property, without compensation, violated the Constitution. <i>See Tahoe-Sierra,</i> 535 U.S. at 322-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118498\"><a href=\"/opinion/118498/tahoe-sierra-preservation-council-inc-v-tahoe-regional-planning-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Therefore, as we turn to the third prong of the qualified immunity analysis (whether a reasonable officer would have believed that the alleged conduct violated clearly established law), we focus only on the alleged taking of the Out-of-Pocket Funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

The 2002 Amendment was subsequently enacted, which required the JUA to pay to the Secretary $73 million in Reserve funds. One month later, pursuant to the 2002 Settlement, Flores Galarza made a \"massive transfer of all the funds [he] had retained since [he] stopped making the transfers,\" but he held back the $73 million in Reserve funds that the JUA was required to pay the Secretary under the 2002 Amendment. As Flores Galarza argues, a reasonable officer in these circumstances would have believed that he \"had a law mandate, stemming from the [2002 Amendment], to retain for use by the Department of Treasury the Reserve Fund recognized by JUA as of December 31, 2001. Any officer in his shoes would have acted as he did in immediately retaining the full Reserve Fund amount without any compensation\" to the JUA. Nothing in the 2002 Amendment suggests that funds owed to the JUA had to be deducted from the $73 million Reserve, and that the failure to do so would constitute a taking. As Flores Galarza argues, \"money [is] fungible in nature.\" Thus, a reasonable officer could have believed that the 2002 Amendment required \"the JUA [] to replenish the Reserve Fund\" and then debit the Out-of-Pocket Funds \"from this `new' Reserve Fund ... and not from the [$73 million] Reserve allocation recognized as of December 31, 2001.\" In that way, the JUA would be made whole with respect to the Out-of-Pocket Funds. Because a reasonable officer would not have believed that retaining $13.6 million in Out-of-Pocket Funds violated the JUA's clearly established rights, we conclude that Flores Galarza is entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize the essential points of our analysis. The JUA has standing to sue Flores Galarza under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and the Supreme Court's prudential ripeness requirements for takings claims pose no barrier to our consideration of the case. We may not, however, address res judicata issues in this interlocutory appeal. Flores Galarza is amenable to suit in his official capacity under the Eleventh Amendment because the JUA seeks prospective declaratory and injunctive relief against him in that capacity, namely: a declaration that his taking of insurance premiums, interest, and other funds to alleviate the cash-flow problems of the Commonwealth violates the Constitution; and an injunction enjoining him from withholding insurance premiums and from enforcing the terms of the 2002 Amendment to the extent they amount to an unconstitutional taking. Notwithstanding the indistinct line between official- and personal-capacity suits against government officials, we conclude that the JUA seeks to hold Flores Galarza liable in his personal capacity for damages. We conclude, however, that he is immune from such liability. Specifically, because the law was not clearly established that Flores Galarza effected an unconstitutional taking of the withheld insurance premiums, the interest generated by those premiums, or the Overstated Reserve Funds, he is entitled to qualified immunity on these claims. Additionally, because a reasonable officer would not have believed that the failure to reimburse the JUA for the Out-of-Pocket Funds violated the JUA's rights, qualified immunity forecloses a damages remedy against him on that claim as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's decision that the JUA has standing to sue Flores Galarza, and that Flores Galarza is amenable to suit in his official capacity under the Eleventh Amendment.

In the complaint, the JUA likewise states that it was forced to liquidate its investments as early as January 2000 \"[a]s a result of the [Secretary's] failure to transfer th[e premiums].\" Elsewhere in the complaint, however, the JUA states that the Secretary withheld premiums \"[d]uring the past two years,\" which would mean that the alleged withholding began in approximately February 2001, based on the February 2003 filing date of the complaint. Flores Galarza argues that \"although not alleged in the complaint, the supposed withholding of the transfers would have started on March 2001.\" While our analysis does not require that we resolve this discrepancy, we use for our analysis the earliest date that Flores Galarza is alleged to have withheld the premiums (January 2000), which date is supported by the record at this stage of the proceedings</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The 2002 Amendment thus allocates the seven-year period provided by the general provisions of Puerto Rico's Insurance Code, P.R.

While the JUA's complaint suggests that the amount paid by Flores Galarza was closer to $100 million, what matters for purposes of our analysis is the amount which Flores Galarza did<i>not</i> pay &#8212; $73 million.

The first mention of Rodr&#237;guez comes in the Notice of Interlocutory Appeal, which references her by political office only, not by name. The parties refer to Rodr&#237;guez again &#8212; this time, in her official capacity as Secretary of Justice &#8212; in the caption on their briefs before us, but neither party makes any argument respecting her. Assuming that Rodr&#237;guez was properly joined as a party to this action, she ceased to be a party when she left her post as Secretary of Justice in 2004 and was succeeded by William Vazquez Irizarry, who was, in turn, succeeded by the present Secretary of Justice, Roberto J. S&#225;nchez Ramos<i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d). We therefore do not reach Rodr&#237;guez's interests here. Furthermore, since neither the complaint nor the district court order lists the Secretary of Justice as a party, and since neither party argues that we should adjudicate the interests of the Secretary of Justice in this appeal, we do not reach the interests of S&#225;nchez Ramos. On remand, it will be important for the district court to clarify S&#225;nchez Ramos's status in this litigation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> For the sake of clarity, we note that &#167; 1983 cannot be \"violated,\" as the JUA suggests in the complaint. \"Section 1983 does not confer substantive rights but merely provides a means to vindicate rights conferred by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"<i>Wilson v.

As noted above, the JUA originally estimated that 25% of all registered motor vehicles were privately insured, and so set aside 25% of all premiums received and accumulated them in the Reserve. In its complaint, the JUA argues that the number of privately insured motor vehicles as of 2001 was actually 17.4%, which means that the JUA overstated the Reserve by approximately $10 million. In its brief before us and at oral argument, however, the JUA argues that the number of privately insured motor vehicles in 2001 was actually 19.3%, which means that the Reserve was overstated by approximately $8 million. Counsel for the JUA also explained at oral argument that the Insurance Commissioner used the higher percentage in adjusting the Reserve for fiscal year 2001. The Secretary says nothing about this discrepancy. Because we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant when considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and because the 17% figure set forth in the complaint would presumably yield a higher damages award for the JUA than the 19% figure, i.e., $10 million as opposed to $8 million, we use the lower percentage yielding the higher damages amount for purposes of our analysis</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We note that even that amount might understate the damages figure. If, as the JUA indicates, the Reserve is based on the estimated total number of privately insured vehicles &#8212; in an attempt to reflect the greatest number of owners who might be entitled to a refund &#8212; the Reserve would contain more than the amount needed for reimbursement to the extent that any of the privately insured owners had avoided payment of the compulsory insurance premium by presenting a Certificate of Compliance. Such owners would not be entitled to a refund, but the Reserve would include enough to reimburse them based on their private insurance status.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> The record does not contain the 2002 Settlement.

The Court explained:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">While the policies underlying the two concepts often overlap, the finality requirement is concerned with whether the initial decisionmaker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual, concrete injury; the exhaustion requirement generally refers to administrative and judicial procedures by which an injured party may seek review of an adverse decision and obtain a remedy if the decision is found to be unlawful or otherwise inappropriate. . . .</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The difference is best illustrated by comparing the procedure for seeking a variance with the procedures that, under <i>Patsy</i> [<i>v. Florida Board of Regents,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110753\"><a href=\"/opinion/110753/patsy-v-board-of-regents-of-fla/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110753\"><a href=\"/opinion/110753/patsy-v-board-of-regents-of-fla/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While it appears that the State provides procedures by which an aggrieved property owner may seek a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of zoning and planning actions taken by county authorities, respondent would not be required to resort to those procedures before bringing its &#167; 1983 action, because those procedures clearly are remedial. Similarly, respondent would not be required to appeal the Commission's rejection of the preliminary plat to the Board of Zoning Appeals, because the Board was empowered, at most, to review that rejection, not to participate in the Commission's decisionmaking.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Resort to those procedures would result in a judgment whether the Commission's actions violated any of respondent's rights. In contrast, resort to the procedure for obtaining variances would result in a conclusive determination by the Commission whether it would allow respondent to develop the subdivision in the manner respondent proposed. The Commission's refusal to approve the preliminary plat does not determine that issue; it . . . leaves open the possibility that respondent may develop the subdivision according to its plat after obtaining the variances. In short, the Commission's denial of approval does not conclusively determine whether respondent will be denied all reasonable beneficial use of its property, and therefore is not a final, reviewable decision.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">473 U.S. at 193-94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the JUA did not pursue compensation through the state system, its federal claim against Flores Galarza, in his individual capacity, should have been dismissed on ripeness grounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn36\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36_ref\">36</a>\n        <p> The finality requirement does not apply because the JUA seeks compensation for a physical, rather than a regulatory, taking<i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 91.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn37\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37_ref\">37</a>\n        <p> Indeed, in<i>Southview,</i> 980 F.2d at 100, the court explicitly rejected the argument that <i>Williamson County's</i> litigation requirement mandated the claimant to pursue state processes only if the state provided a specific statutory avenue of relief.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn38\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38_ref\">38</a>\n        <p> I understand that the lead opinion seeks to limit the litigation requirement because of its concern that preclusion principles will prevent takings claims from being litigated in federal court, if claimants must pursue state remedies in state court<i>See ante</i> at 80. This was the view of four Justices of the Supreme Court in <i>San Remo Hotel v. City &amp; County of San Francisco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799978\"><a href=\"/opinion/799978/san-remo-hotel-lp-v-city-and-county-of-san-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 349, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799978\"><a href=\"/opinion/799978/san-remo-hotel-lp-v-city-and-county-of-san-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The majority, however, disagreed, concluding that \"it is hardly a radical notion to recognize that . . . a significant number of plaintiffs will necessarily litigate their federal takings claims in state courts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 347, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799978\"><a href=\"/opinion/799978/san-remo-hotel-lp-v-city-and-county-of-san-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As the Court has rejected this concern as a basis for revisiting the litigation requirement, it does not serve as an adequate basis for substantially limiting it in this circuit.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The lead opinion also supports its limiting construction of the litigation requirement by suggesting that requiring claimants to pursue state constitutional takings claims or other general causes of action would require claimants to exhaust state remedies, which is inconsistent with Supreme Court caselaw interpreting 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. <i>E.g., Pasty v. Fla.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span> (1982) The <i>Williamson County</i> Court accepted this argument for purposes of the finality requirement, by holding that a claimant need not exhaust judicial review after a state agency has definitively interpreted a regulation. 473 U.S. at 192-93, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
