Kristina McLarey, estranged from\n\nher then-husband, Iraj Danaipour, in June 2001 removed her two\n\nyoung daughters,        A.D.   and   C.D.,   from    Sweden,   the    country   of\n\nhabitual residence, and brought them to the United States in\n\nviolation of a Swedish Court order.           A.D. was then seven and C.D.\n\nwas almost three years old.\n\n          Danaipour filed suit in the United States in state court;\n\nthe case was removed to federal court, and he sought to have the\n\nchildren returned pursuant to the International Child Abduction\n\nRemedies Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 11601, and the Hague Convention on the\n\nCivil   Aspects    of    International       Child    Abduction,     opened     for\n\nsignature Oct. 25, 1980, T.I.A.S. No. 11,670, 1343 U.N.T.S. 89.\n\nMcLarey had filed her own Hague Convention action earlier to\n\nprevent return; she responded to Danaipour's action by claiming the\n\nextremely narrow protection available under Article 13(b) of the\n\nConvention.      Article 13(b) permits the court to decline to return\n\nchildren to the country of habitual residence where return would\n\ncause grave risk of physical or psychological harm to them or\n\notherwise place them in an intolerable situation.                   Specifically,\n\nthe mother asserted that the father had sexually abused both\n\nchildren and returning the two children to Sweden would cause them\n\ngrave risk of harm.\n\n           The    federal      district   court     declined   to    resolve    the\n\nquestion of whether either of the girls had been sexually abused,\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fpreferring that the children be returned so the courts of Sweden\n\ncould resolve that issue.    See Danaipour v. McLarey, 183 F. Supp.\n\n2d 311, 314 (D. Mass. 2002).    This court reversed.   See Danaipour\n\nv. McLarey, 286 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"Danaipour I\").       We\n\nremanded the case with instructions that the sexual abuse question\n\nmust be decided (as part of the court's obligation to consider the\n\ngrave risk issue), and then that the question of grave risk be\n\naddressed in light of this finding.\n\n            On remand, the district court found, after trial, by\n\nclear and convincing evidence that the younger child, C.D., had\n\nbeen sexually abused by her father but that the older daughter,\n\nA.D., had not been.     The court also found that there would be a\n\ngrave risk of harm to and an intolerable situation for both\n\nchildren if the court ordered them returned to Sweden, where their\n\nfather continues to live.       The father now appeals from that\n\ndecision.\n\n            The father's appeal argues that the judgment is based on\n\nthe following errors.    Danaipour first contends the sexual abuse\n\ndetermination falters for evidentiary insufficiency, based in part\n\non inadmissibility of certain evidence. He argues that the finding\n\nof sexual abuse was clearly erroneous because the court-appointed\n\nexpert, Dr. Pierre, made no such finding and the district court\n\nrelied on the testimony of expert witnesses who had never met the\n\nchild.   This argument is supplemented by the argument that the\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fcourt abused its discretion in admitting multiple hearsay evidence\n\nunder Rules 803(4) and 807.                 Recognizing the dangers inherent in\n\npartisan reports           of   a   child's       statements      to    an   examining    or\n\nconsulting expert (for example, by a mother accusing a father of\n\nsexual abuse of a child), we hold there was no abuse of discretion\n\nin admission of such evidence here, which was, inter alia, also\n\nintroduced through direct testimony and corroborated by statements\n\nmade directly to the doctors by the children.\n\n              As to the grave risk finding, Danaipour argues the court\n\nerred in considering one item about the father's behavior, and that\n\nit   failed    to    comply      with      this   court's    mandate         and    committed\n\nreversible error, as a matter of law, in failing to determine\n\nwhether the courts of Sweden could properly address any issue of\n\ngrave   risk.        Danaipour        mischaracterizes         the     district       court's\n\nfindings.      The district court complied with this court's mandate\n\nand, having answered the question of whether sexual abuse occurred,\n\nseparately addressed the issue of grave risk of harm to the\n\nphysical or psychological health of the children.                              The court's\n\nfindings that the return of the children to Sweden would cause\n\ngrave   harm    to    the       psychological       health     of      the   children     was\n\nsupported      by    the    record.          That    finding        renders        immaterial\n\nDanaipour's     arguments           that    the    courts    of     Sweden     could     take\n\nameliorative actions to prevent further harm once the children had\n\nbeen returned.         In such circumstances, Article 13(b) does not\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\frequire separate consideration either of undertakings or of steps\n\nwhich might be taken by the courts of the country of habitual\n\nresidence.\n\n          The district court handled this difficult matter on\n\nremand in an admirable and sensitive way.    We affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          The facts of this case are set out both in the original\n\ndistrict court's opinion, Danaipour v. McLarey, 183 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n316-23, and in the original case before this court, Danaipour I,\n\n286 F.3d at 5-13.   We summarize those facts briefly here.   Kristina\n\nMcLarey, a dual citizen of the United States and Sweden, lived with\n\nIraj Danaipour, a Swedish citizen and Iranian national, in Sweden.\n\nThe two met in Sweden and had their first child, A.D., there in\n\n1994, shortly after which they were married in Massachusetts. They\n\nreturned to Sweden and had a second child, C.D., in 1998.         The\n\nfamily lived in Sweden, with frequent visits to the United States,\n\nwhere Ms. McLarey's family resides.\n\n             The couple's marriage deteriorated, and they jointly\n\nfiled for divorce in February of 2000.        They were eventually\n\nawarded joint custody of the children, with McLarey residing at the\n\ncouple's condominium and Danaipour at his girlfriend's apartment.\n\nThe two girls alternated between them on a weekly basis.       During\n\nthis time, McLarey noticed vaginal redness and soreness by her\n\nyounger daughter, C.D., as well as symptoms of anxiety by both\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fgirls, such as nightmares, headaches, and stomachaches when they\n\nreturned from being with their father.          McLarey testified that she\n\nquestioned C.D. about her vaginal soreness, and the child responded\n\n\"Baba [the child's name for her father] do like this,\" after which\n\nC.D. made a masturbatory motion. McLarey reported this information\n\nto a child psychologist, who issued a report of suspected child\n\nabuse and referred the case to Swedish social services, who then\n\ncontacted the police to investigate.        In November 2000, the police\n\nbriefly interviewed the girls (A.D. was questioned for less than an\n\nhour,   and    C.D.   was   questioned    for   five   minutes),   who   were\n\nnonresponsive to their inquiries.          The Swedish police terminated\n\ntheir investigation in January 2001.\n\n              In early 2001, McLarey requested a separate sexual abuse\n\nevaluation by the Swedish child and youth psychiatric unit.               The\n\nunit would not conduct such an investigation absent Danaipour's\n\nconsent, which he refused to give.          During this time, C.D. made\n\nadditional disclosures to Ms. McLarey, her grandmother, and to Ms.\n\nMcLarey's boyfriend that raised further concerns that the child had\n\nbeen sexually abused by her father.             After videotaping one such\n\ndisclosure by C.D., in March 2001 McLarey sought a Swedish court\n\norder for a full sexual abuse investigation.           The court denied the\n\norder because Danaipour opposed it.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            McLarey   left   Sweden    with    her    children      and   came   to\n\nMassachusetts. She did so without Danaipour's knowledge or consent\n\nand in violation of a Swedish court custody order.\n\n            Shortly after arriving in Massachusetts, McLarey brought\n\nboth her children to a child psychologist, Dr. Toni Luxenberg, for\n\ntreatment for symptoms which McLarey thought resulted from sexual\n\nabuse.     Dr. Luxenberg's role was not to make an evaluation of\n\nwhether sexual abuse had taken place, but to treat the children.\n\nMcLarey informed Dr. Luxenberg of the disclosures C.D. had made to\n\nher and other family members, and Dr. Luxenberg in addition spoke\n\nto the children's grandmother.          Thereupon, Dr. Luxenberg began\n\ntreating the girls, meeting them once a week together or separately\n\nfor approximately one hour.      After C.D. developed a comfort level\n\nwith Dr. Luxenberg, the child began to make significant disclosures\n\nto Dr. Luxenberg, above and beyond any she had made to her family\n\nmembers.   Such disclosures led Dr. Luxenberg to conclude that C.D.\n\nhad in fact been sexually abused by Danaipour.               Dr. Luxenberg has\n\ncontinued to treat C.D. and A.D. throughout this litigation.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.   Sexual Abuse Finding\n\n            The   original   district       court    found   that    a    forensic\n\nexamination would be needed to determine the sexual abuse question\n\nand that the Swedish courts, acting under conditions set for return\n\nof the children, could determine what to do after a forensic\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fexamination was done in Sweden.   We disagreed.    In   Danaipour I,\n\n286 F.3d at 26, we noted that on remand, if necessary, the district\n\ncourt should order further evaluations, but we did not mandate any\n\nparticular method by which the district court should address the\n\ntwo questions of whether there had been sexual abuse and whether\n\nthere was grave risk.\n\n          On remand, the district court decided that a new trial\n\nshould be held to determine whether sexual abuse occurred.       The\n\ncourt also decided that an independent expert evaluation should be\n\nattempted as to whether either girl had been sexually abused,\n\nmindful that this belated evaluation might prove to be inconclusive\n\nand of the potential trauma to the children.    The court appointed\n\nan independent child psychologist, Dr. Claudette Pierre, to perform\n\na sexual abuse evaluation of the girls.   Dr. Pierre spoke with both\n\ngirls, the parents, reviewed the file, and filed a report.       Dr.\n\nPierre concluded that A.D. had not been abused.     Dr. Pierre also\n\nfound that C.D. had in fact been traumatized by some events, most\n\nlikely sexual in nature, but that Dr. Pierre could not conclusively\n\ndetermine whether C.D.'s father had in fact sexually abused her.\n\n          The parties agreed that the children should not testify.\n\nIn conducting the trial, the court elected to have the parties\n\nsubmit affidavits for each of their witnesses as direct testimony,\n\nand cross examination was done of these witnesses on the stand.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fThe parties had the opportunity to object to evidence in the\n\naffidavits.\n\n          Danaipour made a general unspecified objection to hearsay\n\nevidence in the affidavits of McLarey's witnesses.              The court then\n\nasked for the objection to be stated more specifically in writing.\n\nThe court said it would allow the testimony and cross examination,\n\nbut would consider the written objection and whether to credit the\n\nevidence when deciding the merits of the case.\n\n             Danaipour then filed a motion objecting only to any\n\n\"double hearsay,\" specifically referring to statements in the\n\npsychologists' reports by family members recounting to the doctors\n\nwhat the children had said to them.                 Petitioner conceded that\n\nstatements    made    by   the    children     to   the   psychologists    were\n\nadmissible    under   Fed.   R.    Evid.   ยง   803(4),    and   conceded   that\n\nstatements made by the children to family members were \"arguably\"\n\nadmissible under Fed. R. Evid. ยง 807 (and in any event did not\n\nchallenge these statements, and does not do so here).\n\n             After the trial, the district court found:\n\n             by clear and convincing evidence that sexual\n             abuse of C.D., who was slightly younger than\n             two and one-half years old at the time,\n             involving   more   than   one   occasion   of\n             masturbation by and of Danaipour in the\n             presence of and involving C.D. took place\n             during this period of alternating supervision\n             in the fall of 2000. I find further that this\n             abuse stopped once a police investigation\n             began at the end of November 2000. At least\n             one act of abuse involved C.D. touching her\n             father's erect penis and led to her touching\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            his ejaculant.  At least one other such act\n            involved digital masturbation of C.D. by\n            Danaipour.\n\n            The judge found the disclosures of the children to\n\nMcLarey, her then-boyfriend Morin, and the children's grandmother\n\nto be credible.       In doing so, however, the court noted that it\n\nfound pertinent Danaipour's expert's cautionary observations that\n\na custodial parent in the context of a divorce may misinterpret\n\nbehavior and symptoms of the child upon returning from a visit with\n\nthe non-custodial parent.         The court noted that it was \"especially\n\nconcerned that the reports of commentary by the children may have\n\nbeen overstated or manipulated.\"              With this concern in mind, the\n\ncourt found these statements, given by the witnesses through their\n\naffidavits and subject to cross examination, to be credible.                     The\n\ncourt also used the indicia of credibility for statements by\n\nsexually abused children submitted to the court by McLarey's\n\nexpert, Dr. Carole Jenny.\n\n            The court also found \"highly persuasive\" the disclosures\n\nmade by C.D. to Dr. Luxenberg and Dr. Pierre.               The court found that\n\nC.D.'s     multiple     disclosures     to     Dr.    Luxenberg     unambiguously\n\ndemonstrated     that     C.D.    associated         the   word    \"hammer\"      with\n\nmasturbation, and that these references demonstrate that there were\n\nmultiple    occasions     of     her   participating       in     masturbation    of\n\nDanaipour and     his    masturbation        of   her.     The    court   expressly\n\nconsidered the concern of Danaipour's expert that these disclosures\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fwere tainted by inquiries by McLarey or Dr. Luxenberg, and found\n\nthat C.D.'s recollection was not \"materially tainted or otherwise\n\nthe product of suggestion.\"    The district court found that the\n\ncharacters and themes developed by C.D. through her play therapy\n\nwith Dr. Luxenberg were used by her \"as a means to express and\n\ndisclose the abusive circumstances to which she has been exposed,\n\nand her reaction to those circumstances.\"    We note only that our\n\ndiscussion does not repeat all the evidence on which the conclusion\n\nwas based.   Further, despite the fact that Dr. Pierre's ultimate\n\nconclusion was inconclusive as to whether C.D. had been sexually\n\nabused by her father, the court found that the corroborative\n\ndisclosure from C.D. obtained by Dr. Pierre supported its finding,\n\nbased on all the evidence, that C.D. had been abused by her father.\n\nB.   Grave Risk Finding\n\n           Having found by clear and convincing evidence that C.D.\n\nwas sexually abused by her father, the court then went on to\n\nconclude, also by clear and convincing evidence, that returning the\n\nchildren to Sweden would create a grave risk of psychological harm\n\nand an intolerable situation for them.      The court credited the\n\nobservations of both Dr. van der Kolk and Dr. Luxenberg that\n\nreturning C.D., who has been sexually abused, to the place of\n\ntrauma and location of her victimization can have profoundly\n\ndisturbing effects on the child.      The court also credited the\n\nconclusions of Dr. van der Kolk, one of McLarey's expert witnesses,\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fthat \"it is important to the psychological well being of C.D. that\n\nwhat she has disclosed be believed and not appear to lead as a\n\nconsequence to her return to the place of trauma.\"                 Thus, the court\n\nfound that her return would create a grave risk of \"fractur[ing]\n\nirremediably her sense of safety, justice and the value of truth\n\ntelling,\" a situation the court found would be intolerable for her.\n\nThe court found a similar, though derivative, effect would occur to\n\nA.D.    This,     coupled   with   the   fact   that          \"[t]he    parties     have\n\nproceeded on      the   assumption    that    the    children          should    not   be\n\nseparated and that any order under the Hague Convention would apply\n\nto both,\" led the court to deny Danaipour's request to have the\n\nchildren sent back to Sweden.\n\nIII.\n\nA. Challenge to the Finding of Sexual Abuse of C.D.\n\n            The party opposing return of the children, here, the\n\nmother, has the burden of proving the ultimate Article 13(b)\n\nexception issue by clear and convincing evidence. Danaipour I, 286\n\nF.3d   at   13.     Subsidiary     facts      need       be    proven     only    by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.           We review factual determination\n\nunder the Hague Convention for clear error.                   Whallon v. Lynn, 230\n\nF.3d   450,   454    (1st   Cir.     2000).         We    review        questions      of\n\nadmissibility of evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.\n\nSee Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 100 F.3d 203, 212-13\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f             The district court concluded that under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n1101(b) \"the summary character of Hague Convention proceedings does\n\nnot require application of the Federal Rules of Evidence regarding\n\nhearsay.    .     .   .\"      It    nonetheless    attempted   \"to    parallel    the\n\nprocedures        for      notice    and   the    concern   for      guarantees   of\n\ntrustworthiness which are found in Fed. R. Evid. 807, the residual\n\nhearsay exception frequently used when courts receive out of court\n\nstatements by children in [a] child abuse case outside the Hague\n\nConvention context.\" While summary proceedings certainly may occur\n\nin cases under the Convention, this was not one.                  Indeed, this was\n\na full trial.         Whatever our doubts, nonetheless, Danaipour has not\n\ndirectly raised on appeal the point of the applicability of the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence; at most he argues that the mother's\n\nfamily's recounting of the children's statements to physicians\n\nconstituted       inadmissible         double     hearsay   and   was    inherently\n\nunreliable.\n\n             1.

Child therapists routinely, as part of\n\ntheir diagnosis or treatment, obtain the type of statements made by\n\nthe patients here, A.D. and C.D., about the identity of the\n\nperpetrator of the abuse.

Danaipour agrees that statements made directly by A.D. and\n\nC.D. to Dr. Pierre and Dr. Luxenberg are admissible under Rule\n\n803(4).\n\n               The problem presented here concerns statements by a\n\nparent or family member, not the child, to a doctor of what C.D.\n\nand A.D. said.      The plain language of the rule does not require the\n\nstatements to be made by the patients, or even to a physician.\n\nYazzie, 59 F.3d at 813; Davignon v.

In situations in which there are no\n\nincentives for parental bias, parental reports to doctors of\n\nstatements by their children are routinely admitted under Rule\n\n803(4).    See 4 Christopher B. Mueller and Laird C. Kirkpatrick,\n\nFederal Evidence 465 (2d ed. 1994) (\"[The 803(4)] exception does\n\nnot require that the speaker be the patient or that the listener be\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fthe doctor.       Clearly it reaches statements by family members\n\n(parent, sibling, or spouse) who bring a patient to a hospital or\n\ndoctor's office.\"); 4 Stephen A. Saltzburg et al., Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence Manual ยง 803.02[5][d] (8th ed. 2002) (\"[S]tatements by\n\nbystanders, family members, and others, made for the purposes of\n\ntreating an injured person and pertinent to that treatment, have\n\noften been admitted under Rule 803(4).\").               One example would be a\n\nparental report of a five year old's statement explaining where and\n\nhow she scraped her knee badly. In such situations, the incentives\n\nare    strong   for    the    parent    to   recount    the    child's     statement\n\naccurately and honestly.          The Rule recognizes the reality of the\n\nsituation.

Yazzie, 59 F.3d at\n\n813.    It may be clear from the circumstance or context that the\n\nparental report of a child's statement of abuse to a doctor is made\n\nfor purposes other than for diagnosis or treatment.                      See   United\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fStates v. Balfany, 965 F.2d 575 (8th Cir. 1992) (considering that\n\ntheory).\n\n             In a situation such as this where there are reasons to\n\nlook skeptically on the motives of the declarant, the context in\n\nwhich the statements are made is relevant to whether they bear\n\nadequate indicia of trustworthiness.              Yazzie, 59 F.3d at 813.\n\nMcLarey brought her children to Dr. Luxenberg, not for the purposes\n\nof determining whether the children had been sexually abused, but\n\nfor treating their symptoms as manifested by their disturbed\n\nbehavior.     Thus, the statements made by McLarey to Dr. Luxenberg\n\nwere for the purposes of treatment.\n\n             Most of the cases cited by Danaipour in attempting to\n\nchallenge    the   district   court's    admission     of   the    objected-to\n\nstatements are criminal cases, in which the evidence was subjected\n\nto Confrontation Clause analysis.         The Supreme Court has stated\n\nthat   the   Confrontation    Clause    creates    a   higher     bar    for   the\n\nadmission of hearsay evidence than do the Federal Rules alone.\n\nIdaho v. Wright 497 U.S. 804, 814 (1990) (\"The Confrontation Clause\n\n. . . bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be\n\nadmissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\").                   This is a\n\ncivil case.\n\n             In the end Danaipour's claim that the district court\n\ncommitted error by admitting and considering for the truth of the\n\nmatter asserted the parental and family statements concerning C.D.\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fand A.D.'s statements in the reports of Dr. Luxenberg fails, for\n\nseveral reasons.    First, the statements made by McLarey, her\n\nmother, and Morin in the doctor's reports were tested when each\n\nperson took the witness stand, testified directly to the same\n\nstatements by A.D. and C.D., and was subjected to cross examination\n\nabout the hearsay to the doctors.        There were no discrepancies.\n\n          Second, Dr. Luxenberg testified that the children made\n\nthe same statements (as reported by McLarey, her mother, and Morin)\n\ndirectly to her during their therapy, corroborating the statements\n\nreported to her by the mother and her family.             This is true for\n\neach of the statements to which objection was made.           Indeed, C.D.\n\nmade statements to Dr. Luxenberg about her father's actions which\n\nwent beyond what she told her mother.\n\n          Danaipour's real objection is not that reports containing\n\nMcLarey's and others' recounting of the children's statements were\n\ninadmissible   double   hearsay   but     rather   that    the   children's\n\nstatements were inherently unreliable, being a product of the\n\nmother's coaching of the children.        The district court carefully\n\nconsidered the fact that statements by a young child, even if\n\naccurately recounted by an adult, may not reflect the truth.              A\n\nchild may say something in order to get attention.               Further, a\n\nstory once told may, for several reasons, be subject to repetition\n\nand elaboration.   The court also carefully considered the concern\n\nexpressed by the husband's expert that repeated inquiry on the\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\ftopic would taint C.D.'s recollections; the court found this had\n\nnot happened.           The court was very attentive to the possibility of\n\ncoaching and found that improbable, and that the statements did not\n\nbear       the   indicia       of   a   suggested   script.     In   evaluating   the\n\nreliability of the reported statements by the two children, the\n\ncourt utilized the indicia of credibility in sexual abuse cases\n\nreferenced both in the literature and by Dr. Carole Jenny, a\n\nrecognized expert.2             The court was well within its discretion in\n\nconsidering the truth of the statements by C.D. and A.D. as\n\nreported by McLarey and the others to Dr. Luxenberg.\n\n                 2.     Consistency with Dr. Pierre's findings.\n\n                 Danaipour attacks the merits of the sexual abuse finding.\n\nHe argues that the finding was impermissibly contrary to the\n\nconclusion         of    the    one     independent   expert,    Dr.   Pierre,    who\n\nconcluded: \"[i]t is very possible that something has happened,\n\nhowever, based on the contents of this disclosure evaluation it is\n\ndifficult to determine the exact nature of what that is. Therefore\n\nthe results of this evaluation [as to C.D.] would have to be\n\n\n       2\n          The indicia of credibility recounted by Dr. Jenny with\nrespect to children's disclosures of sexual abuse include, among\nother things: \"(1) free recall, without specific prompting or\nquestioning; (2) spontaneity; (3) agitation and distress upon\nmaking disclosures; (4) age-inappropriate sexual knowledge; and (5)\nuse of developmentally appropriate words and sentence structure, as\nwell as drawings containing sexualized themes.\" This was supported\nby a literary review by Kathleen Coulborn-Faller and David L.\nCorwin, widely accepted in the field and published in the highly\nregarded International Journal of Child Abuse and Neglect.\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fconsidered inconclusive.\"   Expanding on this, at trial, Dr. Pierre\n\ntestified she was certain something happened to C.D. that was\n\n\"traumatic\" and \"sexual\" but said she \"did not know specifically\n\nwhat that [was].\"\n\n          Danaipour argues that it would require a very good reason\n\nfor the district court, nonetheless, to conclude there was sexual\n\nabuse and that no such reason exists here.   Danaipour argues that\n\nof the five experts who testified, only one, Dr. Pierre, was truly\n\nindependent, and only two, Dr. Pierre and Dr. Luxenberg, actually\n\nmet with and interviewed the children.3\n\n          We reject Danaipour's first argument that once the court-\n\nappointed expert said \"the results of the evaluation as to C.D.\n\nwould have to be considered inconclusive\" the court could not\n\nplausibly conclude that C.D. had been sexually abused.      First,\n\nthere was no inconsistency between Dr. Pierre's report and the\n\ncourt's conclusions.   We quote at greater length from Dr. Pierre's\n\nreport:\n\n\n\n     3\n          Danaipour argues that the district court \"inexplicably\"\ngave great weight to the testimony of Dr. Carole Jenny, who never\nsaw the children and who, contrary to the district court finding,\nconcluded that the older child may have been abused as well as the\nyounger one. Contrary to Danaipour's argument on appeal, the court\ndid not rely for its sexual abuse findings on Dr. Jenny's\nconclusions that C.D. had been sexually abused. This assertion is\nflatly contradicted by the district court's opinion. While the\ndistrict court agreed with Dr. Jenny's ultimate conclusion that\nC.D. had been sexually abused, it clearly stated that it only\nrelied on her testimony concerning the indicia of credibility with\nrespect to sexual abuse by children.\n\n                               -20-\n\fWith regard to C.D. the case is less clear.\nThe trail is cold for her collateral contacts\nwhich are vital in making determinations in\ncases with very young children. . . .\n\nDuring this evaluation C. did speak.       She\ninitially denied everything.     Upon further\nquestioning she stated that maybe something\nhappened once but never again.       She then\nbecame very distressed stating that she was\nworried that she would get her Baba into\ntrouble, her Momma into trouble and herself\ninto trouble.   It is common for children to\nfear hurting a parent with a disclosure. It\nis also common for a child to state abuse and\nthen recant. This cannot be taken as a\nnondisclosure, but one is careful to not to\nconsider it a full disclosure.     C. was not\nclear enough during this evaluation for this\nexaminer to feel completely comfortable that\nthe information given in this disclosure\ninterview was complete and solid enough to\nconstitute a full disclosure.      It is very\npossible that something has happened, however,\nbased on the contents of this disclosure\nevaluation it is difficult to determine the\nexact nature of what that is. Therefore the\nresults of this disclosure evaluation would\nhave to be considered inconclusive.\n\nHowever, it is clear to this examiner that\nsomething has happened to C. She stated that\nher Baba had done bad things to her and she\nwasn't going to tell me what they were. Based\non what C. has said to her therapist she has\nhad experiences with the father that the\ntherapist considers abusive. Dr. Luxenberg's\nnotes are compelling. C's memory of events is\nclearly hampered by the fact that the\noccurrences would have happened approximately\n1 l/2 years ago which is almost half of her\nlife ago. Not to mention that she has been in\na therapeutic relationship focused on helping\nher heal.     Old memories naturally become\nintegrated into new ones.    In addition, C's\nmemories are most assuredly state dependent at\nsuch an early age and would naturally be more\nlikely   accessed    through   a   therapeutic\n\n               -21-\n\f            relationship than by direct questioning such\n            as was done in the disclosure evaluation.\n\n            My recommendation is that the evaluation end\n            of this be terminated at this time. I do not\n            believe another sexual abuse evaluation will\n            come any closer to the truth than this one\n            did. I would recommend that the therapeutic\n            relationship continue and that information\n            from that source continue to be given\n            credibility.\n\n            Dr. Pierre also testified that from her own observations\n\nof C.D. it was clear something had happened to C.D. but she could\n\nnot say with any degree of certainty what happened.             She thought it\n\nnot useful to do a further disclosure evaluation because the data\n\nwas old and that Dr. Luxenberg had better data.                  And when Dr.\n\nPierre considered Dr. Luxenberg's notes, she found the notes\n\nsuggest that \"something more compelling has happened and more\n\nworrisome,\"    and   that   Dr.   Luxenberg's    data     should   be   treated\n\ncredibly.     Dr. Pierre's opinion to a reasonable degree of medical\n\ncertainty was that something had happened between C.D. and her\n\nfather, and that something bad and something sexual had happened.\n\n            The court relied on the disclosures made by C.D. to both\n\nDr.   Luxenberg   and   Dr.    Pierre,   as   well   as   the   corroborative\n\ndisclosures made by C.D. to her family members and the play\n\nactivity of the child.        The court stated: \"The disclosures to Dr.\n\nLuxenberg are relatively unambiguous in demonstrating that C.D.\n\nassociated the word 'hammer' with the arm movements involved in\n\nmasturbation.     Her alternate references to 'hammering' and being\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fherself 'hammered' satisfy me that there were multiple occasions\n\ninvolving her participation in masturbation of Danaipour and his\n\nmasturbation of her.\" Further, the court found that the disclosure\n\nmade by C.D. to Dr. Pierre was corroborative of those made to Dr.\n\nLuxenberg, and supported the finding of sexual abuse.                Moreover,\n\nthese    statements   were    consistent    with   those     testified   to   by\n\nMcLarey, Morin, and the children's grandmother.\n\n            In interpreting the play activity of C.D. the district\n\ncourt also considered the interpretation of Dr. Munson, Danaipour's\n\nexpert, that the play be interpreted as only expressing themes from\n\nan animation series.     The court held that the play was more than a\n\nsimple    re-enactment   of    the   series.       Rather,    C.D.   used     the\n\ncharacters and themes of the series to express and disclose the\n\nabuse and her reactions to it.        The court considered and rejected\n\nthe possibility of cultural distortion. The court found that while\n\nC.D.'s statements and activities were arguably ambiguous, the most\n\nlogical interpretation was that C.D. had been sexually abused.                 In\n\nfact, the court accepted Dr. Munson's methodology of testing of\n\ncontrary hypotheses and found \"no other hypothesis as compelling as\n\nthat C.D. was sexually abused by her father.\"                The finding that\n\nC.D. was sexually abused by her father was supported by the\n\nevidence.\n\nB.   Challenge to the Finding that Return of C.D. and A.D. to Sweden\n\nPosed A Grave Risk of Psychological Harm\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f             1. Role of Danaipour's Acknowledgment of Responsibility.\n\n             As a subsidiary finding in support of its grave risk\n\nconclusion,    the    district   court   commented      that    an   \"additional\n\nimpediment to return\" was the father's refusal to acknowledge that\n\nC.D. had any difficulties.\n\n             The court's comment was itself based on Dr. Pierre's\n\nreport, which said that a first step in reducing harm would be\n\n\"[Danaipour] offering [C.D.] an apology during his first contact\n\nwith her.     This apology does not have be one admitting guilt but\n\nrather one that acknowledges there have been some things that have\n\nhappened that have caused her great worry and for that he is\n\nsorry.\"     The report was issued on July 31, 2002 to the court and\n\ncounsel. Danaipour testified on August 2, 2002. We have carefully\n\nread his testimony and it contains no indication of any willingness\n\non his part to make the acknowledgment Dr. Pierre recommended.\n\nRather, Danaipour testified that he had not looked at the report.\n\nHe continued to insist, in the face of Dr. Pierre's report, that\n\nC.D.'s statements      were   the   result      of   C.D.   being    coached   and\n\nprompted by her mother. The district court also invited commentary\n\nfrom the parties on Dr. Pierre's report and received none.\n\n             Danaipour's argument is that he was precluded by a\n\nvisitation    order    from   speaking     to    C.D.   and    his   motion    for\n\nvisitation rights had not been resolved, so the court's criticism\n\nis unfair.    The argument mixes tenses.         Dr. Pierre's report refers\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fto what Danaipour should do at any future point of first contact\n\nwith C.D.    On the witness stand he had the opportunity to express\n\na willingness to take that step, a step which the independent\n\nexpert characterized     as   a   first    step   toward   healing   for   his\n\ndaughter.    He chose instead to insist his daughter's statements\n\nwere the result of programming by their mother. The court properly\n\nconsidered this in its evaluation.\n\n            2.   Article 13(b) Requirements.\n\n            The district court, consistent with the second aspect of\n\nthe mandate, made explicit findings that the return of C.D. and\n\nA.D. to Sweden would cause each child a grave risk of psychological\n\nharm and create an intolerable situation.            Danaipour's argument\n\nthat the court did not make such findings is simply not supported\n\nby the record.\n\n            Danaipour makes another argument that the evidence did\n\nnot support any finding of grave risk, particularly in light of the\n\nability of the Swedish courts to rule on custody and visitation\n\nrights of children and Sweden's mechanisms to evaluate whether\n\nsexual abuse has occurred. Danaipour criticizes the district court\n\nfor not directly addressing the issue of protections available in\n\nSweden.\n\n            The court credited and primarily relied on the testimony\n\nof two experts, Dr. van der Kolk and Dr. Luxenberg, on the effects\n\nof a return on the two children.          The evidence from Dr. Luxenberg\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fwas particularly compelling; Dr. van der Kolk's conclusions were\n\nconsistent.\n\n           Two days after the initial district judge ordered the\n\nreturn of the children to Sweden, Dr. Luxenberg met with C.D.    At\n\nthat session, C.D. spontaneously raised the topic of return, saying\n\nher mother had told them they had to go to Sweden.    C.D. said she\n\ndid not want to go to Sweden and did not want to see her father.\n\nThrough her play she raised the issue that she had told the truth\n\nand that her father had not told the truth and had done bad things\n\nto her.    C.D. became extremely anxious, screaming and shaking and\n\nrepeating, \"No, no, no, no!\"   She later expressed fear that if she\n\nsaw her father again, \"he'll just keep doing it, and I don't want\n\nhim to.\"    She equated a return to Sweden with seeing her father.\n\nIn contrast to the ambivalent feelings C.D. expressed about her\n\nfather, C.D. expressed no ambivalence about her desire not to\n\nreturn to him or to Sweden.    C.D. made the point repeatedly.\n\n            Dr. Luxenberg also had therapeutic sessions with A.D. It\n\nwas striking to her that A.D. never expressed any desire to return\n\nto   Sweden or to see her father.   A.D. told Dr. Luxenberg that she\n\nthought her father really did \"do it\" [to C.D.] and she hoped he\n\nwould not do it again.      She equated going back to Sweden with\n\nsomething bad happening to her, and expressed anxiety that if she\n\nwere returned to Sweden she would be separated from her mother (as\n\nhad happened during their last return to Sweden) and that her\n\n\n                                -26-\n\ffather would \"do those things that C.D. said that he did\" again.\n\n          Dr. Luxenberg concluded:\n\n          It is imperative that C.D. and A.D. continue\n          in therapy at this time. Both have been able\n          to develop a very strong and trusting\n          therapeutic relationship, and are able to talk\n          about difficult issues in a way they were\n          unable to do at the beginning of therapy.\n          Without suggesting that the girls would be\n          unable to re-form a similar therapeutic\n          relationship   elsewhere,   disrupting   their\n          therapy at this critical time in their\n          development may cause the girls to become\n          reluctant to discuss their experiences and\n          their emotional responses to them, which is\n          vital to their psychological recovery. Both\n          are still clearly worried about the potential\n          consequences of being honest and open about\n          their feelings and experiences, and to have\n          therapy prematurely terminated would reinforce\n          the sense that talking is, indeed, dangerous.\n\n          Dr. van der Kolk did not meet C.D. but did review the\n\nrecord and observed some testimony at trial.   Dr. van der Kolk drew\n\nconclusions which were entirely consistent.4\n\n\n     4\n          We summarize the conclusions in his testimony:\n1. For A.D. and C.D., being sent back to Sweden will mean that\nthey are not believed and that telling the truth as they see it\nwill have dire consequences.    They will believe they are being\npunished for their disclosures.\n2. C.D.'s psychological health is at a critical juncture at this\nparticular point in time, and returning her to Sweden now will\nlikely have devastating and irreversible consequences. She needs\nto feel safe.\n3. If the girls perceive that they are not believed, or if actions\nare taken that indicate that disclosing the truth of their\nexperiences will lead to retaliation or separation from the people\nthey feel safe with, the natural consequence would be that these\ngirls will grow up believing that telling people the truth has dire\nramifications, and that the rules that are applied to them do not\napply to others.\n4.   If returned, C.D. and A.D. were likely to have similar\n\n                               -27-\n\f          The district court concluded that psychological harm to\n\nC.D. and A.D. would be a necessary consequence of a return to\n\nSweden, regardless of any possible conditions or undertakings\n\nimposed. These harms were beyond the power of any court to prevent\n\nor remedy if the children were returned.     Danaipour's arguments\n\nabout the authority of the Swedish courts are, as a result, beside\n\nthe point.   Nothing in Article 13(b) required further inquiry in\n\nthese circumstances, as this case involves \"a situation in which\n\nthe [Swedish] authorities, through no fault of their own, may not\n\nbe able to give the children adequate protection.\"      Blondin v.\n\nDubois, 238 F.3d 153, 163 n.11 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n          Danaipour cites to our holding in Danaipour I stating the\n\nstandard for qualifying for the Article 13(b) exception, for the\n\nproposition that a district court cannot properly find that an\n\nArticle 13(b) exception exists unless it examines the remedies\n\n\nresponses in Sweden and react with \"fright or freeze\" reactions to\nthe sound of the Swedish language, to familiar sights, sounds,\nsmells and temperatures.\n5. Return would disrupt the relationship with Dr. Luxenberg. The\nrelationship A.D. and C.D. have developed with Dr. Luxenberg will\nultimately serve as a very significant stepping stone in the\nchildren's healing process and likely impact each child's\nindividual ability to reestablish her personal integrity and self-\nconfidence.\n6. Both C.D. and A.D. have expressed their opposition to returning\nto Sweden and their anxiety regarding such a move.      The girls'\nexperience in Sweden has taught them that if they are sent back\nthey will be reunited with their father - - in spite of their\nmemories of his abuse, their disclosures about the abuse, and their\nopposition to such a move. The child will understand that the only\nreason to go to Sweden is to be with their father.\n\n\n                               -28-\n\favailable in the country of habitual residence.5         Our holding in\n\nDanaipour I does not stand for the proposition that every Article\n\n13(b) analysis   requires   two   such    distinct   prongs.   In   fact,\n\nDanaipour I specifically identified the limited role undertakings\n\nmay play in certain situations.     See    Danaipour I, 286 F.3d at 21.\n\nDanaipour I also noted the great weight afforded to the State\n\nDepartment policy concerning undertakings in a situation involving\n\nchild abuse:\n\n          If the requested state court is presented with\n          unequivocal evidence that return would cause\n          the child a \"grave risk\" of physical or\n          psychological harm, however, then it would\n          seem less appropriate for the court to enter\n          extensive undertakings than to deny the return\n          request.     The development of extensive\n          undertakings in such a context would embroil\n          the court in the merits of the underlying\n          custody issues and would tend to dilute the\n          force of the Article 13(b) exception.\n\n\nId. at 25 (quoting Department of State Comment on Undertakings).\n\nThe district court properly followed Danaipour I's mandate; its\n\nfinding of the existence of sexual abuse and that the return of the\n\nchildren to Sweden would result in a grave risk of psychological\n\nharm was adequate to satisfy the Article 13(b) exception, and no\n\n\n     5\n          Danaipour also relies heavily on a footnote in Blondin\nfor the proposition that assessing the capacity of the courts of\nthe country of habitual residence is a prerequisite to an Article\n13(b) exception. 238 F.3d at 163 n.11. We do not read Blondin to\nrequire the court to make findings about the institutional capacity\nof the home country in all cases. To the extent that Blondin does\nstand for such a proposition, we disagree that Article 13(b)\nrequires such findings in all cases.\n\n                                  -29-\n\ffurther inquiry into remedies available to the Swedish courts was\n\nrequired.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n            For these reasons we affirm the judgment of the district\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\n\n                                -30-\n\f",

A.D. was then seven and C.D. was almost three years old.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour filed suit in the United States in state court; the case was removed to federal court, and he sought to have the children returned pursuant to the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 11601, and the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, opened for signature Oct. 25, 1980, T.I.A.S. No. 11,670, 1343 U.N.T.S. 89. McLarey had filed her own Hague Convention action earlier to prevent return; she responded to Danaipour's action by claiming the extremely narrow protection available under Article 13(b) of the Convention. Article 13(b) permits the court to decline to return children to the country of habitual residence where return would cause grave risk of physical or psychological harm to them or otherwise place them in an intolerable situation. Specifically, the mother asserted that the father had sexually abused both children and returning the two children to Sweden would cause them grave risk of harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal district court declined to resolve the question of whether either of the girls had been sexually abused, preferring that the children be returned so the courts of Sweden could resolve that issue. <i>See Danaipour v. McLarey,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d 311, 314 (D.Mass.2002). This court reversed. <i>See Danaipour v. McLarey,</i> 286 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2002) (<i>\"Danaipour I\"</i>). We remanded the case with instructions that the sexual abuse question must be decided (as part of the court's obligation to consider the grave risk issue), and then that the question of grave risk be addressed in light of this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court found, after trial, by clear and convincing evidence that the younger child, C.D., had been sexually abused by her father but that the older daughter, A.D., had not been. The court also found that there would be a grave risk of harm to and an intolerable situation for both children if the court ordered them returned to Sweden, where their father continues to live. The father now appeals from that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The father's appeal argues that the judgment is based on the following errors. Danaipour first contends the sexual abuse determination falters for evidentiary insufficiency, based in part on inadmissibility of certain evidence. He argues that the finding of sexual abuse was clearly erroneous because the court-appointed expert, Dr. Pierre, made no such finding and the district court relied on the testimony of expert witnesses who had never met the child. This argument is supplemented by the argument that the court abused its discretion in admitting multiple hearsay evidence under Rules 803(4) and 807. Recognizing the dangers inherent in partisan reports of a child's statements to an examining or consulting expert (for example, by a mother accusing a father of sexual abuse of a child), we hold there was no abuse of discretion in admission of such evidence here, which was, <i>inter alia,</i> also introduced through direct testimony and corroborated by statements made directly to the doctors by the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the grave risk finding, Danaipour argues the court erred in considering one item about the father's behavior, and that it failed to comply with this court's mandate and committed reversible error, as a matter of law, in failing to determine whether the courts of Sweden could properly address any issue of grave risk. Danaipour mischaracterizes the district court's findings. The district court complied with this court's mandate and, having answered the question of whether sexual abuse occurred, separately addressed the issue of grave risk of harm to the physical or psychological health of the children. The court's findings that the <i>return</i> of the children to Sweden would cause grave harm to the psychological health of the children was supported by the record. That finding renders immaterial Danaipour's arguments that the courts of Sweden could take ameliorative actions to prevent further harm once the children had been returned. In such circumstances, Article 13(b) does not require separate consideration either of undertakings or of steps which might be taken by the courts of the country of habitual residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court handled this difficult matter on remand in an admirable and sensitive way. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are set out both in the original district court's opinion, <i>Danaipour v. McLarey,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d at 316-23, and in the original case before this court, <i>Danaipour I,</i> 286 F.3d at 5-13. We summarize those facts briefly here. Kristina McLarey, a dual citizen of the United States and Sweden, lived with Iraj Danaipour, a Swedish citizen and Iranian national, in Sweden. The two met in Sweden and had their first child, A.D., there in 1994, shortly after which they were married in Massachusetts. They returned to Sweden and had a second child, C.D., in 1998. The family lived in Sweden, with frequent visits to the United States, where Ms. McLarey's family resides.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The couple's marriage deteriorated, and they jointly filed for divorce in February of 2000. They were eventually awarded joint custody of the children, with McLarey residing at the couple's condominium and Danaipour at his girlfriend's apartment. The two girls alternated between them on a weekly basis. During this time, McLarey noticed vaginal redness and soreness by her younger daughter, C.D., as well as symptoms of anxiety by both girls, such as nightmares, headaches, and stomachaches when they returned from being with their father. McLarey testified that she questioned C.D. about her vaginal soreness, and the child responded \"Baba [the child's name for her father] do like this,\" after which C.D. made a masturbatory motion. McLarey reported this information to a child psychologist, who issued a report of suspected child abuse and referred the case to Swedish social services, who then contacted the police to investigate. In November 2000, the police briefly interviewed the girls (A.D. was questioned for less than an hour, and C.D. was questioned for five minutes), who were nonresponsive to their inquiries. The Swedish police terminated their investigation in January 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 2001, McLarey requested a separate sexual abuse evaluation by the Swedish child and youth psychiatric unit. The unit would not conduct such an investigation absent Danaipour's consent, which he refused to give. During this time, C.D. made additional disclosures to Ms. McLarey, her grandmother, and to Ms. McLarey's boyfriend that raised further concerns that the child had been sexually abused by her father. After videotaping one such disclosure by C.D., in March 2001 McLarey sought a Swedish court order for a full sexual abuse investigation. The court denied the order because Danaipour opposed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McLarey left Sweden with her children and came to Massachusetts. She did so without Danaipour's knowledge or consent and in violation of a Swedish court custody order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after arriving in Massachusetts, McLarey brought both her children to a child psychologist, Dr. Toni Luxenberg, for treatment for symptoms which McLarey thought resulted from sexual abuse. Dr. Luxenberg's role was not to make an evaluation of whether sexual abuse had taken place, but to treat the children. McLarey informed Dr. Luxenberg of the disclosures C.D. had made to her and other family members, and Dr. Luxenberg in addition spoke to the children's grandmother. Thereupon, Dr. Luxenberg began treating the girls, meeting them once a week together or separately for approximately one hour. After C.D. developed a comfort level with Dr. Luxenberg, the child began to make significant disclosures to Dr. Luxenberg, above and beyond any she had made to her family members. Such disclosures led Dr. Luxenberg to conclude that C.D. had in fact been sexually abused by Danaipour. Dr. Luxenberg has continued to treat C.D. and A.D. throughout this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sexual Abuse Finding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original district order court found that a forensic examination would be needed to determine the sexual abuse question and that the Swedish courts, acting under conditions set for return of the children, could determine what to do after a forensic examination was done in Sweden. We disagreed. In <i>Danaipour I,</i> 286 F.3d at 26, we noted that on remand, if necessary, the district court should order further evaluations, but we did not mandate any particular method by which the district court should address the two questions of whether there had been sexual abuse and whether there was grave risk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court decided that a new trial should be held to determine whether sexual abuse occurred. The court also decided that an independent expert evaluation should be attempted as to whether either girl had been sexually abused, mindful that this belated evaluation might prove to be inconclusive and of the potential trauma to the children. The court appointed an independent child psychologist, Dr. Claudette Pierre, to perform a sexual abuse evaluation of the girls. Dr. Pierre spoke with both girls, the parents, reviewed the file, and filed a report. Dr. Pierre concluded that A.D. had not been abused. Dr. Pierre also found that C.D. had in fact been traumatized by some events, most likely sexual in nature, but that Dr. Pierre could not conclusively determine whether C.D.'s father had in fact sexually abused her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agreed that the children should not testify. In conducting the trial, the court elected to have the parties submit affidavits for each of their witnesses as direct testimony, and cross examination was done of these witnesses on the stand. The parties had the opportunity to object to evidence in the affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour made a general unspecified objection to hearsay evidence in the affidavits of McLarey's witnesses. The court then asked for the objection to be stated more specifically in writing. The court said it would allow the testimony and cross examination, but would consider the written objection and whether to credit the evidence when deciding the merits of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour then filed a motion objecting only to any \"double hearsay,\" specifically referring to statements in the psychologists' reports by family members recounting to the doctors what the children had said to them. Petitioner conceded that statements made by the children to the psychologists were admissible under Fed. R.Evid. &#167; 803(4), and conceded that statements made by the children to family members were \"arguably\" admissible under Fed.R.Evid. &#167; 807 (and in any event did not challenge these statements, and does not do so here).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">After the trial, the district court found:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">by clear and convincing evidence that sexual abuse of C.D., who was slightly younger than two and one-half years old at the time, involving more than one occasion of masturbation by and of Danaipour in the presence of and involving C.D. took place during this period of alternating supervision in the fall of 2000. I find further that this abuse stopped once a police investigation began at the end of November 2000. At least one act of abuse involved C.D. touching her father's erect penis and led to her touching his ejaculant. At least one other such act involved digital masturbation of C.D. by Danaipour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge found the disclosures of the children to McLarey, her then-boyfriend Morin, and the children's grandmother to be credible. In doing so, however, the court noted that it found pertinent Danaipour's expert's cautionary observations that a custodial parent in the context of a divorce may misinterpret behavior and symptoms of the child upon returning from a visit with the non-custodial parent. The court noted that it was \"especially concerned that the reports of commentary by the children may have been overstated or manipulated.\" With this concern in mind, the court found these statements, given by the witnesses through their affidavits and subject to cross examination, to be credible. The court also used the indicia of credibility for statements by sexually abused children submitted to the court by McLarey's expert, Dr. Carole Jenny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also found \"highly persuasive\" the disclosures made by C.D. to Dr. Luxenberg and Dr. Pierre. The court found that C.D.'s multiple disclosures to Dr. Luxenberg unambiguously demonstrated that C.D. associated the word \"hammer\" with masturbation, and that these references demonstrate that there were multiple occasions of her participating in masturbation of Danaipour and his masturbation of her. The court expressly considered the concern of Danaipour's expert that these disclosures were tainted by inquiries by McLarey or Dr. Luxenberg, and found that C.D.'s recollection was not \"materially tainted or otherwise the product of suggestion.\" The district court found that the characters and themes developed by C.D. through her play therapy with Dr. Luxenberg were used by her \"as a means to express and disclose the abusive circumstances to which she has been exposed, and her reaction to those circumstances.\" We note only that our discussion does not repeat all the evidence on which the conclusion was based. Further, despite the fact that Dr. Pierre's ultimate conclusion was inconclusive as to whether C.D. had been sexually abused by her father, the court found that the corroborative disclosure from C.D. obtained by Dr. Pierre supported its finding, based on all the evidence, that C.D. had been abused by her father.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Grave Risk Finding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found by clear and convincing evidence that C.D. was sexually abused by her father, the court then went on to conclude, also by clear and convincing evidence, that returning the children to Sweden would create a grave risk of psychological harm and an intolerable situation for them. The court credited the observations of both Dr. van der Kolk and Dr. Luxenberg that returning C.D., who has been sexually abused, to the place of trauma and location of her victimization can have profoundly disturbing effects on the child. The court also credited the conclusions of Dr. van der Kolk, one of McLarey's expert witnesses, that \"it is important to the psychological well being of C.D. that what she has disclosed be believed and not appear to lead as a consequence to her return to the place of trauma.\" Thus, the court found that her return would create a grave risk of \"fractur[ing] irremediably her sense of safety, justice and the value of truth telling,\" a situation the court found would be intolerable for her. The court found a similar, though derivative, effect would occur to A.D. This, coupled with the fact that \"[t]he parties have proceeded on the assumption that the children should not be separated and that any order under the Hague Convention would apply to both,\" led the court to deny Danaipour's request to have the children sent back to Sweden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Challenge to the Finding of Sexual Abuse of C.D.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The party opposing return of the children, here, the mother, has the burden of proving the ultimate Article 13(b) exception issue by clear and convincing evidence. <i>Danaipour I,</i> 286 F.3d at 13. Subsidiary facts need be proven only by a preponderance of the evidence. We review factual determination under the Hague Convention for clear error. <i>Whallon v.

Indeed, this was a full trial. Whatever our doubts, nonetheless, Danaipour has not directly raised on appeal the point of the applicability of the Federal Rules of Evidence; at most he argues that the mother's family's recounting of the children's statements to physicians constituted inadmissible double hearsay and was inherently unreliable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Objections to Portions of Doctor's Reports Admitted Under Fed.

Child therapists routinely, as part of their diagnosis or treatment, obtain the type of statements made by the patients here, A.D. and C.D., about the identity of the perpetrator of the abuse. <i>Morgan v. Foretich,</i> 846 F.2d 941, 948-50 (4th Cir.1988). Statements by young children amounting to disclosure to treating therapists that they have been abused by a member of their family are usually reasonably pertinent to treatment of the child. <i>United States v. Yazzie,</i> 59 F.3d 807, 812-13 (9th Cir.1995)(\"[S]exual abuse involves more than physical injury; the physician must be attentive to treating the victim's emotional and psychological injuries, the exact nature and identity of which depend upon the identity of the abuser.\") (quoting <i>United States v.

The plain language of the rule does not require the statements to be made by the patients, or even to a physician. <i>Yazzie,</i> 59 F.3d at 813; <i>Davignon v.

In situations in which there are no incentives for parental bias, parental reports to doctors of statements by their children are routinely admitted under Rule 803(4). <i>See</i> 4 Christopher B. Mueller and Laird C. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence 465 (2d ed. 1994) (\"[The 803(4)] exception does not require that the speaker be the patient or that the listener be the doctor.

Saltzburg et al., Federal Rules of Evidence Manual &#167; 803.02[5][d] (8th ed. 2002) (\"[S]tatements by bystanders, family members, and others, made for the purposes of treating an injured person and pertinent to that treatment, have often been admitted under Rule 803(4).\"). One example would be a parental report of a five year old's statement explaining where and how she scraped her knee badly. In such situations, the incentives are strong for the parent to recount the child's statement accurately and honestly. The Rule recognizes the reality of the situation. The Advisory Committee's Notes contemplate that statements made to members of the family may be within the exception. Fed.

Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 803.06[01] (Joseph M. McLaughlin ed., 4th ed.2004). In sexual abuse cases, especially where one parent accuses the other of abuse, the motives and incentives of the reporting parent may be mixed or, indeed, may <i>not</i> be to tell the truth. <i>Yazzie,</i> 59 F.3d at 813. It may be clear from the circumstance or context that the parental report of a child's statement of abuse to a doctor is made for purposes other than for diagnosis or treatment. <i>See United States v. Balfany,</i> 965 F.2d 575 (8th Cir.1992) (considering that theory).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a situation such as this where there are reasons to look skeptically on the motives of the declarant, the context in which the statements are made is relevant to whether they bear adequate indicia of trustworthiness. <i>Yazzie,</i> 59 F.3d at 813. McLarey brought her children to Dr. Luxenberg, not for the purposes of determining whether the children had been sexually abused, but for treating their symptoms as manifested by their disturbed behavior. Thus, the statements made by McLarey to Dr. Luxenberg were for the purposes of treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the cases cited by Danaipour in attempting to challenge the district court's admission of the objected-to statements are criminal cases, in which the evidence was subjected to Confrontation Clause analysis. The Supreme Court has stated that the Confrontation Clause creates a higher bar for the admission of hearsay evidence than do the Federal Rules alone. <i>Idaho v. Wright</i> 497 U.S. 805, 814, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990) (\"The Confrontation Clause . . . bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\"). This is a civil case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end Danaipour's claim that the district court committed error by admitting and considering for the truth of the matter asserted the parental and family statements concerning C.D. and A.D.'s statements in the reports of Dr. Luxenberg fails, for several reasons. First, the statements made by McLarey, her mother, and Morin in the doctor's reports were tested when each person took the witness stand, testified directly to the same statements by A.D. and C.D., and was subjected to cross examination about the hearsay to the doctors. There were no discrepancies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Dr. Luxenberg testified that the children made the same statements (as reported by McLarey, her mother, and Morin) directly to her during their therapy, corroborating the statements reported to her by the mother and her family. This is true for each of the statements to which objection was made. Indeed, C.D. made statements to Dr. Luxenberg about her father's actions which went beyond what she told her mother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour's real objection is not that reports containing McLarey's and others' recounting of the children's statements were inadmissible double hearsay but rather that the children's statements were inherently unreliable, being a product of the mother's coaching of the children. The district court carefully considered the fact that statements by a young child, even if accurately recounted by an adult, may not reflect the truth. A child may say something in order to get attention. Further, a story once told may, for several reasons, be subject to repetition and elaboration. The court also carefully considered the concern expressed by the husband's expert that repeated inquiry on the topic would taint C.D.'s recollections; the court found this had not happened. The court was very attentive to the possibility of coaching and found that improbable, and that the statements did not bear the indicia of a suggested script. In evaluating the reliability of the reported statements by the two children, the court utilized the indicia of credibility in sexual abuse cases referenced both in the literature and by Dr. Carole Jenny, a recognized expert.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> The court was well within its discretion in considering the truth of the statements by C.D. and A.D. as reported by McLarey and the others to Dr. Luxenberg.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Consistency with Dr. Pierre's findings.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour attacks the merits of the sexual abuse finding. He argues that the finding was impermissibly contrary to the conclusion of the one independent expert, Dr. Pierre, who concluded: \"[i]t is very possible that something has happened, however, based on the contents of this disclosure evaluation it is difficult to determine the exact nature of what that is. Therefore the results of this evaluation [as to C.D.] would have to be considered inconclusive.\" Expanding on this, at trial, Dr. Pierre testified she was certain something happened to C.D. that was \"traumatic\" and \"sexual\" but said she \"did not know specifically what that [was].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour argues that it would require a very good reason for the district court, nonetheless, to conclude there was sexual abuse and that no such reason exists here. Danaipour argues that of the five experts who testified, only one, Dr. Pierre, was truly independent, and only two, Dr. Pierre and Dr. Luxenberg, actually met with and interviewed the children.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Danaipour's first argument that once the court-appointed expert said \"the results of the evaluation as to C.D. would have to be considered inconclusive\" the court could not plausibly conclude that C.D. had been sexually abused. First, there was no inconsistency between Dr. Pierre's report and the court's conclusions. We quote at greater length from Dr. Pierre's report:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to C.D. the case is less clear. The trail is cold for her collateral contacts which are vital in making determinations in cases with very young children. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this evaluation C. did speak. She initially denied everything. Upon further questioning she stated that maybe something happened once but never again. She then became very distressed stating that she was worried that she would get her Baba into trouble, her Momma into trouble and herself into trouble. It is common for children to fear hurting a parent with a disclosure. It is also common for a child to state abuse and then recant. This cannot be taken as a nondisclosure, but one is careful to not to consider it a full disclosure. C. was not clear enough during this evaluation for this examiner to feel completely comfortable that the information given in this disclosure interview was complete and solid enough to constitute a full disclosure. It is very possible that something has happened, however, based on the contents of this disclosure evaluation it is difficult to determine the exact nature of what that is. Therefore the results of this disclosure evaluation would have to be considered inconclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, it is clear to this examiner that something has happened to C. She stated that her Baba had done bad things to her and she wasn't going to tell me what they were. Based on what C. has said to her therapist she has had experiences with the father that the therapist considers abusive. Dr. Luxenberg's notes are compelling. C's memory of events is clearly hampered by the fact that the occurrences would have happened approximately 1 1/2 years ago which is almost half of her life ago. Not to mention that she has been in a therapeutic relationship focused on helping her heal. Old memories naturally become integrated into new ones. In addition, C's memories are most assuredly state dependent at such an early age and would naturally be more likely accessed through a therapeutic relationship than by direct questioning such as was done in the disclosure evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My recommendation is that the evaluation end of this be terminated at this time. I do not believe another sexual abuse evaluation will come any closer to the truth than this one did. I would recommend that the therapeutic relationship continue and that information from that source continue to be given credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Pierre also testified that from her own observations of C.D. it was clear something had happened to C.D. but she could not say with any degree of certainty what happened. She thought it not useful to do a further disclosure evaluation because the data was old and that Dr. Luxenberg had better data. And when Dr. Pierre considered Dr. Luxenberg's notes, she found the notes suggest that \"something more compelling has happened and more worrisome,\" and that Dr. Luxenberg's data should be treated credibly. Dr. Pierre's opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty was that something had happened between C.D. and her father, and that something bad and something sexual had happened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court relied on the disclosures made by C.D. to both Dr. Luxenberg and Dr. Pierre, as well as the corroborative disclosures made by C.D. to her family members and the play activity of the child. The court stated: \"The disclosures to Dr. Luxenberg are relatively unambiguous in demonstrating that C.D. associated the word `hammer' with the arm movements involved in masturbation. Her alternate references to `hammering' and being herself `hammered' satisfy me that there were multiple occasions involving her participation in masturbation of Danaipour and his masturbation of her.\" Further, the court found that the disclosure made by C.D. to Dr. Pierre was corroborative of those made to Dr. Luxenberg, and supported the finding of sexual abuse. Moreover, these statements were consistent with those testified to by McLarey, Morin, and the children's grandmother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting the play activity of C.D. the district court also considered the interpretation of Dr. Munson, Danaipour's expert, that the play be interpreted as only expressing themes from an animation series. The court held that the play was more than a simple re-enactment of the series. Rather, C.D. used the characters and themes of the series to express and disclose the abuse and her reactions to it. The court considered and rejected the possibility of cultural distortion. The court found that while C.D.'s statements and activities were arguably ambiguous, the most logical interpretation was that C.D. had been sexually abused. In fact, the court accepted Dr. Munson's methodology of testing of contrary hypotheses and found \"no other hypothesis as compelling as that C.D. was sexually abused by her father.\" The finding that C.D. was sexually abused by her father was supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Challenge to the Finding that Return of C.D. and A.D. to Sweden Posed A Grave Risk of Psychological Harm</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Role of Danaipour's Acknowledgment of Responsibility.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a subsidiary finding in support of its grave risk conclusion, the district court commented that an \"additional impediment to return\" was the father's refusal to acknowledge that C.D. had any difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's comment was itself based on Dr. Pierre's report, which said that a first step in reducing harm would be \"[Danaipour] offering [C.D.] an apology during his first contact with her. This apology does not have be one admitting guilt but rather one that acknowledges there have been some things that have happened that have caused her great worry and for that he is sorry.\" The report was issued on July 31, 2002 to the court and counsel. Danaipour testified on August 2, 2002. We have carefully read his testimony and it contains no indication of any willingness on his part to make the acknowledgment Dr. Pierre recommended. Rather, Danaipour testified that he had not looked at the report. He continued to insist, in the face of Dr. Pierre's report, that C.D.'s statements were the result of C.D. being coached and prompted by her mother. The district court also invited commentary from the parties on Dr. Pierre's report and received none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour's argument is that he was precluded by a visitation order from speaking to C.D. and his motion for visitation rights had not been resolved, so the court's criticism is unfair. The argument mixes tenses. Dr. Pierre's report refers to what Danaipour should do at any future point of first contact with C.D. On the witness stand he had the opportunity to express a willingness to take that step, a step which the independent expert characterized as a first step toward healing for his daughter. He chose instead to insist his daughter's statements were the result of programming by their mother. The court properly considered this in its evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Article 13(b) Requirements.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, consistent with the second aspect of the mandate, made explicit findings that the return of C.D. and A.D. to Sweden would cause each child a grave risk of psychological harm and create an intolerable situation. Danaipour's argument that the court did not make such findings is simply not supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour makes another argument that the evidence did not support any finding of grave risk, particularly in light of the ability of the Swedish courts to rule on custody and visitation rights of children and Sweden's mechanisms to evaluate whether sexual abuse has occurred. Danaipour criticizes the district court for not directly addressing the issue of protections available in Sweden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court credited and primarily relied on the testimony of two experts, Dr. van der Kolk and Dr. Luxenberg, on the effects of a return on the two children. The evidence from Dr. Luxenberg was particularly compelling; Dr. van der Kolk's conclusions were consistent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two days after the initial district judge ordered the return of the children to Sweden, Dr. Luxenberg met with C.D. At that session, C.D. spontaneously raised the topic of return, saying her mother had told them they had to go to Sweden. C.D. said she did not want to go to Sweden and did not want to see her father. Through her play she raised the issue that she had told the truth and that her father had not told the truth and had done bad things to her. C.D. became extremely anxious, screaming and shaking and repeating, \"No, no, no, no!\" She later expressed fear that if she saw her father again, \"he'll just keep doing it, and I don't want him to.\" She equated a return to Sweden with seeing her father. In contrast to the ambivalent feelings C.D. expressed about her father, C.D. expressed no ambivalence about her desire not to return to him or to Sweden. C.D. made the point repeatedly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Luxenberg also had therapeutic sessions with A.D. It was striking to her that A.D. never expressed any desire to return to Sweden or to see her father. A.D. told Dr. Luxenberg that she thought her father really did \"do it\" [to C.D.] and she hoped he would not do it again. She equated going back to Sweden with something bad happening to her, and expressed anxiety that if she were returned to Sweden she would be separated from her mother (as had happened during their last return to Sweden) and that her father would \"do those things that C.D. said that he did\" again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Luxenberg concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is imperative that C.D. and A.D. continue in therapy at this time. Both have been able to develop a very strong and trusting therapeutic relationship, and are able to talk about difficult issues in a way they were unable to do at the beginning of therapy. Without suggesting that the girls would be unable to re-form a similar therapeutic relationship elsewhere, disrupting their therapy at this critical time in their development may cause the girls to become reluctant to discuss their experiences and their emotional responses to them, which is vital to their psychological recovery. Both are still clearly worried about the potential consequences of being honest and open about their feelings and experiences, and to have therapy prematurely terminated would reinforce the sense that talking is, indeed, dangerous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. van der Kolk did not meet C.D. but did review the record and observed some testimony at trial. Dr. van der Kolk drew conclusions which were entirely consistent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that psychological harm to C.D. and A.D. would be a necessary consequence of a return to Sweden, regardless of any possible conditions or undertakings imposed. These harms were beyond the power of any court to prevent or remedy if the children were returned. Danaipour's arguments about the authority of the Swedish courts are, as a result, beside the point. Nothing in Article 13(b) required further inquiry in these circumstances, as this case involves \"a situation in which the [Swedish] authorities, through no fault of their own, may not be able to give the children adequate protection.\" <i>Blondin v. Dubois,</i> 238 F.3d 153, 163 n. 11 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour cites to our holding in <i>Danaipour I</i> stating the standard for qualifying for the Article 13(b) exception, for the proposition that a district court cannot properly find that an Article 13(b) exception exists unless it examines the remedies available in the country of habitual residence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> Our holding in <i>Danaipour I</i> does not stand for the proposition that every Article 13(b) analysis requires two such distinct prongs. In fact, <i>Danaipour I</i> specifically identified the limited role undertakings may play in certain situations. <i>See Danaipour I,</i> 286 F.3d at 21. <i>Danaipour I</i> also noted the great weight afforded to the State Department policy concerning undertakings in a situation involving child abuse:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the requested state court is presented with unequivocal evidence that return would cause the child a \"grave risk\" of physical or psychological harm, however, then it would seem less appropriate for the court to enter extensive undertakings than to deny the return request.

The district court properly followed <i>Danaipour I's</i> mandate; its finding of the existence of sexual abuse and that the return of the children to Sweden would result in a grave risk of psychological harm was adequate to satisfy the Article 13(b) exception, and no further inquiry into remedies available to the Swedish courts was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons we <i>affirm</i> the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We reject the notion, adopted by at least one circuit, that identifications by children who are abuse victims to doctors are only admissible \"where the physician makes clear to the victim that the inquiry into the identity of the abuser is important to diagnosis and treatment, and the victim manifests such an understanding.\"<i>See Olesen v.

There are many ways in which a party wishing to enter into evidence a statement under Rule 803(4) can demonstrate that the statement was made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment; a per se rule requiring a doctor to explain to the victim why a statement naming an abuser is important to diagnosis and treatment is unnecessarily inflexible. <i>See also United States v.

Contrary to Danaipour's argument on appeal, the court did not rely for its sexual abuse findings on Dr. Jenny's conclusions that C.D. had been sexually abused. This assertion is flatly contradicted by the district court's opinion.

A.D. was then seven and C.D. was almost three years old.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour filed suit in the United States in state court; the case was removed to federal court, and he sought to have the children returned pursuant to the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 11601, and the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, opened for signature Oct. 25, 1980, T.I.A.S. No. 11,670, 1343 U.N.T.S. 89. McLarey had filed her own Hague Convention action earlier to prevent return; she responded to Danaipour's action by claiming the extremely narrow protection available under Article 13(b) of the Convention. Article 13(b) permits the court to decline to return children to the country of habitual residence where return would cause grave risk of physical or psychological harm to them or otherwise place them in an intolerable situation. Specifically, the mother asserted that the father had sexually abused both children and returning the two children to Sweden would cause them grave risk of harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal district court declined to resolve the question of whether either of the girls had been sexually abused, preferring that the children be returned so the courts of Sweden could resolve that issue. <i>See Danaipour v. McLarey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2285608\"><a href=\"/opinion/2285608/danaipour-v-mclarey/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span>, 314 (D.Mass.2002). This court reversed. <i>See Danaipour v.

We remanded the case with instructions that the sexual abuse question must be decided (as part of the court's obligation to consider the grave risk issue), and then that the question of grave risk be addressed in light of this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court found, after trial, by clear and convincing evidence that the younger child, C.D., had been sexually abused by her father but that the older daughter, A.D., had not been. The court also found that there would be a grave risk of harm to and an intolerable situation for both children if the court ordered them returned to Sweden, where their father continues to live. The father now appeals from that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The father's appeal argues that the judgment is based on the following errors. Danaipour first contends the sexual abuse determination falters for evidentiary insufficiency, based in part on inadmissibility of certain evidence. He argues that the finding of sexual abuse was clearly erroneous because the court-appointed expert, Dr. Pierre, made no such finding and the district court relied on the testimony of expert witnesses who had never met the child. This argument is supplemented by the argument that the court abused its discretion in admitting multiple hearsay evidence under Rules 803(4) and 807. Recognizing the dangers inherent in partisan reports of a child's statements to an examining or consulting expert (for example, by a mother accusing a father of sexual abuse of a child), we hold there was no abuse of discretion in admission of such evidence here, which was, <i>inter alia,</i> also introduced through direct testimony and corroborated by statements made directly to the doctors by the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the grave risk finding, Danaipour argues the court erred in considering one item about the father's behavior, and that it failed to comply with this court's mandate and committed reversible error, as a matter of law, in failing to determine whether the courts of Sweden could properly address any issue of grave risk. Danaipour mischaracterizes the district court's findings. The district court complied with this court's mandate and, having answered the question of whether sexual abuse occurred, separately addressed the issue of grave risk of harm to the physical or psychological health of the children. The court's findings that the <i>return</i> of the children to Sweden would cause grave harm to the psychological health of the children was supported by the record. That finding renders immaterial Danaipour's arguments that the courts of Sweden could take ameliorative actions to prevent further harm once the children had been returned. In such circumstances, Article 13(b) does not require separate consideration either of undertakings or of steps which might be taken by the courts of the country of habitual residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court handled this difficult matter on remand in an admirable and sensitive way. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are set out both in the original district court's opinion, <i>Danaipour v. McLarey,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d at 316-23, and in the original case before this court, <i>Danaipour I,</i> 286 F.3d at 5-13. We summarize those facts briefly here. Kristina McLarey, a dual citizen of the United States and Sweden, lived with Iraj Danaipour, a Swedish citizen and Iranian national, in Sweden. The two met in Sweden and had their first child, A.D., there in 1994, shortly after which they were married in Massachusetts. They returned to Sweden and had a second child, C.D., in 1998. The family lived in Sweden, with frequent visits to the United States, where Ms. McLarey's family resides.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The couple's marriage deteriorated, and they jointly filed for divorce in February of 2000. They were eventually awarded joint custody of the children, with McLarey residing at the couple's condominium and Danaipour at his girlfriend's apartment. The two girls alternated between them on a weekly basis. During this time, McLarey noticed vaginal redness and soreness by her younger daughter, C.D., as well as symptoms of anxiety by both girls, such as nightmares, headaches, and stomachaches when they returned from being with their father. McLarey testified that she questioned C.D. about her vaginal soreness, and the child responded \"Baba [the child's name for her father] do like this,\" after which C.D. made a masturbatory motion. McLarey reported this information to a child psychologist, who issued a report of suspected child abuse and referred the case to Swedish social services, who then contacted the police to investigate. In November 2000, the police briefly interviewed the girls (A.D. was questioned for less than an hour, and C.D. was questioned for five minutes), who were nonresponsive to their inquiries. The Swedish police terminated their investigation in January 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 2001, McLarey requested a separate sexual abuse evaluation by the Swedish child and youth psychiatric unit. The unit would not conduct such an investigation absent Danaipour's consent, which he refused to give. During this time, C.D. made additional disclosures to Ms. McLarey, her grandmother, and to Ms. McLarey's boyfriend that raised further concerns that the child had been sexually abused by her father. After videotaping one such disclosure by C.D., in March 2001 McLarey sought a Swedish court order for a full sexual abuse investigation. The court denied the order because Danaipour opposed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McLarey left Sweden with her children and came to Massachusetts. She did so without Danaipour's knowledge or consent and in violation of a Swedish court custody order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after arriving in Massachusetts, McLarey brought both her children to a child psychologist, Dr. Toni Luxenberg, for treatment for symptoms which McLarey thought resulted from sexual abuse. Dr. Luxenberg's role was not to make an evaluation of whether sexual abuse had taken place, but to treat the children. McLarey informed Dr. Luxenberg of the disclosures C.D. had made to her and other family members, and Dr. Luxenberg in addition spoke to the children's grandmother. Thereupon, Dr. Luxenberg began treating the girls, meeting them once a week together or separately for approximately one hour. After C.D. developed a comfort level with Dr. Luxenberg, the child began to make significant disclosures to Dr. Luxenberg, above and beyond any she had made to her family members. Such disclosures led Dr. Luxenberg to conclude that C.D. had in fact been sexually abused by Danaipour. Dr. Luxenberg has continued to treat C.D. and A.D. throughout this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Sexual Abuse Finding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original district order court found that a forensic examination would be needed to determine the sexual abuse question and that the Swedish courts, acting under conditions set for return of the children, could determine what to do after a forensic examination was done in Sweden. We disagreed. In <i>Danaipour I,</i> 286 F.3d at 26, we noted that on remand, if necessary, the district court should order further evaluations, but we did not mandate any particular method by which the district court should address the two questions of whether there had been sexual abuse and whether there was grave risk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court decided that a new trial should be held to determine whether sexual abuse occurred. The court also decided that an independent expert evaluation should be attempted as to whether either girl had been sexually abused, mindful that this belated evaluation might prove to be inconclusive and of the potential trauma to the children. The court appointed an independent child psychologist, Dr. Claudette Pierre, to perform a sexual abuse evaluation of the girls. Dr. Pierre spoke with both girls, the parents, reviewed the file, and filed a report. Dr. Pierre concluded that A.D. had not been abused. Dr. Pierre also found that C.D. had in fact been traumatized by some events, most likely sexual in nature, but that Dr. Pierre could not conclusively determine whether C.D.'s father had in fact sexually abused her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agreed that the children should not testify. In conducting the trial, the court elected to have the parties submit affidavits for each of their witnesses as direct testimony, and cross examination was done of these witnesses on the stand. The parties had the opportunity to object to evidence in the affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour made a general unspecified objection to hearsay evidence in the affidavits of McLarey's witnesses. The court then asked for the objection to be stated more specifically in writing. The court said it would allow the testimony and cross examination, but would consider the written objection and whether to credit the evidence when deciding the merits of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour then filed a motion objecting only to any \"double hearsay,\" specifically referring to statements in the psychologists' reports by family members recounting to the doctors what the children had said to them. Petitioner conceded that statements made by the children to the psychologists were admissible under Fed. R.Evid. &#167; 803(4), and conceded that statements made by the children to family members were \"arguably\" admissible under Fed.R.Evid. &#167; 807 (and in any event did not challenge these statements, and does not do so here).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">After the trial, the district court found:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">by clear and convincing evidence that sexual abuse of C.D., who was slightly younger than two and one-half years old at the time, involving more than one occasion of masturbation by and of Danaipour in the presence of and involving C.D. took place during this period of alternating supervision in the fall of 2000. I find further that this abuse stopped once a police investigation began at the end of November 2000. At least one act of abuse involved C.D. touching her father's erect penis and led to her touching his ejaculant. At least one other such act involved digital masturbation of C.D. by Danaipour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge found the disclosures of the children to McLarey, her then-boyfriend Morin, and the children's grandmother to be credible. In doing so, however, the court noted that it found pertinent Danaipour's expert's cautionary observations that a custodial parent in the context of a divorce may misinterpret behavior and symptoms of the child upon returning from a visit with the non-custodial parent. The court noted that it was \"especially concerned that the reports of commentary by the children may have been overstated or manipulated.\" With this concern in mind, the court found these statements, given by the witnesses through their affidavits and subject to cross examination, to be credible. The court also used the indicia of credibility for statements by sexually abused children submitted to the court by McLarey's expert, Dr. Carole Jenny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also found \"highly persuasive\" the disclosures made by C.D. to Dr. Luxenberg and Dr. Pierre. The court found that C.D.'s multiple disclosures to Dr. Luxenberg unambiguously demonstrated that C.D. associated the word \"hammer\" with masturbation, and that these references demonstrate that there were multiple occasions of her participating in masturbation of Danaipour and his masturbation of her. The court expressly considered the concern of Danaipour's expert that these disclosures were tainted by inquiries by McLarey or Dr. Luxenberg, and found that C.D.'s recollection was not \"materially tainted or otherwise the product of suggestion.\" The district court found that the characters and themes developed by C.D. through her play therapy with Dr. Luxenberg were used by her \"as a means to express and disclose the abusive circumstances to which she has been exposed, and her reaction to those circumstances.\" We note only that our discussion does not repeat all the evidence on which the conclusion was based. Further, despite the fact that Dr. Pierre's ultimate conclusion was inconclusive as to whether C.D. had been sexually abused by her father, the court found that the corroborative disclosure from C.D. obtained by Dr. Pierre supported its finding, based on all the evidence, that C.D. had been abused by her father.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Grave Risk Finding</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found by clear and convincing evidence that C.D. was sexually abused by her father, the court then went on to conclude, also by clear and convincing evidence, that returning the children to Sweden would create a grave risk of psychological harm and an intolerable situation for them. The court credited the observations of both Dr. van der Kolk and Dr. Luxenberg that returning C.D., who has been sexually abused, to the place of trauma and location of her victimization can have profoundly disturbing effects on the child. The court also credited the conclusions of Dr. van der Kolk, one of McLarey's expert witnesses, that \"it is important to the psychological well being of C.D. that what she has disclosed be believed and not appear to lead as a consequence to her return to the place of trauma.\" Thus, the court found that her return would create a grave risk of \"fractur[ing] irremediably her sense of safety, justice and the value of truth telling,\" a situation the court found would be intolerable for her. The court found a similar, though derivative, effect would occur to A.D. This, coupled with the fact that \"[t]he parties have proceeded on the assumption that the children should not be separated and that any order under the Hague Convention would apply to both,\" led the court to deny Danaipour's request to have the children sent back to Sweden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

McLarey brought her children to Dr. Luxenberg, not for the purposes of determining whether the children had been sexually abused, but for treating their symptoms as manifested by their disturbed behavior.

The Supreme Court has stated that the Confrontation Clause creates a higher bar for the admission of hearsay evidence than do the Federal Rules alone. <i>Idaho v.

This is a civil case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end Danaipour's claim that the district court committed error by admitting and considering for the truth of the matter asserted the parental and family statements concerning C.D. and A.D.'s statements in the reports of Dr. Luxenberg fails, for several reasons. First, the statements made by McLarey, her mother, and Morin in the doctor's reports were tested when each person took the witness stand, testified directly to the same statements by A.D. and C.D., and was subjected to cross examination about the hearsay to the doctors. There were no discrepancies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Dr. Luxenberg testified that the children made the same statements (as reported by McLarey, her mother, and Morin) directly to her during their therapy, corroborating the statements reported to her by the mother and her family. This is true for each of the statements to which objection was made. Indeed, C.D. made statements to Dr. Luxenberg about her father's actions which went beyond what she told her mother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour's real objection is not that reports containing McLarey's and others' recounting of the children's statements were inadmissible double hearsay but rather that the children's statements were inherently unreliable, being a product of the mother's coaching of the children. The district court carefully considered the fact that statements by a young child, even if accurately recounted by an adult, may not reflect the truth. A child may say something in order to get attention. Further, a story once told may, for several reasons, be subject to repetition and elaboration. The court also carefully considered the concern expressed by the husband's expert that repeated inquiry on the topic would taint C.D.'s recollections; the court found this had not happened. The court was very attentive to the possibility of coaching and found that improbable, and that the statements did not bear the indicia of a suggested script. In evaluating the reliability of the reported statements by the two children, the court utilized the indicia of credibility in sexual abuse cases referenced both in the literature and by Dr. Carole Jenny, a recognized expert.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> The court was well within its discretion in considering the truth of the statements by C.D. and A.D. as reported by McLarey and the others to Dr. Luxenberg.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Consistency with Dr. Pierre's findings.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour attacks the merits of the sexual abuse finding. He argues that the finding was impermissibly contrary to the conclusion of the one independent expert, Dr. Pierre, who concluded: \"[i]t is very possible that something has happened, however, based on the contents of this disclosure evaluation it is difficult to determine the exact nature of what that is. Therefore the results of this evaluation [as to C.D.] would have to be considered inconclusive.\" Expanding on this, at trial, Dr. Pierre testified she was certain something happened to C.D. that was \"traumatic\" and \"sexual\" but said she \"did not know specifically what that [was].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour argues that it would require a very good reason for the district court, nonetheless, to conclude there was sexual abuse and that no such reason exists here. Danaipour argues that of the five experts who testified, only one, Dr. Pierre, was truly independent, and only two, Dr. Pierre and Dr. Luxenberg, actually met with and interviewed the children.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Danaipour's first argument that once the court-appointed expert said \"the results of the evaluation as to C.D. would have to be considered inconclusive\" the court could not plausibly conclude that C.D. had been sexually abused. First, there was no inconsistency between Dr. Pierre's report and the court's conclusions. We quote at greater length from Dr. Pierre's report:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to C.D. the case is less clear. The trail is cold for her collateral contacts which are vital in making determinations in cases with very young children. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this evaluation C. did speak. She initially denied everything. Upon further questioning she stated that maybe something happened once but never again. She then became very distressed stating that she was worried that she would get her Baba into trouble, her Momma into trouble and herself into trouble. It is common for children to fear hurting a parent with a disclosure. It is also common for a child to state abuse and then recant. This cannot be taken as a nondisclosure, but one is careful to not to consider it a full disclosure. C. was not clear enough during this evaluation for this examiner to feel completely comfortable that the information given in this disclosure interview was complete and solid enough to constitute a full disclosure. It is very possible that something has happened, however, based on the contents of this disclosure evaluation it is difficult to determine the exact nature of what that is. Therefore the results of this disclosure evaluation would have to be considered inconclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, it is clear to this examiner that something has happened to C. She stated that her Baba had done bad things to her and she wasn't going to tell me what they were. Based on what C. has said to her therapist she has had experiences with the father that the therapist considers abusive. Dr. Luxenberg's notes are compelling. C's memory of events is clearly hampered by the fact that the occurrences would have happened approximately 1 1/2 years ago which is almost half of her life ago. Not to mention that she has been in a therapeutic relationship focused on helping her heal. Old memories naturally become integrated into new ones. In addition, C's memories are most assuredly state dependent at such an early age and would naturally be more likely accessed through a therapeutic relationship than by direct questioning such as was done in the disclosure evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My recommendation is that the evaluation end of this be terminated at this time. I do not believe another sexual abuse evaluation will come any closer to the truth than this one did. I would recommend that the therapeutic relationship continue and that information from that source continue to be given credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Pierre also testified that from her own observations of C.D. it was clear something had happened to C.D. but she could not say with any degree of certainty what happened. She thought it not useful to do a further disclosure evaluation because the data was old and that Dr. Luxenberg had better data. And when Dr. Pierre considered Dr. Luxenberg's notes, she found the notes suggest that \"something more compelling has happened and more worrisome,\" and that Dr. Luxenberg's data should be treated credibly. Dr. Pierre's opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty was that something had happened between C.D. and her father, and that something bad and something sexual had happened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court relied on the disclosures made by C.D. to both Dr. Luxenberg and Dr. Pierre, as well as the corroborative disclosures made by C.D. to her family members and the play activity of the child. The court stated: \"The disclosures to Dr. Luxenberg are relatively unambiguous in demonstrating that C.D. associated the word `hammer' with the arm movements involved in masturbation. Her alternate references to `hammering' and being herself `hammered' satisfy me that there were multiple occasions involving her participation in masturbation of Danaipour and his masturbation of her.\" Further, the court found that the disclosure made by C.D. to Dr. Pierre was corroborative of those made to Dr. Luxenberg, and supported the finding of sexual abuse. Moreover, these statements were consistent with those testified to by McLarey, Morin, and the children's grandmother.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting the play activity of C.D. the district court also considered the interpretation of Dr. Munson, Danaipour's expert, that the play be interpreted as only expressing themes from an animation series. The court held that the play was more than a simple re-enactment of the series. Rather, C.D. used the characters and themes of the series to express and disclose the abuse and her reactions to it. The court considered and rejected the possibility of cultural distortion. The court found that while C.D.'s statements and activities were arguably ambiguous, the most logical interpretation was that C.D. had been sexually abused. In fact, the court accepted Dr. Munson's methodology of testing of contrary hypotheses and found \"no other hypothesis as compelling as that C.D. was sexually abused by her father.\" The finding that C.D. was sexually abused by her father was supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Challenge to the Finding that Return of C.D. and A.D. to Sweden Posed A Grave Risk of Psychological Harm</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Role of Danaipour's Acknowledgment of Responsibility.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a subsidiary finding in support of its grave risk conclusion, the district court commented that an \"additional impediment to return\" was the father's refusal to acknowledge that C.D. had any difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's comment was itself based on Dr. Pierre's report, which said that a first step in reducing harm would be \"[Danaipour] offering [C.D.] an apology during his first contact with her. This apology does not have be one admitting guilt but rather one that acknowledges there have been some things that have happened that have caused her great worry and for that he is sorry.\" The report was issued on July 31, 2002 to the court and counsel. Danaipour testified on August 2, 2002. We have carefully read his testimony and it contains no indication of any willingness on his part to make the acknowledgment Dr. Pierre recommended. Rather, Danaipour testified that he had not looked at the report. He continued to insist, in the face of Dr. Pierre's report, that C.D.'s statements were the result of C.D. being coached and prompted by her mother. The district court also invited commentary from the parties on Dr. Pierre's report and received none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour's argument is that he was precluded by a visitation order from speaking to C.D. and his motion for visitation rights had not been resolved, so the court's criticism is unfair. The argument mixes tenses. Dr. Pierre's report refers to what Danaipour should do at any future point of first contact with C.D. On the witness stand he had the opportunity to express a willingness to take that step, a step which the independent expert characterized as a first step toward healing for his daughter. He chose instead to insist his daughter's statements were the result of programming by their mother. The court properly considered this in its evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Article 13(b) Requirements.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, consistent with the second aspect of the mandate, made explicit findings that the return of C.D. and A.D. to Sweden would cause each child a grave risk of psychological harm and create an intolerable situation. Danaipour's argument that the court did not make such findings is simply not supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danaipour makes another argument that the evidence did not support any finding of grave risk, particularly in light of the ability of the Swedish courts to rule on custody and visitation rights of children and Sweden's mechanisms to evaluate whether sexual abuse has occurred. Danaipour criticizes the district court for not directly addressing the issue of protections available in Sweden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court credited and primarily relied on the testimony of two experts, Dr. van der Kolk and Dr. Luxenberg, on the effects of a return on the two children. The evidence from Dr. Luxenberg was particularly compelling; Dr. van der Kolk's conclusions were consistent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two days after the initial district judge ordered the return of the children to Sweden, Dr. Luxenberg met with C.D. At that session, C.D. spontaneously raised the topic of return, saying her mother had told them they had to go to Sweden. C.D. said she did not want to go to Sweden and did not want to see her father. Through her play she raised the issue that she had told the truth and that her father had not told the truth and had done bad things to her. C.D. became extremely anxious, screaming and shaking and repeating, \"No, no, no, no!\" She later expressed fear that if she saw her father again, \"he'll just keep doing it, and I don't want him to.\" She equated a return to Sweden with seeing her father. In contrast to the ambivalent feelings C.D. expressed about her father, C.D. expressed no ambivalence about her desire not to return to him or to Sweden. C.D. made the point repeatedly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Luxenberg also had therapeutic sessions with A.D. It was striking to her that A.D. never expressed any desire to return to Sweden or to see her father. A.D. told Dr. Luxenberg that she thought her father really did \"do it\" [to C.D.] and she hoped he would not do it again. She equated going back to Sweden with something bad happening to her, and expressed anxiety that if she were returned to Sweden she would be separated from her mother (as had happened during their last return to Sweden) and that her father would \"do those things that C.D. said that he did\" again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Luxenberg concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is imperative that C.D. and A.D. continue in therapy at this time. Both have been able to develop a very strong and trusting therapeutic relationship, and are able to talk about difficult issues in a way they were unable to do at the beginning of therapy. Without suggesting that the girls would be unable to re-form a similar therapeutic relationship elsewhere, disrupting their therapy at this critical time in their development may cause the girls to become reluctant to discuss their experiences and their emotional responses to them, which is vital to their psychological recovery. Both are still clearly worried about the potential consequences of being honest and open about their feelings and experiences, and to have therapy prematurely terminated would reinforce the sense that talking is, indeed, dangerous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. van der Kolk did not meet C.D. but did review the record and observed some testimony at trial. Dr. van der Kolk drew conclusions which were entirely consistent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that psychological harm to C.D. and A.D. would be a necessary consequence of a return to Sweden, regardless of any possible conditions or undertakings imposed. These harms were beyond the power of any court to prevent or remedy if the children were returned. Danaipour's arguments about the authority of the Swedish courts are, as a result, beside the point. Nothing in Article 13(b) required further inquiry in these circumstances, as this case involves \"a situation in which the [Swedish] authorities, through no fault of their own, may not be able to give the children adequate protection.\" <i>Blondin v.

In fact, <i>Danaipour I</i> specifically identified the limited role undertakings may play in certain situations. <i>See Danaipour I,</i> 286 F.3d at 21. <i>Danaipour I</i> also noted the great weight afforded to the State Department policy concerning undertakings in a situation involving child abuse:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the requested state court is presented with unequivocal evidence that return would cause the child a \"grave risk\" of physical or psychological harm, however, then it would seem less appropriate for the court to enter extensive undertakings than to deny the return request. The development of extensive undertakings in such a context would embroil the court in the merits of the underlying custody issues and would tend to dilute the force of the Article 13(b) exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 25 (quoting Department of State Comment on Undertakings). The district court properly followed <i>Danaipour I's</i> mandate; its finding of the existence of sexual abuse and that the return of the children to Sweden would result in a grave risk of psychological harm was adequate to satisfy the Article 13(b) exception, and no further inquiry into remedies available to the Swedish courts was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons we <i>affirm</i> the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We reject the notion, adopted by at least one circuit, that identifications by children who are abuse victims to doctors are only admissible \"where the physician makes clear to the victim that the inquiry into the identity of the abuser is important to diagnosis and treatment, and the victim manifests such an understanding.\"<i>See Olesen v.

There are many ways in which a party wishing to enter into evidence a statement under Rule 803(4) can demonstrate that the statement was made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment; a per se rule requiring a doctor to explain to the victim why a statement naming an abuser is important to diagnosis and treatment is unnecessarily inflexible. <i>See also United States v.

Contrary to Danaipour's argument on appeal, the court did not rely for its sexual abuse findings on Dr. Jenny's conclusions that C.D. had been sexually abused. This assertion is flatly contradicted by the district court's opinion. While the district court agreed with Dr. Jenny's ultimate conclusion that C.D. had been sexually abused, it clearly stated that it only relied on her testimony concerning the indicia of credibility with respect to sexual abuse by children</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We summarize the conclusions in his testimony:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">1</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> For A.D. and C.D., being sent back to Sweden will mean that they are not believed and that telling the truth as they see it will have dire consequences.

She needs to feel safe</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">3</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> If the girls perceive that they are not believed, or if actions are taken that indicate that disclosing the truth of their experiences will lead to retaliation or separation from the people they feel safe with, the natural consequence would be that these girls will grow up believing that telling people the truth has dire ramifications, and that the rules that are applied to them do not apply to others</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">4</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> If returned, C.D. and A.D. were likely to have similar responses in Sweden and react with \"fright or freeze\" reactions to the sound of the Swedish language, to familiar sights, sounds, smells and temperatures</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1_ref\">5</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> Return would disrupt the relationship with Dr. Luxenberg. The relationship A.D. and C.D. have developed with Dr. Luxenberg will ultimately serve as a very significant stepping stone in the children's healing process and likely impact each child's individual ability to reestablish her personal integrity and self-confidence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">6</a>\n        <p class=\"indent\"> Both C.D. and A.D. have expressed their opposition to returning to Sweden and their anxiety regarding such a move. The girls' experience in Sweden has taught them that if they are sent back they will be reunited with their father &#8212; in spite of their memories of his abuse, their disclosures about the abuse, and their opposition to such a move. The child will understand that the only reason to go to Sweden is to be with their father</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">5</a>\n        <p> Danaipour also relies heavily on a footnote in<i>Blondin</i> for the proposition that assessing the capacity of the courts of the country of habitual residence is a prerequisite to an Article 13(b) exception. 238 F.3d at 163 n. 11. We do not read <i>Blondin</i> to require the court to make findings about the institutional capacity of the home country in all cases. To the extent that <i>Blondin</i> does stand for such a proposition, we disagree that Article 13(b) requires such findings in all cases.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
