Ronald R. Lagueux, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     George J. West for appellant Sanchez.\n     Robert B. Mann, with whom Mann & Mitchell was on brief, for\nappellant Anderson.\n\f     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Gerard B.\nSullivan, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for the\nUnited States.\n\n\n\n                         January 7, 2004\n\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge. In these consolidated appeals, two\n\nparticipants in a mindless carjacking and double homicide strive to\n\nconvince us that the district court sentenced them more onerously\n\nthan the law permits.     After a painstaking review of the record, we\n\nfind that the sentencing court committed no reversible error.\n\nConsequently, we leave the appellants' sentences intact.\n\nI.   TRAVEL OF THE CASE\n\n             Because the disputed sentences were imposed following\n\nadmissions of guilt, we glean the material facts from the change-\n\nof-plea colloquies, the presentence investigation reports (PSI\n\nReports), and the transcripts of the disposition hearings.          United\n\nStates v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir. 1997); United States\n\nv. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir. 1991).        Those facts paint a\n\ngrisly picture.\n\n             On the evening of June 8, 2000, Samuel Sanchez, Raymond\n\nAnderson, and three other men carjacked Jason Burgeson and Amy\n\nShute   at   gunpoint.    After   confronting   the   pair   in   downtown\n\nProvidence, the malefactors appropriated their vehicle, drove in\n\ncaravan style to a secluded area, murdered the abducted couple in\n\ncold blood, and took what little cash they had.        The brutal crime\n\nattracted immediate attention and the authorities quickly rounded\n\nup five suspects.\n\n             On December 18, 2000, a federal grand jury sitting in the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island indicted Sanchez and Anderson (appellants\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fhere) and three others for conspiracy to commit a carjacking and\n\ncarjacking with death resulting.           See 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 2119, &\n\n2119(3).    The appellants eventually pleaded guilty to both counts\n\npursuant    to    written   plea   agreements   in    which   the   government\n\npromised not to seek the death penalty.          Two of the other persons\n\naccused (Gregory Floyd and Harry Burdick) followed the same course\n\nand were sentenced to life imprisonment.             The final member of the\n\ngroup (Kenneth Day) went to trial and, at the close of the\n\ngovernment's case, moved successfully for judgment of acquittal.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.\n\n            The district court sentenced Sanchez on November 7,\n\n2002.1     The court arrived at his offense level by applying the\n\nfirst    degree    murder   cross-reference,    USSG     §§2A1.1,   2B3.1(c);\n\ngranting a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility,\n\nid. §3E1.1; and departing upward by three levels, id. §5K2.0.\n\nThese steps yielded a total offense level of 43.              The court then\n\ncomputed Sanchez's criminal history score, assigned him to criminal\n\nhistory category (CHC) II, and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\n            The court sentenced Anderson six days later.            It applied\n\nthe first degree murder cross-reference; granted a three-level\n\n\n\n     1\n      When the district court sentenced the appellants, the\nNovember 2002 edition of the sentencing guidelines was in effect.\nConsequently, we refer throughout to that version.       See United\nStates v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(\"Barring any ex post facto problem, a defendant is to be punished\naccording to the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing.\").\n\n                                     -4-\n\freduction for acceptance of responsibility; and departed downward\n\nby two levels, \"one because of [Anderson's] substantial cooperation\n\nand one because he [was] the least culpable.\"            These steps yielded\n\na total offense level of 38. After calculating Anderson's criminal\n\nhistory score, the court placed him in CHC III.            This combination\n\n(offense level 38; CHC III) produced a guideline sentencing range\n\n(GSR) of 292-365 months.       The court thereupon imposed a 30-year\n\nincarcerative sentence.      These timely appeals ensued.\n\n          Each   appellant    advances     three    assignments       of   error.\n\nSanchez challenges the district court's denial of a downward role-\n\nin-the-offense adjustment, its rejection of his entreaty for a\n\ndownward departure, and its decision to depart upward.                 Anderson\n\nalso challenges the district court's denial of a favorable role-in-\n\nthe-offense   adjustment     and   its    refusal   to    grant   a    downward\n\ndeparture based on his state of mind at the time of the homicides.\n\nIn addition, he questions the calculation of his criminal history\n\nscore (and, thus, his CHC).         We treat the common role-in-the-\n\noffense and downward departure issues first.                We then address\n\nSanchez's objection to the district court's upward departure and\n\nAnderson's complaint about the supposedly unwarranted inflation of\n\nhis criminal history score.\n\nII.   ROLE IN THE OFFENSE\n\n           We begin with the appellants' claims that they deserved\n\ntwo-level reductions because they were minor participants in the\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\foffenses of conviction.    A defendant who seeks a downward role\n\nadjustment must bear the burden of proof on that issue.       United\n\nStates v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 332-33 (1st Cir. 1990).          The\n\nensuing question — whether to reduce the defendant's offense level\n\ndue to his minor or minimal role in the offense — is an inquiry\n\nheavily driven by the facts.   See United States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d\n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997) (en banc); USSG §3B1.2, cmt. (n.3(C)).\n\nBecause the sentencing court has a superior coign of vantage, we\n\nmust defer to its findings of fact unless those findings are\n\nclearly erroneous.   Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 333.   If a set of facts can\n\nlead plausibly to competing inferences, the sentencing court's\n\nchoice among them cannot be termed a clear error.     Cruz, 120 F.3d\n\nat 4; United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n          Collectively, these standards are not appellant-friendly.\n\nRecognizing that reality, we have warned that \"absent a mistake of\n\nlaw, battles over a defendant's status . . . will almost always be\n\nwon or lost in the district court.\"   United States v. Graciani, 61\n\nF.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n               A.    Sanchez's Role in the Offense.\n\n          Sanchez asserts that he neither introduced nor used the\n\nmurder weapon, eschewed any participation in the robbery of the\n\nvictims, and never threatened to rape Shute.      On this basis, he\n\nargues that he was less culpable than his coconspirators and\n\ntherefore deserving of a two-level downward adjustment as a minor\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fparticipant.          USSG §3B1.2(b).         The district court rejected this\n\nassertion, and so do we.\n\n                  The Sentencing Commission has explained that section\n\n3B1.2 \"provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a\n\npart in committing the offense that makes him substantially less\n\nculpable than the average participant.\" Id. §3B1.2, cmt. (n.3(A)).\n\nThe roster of available adjustments includes a modest adjustment\n\nfor minor participation and a somewhat more generous adjustment for\n\nminimal      participation.         Id.   §3B1.2.2        We   have    ruled    that   a\n\ndefendant who aspires to be classified as a minor participant bears\n\nthe burden of proving that he is both (i) less culpable than most\n\nother participants in the offenses of conviction, and (ii) less\n\nculpable than the average miscreant involved in offenses of the\n\nsame genre. See United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 149\n\n(1st       Cir.    2000);   Ocasio,    914    F.2d   at   333.        Sanchez   cannot\n\nconceivably run that gauntlet.\n\n                  We need not tarry.      Sanchez effectively admitted during\n\nthe change-of-plea colloquy that he furnished the car used in\n\ncommitting          the   crimes,     drove    his   comrades     around       downtown\n\nProvidence in search of victims, held himself available as a\n\n\"getaway driver\" should the attempted carjacking go awry, suggested\n\n\n\n       2\n      The difference between minor and minimal participation is one\nof degree. See United States v. Almanza, 225 F.3d 845, 847 (7th\nCir. 2000).    This case does not require us to draw so fine a\ndistinction.\n\n                                           -7-\n\fwhere to take the victims following their abduction, searched the\n\ncarjacked vehicle for valuables, and used some of the appropriated\n\ncash.    He also admitted that other participants would testify that\n\nhe urged one of his companions (Floyd) to shoot the victims and\n\nthat he offered to kill them himself should Floyd balk.         Given this\n\nscenario, it beggars credulity to think that Sanchez could qualify\n\nas a minor participant in the criminal activity.          Consequently, we\n\ndiscern no error, clear or otherwise, in the sentencing court's\n\ndenial of his request for a role reduction.\n\n                 B.   Anderson's Role in the Offense.\n\n            Anderson's claim that he deserved a two-level reduction\n\nas a minor participant is somewhat more credible.          He begins with\n\nthe sentencing court's comment, voiced during the disposition\n\nhearing, that \"[h]e was the least culpable [of the gang] because he\n\ndidn't participate in the actual shooting, and he didn't urge or\n\ndemand that these innocent young people be killed.\"          This might be\n\nthought faint praise, but we assume, for argument's sake, that it\n\nconstitutes a finding sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the\n\ntest for minor participation.\n\n            Although Anderson pleaded guilty both to conspiracy to\n\ncommit   carjacking   and   to   carjacking   resulting    in   death,   the\n\nrelevant charge for the comparative analysis required by the second\n\nprong of the \"minor participant\" test is carjacking resulting in\n\ndeath.     Cf. Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 229 (1999)\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f(holding that 18 U.S.C. § 2119 defines three distinct crimes —\n\nsimple carjacking, carjacking resulting in serious bodily injury,\n\nand carjacking resulting in death).     In an effort to satisfy this\n\nprong, Anderson points to the sentencing court's explicit finding\n\nthat he lacked an intent to kill and concludes that he must\n\nperforce be less culpable than the average felon convicted of\n\ncarjacking resulting in death.      This conclusion does not follow\n\nfrom the indicated premise:     whether a carjacker did — or did not\n\n— harbor a subjective intent to kill is not a fact of talismanic\n\nsignificance   to   a   role-in-the-offense   decision   in   a   case   of\n\ncarjacking resulting in death. Regardless of the lack of an intent\n\nto kill, the instant record contains ample evidence from which the\n\nsentencing court reasonably could have concluded that Anderson was\n\nno less culpable than the average defendant convicted of that\n\noffense.\n\n           On this record, a rational trier easily could have found\n\nthat Anderson recruited an accomplice (Sanchez) who made available\n\nthe car used in committing the crimes; that he accompanied his\n\ncoconspirators on their prowl through downtown Providence as they\n\nhunted for potential victims; that he served as a lookout while the\n\ngroup abducted not one but two innocent young people; that he\n\nordered the victims to exit the carjacked vehicle once the caravan\n\nhad reached the murder site; that he removed jewelry from Shute's\n\nperson just prior to her execution; and that he expressed no\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fdisapproval when his compatriots discussed the desirability of\n\nmurdering the victims.        Given Anderson's continuous presence and\n\nhis willing participation in the aforedescribed events, the lower\n\ncourt plausibly could have inferred, from the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, that he had failed to prove his entitlement to a\n\nminor participation credit.           See, e.g., United States v. Nuñez-\n\nRodriguez, 92 F.3d 14, 24 (1st Cir. 1996) (finding no clear error\n\nin denial of minor role adjustment when defendant participated in\n\nplanning the carjacking, drove around with two coconspirators for\n\nseveral hours searching for a likely victim, approached the chosen\n\nvictim with an armed associate, and drove the carjacked vehicle\n\nfrom the scene despite having heard the fatal gunshot).                           We\n\nconclude, therefore, that the sentencing court's denial of a\n\ndownward role-in-the-offense adjustment was not clearly erroneous.\n\nIII.   DOWNWARD DEPARTURES\n\n           Each    appellant      sought     the    benefit    of    a    guideline\n\nprovision (Application Note 1) that authorizes a downward departure\n\nfrom the base offense level mandated by the first degree murder\n\ncross-reference (43) \"[i]f the defendant did not cause the death\n\nintentionally     or    knowingly.\"       USSG     §2A1.1,    cmt.   (n.1).      The\n\ndistrict   court       rejected   these    requests    (although         it   granted\n\nAnderson a downward departure on other grounds, see supra).                      The\n\nappellants attempt to challenge these rejections.                That is easier\n\nsaid than done.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f              As a general rule, a sentencing court's discretionary\n\nrefusal to depart is unreviewable.                See, e.g., United States v.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d 14, 30 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Pierro,\n\n32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994).               At first blush, that rule would\n\nseem    to    apply   here    because     the    decision    whether      to   grant   a\n\ndeparture pursuant to Application Note 1 (appended to section\n\n2A1.1) lies completely within the discretion of the sentencing\n\ncourt.       See Teeter, 257 F.3d at 29-30; see also USSG §2A1.1, cmt.\n\n(n.1)    (explaining        that   \"downward     departure    may    be    warranted\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)).          But this general rule — like most general\n\nrules — admits of certain exceptions.                One such exception covers\n\ncases in which the sentencing court misapprehends its authority to\n\ndepart.      See Teeter, 257 F.3d at 30; United States v. Gifford, 17\n\nF.3d 462, 473 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n              Each appellant endeavors to fit his case within the\n\nnarrow confines of this exception.                As we explain below, neither\n\nsucceeds.\n\n                       A.    Sanchez's Departure Request.\n\n              Sanchez starts by adverting to case law that requires\n\ntrial     courts      to    analyze   a    defendant's      mental     state     after\n\ndetermining that section 2A1.1 applies.               See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Carr, 303 F.3d 539, 544-48 (4th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537\n\nU.S. 1138 (2003); United States v. Prevatte, 16 F.3d 767, 784 (7th\n\nCir. 1994).      Using these cases as a springboard, he seeks to drape\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fthe denial of his departure request in the raiment of reviewability\n\nby insisting that the sentencing court's failure to make a detailed\n\ndetermination of his state of mind at the time of the slayings\n\ndemonstrated a misapprehension of its power to depart.          This\n\nargument does little to persuade us that the sentencing court was\n\nunaware of its departure-granting authority.\n\n            If the district court had granted a downward departure on\n\nthe basis of Application Note 1, it would have had to factor in the\n\ndefendant's state of mind to assess the extent of the departure.\n\nSee USSG §2A1.1, cmt. (n.1) (explaining that if a departure is\n\ngranted, the sentencing court should base its extent, inter alia,\n\n\"upon the defendant's state of mind\").     But no such direction is\n\nprovided as to the underlying decision to depart — and here, the\n\ndistrict court denied the departure request.      Thus, the issue is\n\nnot what analysis the district court made, but, rather, whether it\n\nwas required to make particularized findings at all. We think not.\n\n            In general, sentencing courts are under no obligation to\n\nmake specific findings when denying departure requests. See United\n\nStates v. DeCosta, 37 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1994) (explaining that\n\n\"the district court is not required to give reasons for refusing to\n\ndepart\").     We agree with the Tenth Circuit that this precept\n\nextends with undiminished force to the denial of an Application\n\nNote 1 departure.     See United States v. Nichols, 169 F.3d 1255,\n\n1276-77 (10th Cir. 1999) (concluding that \"[n]othing in [USSG\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f§2A1.1]   requires   a   district   court   to   make   any   findings   when\n\ndeciding whether to depart\").       Indeed, we held as much, albeit in\n\nan unpublished opinion, in United States v. Diaz-Pabon, 187 F.3d\n\n623 (1st Cir. 1998) (table), in which we ruled that \"the sentencing\n\ncourt was under no duty to analyze the factors set forth in\n\nApplication Note 1 to justify its discretionary decision not to\n\ndepart from the guidelines . . . .\"\n\n           That holding undermines Sanchez's argument.          Because the\n\ndistrict court had no obligation to make specific findings, we\n\ncannot interpret the absence of a detailed discussion of Sanchez's\n\nstate of mind as an indication that the court misunderstood its\n\ndiscretionary powers.      See United States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d\n\n555, 564-65 (1st Cir. 1996) (explaining that mere ambiguity in the\n\nsentencing record is insufficient to render the court's refusal to\n\ndepart reviewable on appeal).\n\n           In all events, we must consider the whole of the record\n\nwhen determining whether a sentencing court misapprehended its\n\nauthority to depart.     See United States v. DeLeon, 187 F.3d 60, 69\n\n(1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Morrison, 46 F.3d 127, 130-31\n\n(1st Cir. 1995); Gifford, 17 F.3d at 474-75.            Here, the district\n\ncourt supportably found that Sanchez had urged Floyd to shoot the\n\nvictims and had offered to kill them himself if Floyd faltered.           At\n\nleast implicit in those findings was the court's conclusion that\n\nSanchez had an intent to kill (and, consequently, that he was\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fineligible for the desired departure).              Viewed in this light, it\n\ncannot   be    said    that   the   sentencing      court   misunderstood     its\n\ndeparture-granting         authority.          Therefore,   we   do    not   have\n\njurisdiction to review Sanchez's assignment of error.                 See Teeter,\n\n257 F.3d at 30 (\"[W]e lack jurisdiction to review the court's\n\nrefusal to invoke Application Note 1 unless there is some reason to\n\nbelieve that the court misunderstood its options.\").\n\n                      B.   Anderson's Departure Request.\n\n              Anderson — like Sanchez — seeks to characterize his case\n\nas one in which the district court misperceived the extent of its\n\nauthority to depart under Application Note 1.                    Specifically,\n\nAnderson spotlights the sentencing court's statement that \"[h]e\n\ndidn't have an intent to kill\" and complains that the court failed\n\nto realize that this finding paved the way for a possible downward\n\ndeparture. To prove his point, Anderson singles out a passage from\n\nthe transcript of the disposition hearing, in which the judge\n\nexplained:\n\n              The defendant argues that he shouldn't have a\n              total offense level of 43 because he had no\n              intent to kill. But as I've just indicated,\n              he is charged with that intent because he is\n              an aider and abettor, and whether it's\n              considered a second degree murder or a first\n              degree murder, if it was tried in the state\n              courts the fact of the matter is that he was\n              an accessory before the fact of murder in this\n              case.   So the total offense level of 43 is\n              correct.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fIn Anderson's view, this rationale reveals the court's total\n\nunfamiliarity with the authority granted to it by Application Note\n\n1.\n\n              Anderson's argument elevates hope over reason.                    The\n\nsentencing court's attempt to explain why it chose not to depart,\n\ndespite Anderson's perceived lack of an intent to kill, was not\n\nespecially articulate — but what is conspicuously absent from the\n\nquoted passage is any indication that the court felt constrained in\n\nits ability to depart.          Application Note 1 gives the sentencing\n\ncourt discretion to depart or not, as the court sees fit, if it\n\nfinds that a given defendant did not cause the death intentionally\n\nor knowingly.      On a fair reading of the court's comments in this\n\ncase,   it    seems    highly   likely   that   the   court    was    looking    to\n\nanalogous state criminal law for guidance on how to exercise that\n\ndiscretion.     The fact that the court had recognized its authority\n\nto depart under the self-same rubric at Sanchez's sentencing — held\n\njust six days earlier — reinforces this conclusion.                  We therefore\n\ndismiss Anderson's assignment of error as unreviewable.                         See\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d at 30.\n\nIV.   THE UPWARD DEPARTURE\n\n              At sentencing, the district court ruled that Sanchez's\n\ncase fell outside the heartland of comparable carjacking cases and\n\ndetermined that a three-level upward departure was appropriate.\n\nThe   court    based    this    determination   on    five    factors:      death\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fresulting,    abduction,      use   of    a     weapon,    extreme   conduct,    and\n\ncriminal purpose.       Each of these is a recognized — indeed, an\n\nencouraged — ground for a departure.                 See USSG §§ 5K2.1 (death\n\nresulting), 5K2.4 (abduction), 5K2.6 (use of a weapon), 5K2.8\n\n(extreme conduct), 5K2.9 (criminal purpose); see generally Koon v.\n\nUnited States, 518 U.S. 81, 94 (1996) (\"Encouraged factors are\n\nthose 'the [Sentencing] Commission has not been able to take into\n\naccount   fully   in   formulating        the    guidelines.'\"       (quoting    USSG\n\n§5K2.0)).    If the sentencing court finds an encouraged factor in a\n\nparticular    case,    \"the   court      is     authorized    to   depart   if    the\n\napplicable Guideline does not already take it into account.\" Koon,\n\n518 U.S. at 96.\n\n             Sanchez   assigns      error       to   the     departure   decision,\n\ninsisting (i) that the court's consideration of these five factors\n\nconstituted double counting, and (ii) that, in all events, their\n\napplication was unwarranted in his case.                   We disagree with these\n\nallegations.\n\n             Before addressing Sanchez's claims, we comment briefly\n\nupon the standard of review.          The law is currently unsettled as to\n\nwhether the PROTECT Act, Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650, 670, to\n\nbe codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e) (2003), applies to departure\n\ndecisions made prior to April 30, 2003 (the Act's effective date).3\n\n\n     3\n      Although a panel of this court decided that issue in United\nStates v. Thurston, No. 02-1966, slip op. at 45-47 (1st Cir. Aug.\n4, 2003) (applying the PROTECT Act's standard of review to appeals\n\n                                         -16-\n\fThus, our standard of review is in doubt.           Compare id. (directing\n\nde novo review of departure decisions), with United States v.\n\nDethlefs, 123 F.3d 39, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1997) (describing more\n\ndeferential pre-PROTECT Act standard of review). Here, however, we\n\nwould affirm the district court's departure decision under either\n\nstandard, and so we leave the question unresolved.\n\n                          A.    Double Counting.\n\n          Sanchez's first claim — double counting — posits that the\n\ndeparture factors relied upon by the district court were already\n\nadequately     taken   into    account,    either   as    specific   offense\n\ncharacteristics or as other adjustments, in determining his GSR.\n\nWe are fully satisfied that the sentencing court did not engage in\n\nany double counting when it considered four of the five factors —\n\nabduction (§5K2.4), use of a weapon (§5K2.6), extreme conduct\n\n(§5K2.8), and criminal purpose (§5K2.9) — as grounds for an upward\n\ndeparture.     We explain briefly.\n\n             Sanchez   makes   no   coherent   argument    as   to   why   the\n\nsentencing court's use of extreme conduct or criminal purpose in\n\nthe departure calculus would constitute double counting.                    In\n\ncontrast, his argument as to abduction and use of a weapon is\n\ncoherent but unavailing. It hinges on the fact that the carjacking\n\nguideline is derived from, and generally congruent with, the\n\n\n\npending as of April 30, 2003), that opinion has been withdrawn for\nreconsideration by the panel.\n\n                                    -17-\n\fguideline   for   robbery.   See    USSG     §2B3.1.   Seizing   on   this\n\ncongruence, Sanchez notes that the guideline for robbery allows for\n\nthe consideration of abduction and use of a weapon when calculating\n\na defendant's base offense level.         See id. §2B3.1(b).\n\n            It does not follow, however, that abduction and use of a\n\nweapon are already taken into account in carjacking cases in which\n\nthe murder enhancement applies.           Once a court decides upon the\n\napplicability of the first degree murder cross-reference, id.\n\n§2B3.1(c), proper procedure requires it to ignore the specific\n\noffense characteristics listed under the robbery guideline and move\n\ndirectly to USSG §2A1.1.       The sentencing court followed this\n\nprotocol in Sanchez's case.        Consequently, there was no double\n\ncounting.\n\n            This leaves the sentencing court's application of the\n\n\"death resulting\" factor (§5K2.1).         It is at least arguable that\n\nthis can be construed as double counting:        the court might already\n\nhave provided an enhancement for the fact that the carjacking\n\nresulted in death when it followed the instructions found in USSG\n\n§2B3.1(c) and applied the first degree murder cross-reference. See\n\nUnited States v. Barber, 119 F.3d 276, 280-81 & n.3 (4th Cir. 1997)\n\n(suggesting that the first degree murder guideline already takes\n\ninto account the fact that death resulted).\n\n            This logic is not defeated by the fact that sentencing\n\ncourts are authorized, in certain circumstances, to depart from the\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fguidelines even though the reason for departure has been taken into\n\nconsideration        as   a   specific        offense   characteristic     or   other\n\nadjustment.      That authorization is limited to situations in which\n\n\"the court determines that, in light of unusual circumstances, the\n\nweight attached to [the relevant] factor under the guidelines is\n\ninadequate.\"     USSG §5K2.0.        It would be surpassingly difficult to\n\ncontend that the first degree murder cross-reference (which raised\n\nSanchez's offense level to 43 — the maximum contemplated by the\n\nsentencing guidelines) attributed inadequate weight to the victims'\n\ndeaths.\n\n              Of course, this case is different in the sense that two\n\npersons   —    not    just    one    —   were     slain.       That   distinguishing\n\ncharacteristic might very well suffice to counter the charge of\n\ndouble counting. Courts may consider whether the crime resulted in\n\nmultiple deaths when determining the extent of a departure, see id.\n\n§5K2.1,   and,       by   analogy,       it    would    seem   sensible   to    allow\n\nconsideration of that fact in determining whether to depart at all.\n\nMoreover, Sanchez would have received the same base offense level\n\nhad the carjacking resulted in only one death, so it might well be\n\nsaid that the first degree murder cross-reference failed to take\n\nthe second death into account.                These considerations would tend to\n\njustify departing upward.            Cf. United States v. Menzer, 29 F.3d\n\n1223, 1234-35 (7th Cir. 1994) (using similar reasoning to support\n\n\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fan upward departure in light of the arson guideline's second degree\n\nmurder cross-reference).\n\n            In the last analysis, however, we need not resolve this\n\nquestion.   Even if the sentencing court engaged in double counting\n\nwith regard to the \"death resulting\" factor — a matter that we do\n\nnot decide — the departure as a whole would be sustainable.            We\n\nhave said in the past that\n\n            a departure which rests on a combination of\n            valid and invalid grounds may be affirmed so\n            long as (1) the direction and degree of the\n            departure are reasonable in relation to the\n            remaining (valid) ground, (2) excision of the\n            improper ground does not obscure or defeat the\n            expressed reasoning of the district court, and\n            (3) the reviewing court is left, on the record\n            as a whole, with the definite and firm\n            conviction that removal of the inappropriate\n            ground would not be likely to alter the\n            district   court's   view  of   the   sentence\n            rightfully to be imposed.\n\nUnited States v. Diaz-Bastardo, 929 F.2d 798, 800 (1st Cir. 1991);\n\nsee also Williams v. United States, 503 U.S. 193, 203 (1992);\n\nNuñez-Rodriguez, 92 F.3d at 19.           These requirements are fully\n\nsatisfied here.\n\n            In this instance, the four remaining factors cited by the\n\nsentencing court provide ample justification for the relatively\n\nmoderate three-level upward departure.        Notwithstanding Sanchez's\n\nhyperbolic efforts to classify the extent of the departure as\n\nunreasonable,    we   previously   have   affirmed   similar   (and   even\n\nsignificantly larger) departures, including departures based upon\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fanalogous circumstances. See, e.g., United States v. Carrion-Cruz,\n\n92 F.3d 5, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (affirming a three-\n\nlevel departure from level 40 to level 43 due to the \"sordid facts\"\n\nin a multiple-death carjacking case); see also United States v.\n\nChapman, 241 F.3d 57, 65 (1st Cir. 2001) (collecting First Circuit\n\ncases affirming departures ranging up to 300%).4          As to the final\n\nelement    of   the    Diaz-Bastardo   test,   the   district   court   made\n\nabundantly clear its belief that the only appropriate sentencing\n\noutcome for Sanchez was life imprisonment.            The double-counting\n\nclaim is, therefore, impuissant.\n\n                      B.   Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n\n            Next, Sanchez argues that whether or not these five\n\nfactors were legally available, they were factually unsupported\n\n(and, thus, should not have figured in the departure calculus).\n\nThis is whistling past the graveyard:           the record contains more\n\nthan enough evidence to justify the use of each of the five\n\nfactors.\n\n            A detailed exegesis would serve no useful purpose.           The\n\nshort of it is that the victims were abducted at gunpoint and\n\ntransported to a secluded location, where they were psychologically\n\n\n     4\n      In a rhetorical flourish, Sanchez labels his \"outsized\" life\nsentence a cruel and unusual punishment. Appellant's Br. at 20.\nThe entire Eighth Amendment argument spans only two sentences and\nSanchez cites no authority for it.        Because this claim is\nperfunctory and unaccompanied by developed argumentation, we deem\nit waived.   United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990).\n\n                                    -21-\n\ftormented for a period of time before being murdered execution-\n\nstyle in order to protect the identities of the perpetrators.\n\nAgainst this grim backdrop, only two of Sanchez's subsidiary\n\narguments merit further discussion.\n\n            First, Sanchez asseverates that the \"use of a weapon\"\n\nfactor does not apply because he never actually used the gun.            This\n\nasseveration rings hollow. The relevant guideline provision refers\n\nto the use or possession of a weapon \"in the commission of the\n\noffense.\"     USSG §5K2.6.      To warrant the application of this\n\nprovision, it ordinarily suffices that the defendant and the\n\nshooter are convicted as coconspirators.           See United States v.\n\nConnor, 950 F.2d 1267, 1277 (7th Cir. 1991) (indicating that\n\nsection 5K2.6 will be available where \"the possessor of the gun and\n\nthe defendant are coconspirators, the possessor[] of the gun\n\npossessed it in furtherance of the conspiracy, and the defendant\n\nwas a member of the conspiracy at the time of the possession of the\n\ngun\").\n\n            Second,   Sanchez   makes    a   determined   assault   on   the\n\nsentencing court's use of the \"death resulting\" datum.          Sanchez's\n\nattack rests essentially on two facts:             that Sanchez himself\n\nneither seized control of the victims' car nor pulled the trigger.\n\nThese facts are true as far as they go, but they do not take\n\nSanchez very far.       His argument unrealistically discounts his\n\nactual participation in the criminal activity.             As supportably\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\ffound by the sentencing court, Sanchez, among other things, served\n\na critical function as an available getaway driver and actively\n\nurged Floyd to kill the victims.        We have said before — and today\n\nreaffirm   —   that   section   5K2.1   (encouraging   \"death   resulting\"\n\ndepartures) may bear the weight of an upward departure even when\n\nthe defendant is not the direct cause of the victim's death.\n\nUnited States v. Diaz, 285 F.3d 92, 101 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"We see no\n\nbasis for foreclosing departure under §5K2.1 when a defendant puts\n\ninto motion a chain of events that risks serious injury or death,\n\neven when an intent to harm is entirely absent and the defendant\n\nwas not directly responsible for the death.\"); accord United States\n\nv. Scheetz, 293 F.3d 175, 191 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S.\n\n963 (2002); United States v. White, 979 F.2d 539, 545 (7th Cir.\n\n1992).\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the district court's\n\ndecision to depart upward by three levels in sentencing Sanchez.\n\nV.   THE CHC ASSIGNMENT\n\n           In 1999, Anderson was twice convicted of misdemeanors\n\n(once for obstructing a police officer and once for possession of\n\nmarijuana).    On each occasion, the state court sentenced him to\n\nprobation.     At the disposition hearing in the instant case, the\n\ndistrict court assigned Anderson to CHC III based on the two\n\nmisdemeanor convictions (worth one point apiece toward his criminal\n\nhistory score) and the fact that, at the time of the carjacking, he\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fwas still on probation (worth two points toward his criminal\n\nhistory score).     Anderson deems these four points unwarranted and\n\nmaintains that he should have been assigned to CHC I.            Refined to\n\nbare essence, his argument rests on the notion that the prior\n\nconvictions were improperly considered because Anderson neither had\n\nan attorney at the misdemeanor plea hearings nor knowingly and\n\nintelligently waived his right to counsel.\n\n           This argument runs headlong into a documentary obstacle:\n\nthe state court records contain signed waivers of the right to\n\ncounsel. Anderson attempts to confess and avoid. He concedes that\n\nhe signed the waiver forms but maintains that he never understood\n\nthe forms to waive his right to counsel (he regarded them merely as\n\nboilerplate needed to effectuate his pleas of nolo contendere).\n\n           Anderson advanced this construct in his objections to the\n\nPSI Report.    The district court overruled the objections, stating:\n\n           [Anderson] waived counsel. There's a written\n           waiver in the record that he signed. There's\n           been no evidence to convince me that he didn't\n           understand what he was doing.\n\nOn that basis, the court concluded that the sentencing guidelines\n\nobliged   it   to   take   account    of    both   the   prior   misdemeanor\n\nconvictions and the consequent probationary term.            USSG §§4A1.1,\n\n4A1.2.    It then assigned Anderson to CHC III, observing that, if\n\nanything, CHC III underrepresented the extent of Anderson's prior\n\ncriminal activity.     We discern no error.\n\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\f               We begin with the basics.       In a federal criminal case, a\n\ndefendant's CHC depends upon his criminal history score.                  See id.\n\n§4A1.1, cmt.         Where, as here, the government establishes the\n\nexistence of a prior conviction, the burden shifts to the defendant\n\nto establish that the conviction is constitutionally infirm or\n\notherwise inappropriate for consideration.             United States v. Gray,\n\n177 F.3d 86, 89 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Unger, 915 F.2d\n\n759, 761 (1st Cir. 1990).           If the defendant fails to carry this\n\nburden, the sentencing court may then consider the prior conviction\n\nin     compiling     the   defendant's    criminal     history    score    (and,\n\nultimately, his CHC).\n\n               In   this   instance,   the     government    established    that\n\nAnderson had two prior misdemeanor convictions.                  For his part,\n\nAnderson tried to remove them from the equation by showing that he\n\nwas deprived of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment.\n\nAnderson's argument is a non-starter:            there is no constitutional\n\nright to counsel in a misdemeanor case in which the defendant is\n\nnot sentenced to a term of immurement.            See Scott v. Illinois, 440\n\nU.S.    367,     373-74    (1979)   (holding    that   the   Sixth   Amendment\n\nguarantees a right to counsel only if a misdemeanant ultimately is\n\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment).                That point alone seems\n\nsufficient to derail Anderson's claim.            After all, \"an uncounseled\n\nmisdemeanor conviction, valid under Scott because no prison term\n\nwas imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fsubsequent conviction.\"   Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738,\n\n749 (1994).5\n\n          We add, for the sake of completeness, that Anderson's\n\nclaim has yet another shortcoming.    Even assuming that he had a\n\nright to counsel during the misdemeanor proceedings, the district\n\ncourt found that he had knowingly and intelligently waived that\n\nright.   The standard of review applicable to the district court's\n\nunderlying factual finding — that Anderson understood the import of\n\nthe waivers when he signed them — would be clear error.   Unger, 915\n\nF.2d at 762.   In the circumstances of this case, it simply cannot\n\nbe said that the district court clearly erred in making that\n\ndetermination.\n\n          The proof of the pudding is in the eating.       Anderson\n\nacknowledges that he signed a waiver form with respect to each of\n\nthe prior convictions.    These forms plainly notified him of his\n\n\n     5\n      Anderson might have had a right to counsel under Rhode Island\nlaw. See Nichols, 511 U.S. at 748 n.12 (noting that states are\nallowed to extend the right to counsel beyond the federal right,\nto, for example, all cases in which imprisonment is merely\nauthorized by statute). We need not pursue that possibility for\ntwo reasons. First, Anderson makes no developed argumentation to\nthat effect. Second, the Supreme Court has limited the\ncircumstances in which a defendant can collaterally attack a state\nconviction, for federal sentencing purposes, to cases involving\nSixth Amendment violations. See Custis v. United States, 511 U.S.\n485, 487 (1994) (holding that a defendant in a federal sentencing\nprocedure can collaterally attack prior state convictions only if\nthose convictions were obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment\nright to counsel); see also United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229,\n1237 (1st Cir. 1994) (extending the Custis doctrine to cases\narising under the federal sentencing guidelines).\n\n\n                               -26-\n\fright to consult an attorney of his own choosing or to have one\n\nappointed if he could not afford private representation.                        The\n\nlanguage that appears directly above Anderson's signature on each\n\nform, in bold upper-case letters and partially underscored, is\n\ntelling:\n\n              I HAVE READ AND REVIEWED THE ENTIRE CONTENTS\n              OF THIS PAPER AND I HAVE NO QUESTIONS AS TO\n              WHAT IT STATES AND MEANS AND I UNDERSTAND IT\n              COMPLETELY.   I WISH TO PROCEED WITHOUT A\n              LAWYER REPRESENTING ME KNOWING THE ABOVE\n              RIGHTS. I SWEAR TO THE TRUTH OF THE ABOVE.\n\n              In   an   effort   to   counteract     this   powerful   evidence,\n\nAnderson offers primarily his assertion that he misunderstood the\n\npurport of the proffered documents not once, but twice.                 The short\n\nanswer   to    this     plaint   is   that    the   district   court    found    it\n\nincredible.        That is not the stuff of clear error.            A trial court\n\nis not bound to credit a defendant's self-serving statements.                   See\n\nCuppett v. Duckworth, 8 F.3d 1132, 1139 (7th Cir. 1993) (explaining\n\nthat \"self-serving statements by a defendant that his conviction\n\nwas   constitutionally       infirm    are    insufficient     to   overcome    the\n\npresumption        of   regularity    accorded      state   convictions\");      see\n\ngenerally United States v. Jimenez-Perez, 869 F.2d 9, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (\"It is . . . apodictic that a trier of fact is not bound to\n\naccept the self-serving stories of persons accused.\"); United\n\nStates v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 989 (1st Cir. 1987) (similar).\n\nHere, as elsewhere, the court may draw reasonable inferences from\n\nthe totality of the circumstances.\n\n                                       -27-\n\f          In a last-ditch effort to salvage this claim, Anderson\n\nnotes that the transcript of his August 11, 1999 plea colloquy\n\ncannot be located.    In a related vein, he points out that, when the\n\nstate court judge asked him at the November 19, 1999 hearing\n\nwhether he had any questions as to what was meant by signing the\n\nwaiver form, his response was recorded as \"inaudible.\" These facts\n\nare part of the totality of the circumstances — but in the end,\n\nAnderson adverts to nothing that affirmatively demonstrates the\n\nconstitutional infirmity of the prior convictions.            In the absence\n\nof such evidence, the district court was not obliged to draw\n\ninferences favorable to Anderson from either the wayward transcript\n\nor the inaudible response.     See Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 29-30\n\n(1992) (deciding that reliance on the mere unavailability of a\n\ntranscript does not surmount the \"presumption of regularity\" that\n\nattaches to a final judgment).\n\n          That   ends   this   aspect    of   the   matter.     Credibility\n\ndeterminations at sentencing are within the exclusive province of\n\nthe trial court.     United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1200\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).   Thus, we respect the sentencing court's decision\n\nnot to credit Anderson's testimony that he misunderstood the clear\n\nand pointed language of the waiver forms.           See United States v.\n\nCruz-Alcala, 338 F.3d 1194, 1198 (10th Cir.) (deferring to a\n\ndistrict court's credibility determination in a similar uncounseled\n\nmisdemeanor case), cert. denied, 72 U.S.L.W. 3407 (Dec. 15, 2003).\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\fOn this record, the sentencing court did not err in finding that\n\nAnderson knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.\n\n            This brings us full circle.           The Sentencing Commission\n\nhas gone to some lengths to explain that \"[p]rior sentences, not\n\notherwise excluded, are to be counted in the [defendant's] criminal\n\nhistory score, including uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where\n\nimprisonment was not imposed.\"             USSG §4A1.2, cmt. (backg'd.).\n\nAnderson's prior convictions fit neatly within this integument, and\n\nwe have determined that those prior convictions suffered from no\n\ncognizable constitutional defects.           Consequently, the sentencing\n\ncourt's   calculation   of    Anderson's     criminal    history    score   was\n\nproper.      See   Nichols,   511   U.S.     at    749   (\"[A]n    uncounseled\n\nmisdemeanor conviction, valid under Scott because no prison term\n\nwas imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a\n\nsubsequent conviction.\").        So too was its assignment of this\n\ndefendant to CHC III.\n\nVI.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.           This was a horrific crime,\n\ndemanding stern punishment.         The district court took its task\n\nseriously and approached the matter of sentencing with care.\n\nBecause nothing in the record so much as hints that the court\n\ncommitted reversible error in sentencing either of the appellants,\n\nwe affirm the judgments below.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\f",

TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the disputed sentences were imposed following admissions of guilt, we glean the material facts from the change-of-plea colloquies, the presentence investigation reports (PSI Reports), and the transcripts of the disposition hearings. <i>United States v. Brewster,</i> 127 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir.1991). Those facts paint a grisly picture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of June 8, 2000, Samuel Sanchez, Raymond Anderson, and three other men carjacked Jason Burgeson and Amy Shute at gunpoint. After confronting the pair in downtown Providence, the malefactors appropriated their vehicle, drove in caravan style to a secluded area, murdered the abducted couple in cold blood, and took what little cash they had. The brutal crime attracted immediate attention and the authorities quickly rounded up five suspects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 18, 2000, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Rhode Island indicted Sanchez and Anderson (appellants here) and three others for conspiracy to commit a carjacking and carjacking with death resulting. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 2119, &amp; 2119(3). The appellants eventually pleaded guilty to both counts pursuant to written plea agreements in which the government promised not to seek the death penalty. Two of the other persons accused (Gregory Floyd and Harry Burdick) followed the same course and were sentenced to life imprisonment. The final member of the group (Kenneth Day) went to trial and, at the close of the government's case, moved successfully for judgment of acquittal. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Sanchez on November 7, 2002.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The court arrived at his offense level by applying the first degree murder cross-reference, USSG &#167;&#167; 2A1.1, 2B3.1(c); granting a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <i>id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1; and departing upward by three levels, <i>id.</i> &#167; 5K2.0. These steps yielded a total offense level of 43. The court then computed Sanchez's criminal history score, assigned him to criminal history category (CHC) II, and sentenced him to life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court sentenced Anderson six days later. It applied the first degree murder cross-reference; granted a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; and departed downward by two levels, \"one because of [Anderson's] substantial cooperation and one because he [was] the least culpable.\" These steps yielded a total offense level of 38. After calculating Anderson's criminal history score, the court placed him in CHC III. This combination (offense level 38; CHC III) produced a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 292-365 months. The court thereupon imposed a 30-year incarcerative sentence. These timely appeals ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each appellant advances three assignments of error. Sanchez challenges the district court's denial of a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment, its rejection of his entreaty for a downward departure, and its decision to depart upward. Anderson also challenges the district court's denial of a favorable role-in-the-offense adjustment and its refusal to grant a downward departure based on his state of mind at the time of the homicides. In addition, he questions the calculation of his criminal history score (and, thus, his CHC). We treat the common role-in-the-offense and downward departure issues first. We then address Sanchez's objection to the district court's upward departure and Anderson's complaint about the supposedly unwarranted inflation of his criminal history score.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ROLE IN THE OFFENSE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the appellants' claims that they deserved two-level reductions because they were minor participants in the offenses of conviction. A defendant who seeks a downward role adjustment must bear the burden of proof on that issue. <i>United States v. Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d 330, 332-33 (1st Cir.1990). The ensuing question &#8212; whether to reduce the defendant's offense level due to his minor or minimal role in the offense &#8212; is an inquiry heavily driven by the facts. <i>See United States v. Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc); USSG &#167; 3B1.2, cmt. (n.3(C)). Because the sentencing court has a superior coign of vantage, we must defer to its findings of fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous. <i>Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d at 333. If a set of facts can lead plausibly to competing inferences, the sentencing court's choice among them cannot be termed a clear error. <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 4; <i>United States v. Ruiz,</i> 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collectively, these standards are not appellant-friendly. Recognizing that reality, we have warned that \"absent a mistake of law, battles over a defendant's status ... will almost always be won or lost in the district court.\" <i>United States v. Graciani,</i> 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Sanchez's Role in the Offense.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez asserts that he neither introduced nor used the murder weapon, eschewed any participation in the robbery of the victims, and never threatened to rape Shute. On this basis, he argues that he was less culpable than his coconspirators and therefore deserving of a two-level downward adjustment as a minor participant. USSG &#167; 3B1.2(b). The district court rejected this assertion, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission has explained that section 3B1.2 \"provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3B1.2, cmt. (n.3(A)). The roster of available adjustments includes a modest adjustment for minor participation and a somewhat more generous adjustment for minimal participation. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3B1.2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We have ruled that a defendant who aspires to be classified as a minor participant bears the burden of proving that he is both (i) less culpable than most other participants in the offenses of conviction, and (ii) less culpable than the average miscreant involved in offenses of the same genre. <i>See United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d 146, 149 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d at 333. Sanchez cannot conceivably run that gauntlet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry. Sanchez effectively admitted during the change-of-plea colloquy that he furnished the car used in committing the crimes, drove his comrades around downtown Providence in search of victims, held himself available as a \"getaway driver\" should the attempted carjacking go awry, suggested where to take the victims following their abduction, searched the carjacked vehicle for valuables, and used some of the appropriated cash. He also admitted that other participants would testify that he urged one of his companions (Floyd) to shoot the victims and that he offered to kill them himself should Floyd balk. Given this scenario, it beggars credulity to think that Sanchez could qualify as a minor participant in the criminal activity. Consequently, we discern no error, clear or otherwise, in the sentencing court's denial of his request for a role reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Anderson's Role in the Offense.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson's claim that he deserved a two-level reduction as a minor participant is somewhat more credible. He begins with the sentencing court's comment, voiced during the disposition hearing, that \"[h]e was the least culpable [of the gang] because he didn't participate in the actual shooting, and he didn't urge or demand that these innocent young people be killed.\" This might be thought faint praise, but we assume, for argument's sake, that it constitutes a finding sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the test for minor participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Anderson pleaded guilty both to conspiracy to commit carjacking and to carjacking resulting in death, the relevant charge for the comparative analysis required by the second prong of the \"minor participant\" test is carjacking resulting in death. <i>Cf. Jones v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 227, 229, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) (holding that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 defines three distinct crimes &#8212; simple carjacking, carjacking resulting in serious bodily injury, and carjacking resulting in death). In an effort to satisfy this prong, Anderson points to the sentencing court's explicit finding that he lacked an intent to kill and concludes that he must perforce be less culpable than the average felon convicted of carjacking resulting in death. This conclusion does not follow from the indicated premise: whether a carjacker did &#8212; or did not &#8212; harbor a subjective intent to kill is not a fact of talismanic significance to a role-in-the-offense decision in a case of carjacking resulting in death. Regardless of the lack of an intent to kill, the instant record contains ample evidence from which the sentencing court reasonably could have concluded that Anderson was no less culpable than the average defendant convicted of that offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, a rational trier easily could have found that Anderson recruited an accomplice (Sanchez) who made available the car used in committing the crimes; that he accompanied his coconspirators on their prowl through downtown Providence as they hunted for potential victims; that he served as a lookout while the group abducted not one but two innocent young people; that he ordered the victims to exit the carjacked vehicle once the caravan had reached the murder site; that he removed jewelry from Shute's person just prior to her execution; and that he expressed no disapproval when his compatriots discussed the desirability of murdering the victims. Given Anderson's continuous presence and his willing participation in the aforedescribed events, the lower court plausibly could have inferred, from the totality of the circumstances, that he had failed to prove his entitlement to a minor participation credit. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Nu&#241;ez-Rodriguez,</i> 92 F.3d 14, 24 (1st Cir.1996) (finding no clear error in denial of minor role adjustment when defendant participated in planning the carjacking, drove around with two coconspirators for several hours searching for a likely victim, approached the chosen victim with an armed associate, and drove the carjacked vehicle from the scene despite having heard the fatal gunshot). We conclude, therefore, that the sentencing court's denial of a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DOWNWARD DEPARTURES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each appellant sought the benefit of a guideline provision (Application Note 1) that authorizes a downward departure from the base offense level mandated by the first degree murder cross-reference (43) \"[i]f the defendant did not cause the death intentionally or knowingly.\" USSG &#167; 2A1.1, cmt. (n.1). The district court rejected these requests (although it granted Anderson a downward departure on other grounds, <i>see supra</i>). The appellants attempt to challenge these rejections. That is easier said than done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, a sentencing court's discretionary refusal to depart is unreviewable. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 30 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir.1994). At first blush, that rule would seem to apply here because the decision whether to grant a departure pursuant to Application Note 1 (appended to section 2A1.1) lies completely within the discretion of the sentencing court. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 29-30; <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 2A1.1, cmt. (n.1) (explaining that \"downward departure <i>may</i> be warranted\" (emphasis supplied)). But this general rule &#8212; like most general rules &#8212; admits of certain exceptions. One such exception covers cases in which the sentencing court misapprehends its authority to depart. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 30; <i>United States v. Gifford,</i> 17 F.3d 462, 473 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each appellant endeavors to fit his case within the narrow confines of this exception. As we explain below, neither succeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Sanchez's Departure Request.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez starts by adverting to case law that requires trial courts to analyze a defendant's mental state after determining that section 2A1.1 applies. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Carr,</i> 303 F.3d 539, 544-48 (4th Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 1138, 123 S.Ct. 929, 154 L.Ed.2d 832 (2003); <i>United States v. Prevatte,</i> 16 F.3d 767, 784 (7th Cir.1994). Using these cases as a springboard, he seeks to drape the denial of his departure request in the raiment of reviewability by insisting that the sentencing court's failure to make a detailed determination of his state of mind at the time of the slayings demonstrated a misapprehension of its power to depart. This argument does little to persuade us that the sentencing court was unaware of its departure-granting authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court had <i>granted</i> a downward departure on the basis of Application Note 1, it would have had to factor in the defendant's state of mind to assess the <i>extent</i> of the departure. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 2A1.1, cmt. (n.1) (explaining that if a departure is granted, the sentencing court should base its extent, inter alia, \"upon the defendant's state of mind\"). But no such direction is provided as to the underlying decision to depart &#8212; and here, the district court <i>denied</i> the departure request. Thus, the issue is not what analysis the district court made, but, rather, whether it was required to make particularized findings at all. We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, sentencing courts are under no obligation to make specific findings when <i>denying</i> departure requests. <i>See United States v. DeCosta,</i> 37 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining that \"the district court is not required to give reasons for refusing to depart\"). We agree with the Tenth Circuit that this precept extends with undiminished force to the denial of an Application Note 1 departure. <i>See United States v. Nichols,</i> 169 F.3d 1255, 1276-77 (10th Cir.1999) (concluding that \"[n]othing in [USSG &#167; 2A1.1] requires a district court to make any findings when deciding whether to depart\"). Indeed, we held as much, albeit in an unpublished opinion, in <i>United States v. Diaz-Pabon,</i> 187 F.3d 623 (1st Cir.1998) (table), in which we ruled that \"the sentencing court was under no duty to analyze the factors set forth in Application Note 1 to justify its discretionary decision not to depart from the guidelines....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That holding undermines Sanchez's argument. Because the district court had no obligation to make specific findings, we cannot interpret the absence of a detailed discussion of Sanchez's state of mind as an indication that the court misunderstood its discretionary powers. <i>See United States v. Grandmaison,</i> 77 F.3d 555, 564-65 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that mere ambiguity in the sentencing record is insufficient to render the court's refusal to depart reviewable on appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we must consider the whole of the record when determining whether a sentencing court misapprehended its authority to depart. <i>See United States v. DeLeon,</i> 187 F.3d 60, 69 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 46 F.3d 127, 130-31 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Gifford,</i> 17 F.3d at 474-75. Here, the district court supportably found that Sanchez had urged Floyd to shoot the victims and had offered to kill them himself if Floyd faltered. At least implicit in those findings was the court's conclusion that Sanchez had an intent to kill (and, consequently, that he was ineligible for the desired departure). Viewed in this light, it cannot be said that the sentencing court misunderstood its departure-granting authority. Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review Sanchez's assignment of error. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 30 (\"[W]e lack jurisdiction to review the court's refusal to invoke Application Note 1 unless there is some reason to believe that the court misunderstood its options.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Anderson's Departure Request.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson &#8212; like Sanchez &#8212; seeks to characterize his case as one in which the district court misperceived the extent of its authority to depart under Application Note 1. Specifically, Anderson spotlights the sentencing court's statement that \"[h]e didn't have an intent to kill\" and complains that the court failed to realize that this finding paved the way for a possible downward departure. To prove his point, Anderson singles out a passage from the transcript of the disposition hearing, in which the judge explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that he shouldn't have a total offense level of 43 because he had no intent to kill. But as I've just indicated, he is charged with that intent because he is an aider and abettor, and whether it's considered a second degree murder or a first degree murder, if it was tried in the state courts the fact of the matter is that he was an accessory before the fact of murder in this case. So the total offense level of 43 is correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Anderson's view, this rationale reveals the court's total unfamiliarity with the authority granted to it by Application Note 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson's argument elevates hope over reason. The sentencing court's attempt to explain why it chose not to depart, despite Anderson's perceived lack of an intent to kill, was not especially articulate &#8212; but what is conspicuously absent from the quoted passage is any indication that the court felt constrained in its ability to depart. Application Note 1 gives the sentencing court discretion to depart or not, as the court sees fit, if it finds that a given defendant did not cause the death intentionally or knowingly. On a fair reading of the court's comments in this case, it seems highly likely that the court was looking to analogous state criminal law for guidance on how to exercise that discretion. The fact that the court had recognized its authority to depart under the self-same rubric at Sanchez's sentencing &#8212; held just six days earlier &#8212; reinforces this conclusion. We therefore dismiss Anderson's assignment of error as unreviewable. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE UPWARD DEPARTURE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court ruled that Sanchez's case fell outside the heartland of comparable carjacking cases and determined that a three-level upward departure was appropriate. The court based this determination on five factors: death resulting, abduction, use of a weapon, extreme conduct, and criminal purpose. Each of these is a recognized &#8212; indeed, an encouraged &#8212; ground for a departure. <i>See</i> USSG &#167;&#167; 5K2.1 (death resulting), 5K2.4 (abduction), 5K2.6 (use of a weapon), 5K2.8 (extreme conduct), 5K2.9 (criminal purpose); <i>see generally Koon v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 94, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (\"Encouraged factors are those `the [Sentencing] Commission has not been able to take into account fully in formulating the guidelines.'\" (quoting USSG &#167; 5K2.0)). If the sentencing court finds an encouraged factor in a particular case, \"the court is authorized to depart if the applicable Guideline does not already take it into account.\" <i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 96, 116 S.Ct. 2035.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez assigns error to the departure decision, insisting (i) that the court's consideration of these five factors constituted double counting, and (ii) that, in all events, their application was unwarranted in his case. We disagree with these allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing Sanchez's claims, we comment briefly upon the standard of review. The law is currently unsettled as to whether the PROTECT Act, Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650, 670, to be <i>codified at</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e) (2003), applies to departure decisions made prior to April 30, 2003 (the Act's effective date).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, our standard of review is in doubt. <i>Compare id.</i> (directing de novo review of departure decisions), <i>with United States v. Dethlefs,</i> 123 F.3d 39, 43-44 (1st Cir.1997) (describing more deferential pre-PROTECT Act standard of review). Here, however, we would affirm the district court's departure decision under either standard, and so we leave the question unresolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Double Counting.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez's first claim &#8212; double counting &#8212; posits that the departure factors relied upon by the district court were already adequately taken into account, either as specific offense characteristics or as other adjustments, in determining his GSR. We are fully satisfied that the sentencing court did not engage in any double counting when it considered four of the five factors &#8212; abduction (&#167; 5K2.4), use of a weapon (&#167; 5K2.6), extreme conduct (&#167; 5K2.8), and criminal purpose (&#167; 5K2.9) &#8212; as grounds for an upward departure. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez makes no coherent argument as to why the sentencing court's use of extreme conduct or criminal purpose in the departure calculus would constitute double counting. In contrast, his argument as to abduction and use of a weapon is coherent but unavailing. It hinges on the fact that the carjacking guideline is derived from, and generally congruent with, the guideline for robbery. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 2B3.1. Seizing on this congruence, Sanchez notes that the guideline for robbery allows for the consideration of abduction and use of a weapon when calculating a defendant's base offense level. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2B3.1(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does not follow, however, that abduction and use of a weapon are already taken into account in carjacking cases in which the murder enhancement applies. Once a court decides upon the applicability of the first degree murder cross-reference, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2B3.1(c), proper procedure requires it to ignore the specific offense characteristics listed under the robbery guideline and move directly to USSG &#167; 2A1.1. The sentencing court followed this protocol in Sanchez's case. Consequently, there was no double counting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the sentencing court's application of the \"death resulting\" factor (&#167; 5K2.1). It is at least arguable that this can be construed as double counting: the court might already have provided an enhancement for the fact that the carjacking resulted in death when it followed the instructions found in USSG &#167; 2B3.1(c) and applied the first degree murder cross-reference. <i>See United States v. Barber,</i> 119 F.3d 276, 280-81 &amp; n. 3 (4th Cir.1997) (suggesting that the first degree murder guideline already takes into account the fact that death resulted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This logic is not defeated by the fact that sentencing courts are authorized, in certain circumstances, to depart from the guidelines even though the reason for departure has been taken into consideration as a specific offense characteristic or other adjustment. That authorization is limited to situations in which \"the court determines that, in light of unusual circumstances, the weight attached to [the relevant] factor under the guidelines is inadequate.\" USSG &#167; 5K2.0. It would be surpassingly difficult to contend that the first degree murder cross-reference (which raised Sanchez's offense level to 43 &#8212; the maximum contemplated by the sentencing guidelines) attributed inadequate weight to the victims' deaths.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, this case is different in the sense that two persons &#8212; not just one &#8212; were slain. That distinguishing characteristic might very well suffice to counter the charge of double counting. Courts may consider whether the crime resulted in multiple deaths when determining the <i>extent</i> of a departure, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 5K2.1, and, by analogy, it would seem sensible to allow consideration of that fact in determining whether to depart at all. Moreover, Sanchez would have received the same base offense level had the carjacking resulted in only one death, so it might well be said that the first degree murder cross-reference failed to take the second death into account. These considerations would tend to justify departing upward. <i>Cf. United States v. Menzer,</i> 29 F.3d 1223, 1234-35 (7th Cir.1994) (using similar reasoning to support an upward departure in light of the arson guideline's second degree murder cross-reference).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, however, we need not resolve this question. Even if the sentencing court engaged in double counting with regard to the \"death resulting\" factor &#8212; a matter that we do not decide &#8212; the departure as a whole would be sustainable. We have said in the past that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a departure which rests on a combination of valid and invalid grounds may be affirmed so long as (1) the direction and degree of the departure are reasonable in relation to the remaining (valid) ground, (2) excision of the improper ground does not obscure or defeat the expressed reasoning of the district court, and (3) the reviewing court is left, on the record as a whole, with the definite and firm conviction that removal of the inappropriate ground would not be likely to alter the district court's view of the sentence rightfully to be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Diaz-Bastardo,</i> 929 F.2d 798, 800 (1st Cir.1991); <i>see also Williams v. United States,</i> 503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992); <i>Nu&#241;ez-Rodriguez,</i> 92 F.3d at 19. These requirements are fully satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the four remaining factors cited by the sentencing court provide ample justification for the relatively moderate three-level upward departure. Notwithstanding Sanchez's hyperbolic efforts to classify the extent of the departure as unreasonable, we previously have affirmed similar (and even significantly larger) departures, including departures based upon analogous circumstances. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Carrion-Cruz,</i> 92 F.3d 5, 6-7 (1st Cir.1996) (per curiam) (affirming a three-level departure from level 40 to level 43 due to the \"sordid facts\" in a multiple-death carjacking case); <i>see also United States v. Chapman,</i> 241 F.3d 57, 65 (1st Cir.2001) (collecting First Circuit cases affirming departures ranging up to 300%).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> As to the final element of the <i>Diaz-Bastardo</i> test, the district court made abundantly clear its belief that the only appropriate sentencing outcome for Sanchez was life imprisonment. The double-counting claim is, therefore, impuissant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Sanchez argues that whether or not these five factors were legally available, they were factually unsupported (and, thus, should not have figured in the departure calculus). This is whistling past the graveyard: the record contains more than enough evidence to justify the use of each of the five factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A detailed exegesis would serve no useful purpose. The short of it is that the victims were abducted at gunpoint and transported to a secluded location, where they were psychologically tormented for a period of time before being murdered execution-style in order to protect the identities of the perpetrators. Against this grim backdrop, only two of Sanchez's subsidiary arguments merit further discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Sanchez asseverates that the \"use of a weapon\" factor does not apply because he never actually used the gun. This asseveration rings hollow. The relevant guideline provision refers to the use or possession of a weapon \"in the commission of the offense.\" USSG &#167; 5K2.6. To warrant the application of this provision, it ordinarily suffices that the defendant and the shooter are convicted as coconspirators. <i>See United States v. Connor,</i> 950 F.2d 1267, 1277 (7th Cir.1991) (indicating that section 5K2.6 will be available where \"the possessor of the gun and the defendant are coconspirators, the possessor[] of the gun possessed it in furtherance of the conspiracy, and the defendant was a member of the conspiracy at the time of the possession of the gun\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Sanchez makes a determined assault on the sentencing court's use of the \"death resulting\" datum. Sanchez's attack rests essentially on two facts: that Sanchez himself neither seized control of the victims' car nor pulled the trigger. These facts are true as far as they go, but they do not take Sanchez very far. His argument unrealistically discounts his actual participation in the criminal activity. As supportably found by the sentencing court, Sanchez, among other things, served a critical function as an available getaway driver and actively urged Floyd to kill the victims. We have said before &#8212; and today reaffirm &#8212; that section 5K2.1 (encouraging \"death resulting\" departures) may bear the weight of an upward departure even when the defendant is not the direct cause of the victim's death. <i>United States v. Diaz,</i> 285 F.3d 92, 101 (1st Cir.2002) (\"We see no basis for foreclosing departure under &#167; 5K2.1 when a defendant puts into motion a chain of events that risks serious injury or death, even when an intent to harm is entirely absent and the defendant was not directly responsible for the death.\"); <i>accord United States v. Scheetz,</i> 293 F.3d 175, 191 (4th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 963, 123 S.Ct. 397, 154 L.Ed.2d 320 (2002); <i>United States v. White,</i> 979 F.2d 539, 545 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the district court's decision to depart upward by three levels in sentencing Sanchez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. THE CHC ASSIGNMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, Anderson was twice convicted of misdemeanors (once for obstructing a police officer and once for possession of marijuana). On each occasion, the state court sentenced him to probation. At the disposition hearing in the instant case, the district court assigned Anderson to CHC III based on the two misdemeanor convictions (worth one point apiece toward his criminal history score) and the fact that, at the time of the carjacking, he was still on probation (worth two points toward his criminal history score). Anderson deems these four points unwarranted and maintains that he should have been assigned to CHC I. Refined to bare essence, his argument rests on the notion that the prior convictions were improperly considered because Anderson neither had an attorney at the misdemeanor plea hearings nor knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument runs headlong into a documentary obstacle: the state court records contain signed waivers of the right to counsel. Anderson attempts to confess and avoid. He concedes that he signed the waiver forms but maintains that he never understood the forms to waive his right to counsel (he regarded them merely as boilerplate needed to effectuate his pleas of nolo contendere).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson advanced this construct in his objections to the PSI Report. The district court overruled the objections, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Anderson] waived counsel. There's a written waiver in the record that he signed. There's been no evidence to convince me that he didn't understand what he was doing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that basis, the court concluded that the sentencing guidelines obliged it to take account of both the prior misdemeanor convictions and the consequent probationary term. USSG &#167;&#167; 4A1.1, 4A1.2. It then assigned Anderson to CHC III, observing that, if anything, CHC III underrepresented the extent of Anderson's prior criminal activity. We discern no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the basics. In a federal criminal case, a defendant's CHC depends upon his criminal history score. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 4A1.1, cmt. Where, as here, the government establishes the existence of a prior conviction, the burden shifts to the defendant to establish that the conviction is constitutionally infirm or otherwise inappropriate for consideration. <i>United States v. Gray,</i> 177 F.3d 86, 89 (1st Cir. 1999); <i>United States v. Unger,</i> 915 F.2d 759, 761 (1st Cir.1990). If the defendant fails to carry this burden, the sentencing court may then consider the prior conviction in compiling the defendant's criminal history score (and, ultimately, his CHC).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the government established that Anderson had two prior misdemeanor convictions. For his part, Anderson tried to remove them from the equation by showing that he was deprived of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Anderson's argument is a non-starter: there is no constitutional right to counsel in a misdemeanor case in which the defendant is not sentenced to a term of immurement. <i>See Scott v. Illinois,</i> 440 U.S. 367, 373-74, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979) (holding that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to counsel only if a misdemeanant ultimately is sentenced to a term of imprisonment). That point alone seems sufficient to derail Anderson's claim. After all, \"an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under <i>Scott</i> because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.\" <i>Nichols v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 738, 749, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, for the sake of completeness, that Anderson's claim has yet another shortcoming. Even assuming that he had a right to counsel during the misdemeanor proceedings, the district court found that he had knowingly and intelligently waived that right. The standard of review applicable to the district court's underlying factual finding &#8212; that Anderson understood the import of the waivers when he signed them &#8212; would be clear error. <i>Unger,</i> 915 F.2d at 762. In the circumstances of this case, it simply cannot be said that the district court clearly erred in making that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Anderson acknowledges that he signed a waiver form with respect to each of the prior convictions. These forms plainly notified him of his right to consult an attorney of his own choosing or to have one appointed if he could not afford private representation. The language that appears directly above Anderson's signature on each form, in bold upper-case letters and partially underscored, is telling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I HAVE READ AND REVIEWED THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THIS PAPER AND I HAVE NO QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT IT STATES AND MEANS AND I UNDERSTAND IT COMPLETELY. I WISH TO PROCEED WITHOUT A LAWYER REPRESENTING ME KNOWING THE ABOVE RIGHTS. <i>I SWEAR TO THE TRUTH OF THE ABOVE.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to counteract this powerful evidence, Anderson offers primarily his assertion that he misunderstood the purport of the proffered documents not once, but twice. The short answer to this plaint is that the district court found it incredible. That is not the stuff of clear error. A trial court is not bound to credit a defendant's self-serving statements. <i>See Cuppett v. Duckworth,</i> 8 F.3d 1132, 1139 (7th Cir.1993) (explaining that \"self-serving statements by a defendant that his conviction was constitutionally infirm are insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity accorded state convictions\"); <i>see generally United States v. Jimenez-Perez,</i> 869 F.2d 9, 12 (1st Cir.1989) (\"It is... apodictic that a trier of fact is not bound to accept the self-serving stories of persons accused.\"); <i>United States v. Cintolo,</i> 818 F.2d 980, 989 (1st Cir.1987) (similar). Here, as elsewhere, the court may draw reasonable inferences from the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to salvage this claim, Anderson notes that the transcript of his August 11, 1999 plea colloquy cannot be located. In a related vein, he points out that, when the state court judge asked him at the November 19, 1999 hearing whether he had any questions as to what was meant by signing the waiver form, his response was recorded as \"inaudible.\" These facts are part of the totality of the circumstances &#8212; but in the end, Anderson adverts to nothing that affirmatively demonstrates the constitutional infirmity of the prior convictions. In the absence of such evidence, the district court was not obliged to draw inferences favorable to Anderson from either the wayward transcript or the inaudible response. <i>See Parke v. Raley,</i> 506 U.S. 20, 29-30, 113 S.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992) (deciding that reliance on the mere unavailability of a transcript does not surmount the \"presumption of regularity\" that attaches to a final judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Credibility determinations at sentencing are within the exclusive province of the trial court. <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1200 (1st Cir.1993). Thus, we respect the sentencing court's decision not to credit Anderson's testimony that he misunderstood the clear and pointed language of the waiver forms. <i>See United States v. Cruz-Alcala,</i> 338 F.3d 1194, 1198 (10th Cir.) (deferring to a district court's credibility determination in a similar uncounseled misdemeanor case), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1094, 124 S.Ct. 970, 157 L.Ed.2d 803 (2003). On this record, the sentencing court did not err in finding that Anderson knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us full circle. The Sentencing Commission has gone to some lengths to explain that \"[p]rior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the [defendant's] criminal history score, including uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was not imposed.\" USSG &#167; 4A1.2, cmt. (backg'd.). Anderson's prior convictions fit neatly within this integument, and we have determined that those prior convictions suffered from no cognizable constitutional defects. Consequently, the sentencing court's calculation of Anderson's criminal history score was proper. <i>See Nichols,</i> 511 U.S. at 749, 114 S.Ct. 1921 (\"[A]n uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under <i>Scott</i> because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.\"). So too was its assignment of this defendant to CHC III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI.

TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the disputed sentences were imposed following admissions of guilt, we glean the material facts from the change-of-plea colloquies, the presentence investigation reports (PSI Reports), and the transcripts of the disposition hearings. <i>United States v. Brewster,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197582\"><a href=\"/opinion/197582/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v.

Those facts paint a grisly picture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of June 8, 2000, Samuel Sanchez, Raymond Anderson, and three other men carjacked Jason Burgeson and Amy Shute at gunpoint. After confronting the pair in downtown Providence, the malefactors appropriated their vehicle, drove in caravan style to a secluded area, murdered the abducted couple in cold blood, and took what little cash they had. The brutal crime attracted immediate attention and the authorities quickly rounded up five suspects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 18, 2000, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Rhode Island indicted Sanchez and Anderson (appellants here) and three others for conspiracy to commit a carjacking and carjacking with death resulting. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 2119, &amp; 2119(3). The appellants eventually pleaded guilty to both counts pursuant to written plea agreements in which the government promised not to seek the death penalty. Two of the other persons accused (Gregory Floyd and Harry Burdick) followed the same course and were sentenced to life imprisonment. The final member of the group (Kenneth Day) went to trial and, at the close of the government's case, moved successfully for judgment of acquittal. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Sanchez on November 7, 2002.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The court arrived at his offense level by applying the first degree murder cross-reference, USSG &#167;&#167; 2A1.1, 2B3.1(c); granting a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <i>id.</i> &#167; 3E1.1; and departing upward by three levels, <i>id.</i> &#167; 5K2.0. These steps yielded a total offense level of 43. The court then computed Sanchez's criminal history score, assigned him to criminal history category (CHC) II, and sentenced him to life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court sentenced Anderson six days later. It applied the first degree murder cross-reference; granted a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; and departed downward by two levels, \"one because of [Anderson's] substantial cooperation and one because he [was] the least culpable.\" These steps yielded a total offense level of 38. After calculating Anderson's criminal history score, the court placed him in CHC III. This combination (offense level 38; CHC III) produced a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 292-365 months. The court thereupon imposed a 30-year incarcerative sentence. These timely appeals ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each appellant advances three assignments of error. Sanchez challenges the district court's denial of a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment, its rejection of his entreaty for a downward departure, and its decision to depart upward. Anderson also challenges the district court's denial of a favorable role-in-the-offense adjustment and its refusal to grant a downward departure based on his state of mind at the time of the homicides. In addition, he questions the calculation of his criminal history score (and, thus, his CHC). We treat the common role-in-the-offense and downward departure issues first. We then address Sanchez's objection to the district court's upward departure and Anderson's complaint about the supposedly unwarranted inflation of his criminal history score.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ROLE IN THE OFFENSE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the appellants' claims that they deserved two-level reductions because they were minor participants in the offenses of conviction. A defendant who seeks a downward role adjustment must bear the burden of proof on that issue. <i>United States v. Ocasio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 332-33 (1st Cir.1990). The ensuing question &#8212; whether to reduce the defendant's offense level due to his minor or minimal role in the offense &#8212; is an inquiry heavily driven by the facts. <i>See United States v. Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744197\"><a href=\"/opinion/744197/united-states-v-ceferino-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc); USSG &#167; 3B1.2, cmt. (n.3(C)). Because the sentencing court has a superior coign of vantage, we must defer to its findings of fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous. <i>Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d at 333. If a set of facts can lead plausibly to competing inferences, the sentencing court's choice among them cannot be termed a clear error. <i>Cruz,</i> 120 F.3d at 4; <i>United States v. Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543063\"><a href=\"/opinion/543063/united-states-v-fausto-d-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 508 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collectively, these standards are not appellant-friendly. Recognizing that reality, we have warned that \"absent a mistake of law, battles over a defendant's status ... will almost always be won or lost in the district court.\" <i>United States v. Graciani,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196199\"><a href=\"/opinion/196199/united-states-v-graciani/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Sanchez's Role in the Offense.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez asserts that he neither introduced nor used the murder weapon, eschewed any participation in the robbery of the victims, and never threatened to rape Shute. On this basis, he argues that he was less culpable than his coconspirators and therefore deserving of a two-level downward adjustment as a minor participant. USSG &#167; 3B1.2(b). The district court rejected this assertion, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission has explained that section 3B1.2 \"provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3B1.2, cmt. (n.3(A)). The roster of available adjustments includes a modest adjustment for minor participation and a somewhat more generous adjustment for minimal participation. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3B1.2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We have ruled that a defendant who aspires to be classified as a minor participant bears the burden of proving that he is both (i) less culpable than most other participants in the offenses of conviction, and (ii) less culpable than the average miscreant involved in offenses of the same genre. <i>See United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198902\"><a href=\"/opinion/198902/united-states-v-ortiz-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 149 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Ocasio,</i> 914 F.2d at 333. Sanchez cannot conceivably run that gauntlet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry. Sanchez effectively admitted during the change-of-plea colloquy that he furnished the car used in committing the crimes, drove his comrades around downtown Providence in search of victims, held himself available as a \"getaway driver\" should the attempted carjacking go awry, suggested where to take the victims following their abduction, searched the carjacked vehicle for valuables, and used some of the appropriated cash. He also admitted that other participants would testify that he urged one of his companions (Floyd) to shoot the victims and that he offered to kill them himself should Floyd balk. Given this scenario, it beggars credulity to think that Sanchez could qualify as a minor participant in the criminal activity. Consequently, we discern no error, clear or otherwise, in the sentencing court's denial of his request for a role reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Anderson's Role in the Offense.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson's claim that he deserved a two-level reduction as a minor participant is somewhat more credible. He begins with the sentencing court's comment, voiced during the disposition hearing, that \"[h]e was the least culpable [of the gang] because he didn't participate in the actual shooting, and he didn't urge or demand that these innocent young people be killed.\" This might be thought faint praise, but we assume, for argument's sake, that it constitutes a finding sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the test for minor participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Anderson pleaded guilty both to conspiracy to commit carjacking and to carjacking resulting in death, the relevant charge for the comparative analysis required by the second prong of the \"minor participant\" test is carjacking resulting in death. <i>Cf. Jones v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 229, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span> (1999) (holding that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 defines three distinct crimes &#8212; simple carjacking, carjacking resulting in serious bodily injury, and carjacking resulting in death). In an effort to satisfy this prong, Anderson points to the sentencing court's explicit finding that he lacked an intent to kill and concludes that he must perforce be less culpable than the average felon convicted of carjacking resulting in death. This conclusion does not follow from the indicated premise: whether a carjacker did &#8212; or did not &#8212; harbor a subjective intent to kill is not a fact of talismanic significance to a role-in-the-offense decision in a case of carjacking resulting in death. Regardless of the lack of an intent to kill, the instant record contains ample evidence from which the sentencing court reasonably could have concluded that Anderson was no less culpable than the average defendant convicted of that offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, a rational trier easily could have found that Anderson recruited an accomplice (Sanchez) who made available the car used in committing the crimes; that he accompanied his coconspirators on their prowl through downtown Providence as they hunted for potential victims; that he served as a lookout while the group abducted not one but two innocent young people; that he ordered the victims to exit the carjacked vehicle once the caravan had reached the murder site; that he removed jewelry from Shute's person just prior to her execution; and that he expressed no disapproval when his compatriots discussed the desirability of murdering the victims. Given Anderson's continuous presence and his willing participation in the aforedescribed events, the lower court plausibly could have inferred, from the totality of the circumstances, that he had failed to prove his entitlement to a minor participation credit. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Nu&#241;ez-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723914\"><a href=\"/opinion/723914/united-states-v-josee-antonio-nunez-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1996) (finding no clear error in denial of minor role adjustment when defendant participated in planning the carjacking, drove around with two coconspirators for several hours searching for a likely victim, approached the chosen victim with an armed associate, and drove the carjacked vehicle from the scene despite having heard the fatal gunshot). We conclude, therefore, that the sentencing court's denial of a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DOWNWARD DEPARTURES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each appellant sought the benefit of a guideline provision (Application Note 1) that authorizes a downward departure from the base offense level mandated by the first degree murder cross-reference (43) \"[i]f the defendant did not cause the death intentionally or knowingly.\" USSG &#167; 2A1.1, cmt. (n.1). The district court rejected these requests (although it granted Anderson a downward departure on other grounds, <i>see supra</i>). The appellants attempt to challenge these rejections. That is easier said than done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, a sentencing court's discretionary refusal to depart is unreviewable. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Teeter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199507\"><a href=\"/opinion/199507/united-states-v-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Pierro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195522\"><a href=\"/opinion/195522/united-states-v-pierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 619 (1st Cir.1994). At first blush, that rule would seem to apply here because the decision whether to grant a departure pursuant to Application Note 1 (appended to section 2A1.1) lies completely within the discretion of the sentencing court. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 29-30; <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 2A1.1, cmt. (n.1) (explaining that \"downward departure <i>may</i> be warranted\" (emphasis supplied)). But this general rule &#8212; like most general rules &#8212; admits of certain exceptions. One such exception covers cases in which the sentencing court misapprehends its authority to depart. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 30; <i>United States v. Gifford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195222\"><a href=\"/opinion/195222/united-states-v-gifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 473 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each appellant endeavors to fit his case within the narrow confines of this exception. As we explain below, neither succeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Sanchez's Departure Request.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez starts by adverting to case law that requires trial courts to analyze a defendant's mental state after determining that section 2A1.1 applies. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Carr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779116\"><a href=\"/opinion/779116/united-states-v-adam-nicklous-carr/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span>, 544-48 (4th Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1138</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Using these cases as a springboard, he seeks to drape the denial of his departure request in the raiment of reviewability by insisting that the sentencing court's failure to make a detailed determination of his state of mind at the time of the slayings demonstrated a misapprehension of its power to depart. This argument does little to persuade us that the sentencing court was unaware of its departure-granting authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court had <i>granted</i> a downward departure on the basis of Application Note 1, it would have had to factor in the defendant's state of mind to assess the <i>extent</i> of the departure. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 2A1.1, cmt. (n.1) (explaining that if a departure is granted, the sentencing court should base its extent, inter alia, \"upon the defendant's state of mind\"). But no such direction is provided as to the underlying decision to depart &#8212; and here, the district court <i>denied</i> the departure request. Thus, the issue is not what analysis the district court made, but, rather, whether it was required to make particularized findings at all. We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, sentencing courts are under no obligation to make specific findings when <i>denying</i> departure requests. <i>See United States v.

We agree with the Tenth Circuit that this precept extends with undiminished force to the denial of an Application Note 1 departure. <i>See United States v.

Indeed, we held as much, albeit in an unpublished opinion, in <i>United States v.

Because the district court had no obligation to make specific findings, we cannot interpret the absence of a detailed discussion of Sanchez's state of mind as an indication that the court misunderstood its discretionary powers. <i>See United States v. Grandmaison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196611\"><a href=\"/opinion/196611/united-states-v-grandmaison/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 564-65 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that mere ambiguity in the sentencing record is insufficient to render the court's refusal to depart reviewable on appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we must consider the whole of the record when determining whether a sentencing court misapprehended its authority to depart. <i>See United States v.

Here, the district court supportably found that Sanchez had urged Floyd to shoot the victims and had offered to kill them himself if Floyd faltered. At least implicit in those findings was the court's conclusion that Sanchez had an intent to kill (and, consequently, that he was ineligible for the desired departure). Viewed in this light, it cannot be said that the sentencing court misunderstood its departure-granting authority. Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review Sanchez's assignment of error. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 30 (\"[W]e lack jurisdiction to review the court's refusal to invoke Application Note 1 unless there is some reason to believe that the court misunderstood its options.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Anderson's Departure Request.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson &#8212; like Sanchez &#8212; seeks to characterize his case as one in which the district court misperceived the extent of its authority to depart under Application Note 1. Specifically, Anderson spotlights the sentencing court's statement that \"[h]e didn't have an intent to kill\" and complains that the court failed to realize that this finding paved the way for a possible downward departure. To prove his point, Anderson singles out a passage from the transcript of the disposition hearing, in which the judge explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that he shouldn't have a total offense level of 43 because he had no intent to kill. But as I've just indicated, he is charged with that intent because he is an aider and abettor, and whether it's considered a second degree murder or a first degree murder, if it was tried in the state courts the fact of the matter is that he was an accessory before the fact of murder in this case. So the total offense level of 43 is correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Anderson's view, this rationale reveals the court's total unfamiliarity with the authority granted to it by Application Note 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson's argument elevates hope over reason. The sentencing court's attempt to explain why it chose not to depart, despite Anderson's perceived lack of an intent to kill, was not especially articulate &#8212; but what is conspicuously absent from the quoted passage is any indication that the court felt constrained in its ability to depart. Application Note 1 gives the sentencing court discretion to depart or not, as the court sees fit, if it finds that a given defendant did not cause the death intentionally or knowingly. On a fair reading of the court's comments in this case, it seems highly likely that the court was looking to analogous state criminal law for guidance on how to exercise that discretion. The fact that the court had recognized its authority to depart under the self-same rubric at Sanchez's sentencing &#8212; held just six days earlier &#8212; reinforces this conclusion. We therefore dismiss Anderson's assignment of error as unreviewable. <i>See Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE UPWARD DEPARTURE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court ruled that Sanchez's case fell outside the heartland of comparable carjacking cases and determined that a three-level upward departure was appropriate. The court based this determination on five factors: death resulting, abduction, use of a weapon, extreme conduct, and criminal purpose. Each of these is a recognized &#8212; indeed, an encouraged &#8212; ground for a departure. <i>See</i> USSG &#167;&#167; 5K2.1 (death resulting), 5K2.4 (abduction), 5K2.6 (use of a weapon), 5K2.8 (extreme conduct), 5K2.9 (criminal purpose); <i>see generally Koon v.

We disagree with these allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing Sanchez's claims, we comment briefly upon the standard of review. The law is currently unsettled as to whether the PROTECT Act, Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650, 670, to be <i>codified at</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e) (2003), applies to departure decisions made prior to April 30, 2003 (the Act's effective date).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, our standard of review is in doubt. <i>Compare id.</i> (directing de novo review of departure decisions), <i>with United States v. Dethlefs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197512\"><a href=\"/opinion/197512/united-states-v-dethlefs/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 43-44 (1st Cir.1997) (describing more deferential pre-PROTECT Act standard of review). Here, however, we would affirm the district court's departure decision under either standard, and so we leave the question unresolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Double Counting.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez's first claim &#8212; double counting &#8212; posits that the departure factors relied upon by the district court were already adequately taken into account, either as specific offense characteristics or as other adjustments, in determining his GSR. We are fully satisfied that the sentencing court did not engage in any double counting when it considered four of the five factors &#8212; abduction (&#167; 5K2.4), use of a weapon (&#167; 5K2.6), extreme conduct (&#167; 5K2.8), and criminal purpose (&#167; 5K2.9) &#8212; as grounds for an upward departure. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sanchez makes no coherent argument as to why the sentencing court's use of extreme conduct or criminal purpose in the departure calculus would constitute double counting. In contrast, his argument as to abduction and use of a weapon is coherent but unavailing. It hinges on the fact that the carjacking guideline is derived from, and generally congruent with, the guideline for robbery. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 2B3.1. Seizing on this congruence, Sanchez notes that the guideline for robbery allows for the consideration of abduction and use of a weapon when calculating a defendant's base offense level. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2B3.1(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does not follow, however, that abduction and use of a weapon are already taken into account in carjacking cases in which the murder enhancement applies. Once a court decides upon the applicability of the first degree murder cross-reference, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2B3.1(c), proper procedure requires it to ignore the specific offense characteristics listed under the robbery guideline and move directly to USSG &#167; 2A1.1. The sentencing court followed this protocol in Sanchez's case. Consequently, there was no double counting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the sentencing court's application of the \"death resulting\" factor (&#167; 5K2.1). It is at least arguable that this can be construed as double counting: the court might already have provided an enhancement for the fact that the carjacking resulted in death when it followed the instructions found in USSG &#167; 2B3.1(c) and applied the first degree murder cross-reference. <i>See United States v. Barber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744072\"><a href=\"/opinion/744072/united-states-v-anthony-d-barber-united-states-of-america-v-david-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span>, 280-81 &amp; n. 3 (4th Cir.1997) (suggesting that the first degree murder guideline already takes into account the fact that death resulted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This logic is not defeated by the fact that sentencing courts are authorized, in certain circumstances, to depart from the guidelines even though the reason for departure has been taken into consideration as a specific offense characteristic or other adjustment. That authorization is limited to situations in which \"the court determines that, in light of unusual circumstances, the weight attached to [the relevant] factor under the guidelines is inadequate.\" USSG &#167; 5K2.0. It would be surpassingly difficult to contend that the first degree murder cross-reference (which raised Sanchez's offense level to 43 &#8212; the maximum contemplated by the sentencing guidelines) attributed inadequate weight to the victims' deaths.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, this case is different in the sense that two persons &#8212; not just one &#8212; were slain. That distinguishing characteristic might very well suffice to counter the charge of double counting. Courts may consider whether the crime resulted in multiple deaths when determining the <i>extent</i> of a departure, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 5K2.1, and, by analogy, it would seem sensible to allow consideration of that fact in determining whether to depart at all. Moreover, Sanchez would have received the same base offense level had the carjacking resulted in only one death, so it might well be said that the first degree murder cross-reference failed to take the second death into account. These considerations would tend to justify departing upward. <i>Cf. United States v. Menzer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674640\"><a href=\"/opinion/674640/united-states-v-michael-s-menzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span>, 1234-35 (7th Cir.1994) (using similar reasoning to support an upward departure in light of the arson guideline's second degree murder cross-reference).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, however, we need not resolve this question. Even if the sentencing court engaged in double counting with regard to the \"death resulting\" factor &#8212; a matter that we do not decide &#8212; the departure as a whole would be sustainable. We have said in the past that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a departure which rests on a combination of valid and invalid grounds may be affirmed so long as (1) the direction and degree of the departure are reasonable in relation to the remaining (valid) ground, (2) excision of the improper ground does not obscure or defeat the expressed reasoning of the district court, and (3) the reviewing court is left, on the record as a whole, with the definite and firm conviction that removal of the inappropriate ground would not be likely to alter the district court's view of the sentence rightfully to be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Notwithstanding Sanchez's hyperbolic efforts to classify the extent of the departure as unreasonable, we previously have affirmed similar (and even significantly larger) departures, including departures based upon analogous circumstances. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Carrion-Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196916\"><a href=\"/opinion/196916/united-states-v-carrion-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 6-7 (1st Cir.1996) (per curiam) (affirming a three-level departure from level 40 to level 43 due to the \"sordid facts\" in a multiple-death carjacking case); <i>see also United States v.

The double-counting claim is, therefore, impuissant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Sanchez argues that whether or not these five factors were legally available, they were factually unsupported (and, thus, should not have figured in the departure calculus). This is whistling past the graveyard: the record contains more than enough evidence to justify the use of each of the five factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A detailed exegesis would serve no useful purpose. The short of it is that the victims were abducted at gunpoint and transported to a secluded location, where they were psychologically tormented for a period of time before being murdered execution-style in order to protect the identities of the perpetrators. Against this grim backdrop, only two of Sanchez's subsidiary arguments merit further discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Sanchez asseverates that the \"use of a weapon\" factor does not apply because he never actually used the gun. This asseveration rings hollow. The relevant guideline provision refers to the use or possession of a weapon \"in the commission of the offense.\" USSG &#167; 5K2.6. To warrant the application of this provision, it ordinarily suffices that the defendant and the shooter are convicted as coconspirators. <i>See United States v. Connor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573112\"><a href=\"/opinion/573112/united-states-v-myles-j-connor-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span>, 1277 (7th Cir.1991) (indicating that section 5K2.6 will be available where \"the possessor of the gun and the defendant are coconspirators, the possessor[] of the gun possessed it in furtherance of the conspiracy, and the defendant was a member of the conspiracy at the time of the possession of the gun\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Sanchez makes a determined assault on the sentencing court's use of the \"death resulting\" datum. Sanchez's attack rests essentially on two facts: that Sanchez himself neither seized control of the victims' car nor pulled the trigger. These facts are true as far as they go, but they do not take Sanchez very far. His argument unrealistically discounts his actual participation in the criminal activity. As supportably found by the sentencing court, Sanchez, among other things, served a critical function as an available getaway driver and actively urged Floyd to kill the victims. We have said before &#8212; and today reaffirm &#8212; that section 5K2.1 (encouraging \"death resulting\" departures) may bear the weight of an upward departure even when the defendant is not the direct cause of the victim's death. <i>United States v.

THE CHC ASSIGNMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, Anderson was twice convicted of misdemeanors (once for obstructing a police officer and once for possession of marijuana). On each occasion, the state court sentenced him to probation. At the disposition hearing in the instant case, the district court assigned Anderson to CHC III based on the two misdemeanor convictions (worth one point apiece toward his criminal history score) and the fact that, at the time of the carjacking, he was still on probation (worth two points toward his criminal history score). Anderson deems these four points unwarranted and maintains that he should have been assigned to CHC I. Refined to bare essence, his argument rests on the notion that the prior convictions were improperly considered because Anderson neither had an attorney at the misdemeanor plea hearings nor knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument runs headlong into a documentary obstacle: the state court records contain signed waivers of the right to counsel. Anderson attempts to confess and avoid. He concedes that he signed the waiver forms but maintains that he never understood the forms to waive his right to counsel (he regarded them merely as boilerplate needed to effectuate his pleas of nolo contendere).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson advanced this construct in his objections to the PSI Report. The district court overruled the objections, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Anderson] waived counsel. There's a written waiver in the record that he signed. There's been no evidence to convince me that he didn't understand what he was doing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that basis, the court concluded that the sentencing guidelines obliged it to take account of both the prior misdemeanor convictions and the consequent probationary term. USSG &#167;&#167; 4A1.1, 4A1.2. It then assigned Anderson to CHC III, observing that, if anything, CHC III underrepresented the extent of Anderson's prior criminal activity. We discern no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the basics. In a federal criminal case, a defendant's CHC depends upon his criminal history score. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 4A1.1, cmt.

If the defendant fails to carry this burden, the sentencing court may then consider the prior conviction in compiling the defendant's criminal history score (and, ultimately, his CHC).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the government established that Anderson had two prior misdemeanor convictions. For his part, Anderson tried to remove them from the equation by showing that he was deprived of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Anderson's argument is a non-starter: there is no constitutional right to counsel in a misdemeanor case in which the defendant is not sentenced to a term of immurement. <i>See Scott v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110032\"><a href=\"/opinion/110032/scott-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, 373-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110032\"><a href=\"/opinion/110032/scott-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110032\"><a href=\"/opinion/110032/scott-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span> (1979) (holding that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to counsel only if a misdemeanant ultimately is sentenced to a term of imprisonment). That point alone seems sufficient to derail Anderson's claim. After all, \"an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under <i>Scott</i> because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.\" <i>Nichols v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087959\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087959/nichols-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, 749, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087959\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087959/nichols-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1921</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087959\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087959/nichols-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span> (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, for the sake of completeness, that Anderson's claim has yet another shortcoming. Even assuming that he had a right to counsel during the misdemeanor proceedings, the district court found that he had knowingly and intelligently waived that right. The standard of review applicable to the district court's underlying factual finding &#8212; that Anderson understood the import of the waivers when he signed them &#8212; would be clear error. <i>Unger,</i> 915 F.2d at 762. In the circumstances of this case, it simply cannot be said that the district court clearly erred in making that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Anderson acknowledges that he signed a waiver form with respect to each of the prior convictions. These forms plainly notified him of his right to consult an attorney of his own choosing or to have one appointed if he could not afford private representation. The language that appears directly above Anderson's signature on each form, in bold upper-case letters and partially underscored, is telling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I HAVE READ AND REVIEWED THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THIS PAPER AND I HAVE NO QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT IT STATES AND MEANS AND I UNDERSTAND IT COMPLETELY. I WISH TO PROCEED WITHOUT A LAWYER REPRESENTING ME KNOWING THE ABOVE RIGHTS. <i>I SWEAR TO THE TRUTH OF THE ABOVE.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to counteract this powerful evidence, Anderson offers primarily his assertion that he misunderstood the purport of the proffered documents not once, but twice. The short answer to this plaint is that the district court found it incredible. That is not the stuff of clear error. A trial court is not bound to credit a defendant's self-serving statements. <i>See Cuppett v. Duckworth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656591\"><a href=\"/opinion/656591/robert-r-cuppett-v-jack-r-duckworth-superintendent-indiana-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span></a></span>, 1139 (7th Cir.1993) (explaining that \"self-serving statements by a defendant that his conviction was constitutionally infirm are insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity accorded state convictions\"); <i>see generally United States v. Jimenez-Perez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519199\"><a href=\"/opinion/519199/united-states-v-joaquin-jimenez-perez-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1989) (\"It is... apodictic that a trier of fact is not bound to accept the self-serving stories of persons accused.\"); <i>United States v. Cintolo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488517\"><a href=\"/opinion/488517/united-states-v-william-j-cintolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 989 (1st Cir.1987) (similar). Here, as elsewhere, the court may draw reasonable inferences from the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to salvage this claim, Anderson notes that the transcript of his August 11, 1999 plea colloquy cannot be located. In a related vein, he points out that, when the state court judge asked him at the November 19, 1999 hearing whether he had any questions as to what was meant by signing the waiver form, his response was recorded as \"inaudible.\" These facts are part of the totality of the circumstances &#8212; but in the end, Anderson adverts to nothing that affirmatively demonstrates the constitutional infirmity of the prior convictions. In the absence of such evidence, the district court was not obliged to draw inferences favorable to Anderson from either the wayward transcript or the inaudible response. <i>See Parke v. Raley,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span>, 29-30, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></span> (1992) (deciding that reliance on the mere unavailability of a transcript does not surmount the \"presumption of regularity\" that attaches to a final judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Credibility determinations at sentencing are within the exclusive province of the trial court. <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1200 (1st Cir.1993). Thus, we respect the sentencing court's decision not to credit Anderson's testimony that he misunderstood the clear and pointed language of the waiver forms. <i>See United States v. Cruz-Alcala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"163761\"><a href=\"/opinion/163761/united-states-v-cruz-alcala/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1198 (10th Cir.) (deferring to a district court's credibility determination in a similar uncounseled misdemeanor case), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></span> (2003). On this record, the sentencing court did not err in finding that Anderson knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us full circle. The Sentencing Commission has gone to some lengths to explain that \"[p]rior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the [defendant's] criminal history score, including uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was not imposed.\" USSG &#167; 4A1.2, cmt. (backg'd.). Anderson's prior convictions fit neatly within this integument, and we have determined that those prior convictions suffered from no cognizable constitutional defects. Consequently, the sentencing court's calculation of Anderson's criminal history score was proper. <i>See Nichols,</i> 511 U.S. at 749, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087959\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087959/nichols-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1921</span></a></span> (\"[A]n uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under <i>Scott</i> because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.\"). So too was its assignment of this defendant to CHC III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. This was a horrific crime, demanding stern punishment.

We need not pursue that possibility for two reasons. First, Anderson makes no developed argumentation to that effect. Second, the Supreme Court has limited the circumstances in which a defendant can collaterally attack a state conviction, for federal sentencing purposes, to cases involving Sixth Amendment violations. <i>See Custis v.
