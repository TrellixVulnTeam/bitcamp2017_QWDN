This appeal concerns a\n\ncollateral attack on an injunction, preliminarily issued by the\n\ndistrict court in 1992 and, with modifications, made permanent in\n\n1998.    The effect of the injunction is to prevent the Commonwealth\n\nof Massachusetts (\"Commonwealth\") from enforcing a state law that\n\nrequires members of its reconstituted state police force to retire\n\nupon reaching the age of 55. Appellant, State Police for Automatic\n\nRetirement Association (\"SPARA\"), contends that the challenged\n\npermanent injunction has injured its members by diminishing their\n\npromotional opportunities.           According to SPARA, the injunction\n\nviolates the Supreme Court's decision in Kimel v. Florida Board of\n\nRegents,   528    U.S.    62    (2000),    and    was   also    overly   broad    and\n\nerroneous when issued. Appellant appeals from the district court's\n\nrefusal    to    enjoin   the    Commonwealth       from   complying       with   the\n\nallegedly faulty injunction and also from the court's dismissal of\n\nSPARA's    complaint       against        three    state       officials     (\"State\n\nOfficials\")1 for their failure to enforce the mandatory state\n\npolice retirement age of 55.              In separate orders, the district\n\ncourt denied SPARA's request for a preliminary injunction and\n\ngranted the defendant-appellees' motion to dismiss.                        The court\n\n\n\n     1\n      SPARA brought suit against John DiFava, Superintendent of the\nDepartment of State Police; Ellen Philbin, Executive Director of\nthe Massachusetts State Police Retirement Board; and Jane Perlov,\nSecretary of Public Safety in their individual capacities.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fruled that SPARA's action was barred by the doctrine of res\n\njudicata and, in the alternative, by stare decisis.           We affirm,\n\nalbeit on somewhat different grounds.\n\nI.        Background\n\n          The focus of this action is a Massachusetts law, enacted\n\nin 1991 as part of the reorganization of the Massachusetts State\n\nPolice, that mandated the automatic retirement of all members of\n\nthe reconstituted police force at age 55.      Pursuant to Chapter 412\n\nof the Massachusetts Acts of 1991, the Metropolitan District\n\nCommission Police (\"MDC Police\"), the Registry of Motor Vehicles\n\nLaw Enforcement Division (\"Registry Police\"), and the Capitol\n\nPolice were merged with the Division of State Police.         Section 122\n\nof Chapter 412, codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, § 6(3)(a)\n\n(1992), required all members of the newly consolidated State Police\n\nDepartment to retire at age 55.     Prior to the consolidation, the\n\nMDC Police, the Registry Police, and the Capitol Police had been\n\nrequired by Massachusetts law to retire at age 65.           In contrast,\n\nthe original State Police Division officers had been mandated by\n\nlaw to retire at age 50.    Thus, § 6(3)(a) added five years to the\n\nmandatory retirement age of officers formerly in the original state\n\npolice   division,   but   subtracted   ten   years   from    the   forced\n\nretirement age of officers formerly belonging to the MDC Police,\n\nRegistry Police, and Capitol Police.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f                 Facing   mandatory   retirement    ten   years   earlier    than\n\nanticipated, forty-five officers of the former MDC Police, Capitol\n\nPolice, and Registry Police brought an action in the district court\n\nin December 1992, (the \"Gately action\"), seeking to invalidate the\n\nmandatory retirement provision contained in § 6(3)(a) as being\n\nviolative of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\n(\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. (1999 & Supp. II).2              The district\n\ncourt entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the Commonwealth\n\nfrom enforcing the mandatory retirement provision of the new law.\n\nThe preliminary injunction provided that the Commonwealth was\n\n\"temporarily restrained and enjoined from dismissing or retiring\n\nplaintiffs or other officers because they are aged 55 or older.\"\n\nGately v. Massachusetts, 92-CV-13018-MA (D. Mass. Dec. 30, 1992)\n\n(order granting preliminary injunction). The Commonwealth appealed\n\nfrom       the   preliminary    injunction.        This   court   affirmed   the\n\ninjunction, rejecting, inter alia, the Commonwealth's contention\n\nthat the ADEA's safe-harbor provision allowed the Commonwealth to\n\napply to the plaintiffs the mandatory state police retirement age\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      The ADEA prohibits an employer from \"failing to hire or to\ndischarge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment because of such individual's age . . . .\"\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a).\n\n                                        -5-\n\ffound in § 6(3)(a).3   Gately v. Massachusetts, 2 F.3d 1221, 1229\n\n(1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1082 (1994).\n\n          Following the denial of its appeal, the Commonwealth\n\nmoved the district court to amend the preliminary injunction \"on\n\nthe grounds that the current order enjoins the defendants from\n\nretiring the member[s] of the state police at any age.\"        The\n\nCommonwealth requested the following order:   \"that the defendants\n\n. . . are temporarily restrained and enjoined from dismissing or\n\nretiring plaintiffs or other officers because they are between the\n\nages of 55-64.\"   The plaintiffs opposed the motion.   On November\n\n\n     3\n      The safe-harbor provision of the ADEA, 28 U.S.C. § 623(j),\ncreates an exemption that gives state and local officials the\noption to lawfully retire law enforcement officials who have\nattained the age of retirement in effect under applicable state or\nlocal law on March 3, 1983, or pursuant to a state law enacted\nafter September 30, 1996, that is not a subterfuge to evade the\npurposes of the ADEA. See Gately v. Massachusetts, 2 F.3d 1221,\n1228-29 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1082 (1994)\n(referring to the 1986 amendment); Gately v. Massachusetts, No. 92-\n13018-MA, 1998 WL 518179, at *7 n.5 (D. Mass. June 8, 1998)\n(discussing the applicability of the safe-harbor provision to §\n6(3)(a)). The history of the safe-harbor provision is complex. In\n1986, Congress amended the ADEA to create a time-limited exemption\nthat allowed states to make hiring and discharge decisions of law\nenforcement personnel pursuant to applicable state or local law in\neffect on March 3, 1983 -- the day after issuance of the Supreme\nCourt's decision in EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226, 239 (1983),\nholding that the ADEA validly applied to state and local\ngovernments.    The exemption, designed to provide states an\nopportunity to adjust to the Supreme Court's decision, expired on\nDecember 31, 1993. On that date the ADEA's strictures against age\ndiscrimination would thus become fully applicable to state and\nlocal employment decisions related to law enforcement officers.\nHowever, on September 30, 1996, Congress again amended the ADEA so\nas to reinstate the safe-harbor provision, with some revisions.\nThe amendments were made retroactive to December 31, 1993.\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f24,    1993,    in   a   margin   note,    the    district   court      allowed   the\n\ndefendant's motion and enjoined the Commonwealth from retiring\n\nstate police officers because they were 64 or younger.\n\n               On September 23, 1996, the plaintiffs filed an emergency\n\nmotion    to    amend    the   preliminary       injunction.      The    plaintiffs\n\nrequested that the original preliminary injunction be reinstated\n\nto \"allow the few plaintiffs who are likely to attain the age of 65\n\nbefore this case is resolved to avoid sustaining the very harm the\n\nADEA and       proposed    legislation     is    designed    to   prevent.\"       The\n\nCommonwealth opposed the new amendment arguing that the current\n\ninjunction was consistent with the settled expectations of the\n\nparties because prior to the consolidation of the four divisions\n\n\"no officer had the expectation of remaining employed beyond age\n\n65.\"\n\n               The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion noting:\n\n               This issue raises an important but difficult\n               policy question. However, I am persuaded that\n               the state law, fairness to the two police\n               officers, and the limited immediate impact\n               which will result, provide grounds upon which\n               to grant the motion.    With respect to these\n               two officers and others currently on the force\n               who   might    become    similarly   situated,\n               therefore, the plaintiffs' motion to amend the\n               preliminary injunction is GRANTED.\n\nGately v. Massachusetts, No. 92-13018 (D. Mass. Sept. 26, 1996)\n\n(order amending preliminary injunction).\n\n               Between 1993 and 1996, the court case lay dormant as the\n\nparties attempted to negotiate a settlement which was to include a\n\n                                          -7-\n\flegislative solution.          Proffered state legislation would have\n\npermitted    state    police   officers    to    remain     employed     past   the\n\nmandatory retirement age of 55 if they could pass a physical exam.\n\nThis legislation was suggested in the aftermath of the \"Landry\n\nReport,\" a 3,000 page report, authorized by Congress, concluding\n\nthat no age less than 70 would serve as a bona fide occupational\n\nqualification (\"BFOQ\") for law enforcement work.\n\n            Neither    a   legislative     solution       nor    any    settlement\n\noccurred, however, and the plaintiffs, by then including the Equal\n\nEmployment    Opportunity      Commission       (\"EEOC\"),       which   had   since\n\nintervened, moved for summary judgment. The plaintiffs argued that\n\nthe Commonwealth could not establish that the mandatory retirement\n\nage of 55 in § 6(3)(a) was a BFOQ as required by the ADEA and, as\n\na result, the law violated the ADEA.         On June 8, 1998, the district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and the\n\nintervenor-plaintiff, the EEOC.           The court ruled that § 6(3)(a),\n\nwhich established a mandatory retirement age of 55 for officers of\n\nthe State Police, was superseded and preempted by the ADEA, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 623(a)(1).        The court ordered that the Commonwealth was\n\n\"permanently enjoined from requiring officers of the Department of\n\nthe State Police to retire solely on the basis of their age.\"                   The\n\nCommonwealth did not appeal.\n\n             In August 2000, Gerald A. Colletta, III, a State Police\n\nLieutenant and a member of SPARA, attempted to intervene in the\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fGately action and seek relief from the judgment pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b)(5), in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in Kimel\n\nv. Florida Board of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000).                   The district\n\ncourt denied the motion to intervene as untimely. Colletta did not\n\nappeal from the denial of his motion.\n\n            In    January    2001,    SPARA,   and   a    long   list     of   named\n\nindividuals, initiated an action of their own in the district\n\ncourt. SPARA, and named plaintiffs, contended that they were being\n\ninjured by the continued enforcement of an invalid and overly broad\n\nGately injunction.          The plaintiffs asserted that the existing\n\ninjunction was \"directly responsible for members of SPARA being\n\ndenied promotions.\" The basis of SPARA's initial complaint and the\n\nfirst amended complaint was that the permanent injunction was\n\ninvalid in light of Kimel.           The district court permitted the EEOC\n\nand certain state police officers, aged 50 or older, to intervene.\n\n            SPARA moved for a preliminary injunction based on reading\n\nKimel to stand for the proposition that the ADEA no longer applied\n\nto the States.     The district court denied the motion.               State Police\n\nfor Automatic Ret. Ass'n v. DiFava, 138 F. Supp. 2d 142 (D. Mass.\n\n2001).     SPARA, with the district court's permission, amended its\n\ncomplaint two more times to include claims that the injunction in\n\nGately was invalid because (1) the district court in the Gately\n\naction misconstrued the applicability of the safe-harbor provision\n\nin   the   ADEA    for   mandatory      retirement       plans   for    state    law\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fenforcement       officers,    29    U.S.C.    §   623(j);    (2)   the    blanket\n\nprohibition against requiring the retirement of any state police\n\nofficer at age 55 or older had created a de facto class action in\n\nviolation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23; and (3) the\n\ninjunction impermissibly lacked a termination date.                  SPARA also\n\nappeared to argue that the State Officials were applying the\n\ninjunction incorrectly in direct contravention of this court's\n\ndecision in Gately, 2 F.3d at 1221.\n\n            The State Officials and the intervenors filed a motion to\n\ndismiss the Third Amended Complaint.               The district court allowed\n\nthe motion, concluding that SPARA's action was barred by the\n\ndoctrine of res judicata. State Police for Automatic Ret. Ass'n v.\n\nDiFava, 164 F. Supp. 2d 141, 155 (D. Mass. 2001).                        The court\n\ndetermined that there had been (1) a final judgement in the Gately\n\naction; (2) that the present action derived from the same set of\n\noperative facts; and (3) that the Commonwealth had ably represented\n\nthe interests of SPARA in the Gately action.                 In the alternative,\n\nthe    district    court     ruled   that,    given   this     court's    decision\n\naffirming the preliminary injunction, stare decisis precluded it\n\nfrom reviewing or altering the permanent injunction.                The district\n\ncourt also dismissed SPARA's claims that the lack of a termination\n\ndate   invalidated     the    permanent      injunction   and    denied    SPARA's\n\nattempt to sue under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, noting\n\nthat the rules did not create federal substantive rights.\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f             This appeal followed.\n\nII.          Discussion\n\n             On appeal, SPARA does not pursue all the points raised\n\nbelow. SPARA does not challenge the district court's decisions (1)\n\nthat stare decisis precluded it from reviewing and altering the\n\npermanent injunction; (2) that SPARA was without a cause of action\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (Count II); and (3) that\n\nSPARA did not properly allege constitutional equal protection\n\nclaims based on animus under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1985 and 1986 (Counts V\n\nand VI).\n\n             Our discussion is limited to the issues SPARA now argues\n\non appeal.    First, SPARA claims that the district court erred when\n\nit concluded that, after the Supreme Court's decision in Kimel, the\n\nADEA remains applicable to the states.             Second, SPARA argues that\n\nthe doctrine of res judicata does not bar it from attacking the\n\npermanent injunction issued in Gately.                Third, SPARA attacks\n\ngenerally the breadth of the permanent injunction, claiming that\n\nthe district court in the original Gately action exceeded its power\n\nwhen it enjoined the state from retiring state police officers\n\nsubject to age 50 retirement prior to the merger.\n\nA.           Whether the ADEA Remains Applicable to the States\n\n             SPARA contends that the Supreme Court's decision in Kimel\n\nrenders    the    ADEA   inapplicable   to   the    states   in   the   present\n\nsituation.       Under this view, the continuing permanent injunction\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fissued in the Gately action, enforcing the ADEA in such a way as to\n\nnullify the state's mandatory age 55 retirement law, is an illegal\n\nand    invalid   exercise      of   federal   judicial    power,    leaving   the\n\nCommonwealth's statute requiring the age-based retirement of state\n\npolice officers in full force.\n\n              This reading of Kimel is erroneous.             The Kimel Court\n\nreiterated the Supreme Court's earlier holding in Wyoming, 460 U.S.\n\n226    (1983),   that    the    ADEA   constitutes   a     valid   exercise   of\n\nCongress's power under Article I, § 8, cl. 3 \"'[t]o regulate\n\nCommerce . . . among the several States.'\"               Kimel, 528 U.S. at 78\n\n(quoting Wyoming, 460 U.S. at 243).           Moreover, nothing was said in\n\nKimel    to   question   Wyoming's      determination      that    Congress   had\n\nextended the ADEA to cover state and local governments and their\n\nemployees in addition to private firms and individuals.                 Nor did\n\nKimel alter Wyoming's holding that the ADEA's regulation of state\n\nand local government workers did not violate the Tenth Amendment or\n\nother provisions of the Constitution.            Wyoming, 460 U.S. at 232-\n\n243.    All that Kimel held was that -- although the ADEA remained a\n\nvalid exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause --\n\nthis fact alone did not, and could not, enable Congress to override\n\na state's Eleventh Amendment immunity against suit.                 528 U.S. at\n\n91.    Hence Kimel did not declare the standards of the ADEA invalid\n\nnor inapplicable as they pertained to the states, but simply\n\nendorsed the rights of states and political subdivisions to enforce\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fagainst ADEA lawsuits the immunity conferred by the Eleventh\n\nAmendment.\n\n            The Eleventh Amendment, however, does not confer upon the\n\nstates a total immunity against suit.           Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S.\n\n706, 755 (1999).      Kimel involved a private action for monetary\n\ndamages.     Neither Kimel, nor Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence,\n\nprevents individuals, such as the Gately plaintiffs, from obtaining\n\ninjunctive relief against a state based upon the ADEA pursuant to\n\nEx parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).        See Bd. of Trs. of the Univ.\n\nof   Ala.   v.   Garrett,   531   U.S.   356,   374   n.9    (2001)   (private\n\nindividuals may sue for injunctive relief to enforce the standards\n\nof the ADA under Ex parte Young); Laro v. New Hampshire, 259 F.3d\n\n1, 17 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Indeed,   the   United    States    itself      may   enforce   the\n\nstandards of the ADEA against states both in actions for money\n\ndamages and for injunctive relief.          See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 374\n\nn.9; Alden, 527 U.S. at 755; Laro, 259 F.3d at 17.                The EEOC, an\n\nagency of the United States, was a party to the suit that resulted\n\nin the issuance of the permanent injunction that SPARA now seeks to\n\ninvalidate.      In Alden the Court stated that \"[i]n ratifying the\n\nconstitution, the States consented to suits brought by other States\n\nor by the Federal Government.\"       527 U.S. at 755.       Thus, even though\n\nprivate individuals are precluded by the Eleventh Amendment from\n\nsuing the Commonwealth for money damages for violations of the\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fADEA, the provisions of the ADEA remain fully applicable and may be\n\nenforced against the Commonwealth in the manner described.              Kimel\n\nhas not so altered the legal landscape as to invalidate the\n\npermanent injunction issued in Gately.\n\nB.          Remaining Claims\n\n            Absent its argument that Kimel removed the legal basis\n\nfor the 1998 permanent injunction, SPARA's complaint is essentially\n\na renewed attack upon the underlying merits of the injunction.\n\nSPARA's primary contention is that the mandatory retirement age of\n\n55 found in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, § 6(3)(a), does not violate the\n\nADEA because it is in fact allowed (as to certain officers) by the\n\nsafe-harbor provision of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. § 623(j) (2000).\n\nSPARA also contends that the State Officials' continued adherence\n\nto the injunction violates its members' civil rights.\n\n             The district court held that SPARA was barred by res\n\njudicata from attempting to litigate this issue.            State Police for\n\nAutomatic Ret. Ass'n, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 155.            While we agree with\n\nthe district court that SPARA's complaint must be dismissed, and\n\nwhile we     do   not   necessarily     reject   the   district   court's   res\n\njudicata    analysis,     we   affirm    on   somewhat   different   grounds.\n\nTicketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 204 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).     We conclude that SPARA's complaint is devoid of merit and\n\nlacks any basis on which relief can be granted.              Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f            SPARA contends that the ADEA's safe-harbor provision\n\nshould be read to save the state's mandatory retirement age of 55\n\nas applied to those officers who were in the former state police\n\ndivision at the time it was merged with the three other police\n\nforces.   SPARA is apparently arguing that, by failing to apply the\n\nstate's 55-year mandatory retirement age to former members of the\n\nold state police division, the Commonwealth is permitting these\n\nofficers to stay longer than they should, thereby filling positions\n\ninto which SPARA's members, or some of them, might otherwise be\n\npromoted.\n\n            The safe-harbor provision in effect at the time of the\n\nGately action provided:\n\n            [i]t shall not be unlawful for an employer\n            which is a State . . . to discharge any\n            individual because of such individual's age if\n            such action is taken --\n            (1) with respect to the employment of an\n            individual . . . as a law enforcement officer\n            and the individual has attained the age\n            of . . . retirement in effect under applicable\n            State or local law on March 3, 1983; and\n            (2) pursuant to a bona fide . . . retirement\n            plan that is not subterfuge to evade the\n            purposes of this chapter.\n\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(j).\n\n            The provision was initially enacted to give states a\n\ngrace period of seven years during which time certain retirement\n\nplans for law enforcement officials would be exempted from the\n\nADEA's reach.    Gately, 2 F.3d at 1229.    We concluded in Gately\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fthat, under the exemption, states were free to raise or eliminate\n\npre-March 3, 1983 mandatory retirement ages for law enforcement\n\nofficials but they could not lower retirement ages below what was\n\nin effect on that date.          Id.     In essence, the retirement age\n\nrequirements of a plan in effect as of March 3, 1983 became the\n\nfloor for legally valid plans adopted by a state.             Id. (citing 132\n\nCong. Rec. S16850-02 (daily ed. Oct. 6, 1986)).\n\n            SPARA now concedes, as was held in Gately, that the\n\nmandatory retirement age contained in § 6(3)(a), as applied to the\n\nGately plaintiffs, was not saved by the safe-harbor provision\n\ncontained in § 623(j).      The Gately plaintiffs consisted of former\n\nmembers of the MDC Police, the Capitol Police, and the Registry\n\nPolice whose retirement age had been 65.              The age-55 statute,\n\nadopted in 1991 as part of the consolidation of the four state\n\npolice forces, impermissibly lowered the retirement age of those\n\nplaintiffs.     SPARA   argues,    however,    that   the     age-55    age    cap\n\ncontained in § 6(3)(a), as applied to former troopers in the old\n\nstate police division, whose retirement age in 1983 was 50, was\n\nprotected by the exemption contained in § 623(j).\n\n            The difficulty with this argument is that the safe-harbor\n\nprovision   merely   permits     \"an    employee   which     is   a   State\"    to\n\ngrandfather pre-March 3, 1983, state retirement standards. It does\n\nnot   require   a   state   to   continue     to   enforce    such     age-based\n\nstandards, nor does it empower individual state employees to force\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fthe state to do so.           Having found that the mandatory age-55\n\nretirement    law   enacted   as    part   of   the   reorganization        of   the\n\nenlarged State Police Department violated the ADEA with respect to\n\ncertain of its members, the district court understandably enjoined\n\nenforcement of the entire law rather than attempting to narrow it,\n\nas SPARA would prefer, so that it would still apply to some\n\nofficers within the new department although not others. See, e.g.,\n\nVirginia v.    Am.    Booksellers     Ass'n,    484   U.S.   383,     397   (1988)\n\n(stating \"we will not rewrite a state law to conform it to\n\nconstitutional requirements\"); Consol. Cigar Corp. v. Reilly, 218\n\nF.3d 30, 56 (1st Cir. 2000) (stating courts must \"take care not to\n\ntrample legislative or executive province of state authorities by\n\nmaking   unduly     substantive     additions    or   changes    to    laws      and\n\nregulations\"), rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom., Lorillard\n\nTobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525 (2001).                  The Commonwealth,\n\nrepresented in the Gately action by its Attorney General, chose not\n\nto appeal from the broadly-worded injunction, accepting the federal\n\ncourt's determination that § 6(3)(a) was, in effect, non-severable,\n\ni.e., could not reasonably be applied to the reorganized division\n\nin a splintered fashion so as to permit the forced retirement of\n\ncertain former state troopers while all others would be free from\n\nany retirement age limit.          Certainly both the district court and\n\nthe Commonwealth were entitled to doubt that the Massachusetts\n\nlegislature would have wanted the age-55 retirement law -- that the\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\flegislature had written expressly to apply to the entire new state\n\npolice department -- to remain in effect only with respect to some\n\nofficers while others enjoyed the full protections of the ADEA.\n\nCf. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 75 (1996)\n\n(noting that a federal court is not free to rewrite a law \"to\n\napproximate what we think Congress might have wanted had it known\n\nthat [the statute] was beyond its authority\").   It is notable that\n\nthe Gately court afforded the parties time to return to the\n\nMassachusetts legislature in hopes of securing legislative redress\n\n-- a vain hope, as matters evolved.\n\n          In any event, whether to pursue the goal SPARA now seeks\n\nand attempt to persuade the federal court to narrow its injunction\n\nso as to save the retirement age selectively under the ADEA's safe-\n\nharbor provision in the case of certain former state troopers was\n\na decision for the Commonwealth alone to make.4       See Clerk of\n\n\n     4\n      We note that SPARA's members had ample notice of the Gately\naction. They could have brought their views to the attention of\nthe Commonwealth's attorney general in a timely fashion, or even\nsought to persuade the court to allow them to intervene\npermissively, or, possibly, to file an amicus brief on the point\nnow made. State police officers were apprised of the developments\nin the Gately litigation through internal memoranda and press\ncoverage. The Gately action spanned six years -- from the date of\nthe preliminary injunction issued in 1992 to the date of the nearly\nidentical permanent injunction issued in 1998. The impact of the\ninjunction on advancement within the department was certainly a\nmatter that could have been anticipated during the six years the\npreliminary injunction was in place. The Commonwealth's litigation\nposition -- upholding the mandatory retirement age without\ndifferentiating among officers -- was revealed, at the latest,\nduring its appeal from the preliminary injunction in 1992. Yet, it\nwas not until two years after the final judgment was entered in the\n\n                               -18-\n\fSuperior Court v. Treasurer and Receiver Gen., 437 N.E.2d 158, 163\n\n(Mass. 1982) (\"The Attorney General alone has control over the\n\nconduct of litigation involving the Commonwealth, its agencies, and\n\nofficers.\").       The safe-harbor provision permits states alone to\n\ngrandfather     pre-March    3,     1983   retirement     laws.        As    a    narrow\n\nexception    to    ADEA's   broad    prohibition     of   mandatory         age-based\n\nretirement, it allows states, if they choose, to continue to\n\nenforce against relevant law enforcement officers certain earlier\n\nage-based retirement laws (or to create new laws consistent with\n\nthe mandates of the statute).                 The language of § 623(j) is\n\npermissive      not    mandatory.      The    Commonwealth's      and       the    State\n\nOfficials' adherence to the permanent injunction in no way violates\n\n§ 623(j) much less any other provision of the ADEA.                Massachusetts\n\nfought   hard     in   Gately to     uphold    the   validity     of    the       age-55\n\nretirement law as a whole; but once the Gately plaintiffs prevailed\n\nthe Commonwealth was entitled to accept, without further appeal,\n\nthe court's determination that the age-55 law should not stand on\n\na fragmented basis.\n\n            Not only are the grandfather rights in § 623(j) expressly\n\naccorded to the states alone, but neither § 623(j), nor any other\n\npart of the ADEA, makes provision for a private cause of action in\n\nthe case of individual officers or classes of officers who wish to\n\n\nGately action that a SPARA member sought to intervene. When that\nmotion to intervene was denied as untimely, the intervenor did not\nappeal from the decision.\n\n                                       -19-\n\fretain state age-based retirement laws.   Section 626(c)(1) of the\n\nADEA allows \"any person aggrieved [to] bring a civil action in any\n\ncourt of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief\n\nas will effectuate the purposes of this chapter.\"   The purpose of\n\nthe ADEA is to eliminate age discrimination in the workplace.\n\nMcKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ'g Co., 513 U.S. 352 (1995);\n\nLavery v. Marsh, 918 F.2d 1022, 1025 (1st Cir. 1990).      SPARA's\n\ndesire to preempt § 623(j) to its own uses, so as to grandfather a\n\nstate retirement law that is otherwise in contravention of the ADEA\n\ndoes not advance this purpose.     The ADEA has been said not to\n\nprevent an employer from treating older persons more generously\n\nthan others.   Schuler v. Polaroid Corp., 848 F.2d 276, 278 (1st\n\nCir. 1988) (Breyer, C.J.). Additionally, it is clear that § 623(j)\n\ndoes not provide for an implied cause of action that would allow\n\nprivate litigants to force states, against their will, to use the\n\nprotections offered in the safe-harbor provision.      See Merrill\n\nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 375-78\n\n(1982); Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 698-99 (1979);\n\nCort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78 (1975).\n\n           Furthermore, SPARA has failed to explain how the State\n\nOfficials continued adherence to the terms of the injunction\n\nviolates any cognizable statutory or constitutional rights of its\n\nmembers.   SPARA complains that the State Officials are depriving\n\nits members \"of promotions to the position of sergeant, lieutenant,\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fand captain because the order prohibits the implementation of the\n\nmandatory retirement age of 55.\"        It is unclear from where SPARA\n\nwould have us find such a \"right to promotion\" in this context.\n\nSPARA does not allege that any federal or state statute affords\n\nthem a legal right to receive as many promotions as they would have\n\nreceived if the mandatory retirement policy they favor were in\n\neffect. No relevant precedent for such a right in federal or state\n\nlaw has been called to our attention.\n\n          SPARA also broadly alleges that the State Officials'\n\nadherence to the permanent injunction violates its members' equal\n\nprotection rights.     To establish an equal protection claim, SPARA\n\nmust allege that its members have \"been intentionally treated\n\ndifferently and there is no rational basis for the difference in\n\ntreatment.\"   Village of Willow Brook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564\n\n(2000) (per curiam). SPARA has not alleged that similarly situated\n\nstate police officers are being promoted and its members are not.\n\nThe premise of SPARA's complaint is that the lack of a mandatory\n\nretirement for certain officers is slowing the advancement of all\n\nstate police officers. SPARA has simply failed to allege the facts\n\nnecessary to support an equal protection claim.          See Fireside\n\nNissan, Inc. v. Fanning, 30 F.3d 206, 219 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nC.        Conclusion\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f",

The effect of the injunction is to prevent the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (\"Commonwealth\") from enforcing a state law that requires members of its reconstituted state police force to retire upon reaching the age of 55. Appellant, State Police for Automatic Retirement Association (\"SPARA\"), contends that the challenged permanent injunction has injured its members by diminishing their promotional opportunities. According to SPARA, the injunction violates the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents,</i> 528 U.S. 62, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000), and was also overly broad and erroneous when issued. Appellant appeals from the district court's refusal to enjoin the Commonwealth from complying with the allegedly faulty injunction and also from the court's dismissal of SPARA's complaint against three state officials (\"State Officials\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for their failure to enforce the mandatory state police retirement age of 55. In separate orders, the district court denied SPARA's request for a preliminary injunction and granted the defendant-appellees' motion to dismiss. The court ruled that SPARA's action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata and, in the alternative, by stare decisis. We affirm, albeit on somewhat different grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The focus of this action is a Massachusetts law, enacted in 1991 as part of the reorganization of the Massachusetts State Police, that mandated the automatic retirement of all members of the reconstituted police force at age 55. Pursuant to Chapter 412 of the Massachusetts Acts of 1991, the Metropolitan District Commission Police (\"MDC Police\"), the Registry of Motor Vehicles Law Enforcement Division (\"Registry Police\"), and the Capitol Police were merged with the Division of State Police. Section 122 of Chapter 412, codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &#167; 6(3)(a) (1992), required all members of the newly consolidated State Police Department to retire at age 55. Prior to the consolidation, the MDC Police, the Registry Police, and the Capitol Police had been required by Massachusetts law to retire at age 65. In contrast, the original State Police Division officers had been mandated by law to retire at age 50. Thus, &#167; 6(3)(a) added five years to the mandatory retirement age of officers formerly in the original state police division, but subtracted ten years from the forced retirement age of officers formerly belonging to the MDC Police, Registry Police, and Capitol Police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Facing mandatory retirement ten years earlier than anticipated, forty-five officers of the former MDC Police, Capitol Police, and Registry Police brought an action in the district court in December 1992, (the \"<i>Gately</i> action\"), seeking to invalidate the mandatory retirement provision contained in &#167; 6(3)(a) as being violative of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 621 <i>et seq.</i> (1999 &amp; Supp. II).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The district court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the Commonwealth from enforcing the mandatory retirement provision of the new law. The preliminary injunction provided that the Commonwealth was \"temporarily restrained and enjoined from dismissing or retiring plaintiffs or other officers because they are aged 55 or older.\" <i>Gately v. Massachusetts,</i> 92-CV-13018-MA (D.Mass. Dec. 30, 1992) (order granting preliminary injunction). The Commonwealth appealed from the preliminary injunction. This court affirmed the injunction, rejecting, <i>inter alia,</i> the Commonwealth's contention that the ADEA's safe-harbor provision allowed the Commonwealth to apply to the plaintiffs the mandatory state police retirement age found in &#167; 6(3)(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Gately v. Massachusetts,</i> 2 F.3d 1221, 1229 (1st Cir.1993), <i>cert. denied,</i> 511 U.S. 1082, 114 S.Ct. 1832, 128 L.Ed.2d 461 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the denial of its appeal, the Commonwealth moved the district court to amend the preliminary injunction \"on the grounds that the current order enjoins the defendants from retiring the member[s] of the state police at any age.\" The Commonwealth requested the following order: \"that the defendants ... are temporarily restrained and enjoined from dismissing or retiring plaintiffs or other officers because they are between the ages of 55-64.\" The plaintiffs opposed the motion. On November 24, 1993, in a margin note, the district court allowed the defendant's motion and enjoined the Commonwealth from retiring state police officers because they were 64 or younger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 23, 1996, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to amend the preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs requested that the original preliminary injunction be reinstated to \"allow the few plaintiffs who are likely to attain the age of 65 before this case is resolved to avoid sustaining the very harm the ADEA and proposed legislation is designed to prevent.\" The Commonwealth opposed the new amendment arguing that the current injunction was consistent with the settled expectations of the parties because prior to the consolidation of the four divisions \"no officer had the expectation of remaining employed beyond age 65.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion noting:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue raises an important but difficult policy question. However, I am persuaded that the state law, fairness to the two police officers, and the limited immediate impact which will result, provide grounds upon which to grant the motion. With respect to these two officers and others currently on the force who might become similarly situated, therefore, the plaintiffs' motion to amend the preliminary injunction is GRANTED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gately v.

Proffered state legislation would have permitted state police officers to remain employed past the mandatory retirement age of 55 if they could pass a physical exam. This legislation was suggested in the aftermath of the \"Landry Report,\" a 3,000 page report, authorized by Congress, concluding that no age less than 70 would serve as a bona fide occupational qualification (\"BFOQ\") for law enforcement work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither a legislative solution nor any settlement occurred, however, and the plaintiffs, by then including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), which had since intervened, moved for summary judgment. The plaintiffs argued that the Commonwealth could not establish that the mandatory retirement age of 55 in &#167; 6(3)(a) was a BFOQ as required by the ADEA and, as a result, the law violated the ADEA. On June 8, 1998, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and the intervenor-plaintiff, the EEOC. The court ruled that &#167; 6(3)(a), which established a mandatory retirement age of 55 for officers of the State Police, was superseded and preempted by the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(a)(1). The court ordered that the Commonwealth was \"permanently enjoined from requiring officers of the Department of the State Police to retire solely on the basis of their age.\" The Commonwealth did not appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 2000, Gerald A. Colletta, III, a State Police Lieutenant and a member of SPARA, attempted to intervene in the <i>Gately</i> action and seek relief from the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5), in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in <i>Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents,</i> 528 U.S. 62, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000). The district court denied the motion to intervene as untimely.

SPARA, and named plaintiffs, contended that they were being injured by the continued enforcement of an invalid and overly broad <i>Gately</i> injunction. The plaintiffs asserted that the existing injunction was \"directly responsible for members of SPARA being denied promotions.\" The basis of SPARA's initial complaint and the first amended complaint was that the permanent injunction was invalid in light of <i>Kimel.</i> The district court permitted the EEOC and certain state police officers, aged 50 or older, to intervene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SPARA moved for a preliminary injunction based on reading <i>Kimel</i> to stand for the proposition that the ADEA no longer applied to the States. The district court denied the motion. <i>State Police for Automatic Ret. Ass'n v. Difava,</i> 138 F.Supp.2d 142 (D.Mass.2001). SPARA, with the district court's permission, amended its complaint two more times to include claims that the injunction in <i>Gately</i> was invalid because (1) the district court in the <i>Gately</i> action misconstrued the applicability of the safe-harbor provision in the ADEA for mandatory retirement plans for state law enforcement officers, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(j); (2) the blanket prohibition against requiring the retirement of any state police officer at age 55 or older had created a de facto class action in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23; and (3) the injunction impermissibly lacked a termination date. SPARA also appeared to argue that the State Officials were applying the injunction incorrectly in direct contravention of this court's decision in <i>Gately,</i> 2 F.3d at 1221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State Officials and the intervenors filed a motion to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint. The district court allowed the motion, concluding that SPARA's action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. <i>State Police for Automatic Ret. Ass'n v. Difava,</i> 164 F.Supp.2d 141, 155 (D.Mass.2001). The court determined that there had been (1) a final judgement in the <i>Gately</i> action; (2) that the present action derived from the same set of operative facts; and (3) that the Commonwealth had ably represented the interests of SPARA in the <i>Gately</i> action. In the alternative, the district court ruled that, given this court's decision affirming the preliminary injunction, stare decisis precluded it from reviewing or altering the permanent injunction. The district court also dismissed SPARA's claims that the lack of a termination date invalidated the permanent injunction and denied SPARA's attempt to sue under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, noting that the rules did not create federal substantive rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, SPARA does not pursue all the points raised below. SPARA does not challenge the district court's decisions (1) that stare decisis precluded it from reviewing and altering the permanent injunction; (2) that SPARA was without a cause of action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (Count II); and (3) that SPARA did not properly allege constitutional equal protection claims based on animus under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1985 and 1986 (Counts V and VI).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our discussion is limited to the issues SPARA now argues on appeal. First, SPARA claims that the district court erred when it concluded that, after the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Kimel,</i> the ADEA remains applicable to the states. Second, SPARA argues that the doctrine of res judicata does not bar it from attacking the permanent injunction issued in <i>Gately.</i> Third, SPARA attacks generally the breadth of the permanent injunction, claiming that the district court in the original <i>Gately</i> action exceeded its power when it enjoined the state from retiring state police officers subject to age 50 retirement prior to the merger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Whether the ADEA Remains Applicable to the States</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SPARA contends that the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Kimel</i> renders the ADEA inapplicable to the states in the present situation. Under this view, the continuing permanent injunction issued in the <i>Gately</i> action, enforcing the ADEA in such a way as to nullify the state's mandatory age 55 retirement law, is an illegal and invalid exercise of federal judicial power, leaving the Commonwealth's statute requiring the age-based retirement of state police officers in full force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reading of <i>Kimel</i> is erroneous. The <i>Kimel</i> Court reiterated the Supreme Court's earlier holding in <i>Wyoming,</i> 460 U.S. 226, 103 S.Ct. 1054, 75 L.Ed.2d 18 (1983), that the ADEA constitutes a valid exercise of Congress's power under Article I, &#167; 8, cl. 3 \"`[t]o regulate Commerce ... among the several States.'\" <i>Kimel,</i> 528 U.S. at 78, 120 S.Ct. 631 (quoting <i>Wyoming,</i> 460 U.S. at 243, 103 S.Ct. 1054). Moreover, nothing was said in <i>Kimel</i> to question <i>Wyoming</i>'s determination that Congress had extended the ADEA to cover state and local governments and their employees in addition to private firms and individuals. Nor did <i>Kimel</i> alter <i>Wyoming</i>'s holding that the ADEA's regulation of state and local government workers did not violate the Tenth Amendment or other provisions of the Constitution. <i>Wyoming,</i> 460 U.S. at 232-243, 103 S.Ct. 1054. All that <i>Kimel</i> held was that &#8212; although the ADEA remained a valid exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause &#8212; this fact alone did not, and could not, enable Congress to override a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity against suit. 528 U.S. at 91, 120 S.Ct. 631. Hence <i>Kimel</i> did not declare the standards of the ADEA invalid nor inapplicable as they pertained to the states, but simply endorsed the rights of states and political subdivisions to enforce against ADEA lawsuits the immunity conferred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Amendment, however, does not confer upon the states a total immunity against suit. <i>Alden v. Maine,</i> 527 U.S. 706, 755, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999). <i>Kimel</i> involved a private action for monetary damages. Neither <i>Kimel,</i> nor Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, prevents individuals, such as the <i>Gately</i> plaintiffs, from obtaining injunctive relief against a state based upon the ADEA pursuant to <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). <i>See Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,</i> 531 U.S. 356, 374 n. 9, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001) (private individuals may sue for injunctive relief to enforce the standards of the ADA under <i>Ex parte Young</i>); <i>Laro v. New Hampshire,</i> 259 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the United States itself may enforce the standards of the ADEA against states both in actions for money damages and for injunctive relief. <i>See Garrett,</i> 531 U.S. at 374 n. 9, 121 S.Ct. 955; <i>Alden,</i> 527 U.S. at 755, 119 S.Ct. 2240; <i>Laro,</i> 259 F.3d at 17. The EEOC, an agency of the United States, was a party to the suit that resulted in the issuance of the permanent injunction that SPARA now seeks to invalidate. In <i>Alden</i> the Court stated that \"[i]n ratifying the constitution, the States consented to suits brought by other States or by the Federal Government.\" 527 U.S. at 755, 119 S.Ct. 2240. Thus, even though private individuals are precluded by the Eleventh Amendment from suing the Commonwealth for money damages for violations of the ADEA, the provisions of the ADEA remain fully applicable and may be enforced against the Commonwealth in the manner described. <i>Kimel</i> has not so altered the legal landscape as to invalidate the permanent injunction issued in <i>Gately.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Remaining Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent its argument that <i>Kimel</i> removed the legal basis for the 1998 permanent injunction, SPARA's complaint is essentially a renewed attack upon the underlying merits of the injunction. SPARA's primary contention is that the mandatory retirement age of 55 found in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &#167; 6(3)(a), does not violate the ADEA because it is in fact allowed (as to certain officers) by the safe-harbor provision of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(j) (2000). SPARA also contends that the State Officials' continued adherence to the injunction violates its members' civil rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that SPARA was barred by res judicata from attempting to litigate this issue. <i>State Police for Automatic Ret. Ass'n,</i> 164 F.Supp.2d at 155. While we agree with the district court that SPARA's complaint must be dismissed, and while we do not necessarily reject the district court's res judicata analysis, we affirm on somewhat different grounds. <i>Ticketmaster-New York, Inc. v. Alioto,</i> 26 F.3d 201, 204 (1st Cir.1994). We conclude that SPARA's complaint is devoid of merit and lacks any basis on which relief can be granted.

SPARA is apparently arguing that, by failing to apply the state's 55-year mandatory retirement age to former members of the old state police division, the Commonwealth is permitting these officers to stay longer than they should, thereby filling positions into which SPARA's members, or some of them, might otherwise be promoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The safe-harbor provision in effect at the time of the <i>Gately</i> action provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]t shall not be unlawful for an employer which is a State ... to discharge any individual because of such individual's age if such action is taken &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) with respect to the employment of an individual ... as a law enforcement officer and the individual has attained the age of ... retirement in effect under applicable State or local law on March 3, 1983; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) pursuant to a bona fide ... retirement plan that is not subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(j).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision was initially enacted to give states a grace period of seven years during which time certain retirement plans for law enforcement officials would be exempted from the ADEA's reach. <i>Gately,</i> 2 F.3d at 1229. We concluded in <i>Gately</i> that, under the exemption, states were free to raise or eliminate pre-March 3, 1983 mandatory retirement ages for law enforcement officials but they could not lower retirement ages below what was in effect on that date. <i>Id.</i> In essence, the retirement age requirements of a plan in effect as of March 3, 1983 became the floor for legally valid plans adopted by a state. <i>Id.</i> (citing 132 Cong. Rec. S16850-02 (daily ed. Oct. 6, 1986)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SPARA now concedes, as was held in <i>Gately,</i> that the mandatory retirement age contained in &#167; 6(3)(a), as applied to the <i>Gately</i> plaintiffs, was not saved by the safe-harbor provision contained in &#167; 623(j). The <i>Gately</i> plaintiffs consisted of former members of the MDC Police, the Capitol Police, and the Registry Police whose retirement age had been 65. The age-55 statute, adopted in 1991 as part of the consolidation of the four state police forces, impermissibly lowered the retirement age of those plaintiffs. SPARA argues, however, that the age-55 age cap contained in &#167; 6(3)(a), as applied to former troopers in the old state police division, whose retirement age in 1983 was 50, was protected by the exemption contained in &#167; 623(j).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with this argument is that the safe-harbor provision merely permits \"an employer which is a State\" to grandfather pre-March 3, 1983, state retirement standards. It does not require a state to continue to enforce such age-based standards, nor does it empower individual state employees to force the state to do so. Having found that the mandatory age-55 retirement law enacted as part of the reorganization of the enlarged State Police Department violated the ADEA with respect to certain of its members, the district court understandably enjoined enforcement of the entire law rather than attempting to narrow it, as SPARA would prefer, so that it would still apply to some officers within the new department although not others. <i>See, e.g., Virginia v. Am. Booksellers Ass'n,</i> 484 U.S. 383, 397, 108 S.Ct. 636, 98 L.Ed.2d 782 (1988) (stating \"we will not rewrite a state law to conform it to constitutional requirements\"); <i>Consol. Cigar Corp. v. Reilly,</i> 218 F.3d 30, 56 (1st Cir. 2000) (stating courts must \"take care not to trample legislative or executive province of state authorities by making unduly substantive additions or changes to laws and regulations\"), <i>rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom., Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly,</i> 533 U.S. 525, 121 S.Ct. 2404, 150 L.Ed.2d 532 (2001). The Commonwealth, represented in the <i>Gately</i> action by its Attorney General, chose not to appeal from the broadly-worded injunction, accepting the federal court's determination that &#167; 6(3)(a) was, in effect, non-severable, i.e., could not reasonably be applied to the reorganized division in a splintered fashion so as to permit the forced retirement of certain former state troopers while all others would be free from any retirement age limit. Certainly both the district court and the Commonwealth were entitled to doubt that the Massachusetts legislature would have wanted the age-55 retirement law &#8212; that the legislature had written expressly to apply to the entire new state police department &#8212; to remain in effect only with respect to some officers while others enjoyed the full protections of the ADEA. <i>Cf. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,</i> 517 U.S. 44, 75, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996) (noting that a federal court is not free to rewrite a law \"to approximate what we think Congress might have wanted had it known that [the statute] was beyond its authority\"). It is notable that the <i>Gately</i> court afforded the parties time to return to the Massachusetts legislature in hopes of securing legislative redress &#8212; a vain hope, as matters evolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, whether to pursue the goal SPARA now seeks and attempt to persuade the federal court to narrow its injunction so as to save the retirement age selectively under the ADEA's safe-harbor provision in the case of certain former state troopers was a decision for the Commonwealth alone to make.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Clerk of Superior Court v. Treasurer and Receiver Gen.,</i> 386 Mass. 517, 437 N.E.2d 158, 163 (Mass.1982) (\"The Attorney General alone has control over the conduct of litigation involving the Commonwealth, its agencies, and officers.\"). The safe-harbor provision permits states alone to grandfather pre-March 3, 1983 retirement laws. As a narrow exception to ADEA's broad prohibition of mandatory age-based retirement, it allows states, if they choose, to continue to enforce against relevant law enforcement officers certain earlier age-based retirement laws (or to create new laws consistent with the mandates of the statute). The language of &#167; 623(j) is permissive not mandatory. The Commonwealth's and the State Officials' adherence to the permanent injunction in no way violates &#167; 623(j) much less any other provision of the ADEA. Massachusetts fought hard in <i>Gately</i> to uphold the validity of the age-55 retirement law as a whole; but once the <i>Gately</i> plaintiffs prevailed the Commonwealth was entitled to accept, without further appeal, the court's determination that the age-55 law should not stand on a fragmented basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only are the grandfather rights in &#167; 623(j) expressly accorded to the states alone, but neither &#167; 623(j), nor any other part of the ADEA, makes provision for a private cause of action in the case of individual officers or classes of officers who wish to retain state age-based retirement laws. Section 626(c)(1) of the ADEA allows \"any person aggrieved [to] bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter.\" The purpose of the ADEA is to eliminate age discrimination in the workplace. <i>McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ'g Co.,</i> 513 U.S. 352, 115 S.Ct. 879, 130 L.Ed.2d 852 (1995); <i>Lavery v. Marsh,</i> 918 F.2d 1022, 1025 (1st Cir.1990). SPARA's desire to preempt &#167; 623(j) to its own uses, so as to grandfather a state retirement law that is otherwise in contravention of the ADEA does not advance this purpose. The ADEA has been said not to prevent an employer from treating older persons more generously than others. <i>Schuler v. Polaroid Corp.,</i> 848 F.2d 276, 278 (1st Cir.1988) (Breyer, C.J.). Additionally, it is clear that &#167; 623(j) does not provide for an implied cause of action that would allow private litigants to force states, against their will, to use the protections offered in the safe-harbor provision. <i>See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Curran,</i> 456 U.S. 353, 375-78, 102 S.Ct. 1825, 72 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982); <i>Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago,</i> 441 U.S. 677, 698-99, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <i>Cort v. Ash,</i> 422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, SPARA has failed to explain how the State Officials' continued adherence to the terms of the injunction violates any cognizable statutory or constitutional rights of its members. SPARA complains that the State Officials are depriving its members \"of promotions to the position of sergeant, lieutenant, and captain because the order prohibits the implementation of the mandatory retirement age of 55.\" It is unclear from where SPARA would have us find such a \"right to promotion\" in this context. SPARA does not allege that any federal or state statute affords them a legal right to receive as many promotions as they would have received if the mandatory retirement policy they favor were in effect. No relevant precedent for such a right in federal or state law has been called to our attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SPARA also broadly alleges that the State Officials' adherence to the permanent injunction violates its members' equal protection rights. To establish an equal protection claim, SPARA must allege that its members have \"been intentionally treated differently and there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\" <i>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech,</i> 528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000) (per curiam). SPARA has not alleged that similarly situated state police officers are being promoted and its members are not. The premise of SPARA's complaint is that the lack of a mandatory retirement for certain officers is slowing the advancement of <i>all</i> state police officers. SPARA has simply failed to allege the facts necessary to support an equal protection claim. <i>See Fireside Nissan, Inc. v.

The history of the safe-harbor provision is complex. In 1986, Congress amended the ADEA to create a time-limited exemption that allowed states to make hiring and discharge decisions of law enforcement personnel pursuant to applicable state or local law in effect on March 3, 1983 &#8212; the day after issuance of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>EEOC v.

The exemption, designed to provide states an opportunity to adjust to the Supreme Court's decision, expired on December 31, 1993. On that date the ADEA's strictures against age discrimination would thus become fully applicable to state and local employment decisions related to law enforcement officers. However, on September 30, 1996, Congress again amended the ADEA so as to reinstate the safe-harbor provision, with some revisions.

State police officers were apprised of the developments in the <i>Gately</i> litigation through internal memoranda and press coverage. The <i>Gately</i> action spanned six years &#8212; from the date of the preliminary injunction issued in 1992 to the date of the nearly identical permanent injunction issued in 1998. The impact of the injunction on advancement within the department was certainly a matter that could have been anticipated during the six years the preliminary injunction was in place. The Commonwealth's litigation position &#8212; upholding the mandatory retirement age without differentiating among officers &#8212; was revealed, at the latest, during its appeal from the preliminary injunction in 1992. Yet, it was not until two years after the final judgment was entered in the <i>Gately</i> action that a SPARA member sought to intervene.

The effect of the injunction is to prevent the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (\"Commonwealth\") from enforcing a state law that requires members of its reconstituted state police force to retire upon reaching the age of 55. Appellant, State Police for Automatic Retirement Association (\"SPARA\"), contends that the challenged permanent injunction has injured its members by diminishing their promotional opportunities. According to SPARA, the injunction violates the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Kimel v.

Appellant appeals from the district court's refusal to enjoin the Commonwealth from complying with the allegedly faulty injunction and also from the court's dismissal of SPARA's complaint against three state officials (\"State Officials\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for their failure to enforce the mandatory state police retirement age of 55. In separate orders, the district court denied SPARA's request for a preliminary injunction and granted the defendant-appellees' motion to dismiss. The court ruled that SPARA's action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata and, in the alternative, by stare decisis. We affirm, albeit on somewhat different grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The focus of this action is a Massachusetts law, enacted in 1991 as part of the reorganization of the Massachusetts State Police, that mandated the automatic retirement of all members of the reconstituted police force at age 55. Pursuant to Chapter 412 of the Massachusetts Acts of 1991, the Metropolitan District Commission Police (\"MDC Police\"), the Registry of Motor Vehicles Law Enforcement Division (\"Registry Police\"), and the Capitol Police were merged with the Division of State Police. Section 122 of Chapter 412, codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &#167; 6(3)(a) (1992), required all members of the newly consolidated State Police Department to retire at age 55. Prior to the consolidation, the MDC Police, the Registry Police, and the Capitol Police had been required by Massachusetts law to retire at age 65. In contrast, the original State Police Division officers had been mandated by law to retire at age 50. Thus, &#167; 6(3)(a) added five years to the mandatory retirement age of officers formerly in the original state police division, but subtracted ten years from the forced retirement age of officers formerly belonging to the MDC Police, Registry Police, and Capitol Police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Facing mandatory retirement ten years earlier than anticipated, forty-five officers of the former MDC Police, Capitol Police, and Registry Police brought an action in the district court in December 1992, (the \"<i>Gately</i> action\"), seeking to invalidate the mandatory retirement provision contained in &#167; 6(3)(a) as being violative of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 621 <i>et seq.</i> (1999 &amp; Supp. II).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The district court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the Commonwealth from enforcing the mandatory retirement provision of the new law. The preliminary injunction provided that the Commonwealth was \"temporarily restrained and enjoined from dismissing or retiring plaintiffs or other officers because they are aged 55 or older.\" <i>Gately v. Massachusetts,</i> 92-CV-13018-MA (D.Mass. Dec. 30, 1992) (order granting preliminary injunction). The Commonwealth appealed from the preliminary injunction. This court affirmed the injunction, rejecting, <i>inter alia,</i> the Commonwealth's contention that the ADEA's safe-harbor provision allowed the Commonwealth to apply to the plaintiffs the mandatory state police retirement age found in &#167; 6(3)(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Gately v.

On November 24, 1993, in a margin note, the district court allowed the defendant's motion and enjoined the Commonwealth from retiring state police officers because they were 64 or younger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 23, 1996, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to amend the preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs requested that the original preliminary injunction be reinstated to \"allow the few plaintiffs who are likely to attain the age of 65 before this case is resolved to avoid sustaining the very harm the ADEA and proposed legislation is designed to prevent.\" The Commonwealth opposed the new amendment arguing that the current injunction was consistent with the settled expectations of the parties because prior to the consolidation of the four divisions \"no officer had the expectation of remaining employed beyond age 65.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion noting:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This issue raises an important but difficult policy question. However, I am persuaded that the state law, fairness to the two police officers, and the limited immediate impact which will result, provide grounds upon which to grant the motion. With respect to these two officers and others currently on the force who might become similarly situated, therefore, the plaintiffs' motion to amend the preliminary injunction is GRANTED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gately v.

Proffered state legislation would have permitted state police officers to remain employed past the mandatory retirement age of 55 if they could pass a physical exam. This legislation was suggested in the aftermath of the \"Landry Report,\" a 3,000 page report, authorized by Congress, concluding that no age less than 70 would serve as a bona fide occupational qualification (\"BFOQ\") for law enforcement work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither a legislative solution nor any settlement occurred, however, and the plaintiffs, by then including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), which had since intervened, moved for summary judgment. The plaintiffs argued that the Commonwealth could not establish that the mandatory retirement age of 55 in &#167; 6(3)(a) was a BFOQ as required by the ADEA and, as a result, the law violated the ADEA. On June 8, 1998, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and the intervenor-plaintiff, the EEOC. The court ruled that &#167; 6(3)(a), which established a mandatory retirement age of 55 for officers of the State Police, was superseded and preempted by the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(a)(1). The court ordered that the Commonwealth was \"permanently enjoined from requiring officers of the Department of the State Police to retire solely on the basis of their age.\" The Commonwealth did not appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 2000, Gerald A. Colletta, III, a State Police Lieutenant and a member of SPARA, attempted to intervene in the <i>Gately</i> action and seek relief from the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5), in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in <i>Kimel v.

SPARA, and named plaintiffs, contended that they were being injured by the continued enforcement of an invalid and overly broad <i>Gately</i> injunction. The plaintiffs asserted that the existing injunction was \"directly responsible for members of SPARA being denied promotions.\" The basis of SPARA's initial complaint and the first amended complaint was that the permanent injunction was invalid in light of <i>Kimel.</i> The district court permitted the EEOC and certain state police officers, aged 50 or older, to intervene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SPARA moved for a preliminary injunction based on reading <i>Kimel</i> to stand for the proposition that the ADEA no longer applied to the States. The district court denied the motion. <i>State Police for Automatic Ret. Ass'n v. Difava,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462237\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462237/state-police-for-automatic-retirement-v-difava/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2001). SPARA, with the district court's permission, amended its complaint two more times to include claims that the injunction in <i>Gately</i> was invalid because (1) the district court in the <i>Gately</i> action misconstrued the applicability of the safe-harbor provision in the ADEA for mandatory retirement plans for state law enforcement officers, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(j); (2) the blanket prohibition against requiring the retirement of any state police officer at age 55 or older had created a de facto class action in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23; and (3) the injunction impermissibly lacked a termination date. SPARA also appeared to argue that the State Officials were applying the injunction incorrectly in direct contravention of this court's decision in <i>Gately,</i> 2 F.3d at 1221.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State Officials and the intervenors filed a motion to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint. The district court allowed the motion, concluding that SPARA's action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. <i>State Police for Automatic Ret. Ass'n v. Difava,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2459735\"><a href=\"/opinion/2459735/state-police-for-automatic-retirement-v-difava/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 155 (D.Mass.2001). The court determined that there had been (1) a final judgement in the <i>Gately</i> action; (2) that the present action derived from the same set of operative facts; and (3) that the Commonwealth had ably represented the interests of SPARA in the <i>Gately</i> action. In the alternative, the district court ruled that, given this court's decision affirming the preliminary injunction, stare decisis precluded it from reviewing or altering the permanent injunction. The district court also dismissed SPARA's claims that the lack of a termination date invalidated the permanent injunction and denied SPARA's attempt to sue under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, noting that the rules did not create federal substantive rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, SPARA does not pursue all the points raised below. SPARA does not challenge the district court's decisions (1) that stare decisis precluded it from reviewing and altering the permanent injunction; (2) that SPARA was without a cause of action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (Count II); and (3) that SPARA did not properly allege constitutional equal protection claims based on animus under 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1985 and 1986 (Counts V and VI).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our discussion is limited to the issues SPARA now argues on appeal. First, SPARA claims that the district court erred when it concluded that, after the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Kimel,</i> the ADEA remains applicable to the states. Second, SPARA argues that the doctrine of res judicata does not bar it from attacking the permanent injunction issued in <i>Gately.</i> Third, SPARA attacks generally the breadth of the permanent injunction, claiming that the district court in the original <i>Gately</i> action exceeded its power when it enjoined the state from retiring state police officers subject to age 50 retirement prior to the merger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

Under this view, the continuing permanent injunction issued in the <i>Gately</i> action, enforcing the ADEA in such a way as to nullify the state's mandatory age 55 retirement law, is an illegal and invalid exercise of federal judicial power, leaving the Commonwealth's statute requiring the age-based retirement of state police officers in full force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reading of <i>Kimel</i> is erroneous.

Moreover, nothing was said in <i>Kimel</i> to question <i>Wyoming</i>'s determination that Congress had extended the ADEA to cover state and local governments and their employees in addition to private firms and individuals.

SPARA's primary contention is that the mandatory retirement age of 55 found in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 32, &#167; 6(3)(a), does not violate the ADEA because it is in fact allowed (as to certain officers) by the safe-harbor provision of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(j) (2000).

SPARA is apparently arguing that, by failing to apply the state's 55-year mandatory retirement age to former members of the old state police division, the Commonwealth is permitting these officers to stay longer than they should, thereby filling positions into which SPARA's members, or some of them, might otherwise be promoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The safe-harbor provision in effect at the time of the <i>Gately</i> action provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]t shall not be unlawful for an employer which is a State ... to discharge any individual because of such individual's age if such action is taken &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) with respect to the employment of an individual ... as a law enforcement officer and the individual has attained the age of ... retirement in effect under applicable State or local law on March 3, 1983; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) pursuant to a bona fide ... retirement plan that is not subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(j).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision was initially enacted to give states a grace period of seven years during which time certain retirement plans for law enforcement officials would be exempted from the ADEA's reach. <i>Gately,</i> 2 F.3d at 1229. We concluded in <i>Gately</i> that, under the exemption, states were free to raise or eliminate pre-March 3, 1983 mandatory retirement ages for law enforcement officials but they could not lower retirement ages below what was in effect on that date. <i>Id.</i> In essence, the retirement age requirements of a plan in effect as of March 3, 1983 became the floor for legally valid plans adopted by a state. <i>Id.</i> (citing 132 Cong. Rec. S16850-02 (daily ed.

The <i>Gately</i> plaintiffs consisted of former members of the MDC Police, the Capitol Police, and the Registry Police whose retirement age had been 65. The age-55 statute, adopted in 1991 as part of the consolidation of the four state police forces, impermissibly lowered the retirement age of those plaintiffs. SPARA argues, however, that the age-55 age cap contained in &#167; 6(3)(a), as applied to former troopers in the old state police division, whose retirement age in 1983 was 50, was protected by the exemption contained in &#167; 623(j).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with this argument is that the safe-harbor provision merely permits \"an employer which is a State\" to grandfather pre-March 3, 1983, state retirement standards. It does not require a state to continue to enforce such age-based standards, nor does it empower individual state employees to force the state to do so. Having found that the mandatory age-55 retirement law enacted as part of the reorganization of the enlarged State Police Department violated the ADEA with respect to certain of its members, the district court understandably enjoined enforcement of the entire law rather than attempting to narrow it, as SPARA would prefer, so that it would still apply to some officers within the new department although not others. <i>See, e.g., Virginia v.

The Commonwealth, represented in the <i>Gately</i> action by its Attorney General, chose not to appeal from the broadly-worded injunction, accepting the federal court's determination that &#167; 6(3)(a) was, in effect, non-severable, i.e., could not reasonably be applied to the reorganized division in a splintered fashion so as to permit the forced retirement of certain former state troopers while all others would be free from any retirement age limit. Certainly both the district court and the Commonwealth were entitled to doubt that the Massachusetts legislature would have wanted the age-55 retirement law &#8212; that the legislature had written expressly to apply to the entire new state police department &#8212; to remain in effect only with respect to some officers while others enjoyed the full protections of the ADEA. <i>Cf.

The safe-harbor provision permits states alone to grandfather pre-March 3, 1983 retirement laws. As a narrow exception to ADEA's broad prohibition of mandatory age-based retirement, it allows states, if they choose, to continue to enforce against relevant law enforcement officers certain earlier age-based retirement laws (or to create new laws consistent with the mandates of the statute). The language of &#167; 623(j) is permissive not mandatory. The Commonwealth's and the State Officials' adherence to the permanent injunction in no way violates &#167; 623(j) much less any other provision of the ADEA. Massachusetts fought hard in <i>Gately</i> to uphold the validity of the age-55 retirement law as a whole; but once the <i>Gately</i> plaintiffs prevailed the Commonwealth was entitled to accept, without further appeal, the court's determination that the age-55 law should not stand on a fragmented basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only are the grandfather rights in &#167; 623(j) expressly accorded to the states alone, but neither &#167; 623(j), nor any other part of the ADEA, makes provision for a private cause of action in the case of individual officers or classes of officers who wish to retain state age-based retirement laws. Section 626(c)(1) of the ADEA allows \"any person aggrieved [to] bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter.\" The purpose of the ADEA is to eliminate age discrimination in the workplace. <i>McKennon v.

SPARA's desire to preempt &#167; 623(j) to its own uses, so as to grandfather a state retirement law that is otherwise in contravention of the ADEA does not advance this purpose.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110881\"><a href=\"/opinion/110881/eeoc-v-wyoming/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span> (1983), holding that the ADEA validly applied to state and local governments. The exemption, designed to provide states an opportunity to adjust to the Supreme Court's decision, expired on December 31, 1993. On that date the ADEA's strictures against age discrimination would thus become fully applicable to state and local employment decisions related to law enforcement officers. However, on September 30, 1996, Congress again amended the ADEA so as to reinstate the safe-harbor provision, with some revisions. The amendments were made retroactive to December 31, 1993.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We note that SPARA's members had ample notice of the<i>Gately</i> action. They could have brought their views to the attention of the Commonwealth's attorney general in a timely fashion, or even sought to persuade the court to allow them to intervene permissively, or, possibly, to file an amicus brief on the point now made. State police officers were apprised of the developments in the <i>Gately</i> litigation through internal memoranda and press coverage. The <i>Gately</i> action spanned six years &#8212; from the date of the preliminary injunction issued in 1992 to the date of the nearly identical permanent injunction issued in 1998. The impact of the injunction on advancement within the department was certainly a matter that could have been anticipated during the six years the preliminary injunction was in place. The Commonwealth's litigation position &#8212; upholding the mandatory retirement age without differentiating among officers &#8212; was revealed, at the latest, during its appeal from the preliminary injunction in 1992. Yet, it was not until two years after the final judgment was entered in the <i>Gately</i> action that a SPARA member sought to intervene. When that motion to intervene was denied as untimely, the intervenor did not appeal from the decision.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
