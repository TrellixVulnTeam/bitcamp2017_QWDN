OSEDIACZ,\n\n                       Plaintiff, Appellee,\n\n                                v.\n\n                 CITY OF CRANSTON, ETC., ET AL.,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellants.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n          [Hon. William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Tom Marcelle, with whom Steven Frias and Michael Glucksman,\nCity Solicitor, were on brief, for appellants.\n     Michael T. Eskey, with whom Amato A. DeLuca, Miriam Weizenbaum\nand DeLuca & Weizenbaum Ltd. were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                           July 6, 2005\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.            This appeal has its genesis in a\n\ndecision by Cranston, Rhode Island (the City) to institute a policy\n\n(the Policy) that allowed private parties to erect holiday displays\n\non   a    prime    piece     of    public     property,   subject   to   certain\n\nadministrative requirements and the approval of the mayor.                      A\n\nnumber     of     individuals      and   groups    seized    the    opportunity.\n\nCollectively, they erected a myrioramic array of exhibits, some of\n\nwhich (such as a nativity scene) were overtly religious. A citizen\n\nof Cranston took umbrage and sued for declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief.\n\n            The district court rebuffed the plaintiff's Establishment\n\nClause challenge but found her Free Speech Clause claim meritorious\n\nand enjoined continued use of the Policy on the ground that it gave\n\nthe mayor unconstrained authority to approve (and, by extension, to\n\ndisapprove) proposed displays.              Osediacz v. City of Cranston, 344\n\nF. Supp. 2d 799, 814 (D.R.I. 2004).            The City appeals.    Concluding,\n\nas we do, that the plaintiff lacks standing to mount a challenge\n\nunder the Free Speech Clause, we reverse.\n\n                                         I.\n\n                                     Background\n\n            The facts are straightforward.                As the 2003 holiday\n\nseason approached, the City issued the Policy, which designated the\n\nsouth lawn of City Hall as a limited public forum for the display\n\nof   holiday-themed        and    seasonal    decorations.    The    Policy   was\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fdesigned to continue in force from year to year.                  It permitted the\n\npublic to erect \"appropriate\" displays between December 5 and\n\nJanuary 1, defined \"appropriate\" as \"being suitable and proper for\n\nthe holiday occasion,\" and explicitly prohibited any display that\n\nwould \"shock the consciousness [sic] of the community.\" The Policy\n\nrequired any person wishing to erect an exhibit to provide his or\n\nher     name,   address,      and   telephone       number,   a    brief   written\n\ndescription of the exhibit, and a signed release absolving the City\n\nof    any   liability   for    damage   to    the    exhibit.       Of   particular\n\npertinence here, the Policy proclaimed that the mayor or his\n\ndesignee \"must approve\" all displays.\n\n             In short order, several exhibits appeared on the south\n\nlawn.       These included a large menorah accompanied by a sign\n\nconveying wishes for \"a Happy Chanukah\"; a near-life-size nativity\n\nscene; an inflatable seven-foot-tall snowman and a similarly sized\n\nSanta Claus; a huge holographic angel; a train of fifteen pink\n\nflamingos with Santa Claus hats; and a sign that read \"Happy\n\nHolidays from the Teamsters Union.\"            Faced with this embarrassment\n\nof riches, the City determined on December 21, 2003 that the south\n\nlawn could contain nothing more and barred further entries.\n\n             On December 22, 2003, plaintiff-appellee Grace Osediacz\n\nfiled suit in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nRhode Island.     She asserted that the display of religious symbols\n\non the City Hall lawn violated the Establishment Clause.                   She also\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fchallenged     the   Policy   as   contravening     the   Constitution's\n\nEstablishment, Free Speech, and Due Process Clauses.\n\n          After a brief period of discovery, the City moved for\n\nsummary judgment with respect to the Establishment Clause claims.\n\nThe plaintiff opposed the motion.        The district court expanded the\n\nsummary judgment battleground to include the free speech claim and\n\nsolicited additional affidavits and briefs.        See Berkovitz v. Home\n\nBox Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1996) (discussing a\n\ndistrict court's authority to grant sua sponte summary judgment).\n\n             In her main affidavit, the plaintiff portrayed herself as\n\na Cranston resident and taxpayer who regularly conducts business at\n\nCity Hall.     She stated that she found the spectacle of a menorah\n\nand creche on municipal property an inappropriate governmental\n\nendorsement of religion.       She did not aver, however, that she\n\nherself harbored any interest in erecting a display.\n\n             The district court ruled that the tableau on the south\n\nlawn of City Hall, though it included religious symbols, was\n\nnothing more than \"a celebration of the holiday in both its\n\nreligious and secular senses.\"      Osediacz, 344 F. Supp. 2d at 807\n\n(citing Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 680-81 (1984)). The court\n\nfurther ruled that the displays had no religious purpose and that\n\nthey did not have the effect of endorsing religion.        Id. at 807-10\n\n(citing County of Allegheny v. ACLU, 492 U.S. 573, 579-82 (1989)).\n\nConsequently, the court granted partial summary judgment in the\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fCity's favor on the plaintiff's flagship Establishment Clause\n\nclaim.1      See id. at 815.\n\n               The court was less sanguine about the Policy's free\n\nspeech implications.          After determining that the plaintiff had\n\nstanding to raise a free speech claim, id. at 811-12, the court\n\nnoted       that   the   Policy,   on   its    face,   provided    no   meaningful\n\nstandards that in any way constrained the mayor's authority to\n\napprove or disapprove displays, id. at 812-13.                    Nor was there a\n\nsufficient history of past practice from which such standards could\n\nbe inferred. Id. at 813-14. Because the Policy vested essentially\n\nstandardless discretion in the mayor to grant or withhold approval\n\nfor displays at his whim, the Policy constituted a prior restraint\n\non speech and, therefore, transgressed the Free Speech Clause of\n\nthe First Amendment.         Id. at 814 (citing City of Lakewood v. Plain\n\nDealer Publ'g Co., 486 U.S. 750, 772 (1988)).                The court granted\n\npartial summary judgment for the plaintiff on that claim, id., and\n\naccordingly, declined to address her due process claim, id. at 801\n\nn.2.\n\n               The City appeals from the district court's resolution of\n\nthe free speech claim.             We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1291.       Since the district court decided this case at the summary\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      The plaintiff has not appealed from this ukase. Accordingly,\nthat portion of the judgment is not before us and we eschew further\ndiscussion of it.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fjudgment stage, we undertake de novo review.       Houlton Citizens'\n\nCoalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                 II.\n\n                               Analysis\n\n           Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Rhode\n\nIsland v. EPA, 378 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 2004).           They are not\n\nempowered to offer advisory opinions.     United States v. Green, 407\n\nF.3d 434, 444 (1st Cir. 2005).         Thus, standing to sue is an\n\nindispensable component of federal court jurisdiction.          As the\n\nSupreme Court has explained:\n\n           [T]he case or controversy requirement defines\n           with respect to the Judicial Branch the idea\n           of separation of powers on which the Federal\n           Government is founded. The several doctrines\n           that   have  grown   up  to   elaborate  that\n           requirement are founded in concern about the\n           proper — and properly limited — role of the\n           courts in a democratic society.\n\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n           In this instance, our discussion begins and ends with the\n\nstanding   issue.     Standing    doctrine    comprises    a   mix   of\n\nconstitutional and prudential criteria. See Elk Grove Unified Sch.\n\nDist. v. Newdow, 124 S. Ct. 2301, 2308 (2004); N.H. Right to Life\n\nPAC v. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1996).    The constitutional\n\ncore of standing requires that a plaintiff make a tripartite\n\nshowing:   she must demonstrate that she has suffered an injury in\n\nfact, that her injury is fairly traceable to the disputed conduct,\n\n                                 -6-\n\fand   that    the    relief    sought    promises     to    redress   the   injury\n\nsustained.        Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61\n\n(1992); Gardner, 99 F.3d at 13.            The party seeking to invoke the\n\nfederal court's jurisdiction — normally, the plaintiff — bears the\n\nburden of pleading and proof on each step of the standing pavane.\n\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561.\n\n             In keeping with these important concepts, the Supreme\n\nCourt has embellished the constitutional requirements attendant to\n\nstanding with an array of prudential monitions.                  The prudential\n\naspects      of    standing   include     \"the    general    prohibition     on    a\n\nlitigant's raising another person's legal rights, the rule barring\n\nadjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed\n\nin    the   representative      branches,       and   the   requirement     that   a\n\nplaintiff's complaint fall within the zone of interests protected\n\nby the law invoked.\"          Allen, 468 U.S. at 751.\n\n             In     this   case,   the   City    challenges    the    plaintiff's\n\nstanding.         It reasons that because the plaintiff never had any\n\ninterest in erecting a display, there was no chance that she would\n\nbe subjected to the vagaries of the approval process and, hence,\n\nshe has failed to show a sufficiently personalized injury emanating\n\nfrom the Policy.           To bolster this reasoning, the City relies\n\nheavily on Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1 (1972), in which the Supreme\n\nCourt wrote that if the complaining parties \"themselves are not\n\nchilled, but seek only to represent those millions whom they\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fbelieve are so chilled, [they] clearly lack that personal stake in\n\nthe outcome of the controversy essential to standing.\"                           Id. at 13\n\nn.7 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The      plaintiff    attempts      to    blunt       the   force     of    this\n\nreasoning by touting a line of cases holding that traditional\n\nstanding requirements are relaxed in the precincts patrolled by the\n\nFirst Amendment.        See, e.g., Broderick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601,\n\n612 (1973) (holding that when First Amendment concerns are at\n\nstake, a plaintiff may \"challenge a statute not because [her] own\n\nrights are violated, but because . . . the statute's very existence\n\nmay    cause     others    not        before    the       court    to     refrain       from\n\nconstitutionally protected speech or expression\").                            The district\n\ncourt accepted this distinction.               See Osediacz, 344 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n812.   We do not.\n\n            We think that this clash between competing lines of\n\nauthority      may   readily     be    resolved      by   sorting       out    some    basic\n\nconcepts.      Standing is not a unitary concept but, rather, a group\n\nof doctrines collectively intended to ensure that the federal\n\ncourts adjudicate only those actual cases or controversies that\n\nfall within the purview of Article III of the Constitution.                              See\n\nNewdow, 124 S. Ct. at 2308 (describing standing doctrine as \"a\n\nseries of rules\").         When certain types of facial challenges to\n\nstatutes, ordinances, regulations, or governmental policies are\n\npremised on First Amendment grounds, they invite a lowering of\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fconventional standing barriers because the traditional jus tertii\n\nban   on   litigating   the    rights   of   third   parties   is    arguably\n\ninapplicable.2      See Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505\n\nU.S. 123, 129 (1992) (explaining that third-party standing concerns\n\nwill not pretermit a facial challenge to a statute on First\n\nAmendment grounds).     Thus, the lowering of the bar intersects with\n\nstanding doctrine only on the issue of third-party standing.\n\n             That distinction demonstrates why City of Lakewood and\n\nsimilar cases are not persuasive here.               Historically, facial\n\nchallenges were disfavored, in part because they were thought to\n\nrequire the challenger to raise the rights of others.              See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 20-22 (1960).                Under this\n\ntraditional approach, the normal jus tertii rules made it nearly\n\nimpossible     to   have   a    court     declare    a   statute     facially\n\nunconstitutional; after all, an individual litigant would have\n\nstanding to object to it only as applied to her situation.                See\n\nRichard H. Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third Party\n\nStanding, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 1321, 1322 (2000).           As a corollary, a\n\nplaintiff who had not herself been subjected to an unconstitutional\n\n\n      2\n      Even this limited relaxation of conventional standing\nrequirements is controversial. See, e.g., Richard H. Fallon, Jr.,\nAs-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third Party Standing, 113\nHarv. L. Rev. 1321, 1359-64 (2000) (arguing that the Supreme\nCourt's permissive approach to facial challenges in the First\nAmendment context has little to do with third-party standing but,\nrather, reflects a substantive concern that facially invalid\nstatutes harm the plaintiff herself, regardless of whether a more\nnarrowly drawn statute could regulate her conduct).\n\n                                    -9-\n\fexercise of power could not challenge the offending statute at all.\n\nSee id.\n\n             The City of Lakewood Court recognized that as long as no\n\none was denied a permit, no one would have standing to mount a\n\nchallenge — yet the chilling effect of the unconstitutional grant\n\nof standardless discretion would remain undiminished.                  Id. at 757-\n\n58.   To correct this problem, the Court loosened the customary\n\nprudential    limits   that    constrain       a    plaintiff's      standing   with\n\nrespect to facial challenges brought against statutes that vest\n\nunbridled discretion in public officials to censor speech. See id.\n\nat 759. Confronted with a facial challenge to a licencing statute,\n\nit ruled that in the case of \"a licensing statute [that] allegedly\n\nvests unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to\n\npermit or deny expressive activity,\" a plaintiff \"who is subject to\n\nthe law may challenge it facially without the necessity of first\n\napplying for, and being denied, a license.\"                  468 U.S. at 755-56.\n\n             The Court did not, however, carve out any exception to\n\nthe   core    requirements     of       constitutional        standing.         These\n\nrequirements, including the bedrock requirement that the plaintiff\n\nherself   have   suffered     an    injury     in    fact,    were   left   intact.\n\nImportantly, the Court recognized that the theoretical risk of\n\nself-censorship     inherent       in   statutes      conferring      standardless\n\ndiscretion on public officials was not itself a sufficient injury\n\nwithin the meaning of Article III.                  Id. at 759.        Indeed, the\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fJustices stressed that a plaintiff, as a prerequisite to suit, had\n\nto show that the law that she aspired to challenge \"pose[d] a real\n\nand substantial threat [to] identified censorship risks.\"         Id.\n\n(emphasis supplied); see also Tatum, 408 U.S. at 13-14 & n.7\n\n(explaining that even in First Amendment cases, courts must guard\n\nagainst rendering advisory opinions).\n\n          Virtually by definition, the threat of self-censorship\n\ncannot exist if a party has no intention either of speaking or\n\notherwise exposing herself to the vagaries of a standardless\n\nlicensing policy.   It is, therefore, not surprising that in every\n\ncase the plaintiff cites, the party mounting a facial challenge at\n\nthe very least desired or intended to undertake activity within the\n\ncompass of the challenged statute.      See, e.g., Forsyth County, 505\n\nU.S. at 127; City of Lakewood, 486 U.S. at 753-54.      Consequently,\n\nthose cases cannot be read to reduce to a state of irrelevancy the\n\nconstitutionally mandated requirement that a plaintiff must show an\n\ninjury in fact.\n\n          The short of it is that were the instant plaintiff armed\n\nwith constitutionally sufficient standing credentials, she could\n\nprevail on an issue of this sort merely by showing that the Policy,\n\nby vesting standardless discretion in the mayor, constitutes an\n\nimpermissible prior restraint.     See, e.g., Freedman v. Maryland,\n\n380 U.S. 51, 56 (1965).   In that event, the plaintiff could press\n\nthe rights of others; she would not have to make the additional\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f(prudential) showing that the mayor could not, consistent with the\n\nFree Speech Clause, deny her permission to erect a particular\n\ndisplay.    The net result, then, is that even though prudential\n\nstanding    concerns   are   relaxed   in   certain   facial   challenges\n\nimplicating the First Amendment, a litigant still must demonstrate\n\nthat she satisfies the constitutional minima essential to establish\n\nstanding.\n\n            Seen in this light, the question reduces to whether the\n\nplaintiff has been injured within the meaning of Article III.\n\nHere, that inquiry is informed by what the plaintiff does not\n\nassert.     She does not assert that she herself unsuccessfully\n\nattempted to place her handiwork on the south lawn of City Hall.\n\nShe does not assert that she has any interest in erecting a\n\ndisplay, but fears that her expression will be subjugated to a\n\nstandardless approval process. She does not assert that the Policy\n\ntakes away her appetite for expressing herself or chills her speech\n\nin any cognizable way.       Her only claim of injury is that, as a\n\nresident and taxpayer, she is subject to the effects of the Policy\n\nand that, by conferring unbridled discretion on the mayor to\n\napprove or reject displays, the Policy has a chilling effect on the\n\nspeech of others.\n\n            This is not a sufficient predicate to allow this suit to\n\ngo forward.    It is apodictic that a mere interest in seeing the\n\ngovernment turn square corners is not the kind of particularized\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\finterest    that   can   satisfy    the    most   basic   constitutional\n\nprerequisite for standing.     See Fed. Election Comm'n v. Akins, 524\n\nU.S. 11, 23-24 (1998) (collecting cases).          It has been equally\n\nclear for more than three-quarters of a century that, with certain\n\nnarrow exceptions not implicated here, taxpayers, as such, lack\n\ngeneralized   standing    to   challenge    the   constitutionality    of\n\ngovernmental action.     See Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487\n\n(1923). The plaintiff's standing, therefore, cannot be grounded on\n\nthe mere fact that she pays taxes to a municipality which, in turn,\n\nexpends funds to further an unconstitutional exercise of government\n\npower.     See Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for\n\nSeparation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464, 477 (1982).\n\n           In the last analysis, all that remains is the question of\n\nwhether the risk that the Policy will have a chilling effect on the\n\nspeech of others is a sufficient injury to the plaintiff to meet\n\nthe first prong of the constitutional test for standing.              The\n\nSupreme Court answered that question in Tatum, a case that involved\n\na challenge to the scope of domestic intelligence gathering by the\n\nUnited States Army.      There, the plaintiffs alleged that the Army\n\nwas spying on civilians whom the Army believed might engage in\n\ncivil disobedience and that such systematic surveillance chilled\n\nspeech by deterring citizens from indulging in expression that\n\nmight draw the Army's ire.     Tatum, 408 U.S. at 9-10.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f          The Tatum Court held that the plaintiffs, who had not\n\nthemselves   been   surveilled,   lacked        standing   to   challenge   the\n\npurportedly pernicious practice.          Id.     In so holding, the Court\n\nacknowledged that a chill on speech sometimes may be a cognizable\n\ninjury but explained that, in order to have standing, the plaintiff\n\nmust be within the class of persons potentially chilled.               Id. at\n\n12-13.   In words that seem apropos here, the Court concluded:\n\n\"Allegations of a subjective 'chill' are not an adequate substitute\n\nfor a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of\n\nspecific future harm.\"    Id. at 13-14.\n\n          The plaintiff's plight falls squarely within the compass\n\nof this admonition.      Although offended by the Policy, she has\n\nsustained no injury in fact.      Thus, she has no sufficient personal\n\nstake in this litigation to ground a determination that she has\n\nstanding to sue.    See id. at 13 n.7.          Even if the Policy chilled\n\nsome speech, it did not chill any of the plaintiff's speech.\n\n          The plaintiff strives mightily to dodge this bullet. Her\n\nfirst attempted evasion is a suggestion that we should not assume\n\nfrom an empty record that her speech was not chilled.                       That\n\nsuggestion turns the standing inquiry on its head.                 It was the\n\nplaintiff who invoked federal jurisdiction.                Hence, it was her\n\nburden to put adequate facts in the record from which a court\n\nreasonably could conclude that she was among those whose speech was\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fpotentially chilled.        See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.           Having failed to\n\ncarry that burden, she lacks standing to maintain this suit.\n\n             The    plaintiff's     second       attempted    evasion     is   equally\n\nunavailing.    She suggests that because the Policy vests unfettered\n\ndiscretion in the mayor over what displays are permitted, the mayor\n\nconceivably        could   use     that     discretion       to   favor    religious\n\nexpositions and, thus, infringe the plaintiff's rights under the\n\nEstablishment       Clause.        We    reject    this    effort   to    hitch    the\n\nplaintiff's First Amendment claim to her defunct Establishment\n\nClause claim.       Simply asserting that the mayor might exercise his\n\nauthority in an unconstitutional manner is no different than saying\n\nthat   the    existence       of        standardless      discretion      is    itself\n\nunconstitutional and redressable without regard to the existence of\n\nan injury in fact.         Any way the pie is sliced, the plaintiff still\n\nhas to show some reasonable possibility that she would be subject\n\nto the constitutionally defective action.                 See Tatum, 408 U.S. at\n\n13 n.7.   She has not done so.\n\n             It is, of course, disquieting whenever government takes\n\nan action that seems to transgress a constitutional protection.\n\nBut in the law, as elsewhere, \"two wrongs seldom make a right,\"\n\nFoster v. Dalton, 71 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 1995) — and it would be\n\nwrong to arrogate unto ourselves the power to hear a case at the\n\nbehest of a plaintiff who lacks standing to sue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\f            Moreover,        we   perceive    no    unfairness.         The   standing\n\ninquiry is not very demanding.             To satisfy its first element, the\n\nplaintiff       need   not   show   that     the    mayor    actually     denied   her\n\npermission to erect a display.               See, e.g., City of Lakewood, 486\n\nU.S. at 756.      She need not even show that she actually made such a\n\nrequest.    See, e.g., Freedman, 380 U.S. at 56.                  Nevertheless, the\n\nrecord must contain evidence sufficient to indicate an objectively\n\nreasonable possibility that she would be subject to the allegedly\n\nunconstitutional mayoral approval requirement. See Tatum, 408 U.S.\n\nat 11; see also Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs.\n\n(TOC), Inc.,       528   U.S.     167,   183-84     (2000)      (explaining    that   a\n\nplaintiff need not show a certainty of future harm to establish\n\nstanding, so long as there is a reasonable threat of such harm).\n\nThe record before us contains no such evidence.                       It follows that\n\nthis suit cannot be maintained in a federal court.\n\n                                         III.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n            Let us be perfectly clear.                  We recognize, as did the\n\nlearned district court, Osediacz, 344 F. Supp. 2d at 812-14, that\n\nthe Policy is constitutionally suspect and we encourage the City to\n\nabandon it (or, at least, to modify it substantially).                        Absent a\n\nplaintiff with a cognizable interest in the outcome, however, this\n\nis   not   an    appropriate      proceeding       in   which    to   adjudicate   the\n\nPolicy's merits.\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\f          We need go no further.       The Constitution requires that\n\nlitigants have a personal stake in a case before they may sue in a\n\nfederal court, see, e.g., Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499\n\n(1975), and this plaintiff has not provided facts sufficient to\n\nshow that she possesses such a stake. Accordingly, her free speech\n\nclaim should have been dismissed without prejudice for want of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.3\n\n          We reverse the partial summary judgment entered by the\n\ndistrict court on the free speech claim and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to dismiss that claim and the due\n\nprocess claim without prejudice for want of standing.     All parties\n\nshall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      For the same reasons, the plaintiff's due process claim, not\nreached by the lower court, see 344 F. Supp. 2d at 801 n.2,\nlikewise should have been dismissed.\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

A number of individuals and groups seized the opportunity. Collectively, they erected a myrioramic array of exhibits, some of which (such as a nativity scene) were overtly religious. A citizen of Cranston took umbrage and sued for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rebuffed the plaintiff's Establishment Clause challenge but found her Free Speech Clause claim meritorious and enjoined continued use of the Policy on the ground that it gave the mayor unconstrained authority to approve (and, by extension, to disapprove) proposed displays. <i>Osediacz v. City of Cranston,</i> 344 F.Supp.2d 799, 814 (D.R.I.2004). The City appeals. Concluding, as we do, that the plaintiff lacks standing to mount a challenge under the Free Speech Clause, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are straightforward. As the 2003 holiday season approached, the City issued the Policy, which designated the south lawn of City Hall as a limited public forum for the display of holiday-themed and seasonal decorations. The Policy was designed to continue in force from year to year. It permitted the public to erect \"appropriate\" displays between December 5 and January 1, defined \"appropriate\" as \"being suitable and proper for the holiday occasion,\" and explicitly prohibited any display that would \"shock the consciousness [sic] of the community.\" The Policy required any person wishing to erect an exhibit to provide his or her name, address, and telephone number, a brief written description of the exhibit, and a signed release absolving the City of any liability for damage to the exhibit. Of particular pertinence here, the Policy proclaimed that the mayor or his designee \"must approve\" all displays.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short order, several exhibits appeared on the south lawn. These included a large menorah accompanied by a sign conveying wishes for \"a Happy Chanukah\"; a near-life-size nativity scene; an inflatable seven-foot-tall snowman and a similarly sized Santa Claus; a huge holographic angel; a train of fifteen pink flamingos with Santa Claus hats; and a sign that read \"Happy Holidays from the Teamsters Union.\" Faced with this embarrassment of riches, the City determined on December 21, 2003 that the south lawn could contain nothing more and barred further entries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, 2003, plaintiff-appellee Grace Osediacz filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. She asserted that the display of religious symbols on the City Hall lawn violated the Establishment Clause. She also challenged the Policy as contravening the Constitution's Establishment, Free Speech, and Due Process Clauses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a brief period of discovery, the City moved for summary judgment with respect to the Establishment Clause claims. The plaintiff opposed the motion. The district court expanded the summary judgment battleground to include the free speech claim and solicited additional affidavits and briefs. <i>See Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,</i> 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.1996) (discussing a district court's authority to grant sua sponte summary judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her main affidavit, the plaintiff portrayed herself as a Cranston resident and taxpayer who regularly conducts business at City Hall. She stated that she found the spectacle of a menorah and creche on municipal property an inappropriate governmental endorsement of religion. She did not aver, however, that she herself harbored any interest in erecting a display.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that the tableau on the south lawn of City Hall, though it included religious symbols, was nothing more than \"a celebration of the holiday in both its religious and secular senses.\" <i>Osediacz,</i> 344 F.Supp.2d at 807 (citing <i>Lynch v. Donnelly,</i> 465 U.S. 668, 680-81, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984)). The court further ruled that the displays had no religious purpose and that they did not have the effect of endorsing religion. <i>Id.</i> at 807-10 (citing <i>County of Allegheny v. ACLU,</i> 492 U.S. 573, 579-82, 109 S.Ct. 3086, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989)). Consequently, the court granted partial summary judgment in the City's favor on the plaintiff's flagship Establishment Clause claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See id.</i> at 815.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court was less sanguine about the Policy's free speech implications. After determining that the plaintiff had standing to raise a free speech claim, <i>id.</i> at 811-12, the court noted that the Policy, on its face, provided no meaningful standards that in any way constrained the mayor's authority to approve or disapprove displays, <i>id.</i> at 812-13. Nor was there a sufficient history of past practice from which such standards could be inferred. <i>Id.</i> at 813-14. Because the Policy vested essentially standardless discretion in the mayor to grant or withhold approval for displays at his whim, the Policy constituted a prior restraint on speech and, therefore, transgressed the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 814 (citing <i>City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ'g Co.,</i> 486 U.S. 750, 772, 108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988)). The court granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiff on that claim, <i>id.,</i> and accordingly, declined to address her due process claim, <i>id.</i> at 801 n. 2, 108 S.Ct. 2138.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City appeals from the district court's resolution of the free speech claim. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. Since the district court decided this case at the summary judgment stage, we undertake de novo review. <i>Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Analysis</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. <i>Rhode Island v. EPA,</i> 378 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.2004). They are not empowered to offer advisory opinions. <i>United States v. Green,</i> 407 F.3d 434, 444 (1st Cir.2005). Thus, standing to sue is an indispensable component of federal court jurisdiction. As the Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he case or controversy requirement defines with respect to the Judicial Branch the idea of separation of powers on which the Federal Government is founded. The several doctrines that have grown up to elaborate that requirement are founded in concern about the proper &#8212; and properly limited &#8212; role of the courts in a democratic society.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 750, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, our discussion begins and ends with the standing issue. Standing doctrine comprises a mix of constitutional and prudential criteria. <i>See Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow,</i> 542 U.S. 1, 124 S.Ct. 2301, 2308, 159 L.Ed.2d 98 (2004); <i>N.H. Right to Life PAC v. Gardner,</i> 99 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.1996). The constitutional core of standing requires that a plaintiff make a tripartite showing: she must demonstrate that she has suffered an injury in fact, that her injury is fairly traceable to the disputed conduct, and that the relief sought promises to redress the injury sustained. <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); <i>Gardner,</i> 99 F.3d at 13. The party seeking to invoke the federal court's jurisdiction &#8212; normally, the plaintiff &#8212; bears the burden of pleading and proof on each step of the standing pavane. <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In keeping with these important concepts, the Supreme Court has embellished the constitutional requirements attendant to standing with an array of prudential monitions. The prudential aspects of standing include \"the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff's complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.\" <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S. at 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the City challenges the plaintiff's standing. It reasons that because the plaintiff never had any interest in erecting a display, there was no chance that she would be subjected to the vagaries of the approval process and, hence, she has failed to show a sufficiently personalized injury emanating from the Policy. To bolster this reasoning, the City relies heavily on <i>Laird v. Tatum,</i> 408 U.S. 1, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972), in which the Supreme Court wrote that if the complaining parties \"themselves are not chilled, but seek only to represent those millions whom they believe are so chilled, [they] clearly lack that personal stake in the outcome of the controversy essential to standing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13 n. 7, 92 S.Ct. 2318 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff attempts to blunt the force of this reasoning by touting a line of cases holding that traditional standing requirements are relaxed in the precincts patrolled by the First Amendment. <i>See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> 413 U.S. 601, 612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973) (holding that when First Amendment concerns are at stake, a plaintiff may \"challenge a statute not because [her] own rights are violated, but because . . . the statute's very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression\"). The district court accepted this distinction. <i>See Osediacz,</i> 344 F.Supp.2d at 812. We do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this clash between competing lines of authority may readily be resolved by sorting out some basic concepts. Standing is not a unitary concept but, rather, a group of doctrines collectively intended to ensure that the federal courts adjudicate only those actual cases or controversies that fall within the purview of Article III of the Constitution. <i>See Newdow,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2308 (describing standing doctrine as \"a series of rules\"). When certain types of facial challenges to statutes, ordinances, regulations, or governmental policies are premised on First Amendment grounds, they invite a lowering of conventional standing barriers because the traditional <i>jus tertii</i> ban on litigating the rights of third parties is arguably inapplicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement,</i> 505 U.S. 123, 129, 112 S.Ct. 2395, 120 L.Ed.2d 101 (1992) (explaining that third-party standing concerns will not pretermit a facial challenge to a statute on First Amendment grounds). Thus, the lowering of the bar intersects with standing doctrine only on the issue of third-party standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That distinction demonstrates why <i>City of Lakewood</i> and similar cases are not persuasive here. Historically, facial challenges were disfavored, in part because they were thought to require the challenger to raise the rights of others. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Raines,</i> 362 U.S. 17, 20-22, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960). Under this traditional approach, the normal <i>jus tertii</i> rules made it nearly impossible to have a court declare a statute facially unconstitutional; after all, an individual litigant would have standing to object to it only as applied to her situation. <i>See</i> Richard H. Fallon, <i>As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third Party Standing,</i> 113 Harv. L.Rev. 1321, 1322 (2000). As a corollary, a plaintiff who had not herself been subjected to an unconstitutional exercise of power could not challenge the offending statute at all. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>City of Lakewood</i> Court recognized that as long as no one was denied a permit, no one would have standing to mount a challenge &#8212; yet the chilling effect of the unconstitutional grant of standardless discretion would remain undiminished. <i>Id.</i> at 757-58, 108 S.Ct. 2138. To correct this problem, the Court loosened the customary prudential limits that constrain a plaintiff's standing with respect to facial challenges brought against statutes that vest unbridled discretion in public officials to censor speech. <i>See id.</i> at 759, 108 S.Ct. 2138. Confronted with a facial challenge to a licensing statute, it ruled that in the case of \"a licensing statute [that] allegedly vests unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or deny expressive activity,\" a plaintiff \"who is subject to the law may challenge it facially without the necessity of first applying for, and being denied, a license.\" 468 U.S. at 755-56, 104 S.Ct. 3315.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court did not, however, carve out any exception to the core requirements of constitutional standing. These requirements, including the bedrock requirement that the plaintiff herself have suffered an injury in fact, were left intact. Importantly, the Court recognized that the theoretical risk of self-censorship inherent in statutes conferring standardless discretion on public officials was not itself a sufficient injury within the meaning of Article III. <i>Id.</i> at 759, 104 S.Ct. 3315. Indeed, the Justices stressed that a plaintiff, as a prerequisite to suit, had to show that the law that she aspired to challenge \"pose[d] a real and substantial threat [to] <i>identified</i> censorship risks.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied); <i>see also Tatum,</i> 408 U.S. at 13-14 &amp; n. 7, 92 S.Ct. 2318 (explaining that even in First Amendment cases, courts must guard against rendering advisory opinions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually by definition, the threat of self-censorship cannot exist if a party has no intention either of speaking or otherwise exposing herself to the vagaries of a standardless licensing policy. It is, therefore, not surprising that in every case the plaintiff cites, the party mounting a facial challenge at the very least desired or intended to undertake activity within the compass of the challenged statute. <i>See, e.g., Forsyth County,</i> 505 U.S. at 127, 112 S.Ct. 2395; <i>City of Lakewood,</i> 486 U.S. at 753-54, 108 S.Ct. 2138. Consequently, those cases cannot be read to reduce to a state of irrelevancy the constitutionally mandated requirement that a plaintiff must show an injury in fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that were the instant plaintiff armed with constitutionally sufficient standing credentials, she could prevail on an issue of this sort merely by showing that the Policy, by vesting standardless discretion in the mayor, constitutes an impermissible prior restraint. <i>See, e.g., Freedman v. Maryland,</i> 380 U.S. 51, 56, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965). In that event, the plaintiff could press the rights of others; she would not have to make the additional (prudential) showing that the mayor could not, consistent with the Free Speech Clause, deny her permission to erect a particular display. The net result, then, is that even though prudential standing concerns are relaxed in certain facial challenges implicating the First Amendment, a litigant still must demonstrate that she satisfies the constitutional minima essential to establish standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seen in this light, the question reduces to whether the plaintiff has been injured within the meaning of Article III. Here, that inquiry is informed by what the plaintiff does not assert. She does not assert that she herself unsuccessfully attempted to place her handiwork on the south lawn of City Hall. She does not assert that she has any interest in erecting a display, but fears that her expression will be subjugated to a standardless approval process. She does not assert that the Policy takes away her appetite for expressing herself or chills her speech in any cognizable way. Her only claim of injury is that, as a resident and taxpayer, she is subject to the effects of the Policy and that, by conferring unbridled discretion on the mayor to approve or reject displays, the Policy has a chilling effect on the speech of others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a sufficient predicate to allow this suit to go forward. It is apodictic that a mere interest in seeing the government turn square corners is not the kind of particularized interest that can satisfy the most basic constitutional prerequisite for standing. <i>See Fed. Election Comm'n v. Akins,</i> 524 U.S. 11, 23-24, 118 S.Ct. 1777, 141 L.Ed.2d 10 (1998) (collecting cases). It has been equally clear for more than three-quarters of a century that, with certain narrow exceptions not implicated here, taxpayers, as such, lack generalized standing to challenge the constitutionality of governmental action. <i>See Frothingham v. Mellon,</i> 262 U.S. 447, 487, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923). The plaintiff's standing, therefore, cannot be grounded on the mere fact that she pays taxes to a municipality which, in turn, expends funds to further an unconstitutional exercise of government power. <i>See Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church and State,</i> 454 U.S. 464, 477, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, all that remains is the question of whether the risk that the Policy will have a chilling effect on the speech of others is a sufficient injury <i>to the plaintiff</i> to meet the first prong of the constitutional test for standing. The Supreme Court answered that question in <i>Tatum,</i> a case that involved a challenge to the scope of domestic intelligence gathering by the United States Army. There, the plaintiffs alleged that the Army was spying on civilians whom the Army believed might engage in civil disobedience and that such systematic surveillance chilled speech by deterring citizens from indulging in expression that might draw the Army's ire. <i>Tatum,</i> 408 U.S. at 9-10, 92 S.Ct. 2318.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Tatum</i> Court held that the plaintiffs, who had not themselves been surveilled, lacked standing to challenge the purportedly pernicious practice. <i>Id.</i> In so holding, the Court acknowledged that a chill on speech sometimes may be a cognizable injury but explained that, in order to have standing, the plaintiff must be within the class of persons potentially chilled. <i>Id.</i> at 12-13, 92 S.Ct. 2318. In words that seem apropos here, the Court concluded: \"Allegations of a subjective `chill' are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13-14, 92 S.Ct. 2318.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's plight falls squarely within the compass of this admonition. Although offended by the Policy, she has sustained no injury in fact. Thus, she has no sufficient personal stake in this litigation to ground a determination that she has standing to sue. <i>See id.</i> at 13 n. 7, 92 S.Ct. 2318. Even if the Policy chilled some speech, it did not chill any of the plaintiff's speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff strives mightily to dodge this bullet. Her first attempted evasion is a suggestion that we should not assume from an empty record that her speech was not chilled. That suggestion turns the standing inquiry on its head. It was the plaintiff who invoked federal jurisdiction. Hence, it was her burden to put adequate facts in the record from which a court reasonably could conclude that she was among those whose speech was potentially chilled. <i>See Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Having failed to carry that burden, she lacks standing to maintain this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's second attempted evasion is equally unavailing. She suggests that because the Policy vests unfettered discretion in the mayor over what displays are permitted, the mayor conceivably could use that discretion to favor religious expositions and, thus, infringe the plaintiff's rights under the Establishment Clause. We reject this effort to hitch the plaintiff's First Amendment claim to her defunct Establishment Clause claim. Simply asserting that the mayor might exercise his authority in an unconstitutional manner is no different than saying that the existence of standardless discretion is itself unconstitutional and redressable without regard to the existence of an injury in fact. Any way the pie is sliced, the plaintiff still has to show some reasonable possibility that she would be subject to the constitutionally defective action. <i>See Tatum,</i> 408 U.S. at 13 n. 7, 92 S.Ct. 2318. She has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, of course, disquieting whenever government takes an action that seems to transgress a constitutional protection. But in the law, as elsewhere, \"two wrongs seldom make a right,\" <i>Foster v. Dalton,</i> 71 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir.1995) &#8212; and it would be wrong to arrogate unto ourselves the power to hear a case at the behest of a plaintiff who lacks standing to sue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we perceive no unfairness. The standing inquiry is not very demanding. To satisfy its first element, the plaintiff need not show that the mayor actually denied her permission to erect a display. <i>See, e.g., City of Lakewood,</i> 486 U.S. at 756, 108 S.Ct. 2138. She need not even show that she actually made such a request. <i>See, e.g., Freedman,</i> 380 U.S. at 56, 85 S.Ct. 734. Nevertheless, the record must contain evidence sufficient to indicate an objectively reasonable possibility that she would be subject to the allegedly unconstitutional mayoral approval requirement. <i>See Tatum,</i> 408 U.S. at 11, 92 S.Ct. 2318; <i>see also Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U.S. 167, 183-84, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (explaining that a plaintiff need not show a certainty of future harm to establish standing, so long as there is a reasonable threat of such harm). The record before us contains no such evidence. It follows that this suit cannot be maintained in a federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. We recognize, as did the learned district court, <i>Osediacz,</i> 344 F.Supp.2d at 812-14, that the Policy is constitutionally suspect and we encourage the City to abandon it (or, at least, to modify it substantially). Absent a plaintiff with a cognizable interest in the outcome, however, this is not an appropriate proceeding in which to adjudicate the Policy's merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The Constitution requires that litigants have a personal stake in a case before they may sue in a federal court, <i>see, e.g., Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), and this plaintiff has not provided facts sufficient to show that she possesses such a stake.

A number of individuals and groups seized the opportunity. Collectively, they erected a myrioramic array of exhibits, some of which (such as a nativity scene) were overtly religious. A citizen of Cranston took umbrage and sued for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rebuffed the plaintiff's Establishment Clause challenge but found her Free Speech Clause claim meritorious and enjoined continued use of the Policy on the ground that it gave the mayor unconstrained authority to approve (and, by extension, to disapprove) proposed displays. <i>Osediacz v. City of Cranston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369045\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369045/osediacz-v-city-of-cranston-ex-rel-rossi/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

As the 2003 holiday season approached, the City issued the Policy, which designated the south lawn of City Hall as a limited public forum for the display of holiday-themed and seasonal decorations. The Policy was designed to continue in force from year to year. It permitted the public to erect \"appropriate\" displays between December 5 and January 1, defined \"appropriate\" as \"being suitable and proper for the holiday occasion,\" and explicitly prohibited any display that would \"shock the consciousness [sic] of the community.\" The Policy required any person wishing to erect an exhibit to provide his or her name, address, and telephone number, a brief written description of the exhibit, and a signed release absolving the City of any liability for damage to the exhibit. Of particular pertinence here, the Policy proclaimed that the mayor or his designee \"must approve\" all displays.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short order, several exhibits appeared on the south lawn. These included a large menorah accompanied by a sign conveying wishes for \"a Happy Chanukah\"; a near-life-size nativity scene; an inflatable seven-foot-tall snowman and a similarly sized Santa Claus; a huge holographic angel; a train of fifteen pink flamingos with Santa Claus hats; and a sign that read \"Happy Holidays from the Teamsters Union.\" Faced with this embarrassment of riches, the City determined on December 21, 2003 that the south lawn could contain nothing more and barred further entries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 22, 2003, plaintiff-appellee Grace Osediacz filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. She asserted that the display of religious symbols on the City Hall lawn violated the Establishment Clause. She also challenged the Policy as contravening the Constitution's Establishment, Free Speech, and Due Process Clauses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a brief period of discovery, the City moved for summary judgment with respect to the Establishment Clause claims. The plaintiff opposed the motion. The district court expanded the summary judgment battleground to include the free speech claim and solicited additional affidavits and briefs. <i>See Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196881\"><a href=\"/opinion/196881/berkovitz-v-home-box-office/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1996) (discussing a district court's authority to grant sua sponte summary judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her main affidavit, the plaintiff portrayed herself as a Cranston resident and taxpayer who regularly conducts business at City Hall. She stated that she found the spectacle of a menorah and creche on municipal property an inappropriate governmental endorsement of religion. She did not aver, however, that she herself harbored any interest in erecting a display.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that the tableau on the south lawn of City Hall, though it included religious symbols, was nothing more than \"a celebration of the holiday in both its religious and secular senses.\" <i>Osediacz,</i> 344 F.Supp.2d at 807 (citing <i>Lynch v.

Nor was there a sufficient history of past practice from which such standards could be inferred. <i>Id.</i> at 813-14. Because the Policy vested essentially standardless discretion in the mayor to grant or withhold approval for displays at his whim, the Policy constituted a prior restraint on speech and, therefore, transgressed the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 814 (citing <i>City of Lakewood v.

The prudential aspects of standing include \"the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff's complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.\" <i>Allen,</i> 468 U.S. at 751, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111258\"><a href=\"/opinion/111258/allen-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It reasons that because the plaintiff never had any interest in erecting a display, there was no chance that she would be subjected to the vagaries of the approval process and, hence, she has failed to show a sufficiently personalized injury emanating from the Policy. To bolster this reasoning, the City relies heavily on <i>Laird v. Tatum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108595\"><a href=\"/opinion/108595/laird-v-tatum/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108595\"><a href=\"/opinion/108595/laird-v-tatum/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108858\"><a href=\"/opinion/108858/broadrick-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 612, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108858\"><a href=\"/opinion/108858/broadrick-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court accepted this distinction. <i>See Osediacz,</i> 344 F.Supp.2d at 812.

Standing is not a unitary concept but, rather, a group of doctrines collectively intended to ensure that the federal courts adjudicate only those actual cases or controversies that fall within the purview of Article III of the Constitution. <i>See Newdow,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2308 (describing standing doctrine as \"a series of rules\"). When certain types of facial challenges to statutes, ordinances, regulations, or governmental policies are premised on First Amendment grounds, they invite a lowering of conventional standing barriers because the traditional <i>jus tertii</i> ban on litigating the rights of third parties is arguably inapplicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Forsyth County v.

Historically, facial challenges were disfavored, in part because they were thought to require the challenger to raise the rights of others. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Raines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106008\"><a href=\"/opinion/106008/united-states-v-james-griggs-raines/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 20-22, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106008\"><a href=\"/opinion/106008/united-states-v-james-griggs-raines/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span> (1960). Under this traditional approach, the normal <i>jus tertii</i> rules made it nearly impossible to have a court declare a statute facially unconstitutional; after all, an individual litigant would have standing to object to it only as applied to her situation. <i>See</i> Richard H. Fallon, <i>As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third Party Standing,</i> 113 Harv. L.Rev. 1321, 1322 (2000). As a corollary, a plaintiff who had not herself been subjected to an unconstitutional exercise of power could not challenge the offending statute at all. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>City of Lakewood</i> Court recognized that as long as no one was denied a permit, no one would have standing to mount a challenge &#8212; yet the chilling effect of the unconstitutional grant of standardless discretion would remain undiminished. <i>Id.</i> at 757-58, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112103\"><a href=\"/opinion/112103/city-of-lakewood-v-plain-dealer-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2138</span></a></span>. To correct this problem, the Court loosened the customary prudential limits that constrain a plaintiff's standing with respect to facial challenges brought against statutes that vest unbridled discretion in public officials to censor speech. <i>See id.</i> at 759, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112103\"><a href=\"/opinion/112103/city-of-lakewood-v-plain-dealer-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2138</span></a></span>. Confronted with a facial challenge to a licensing statute, it ruled that in the case of \"a licensing statute [that] allegedly vests unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or deny expressive activity,\" a plaintiff \"who is subject to the law may challenge it facially without the necessity of first applying for, and being denied, a license.\" 468 U.S. at 755-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111258\"><a href=\"/opinion/111258/allen-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

These requirements, including the bedrock requirement that the plaintiff herself have suffered an injury in fact, were left intact. Importantly, the Court recognized that the theoretical risk of self-censorship inherent in statutes conferring standardless discretion on public officials was not itself a sufficient injury within the meaning of Article III. <i>Id.</i> at 759, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111258\"><a href=\"/opinion/111258/allen-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3315</span></a></span>. Indeed, the Justices stressed that a plaintiff, as a prerequisite to suit, had to show that the law that she aspired to challenge \"pose[d] a real and substantial threat [to] <i>identified</i> censorship risks.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied); <i>see also Tatum,</i> 408 U.S. at 13-14 &amp; n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108595\"><a href=\"/opinion/108595/laird-v-tatum/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is, therefore, not surprising that in every case the plaintiff cites, the party mounting a facial challenge at the very least desired or intended to undertake activity within the compass of the challenged statute. <i>See, e.g., Forsyth County,</i> 505 U.S. at 127, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112767\"><a href=\"/opinion/112767/forsyth-county-v-nationalist-movement/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2138</span></a></span>. Consequently, those cases cannot be read to reduce to a state of irrelevancy the constitutionally mandated requirement that a plaintiff must show an injury in fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that were the instant plaintiff armed with constitutionally sufficient standing credentials, she could prevail on an issue of this sort merely by showing that the Policy, by vesting standardless discretion in the mayor, constitutes an impermissible prior restraint. <i>See, e.g., Freedman v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106987\"><a href=\"/opinion/106987/freedman-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106987\"><a href=\"/opinion/106987/freedman-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span> (1965). In that event, the plaintiff could press the rights of others; she would not have to make the additional (prudential) showing that the mayor could not, consistent with the Free Speech Clause, deny her permission to erect a particular display. The net result, then, is that even though prudential standing concerns are relaxed in certain facial challenges implicating the First Amendment, a litigant still must demonstrate that she satisfies the constitutional minima essential to establish standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seen in this light, the question reduces to whether the plaintiff has been injured within the meaning of Article III. Here, that inquiry is informed by what the plaintiff does not assert. She does not assert that she herself unsuccessfully attempted to place her handiwork on the south lawn of City Hall. She does not assert that she has any interest in erecting a display, but fears that her expression will be subjugated to a standardless approval process. She does not assert that the Policy takes away her appetite for expressing herself or chills her speech in any cognizable way. Her only claim of injury is that, as a resident and taxpayer, she is subject to the effects of the Policy and that, by conferring unbridled discretion on the mayor to approve or reject displays, the Policy has a chilling effect on the speech of others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a sufficient predicate to allow this suit to go forward. It is apodictic that a mere interest in seeing the government turn square corners is not the kind of particularized interest that can satisfy the most basic constitutional prerequisite for standing. <i>See Fed. Election Comm'n v. Akins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 23-24, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span> (1998) (collecting cases). It has been equally clear for more than three-quarters of a century that, with certain narrow exceptions not implicated here, taxpayers, as such, lack generalized standing to challenge the constitutionality of governmental action. <i>See Frothingham v. Mellon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100240\"><a href=\"/opinion/100240/massachusetts-v-mellon/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>, 487, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1078</span></span> (1923). The plaintiff's standing, therefore, cannot be grounded on the mere fact that she pays taxes to a municipality which, in turn, expends funds to further an unconstitutional exercise of government power. <i>See Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church and State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-for-separation-of-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 477, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-for-separation-of-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Supreme Court answered that question in <i>Tatum,</i> a case that involved a challenge to the scope of domestic intelligence gathering by the United States Army. There, the plaintiffs alleged that the Army was spying on civilians whom the Army believed might engage in civil disobedience and that such systematic surveillance chilled speech by deterring citizens from indulging in expression that might draw the Army's ire. <i>Tatum,</i> 408 U.S. at 9-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108595\"><a href=\"/opinion/108595/laird-v-tatum/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2318</span></a></span>. In words that seem apropos here, the Court concluded: \"Allegations of a subjective `chill' are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108595\"><a href=\"/opinion/108595/laird-v-tatum/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although offended by the Policy, she has sustained no injury in fact. Thus, she has no sufficient personal stake in this litigation to ground a determination that she has standing to sue. <i>See id.</i> at 13 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108595\"><a href=\"/opinion/108595/laird-v-tatum/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Even if the Policy chilled some speech, it did not chill any of the plaintiff's speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff strives mightily to dodge this bullet. Her first attempted evasion is a suggestion that we should not assume from an empty record that her speech was not chilled. That suggestion turns the standing inquiry on its head. It was the plaintiff who invoked federal jurisdiction. Hence, it was her burden to put adequate facts in the record from which a court reasonably could conclude that she was among those whose speech was potentially chilled. <i>See Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 561, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2130</span></a></span>. Having failed to carry that burden, she lacks standing to maintain this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's second attempted evasion is equally unavailing. She suggests that because the Policy vests unfettered discretion in the mayor over what displays are permitted, the mayor conceivably could use that discretion to favor religious expositions and, thus, infringe the plaintiff's rights under the Establishment Clause. We reject this effort to hitch the plaintiff's First Amendment claim to her defunct Establishment Clause claim. Simply asserting that the mayor might exercise his authority in an unconstitutional manner is no different than saying that the existence of standardless discretion is itself unconstitutional and redressable without regard to the existence of an injury in fact. Any way the pie is sliced, the plaintiff still has to show some reasonable possibility that she would be subject to the constitutionally defective action. <i>See Tatum,</i> 408 U.S. at 13 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108595\"><a href=\"/opinion/108595/laird-v-tatum/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2318</span></a></span>. She has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, of course, disquieting whenever government takes an action that seems to transgress a constitutional protection. But in the law, as elsewhere, \"two wrongs seldom make a right,\" <i>Foster v. Dalton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709035\"><a href=\"/opinion/709035/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1402-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43789-sharon-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.1995) &#8212; and it would be wrong to arrogate unto ourselves the power to hear a case at the behest of a plaintiff who lacks standing to sue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we perceive no unfairness. The standing inquiry is not very demanding. To satisfy its first element, the plaintiff need not show that the mayor actually denied her permission to erect a display. <i>See, e.g., City of Lakewood,</i> 486 U.S. at 756, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112103\"><a href=\"/opinion/112103/city-of-lakewood-v-plain-dealer-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2138</span></a></span>. She need not even show that she actually made such a request. <i>See, e.g., Freedman,</i> 380 U.S. at 56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106987\"><a href=\"/opinion/106987/freedman-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span>. Nevertheless, the record must contain evidence sufficient to indicate an objectively reasonable possibility that she would be subject to the allegedly unconstitutional mayoral approval requirement. <i>See Tatum,</i> 408 U.S. at 11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108595\"><a href=\"/opinion/108595/laird-v-tatum/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2318</span></a></span>; <i>see also Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl.

The record before us contains no such evidence. It follows that this suit cannot be maintained in a federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. We recognize, as did the learned district court, <i>Osediacz,</i> 344 F.Supp.2d at 812-14, that the Policy is constitutionally suspect and we encourage the City to abandon it (or, at least, to modify it substantially). Absent a plaintiff with a cognizable interest in the outcome, however, this is not an appropriate proceeding in which to adjudicate the Policy's merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The Constitution requires that litigants have a personal stake in a case before they may sue in a federal court, <i>see, e.g., Warth v. Seldin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109301\"><a href=\"/opinion/109301/warth-v-seldin/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 499, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109301\"><a href=\"/opinion/109301/warth-v-seldin/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span> (1975), and this plaintiff has not provided facts sufficient to show that she possesses such a stake.

Fallon, Jr., <i>As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third Party Standing,</i> 113 Harv. L.Rev. 1321, 1359-64 (2000) (arguing that the Supreme Court's permissive approach to facial challenges in the First Amendment context has little to do with third-party standing but, rather, reflects a substantive concern that facially invalid statutes harm the plaintiff herself, regardless of whether a more narrowly drawn statute could regulate her conduct).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> For the same reasons, the plaintiff's due process claim, not reached by the lower court,<i>see</i> 344 F.Supp.2d at 801 n. 2, likewise should have been dismissed.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
