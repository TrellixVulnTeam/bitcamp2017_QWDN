Morris E.

Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Jonathan Shapiro with whom Stern, Shapiro, Weissberg & Garin,\nLLP was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             April 7, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.         Corey Smith pled guilty to six\n\ncounts of crack distribution and one count of conspiring to sell\n\ncrack.     Applying the sentencing guidelines, the district court\n\ncalculated      Smith's   sentencing    range    to   be    100-125    months     of\n\nimprisonment, but then sentenced Smith to 46 months of imprisonment\n\n(followed by six years of supervised release).              The government now\n\nappeals, arguing that Smith's sentence is unreasonably low.\n\n            In October and November of 2003, Smith--who was twenty-\n\none years old at the time--facilitated four sales and made three\n\ndirect sales of crack cocaine to Adolfo Brito, an undercover police\n\nofficer.       All of the transactions, save perhaps one, took place\n\nwithin 1,000 feet of either the George A. Lewis Middle School or\n\nthe Little Scobie Playground.            Smith was arrested on April 15,\n\n2004,    and    eventually    pled     guilty    to   six    counts      of    crack\n\ndistribution and one count of conspiring to sell crack.                  21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(a) (2000).\n\n            Soon after his arrest, Smith was released to an in-\n\npatient drug treatment program at Spectrum House and successfully\n\ncompleted the initial treatment program.              In January      2005, after\n\nhis guilty plea, he was transferred to a \"sober house\" run by the\n\nSouth Middlesex Opportunity Council.            After a series of violations\n\nof   the   sober    house's    rules--including        staying     out        without\n\nauthorization--Smith's release was revoked by a magistrate judge on\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fFebruary 8, 2005, and he was thereafter detained until April 19,\n\n2005, when his sentence was imposed.\n\n          The pre-sentence report calculated Smith's total offense\n\nlevel as 25, based on the quantity of crack (14.25 grams), the\n\nproximity of his offenses to a school and playground, and Smith's\n\nacceptance of responsibility.     Because of prior convictions for\n\nvarious offenses, including the possession of marijuana with the\n\nintent to distribute, Smith had a criminal history category of V\n\n(based on eleven criminal history points).1\n\n          The probation officer found no basis for a downward\n\ndeparture under the guidelines.    This meant that Smith's guideline\n\nsentencing range was 100 to 125 months.     However, the sentencing\n\noccurred after United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), so\n\nthe district court was not restricted to a guideline sentence.   It\n\nappears that the probation officer recommended a below-guideline\n\nsentence of sixty months based on considerations such as Smith's\n\nlimited role in the offenses, his rehabilitation from his drug\n\nhabit, and the allegedly minor nature of his prior offenses.\n\n          After hearing argument from the government and defense\n\ncounsel, and after an allocution by the defendant, the district\n\n\n\n     1\n      Smith was convicted of these crimes embracing six separate\nincidents spanning the period May 16, 2000, to December 3, 2002.\nHe served time in prison after violating the conditions of his\nprobation stemming from his drug possession conviction, and it was\nsoon after his release from that period of incarceration that he\nwas arrested for the crime in question here.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fjudge (over the government's objection) sentenced Smith to 46\n\nmonths in prison followed by six years of supervised release, and\n\nrecommended   drug   treatment   for    Smith   while   in   prison.   In\n\nexplaining the sentence, the district judge addressed Smith as\n\nfollows:\n\n           I think you're a man who has done wrong\n           things, gotten in trouble, find yourself in a\n           fix, but you're young and you may turn around\n           and I'd like to see you turn around rather\n           than get crushed. . . .\n\n           Against you is the nature of the offense that\n           you committed, an aggravated selling of\n           controlled substance regularly in a location\n           close to a school, and although I don't\n           suppose you sat and thought about whether it's\n           close to a school or not, I'm sure you knew\n           there were a lot of little kids in that area,\n           and that's a hell of a place to be selling\n           cocaine, and the law makes it more of an\n           offense, but in your favor is the fact that\n           you were involved in the offense for a limited\n           period of time and [d]o not appear to have\n           been a leader. You appear to have committed\n           the crime to support your drug habit.\n\n           While on pretrial release you did participate\n           in drug abuse treatment and, for the most\n           part, you received positive reports, although\n           I guess you had a couple of slips, didn't you?\n           And during pretrial release, you did obtain\n           employment.\n\n           Bearing all these things in mind and the\n           requirements of the statute that the sentence\n           imposed be serious -- I mean, be sufficient to\n           take into consideration the seriousness of the\n           offense, the protection of society, your own\n           needs to improve and to make sure that the\n           sentence is sufficient but not excessive, and\n           bearing in mind that the Probation Department\n           concludes that in accordance with this\n           statute, a sentence substantially below the\n\n                                  -4-\n\f                 guidelines is appropriate. I'm imposing the\n                 same sentence on you as I have imposed on the\n                 two defendants in this case who have appeared\n                 before me already, although that sentence is\n                 somewhat below what the probation guideline\n                 recommends in your case.\n\n                 In     Booker,       the    Supreme    Court     held    that    mandatory\n\nguidelines            based    on     judge-made       findings    violated       the   Sixth\n\nAmendment,        but,        after    a    severance     analysis,       ruled    that   the\n\nguidelines should be treated as \"effectively advisory.\" 125 S. Ct.\n\nat 750-52, 757.           The Court further stated that sentences would be\n\nreviewable for \"reasonableness,\" and that this review would apply\n\nregardless of whether sentences fell within the advisory guidelines\n\nrange.       Id. at 765-66.\n\n                 The sentencing court's discretion remains constrained by\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2000), which requires courts to consider a\n\nnumber of factors in imposing sentences, United States v. Pho, 433\n\nF.3d       53,   61-62        (1st    Cir.    2006),     including       \"the    nature   and\n\ncircumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of\n\nthe defendant,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1), \"the need for the sentence\n\nimposed,\" id. § 3553(a)(2),2 and \"the need to avoid unwarranted\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      In making this determination, courts must consider the need\nfor the sentence \"to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to\npromote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the\noffense\"; \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\"; \"to\nprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant\"; and \"to\nprovide the defendant with needed educational or vocational\ntraining, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most\neffective manner.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(2)(A)-(D).\n\n                                                -5-\n\fsentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have\n\nbeen found guilty of similar conduct,\" id. § 3553(a)(6).\n\n            The   statute    also   requires   courts    to   consider   the\n\nsentencing range established by the guidelines.               18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a)(4); accord Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 764-65.          In United States\n\nv. Jiménez-Beltre, --- F.3d ---, 2006 WL 562154 (1st. Cir. Mar. 9,\n\n2006) (en banc), this court stated that the guidelines remained \"an\n\nimportant    consideration\"     because    they   represented    the     only\n\n\"integration of the multiple factors\" identified in the statute,\n\noften reflected past practice, and bore the imprimatur of the\n\nexpert agency charged with developing them. Id. at *2-*3 (emphasis\n\nomitted).\n\n            For the same reasons, we said that a district court\n\nshould normally begin with a guideline calculation, and that after\n\nconsidering departures, the district court should decide whether\n\n\"other factors\" (beyond the guidelines) warranted an ultimate\n\nsentence above or below the guideline range.        Jiménez-Beltre, 2006\n\nWL 562154, at *3.     As for review for reasonableness, we stressed\n\nthe need for \"a plausible explanation and a defensible overall\n\nresult.\"    Id. at *4.   The \"within the range\" sentence involved in\n\nJiménez-Beltre was easily affirmed.        Id. at *3-*5.\n\n            The present case is more difficult.         The sentence is not\n\na modest variance from the guideline range, but less than half the\n\nminimum of the range.       \"[T]he farther the judge's sentence departs\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\ffrom       the   guidelines       sentence      .     .   .   the   more   compelling       the\n\njustification based on factors in section 3553(a) that the judge\n\nmust offer in order to enable the court of appeals to assess the\n\nreasonableness of the sentence imposed.\"                         United States v. Dean,\n\n414    F.3d      725,     729    (7th    Cir.    2005)        (Posner,     J.).     However,\n\ncircumstances may make a major variance reasonable.\n\n                 Here,    the    district       court     relied     on    six    factors    to\n\ndistinguish this case: Smith's youth; his involvement in the\n\noffense \"for a limited period of time\"; the fact that Smith did not\n\n\"appear to have been a leader\"; the fact that Smith \"appear[ed] to\n\nhave committed the crime to support [his] drug habit\"; Smith's\n\nparticipation            in     drug    abuse       treatment       and    his    subsequent\n\nemployment; and the probation officer's suggestion that a \"sentence\n\nsubstantially below the guidelines is appropriate.\"3\n\n                 The government first argues that the district court\n\ncommitted legal error because some of the factors relied upon--such\n\nas age, drug use, lack of a leadership role, and post-offense\n\nrehabilitation--are \"either discouraged or prohibited bases for\n\ndeparture\" under the sentencing guidelines and circuit precedent.\n\nLegal errors are reviewed de novo and are themselves a basis for\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      The district judge also told Smith that he was \"imposing the\nsame sentence on you as I have imposed on the two defendants in\nthis case who have appeared before me already.\"        One of the\ndefendants was sentenced to 46 months of imprisonment, while the\nother was sentenced to 57 months of imprisonment.\n\n                                                -7-\n\fremand, Pho, 433 F.3d at 60-61, unless the error had no effect upon\n\nthe sentence.\n\n             For    the    most   part,    the   Commission's     decision    to\n\ndiscourage or exclude a factor seemingly rested either on a doubt\n\nwhether the factor had much relevance to the statutory goals of\n\nsentencing or a concern that the factor was of a kind that tended\n\nto promote the inequality in sentencing that the guidelines aimed\n\nto reduce.     U.S.S.G. § 5H1.1, intro. cmt. (2005); cf. id. § 5K2.0,\n\ncmt. (backg'd).           But, as we explained in Jiménez-Beltre, the\n\nguidelines are generalizations; the benefit of advisory guidelines\n\nis the room allowed for finer tuning.            2006 WL 562154, at *3.\n\n             That a factor is discouraged or forbidden under the\n\nguidelines does not automatically make it irrelevant when a court\n\nis weighing the statutory factors apart from the guidelines.                 The\n\nguidelines--being advisory--are no longer decisive as to factors\n\nany more than as to results.          About the best one can say for the\n\ngovernment's argument is that reliance on a discounted or excluded\n\nfactor may, like the extent of the variance, have some bearing on\n\nreasonableness.\n\n             The government also argues that the district court erred\n\nin   relying   on    the    pre-sentence    recommendation   of    a   sentence\n\nsubstantially below the guidelines range, contending that this\n\nfactor is \"irrelevant\" under section 3553(a).           However, nothing in\n\nthe statute forbids taking the probation officer's recommendation\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\finto account.       A sentencing judge could reasonably consider the\n\ninformed opinion of the officer in evaluating the section 3553(a)\n\nfactors, see United States v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir.\n\n2005), although the weight accorded such an evaluation surely\n\ndepends on the strength of the reasons given.\n\n            The government next argues that the district court erred\n\nin    (allegedly)        basing     Smith's      sentence      on   those    of   his\n\nco-defendants.      The government says that this misconstrues section\n\n3553(a)(6),      which    requires     district     courts     to   avoid   creating\n\n\"unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar\n\nrecords who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\"                           The\n\ngovernment argues that the \"disparity\" referenced in the statutory\n\nlanguage refers only to variations from a national norm.\n\n            We    agree    that     Congress'      goal   of   equality     primarily\n\nenvisions a national norm; the guidelines were in some measure a\n\nresponse to disparities among sentences for like individuals in\n\ndifferent parts of the country.             United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d\n\n1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 969 (1991).                     In\n\nany event, the district judge in this case was apparently stressing\n\nhis   own   consistency           rather    than    supplying       an   independent\n\njustification of the 46 month sentence.\n\n            Having rejected the government's legal-error arguments,\n\nwe turn now to its claim that the sentence was unreasonably low.\n\nIn doing so, we do not think that the district court made any clear\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\ferror as to underlying fact warranting a remand.                Robinson, 433\n\nF.3d at 38 (sentence may be vacated if \"predicated on a clearly\n\nerroneous view of material facts\").4         The issue, rather, is one of\n\nreasonableness: the plausibility of both the explanation and the\n\nresult.   Jiménez-Beltre, 2006 WL 562154, at *4.\n\n           The first fact relied on by the district court--Smith's\n\nyouth--is a discouraged factor, but one that has a conventional\n\nappeal; among the concerns are that the crime may be a youthful\n\naberration and that a young man may have a greater chance for\n\nrehabilitation.     The district judge did not rely upon aberration--\n\nSmith, after all, had participated in six crack transactions and\n\nhad a substantial criminal history continuing over several years--\n\nbut the judge did express a hope of rehabilitation.\n\n           Yet     Smith's     criminal   career   has    progressed    fairly\n\nsteadily toward more serious crimes (from license plate theft and\n\nmarijuana possession, for example, to crack distribution near a\n\nschool and playground).        He served time in prison after violating\n\nthe   conditions    of   his   probation    stemming     from   his   marijuana\n\npossession conviction, and it was soon after his release from that\n\n\n\n      4\n      The government says that the evidence did not support the\ndistrict court's statements about drugs as a cause of Smith's\ncrimes or his rehabilitation. A close reading indicates that the\nstatements were quite qualified--that Smith \"appear[ed]\" to have\nengaged in his crimes in order to support a drug habit, and, in\ntreatment, \"received positive reports,\" though he \"had a couple of\nslips.\" The former statement, so qualified, has some basis in the\nPSR; the latter is a matter of characterization.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fperiod of incarceration that he was arrested for the crime in\n\nquestion here.\n\n          The district judge also relied upon Smith's involvement\n\nin the present offenses \"for a limited period of time.\"          But Smith\n\nalready had a significant criminal history; his first conviction\n\n(not necessarily his first crime) occurred more than three years\n\nbefore his crack transactions, which means that he was engaged in\n\noffenses from the age of 18 through the age of 21.           During this\n\nperiod, he accumulated nine criminal history points, so his present\n\noffenses appear a further extension of his criminal history.\n\n          Further, the court said that Smith did not \"appear to\n\nhave been a leader,\" and this is true even though Smith progressed\n\nin the six transactions from aiding others to making his own sales.\n\nBut the guideline calculations already account for this fact.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1 (2005).    If there is some more specific aspect of\n\nhis role that mitigates over and above the usual guideline sentence\n\nfor an ordinary participant, which in principle could be true, it\n\nis not stated.\n\n          Finally,   the   district    judge   mentioned   the   potential\n\ncontribution of drug addiction.       The probation officer apparently\n\nsaid that the defendant \"appear[ed] to have committed\" the crimes\n\nto support a drug habit.        At sentencing, the district judge\n\nessentially echoed the probation officer's qualified statement\n\nabout the role of Smith's drug problems in his crimes.                 The\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fgovernment argues that this finding was without basis, and the\n\ndefendant does not point to any specific facts on the record that\n\nsupport such a conclusion.\n\n              In any case, we note that Smith, as soon as he had\n\ncompleted his first phase of rehabilitation, immediately began to\n\nbreak   the    rules      of   the    sober       house,       which     resulted    in   the\n\ntermination of his release. Regardless of the extent to which drug\n\ndependence may have played a role in his crimes, this relapse into\n\nmisbehavior almost as soon as controls lessened does not speak well\n\nfor his prospects of future self-control, whatever the cause for\n\nthe relapse may have been.\n\n              We    are   hard-put        to    see    any     basis    for    finding    this\n\nsentence reasonable.           This is equally true if one turns from the\n\nfacts   relied       upon      by    the       district        judge     to    the   general\n\nconsiderations        provided       by    the    statute.             Both    vantages    are\n\npertinent in assessing reasonableness, and other circuits that have\n\nreviewed sentences for reasonableness have been willing to look at\n\nthe matter from either end of the telescope.                            See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Lazenby, --- F.3d ---, 2006 WL 569284, at *4-*5 (8th Cir.\n\nMar. 10, 2006); United States v. Duhon, --- F.3d ---, 2006 WL\n\n367017, at *3-*8 (5th Cir. Feb. 17, 2006); United States v.\n\nMoreland, 437 F.3d 424, 436-37 (4th Cir. 2006).\n\n              The    first     sentencing             factor     is     \"the    nature     and\n\ncircumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of\n\n\n                                               -12-\n\fthe defendant.\"         18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).               Here, the offense\n\ninvolved repeatedly selling crack near a school and playground, and\n\nthe   defendant,      although    young,       has    accumulated    a   significant\n\ncriminal history.       Even after some rehabilitation and while this\n\ncase was pending, he was unable to conform to the rules of the\n\nsober house to which he was sent.\n\n            Three more factors, grouped together by the statute, are\n\nthe seriousness of the offense, need for respect for law, and need\n\nfor just punishment.        18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).                Selling crack\n\nnear facilities where children gather speaks directly to these\n\nfactors.     The offense, and the defendant's developing criminal\n\ncareer, is also pertinent, again in ways unhelpful to him, to two\n\nother statutory factors: the need \"to afford adequate deterrence\"\n\nand \"to protect the public.\"               Id. § 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C).\n\n            The statute also refers to the need \"to provide the\n\ndefendant with needed . . . medical care[] or other correctional\n\ntreatment . . . .\"       18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(D).               If drug treatment\n\nis required by Smith, this can presumably be done whether the\n\nsentence    is   46   months     or    a    longer    guideline     sentence.     The\n\nstatute's    language     does        not    itself    make   drug    addiction   an\n\nextenuating circumstance, and in any event, as we have seen, there\n\nis no very clear evidence of a causal link between drug abuse and\n\nSmith's crimes in this case.\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\f           The next pertinent sentencing factor in the statute is\n\nthe guideline range itself, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4)(A), which in\n\nturn is the principal means for complying with the last pertinent\n\ngoal, namely, \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\n\namong defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\n\nsimilar conduct.\"    Id. § 3553(a)(6).       The factor in question--the\n\nguideline range--is obviously not one that supports the district\n\ncourt's   non-guideline     sentence,     and,   to   the    extent   that   the\n\nguidelines are given force, pushes in the other direction.\n\n           In a nutshell, the offense is quite serious and the\n\ndefendant's record unpromising, and there are no developed findings\n\nto indicate that rehabilitation is a better prospect than usual.\n\nA sentence less than half the minimum range appears to us plainly\n\nunreasonable.     Although    we    are   unhappy     to   disagree   with   the\n\nrespected and experienced district judge in this case, we cannot\n\nsustain the sentence on the findings and explanation before us.5\n\n           The   sentence    is    vacated   and    the    case   remanded   for\n\nresentencing consistent with this decision. Framing a new sentence\n\nafter any proceedings deemed appropriate is, in the first instance,\n\nthe responsibility of the district judge.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n     5\n      Compare United States v.

Corey Smith pled guilty to six\n\ncounts of crack distribution and one count of conspiring to sell\n\ncrack.     Applying the sentencing guidelines, the district court\n\ncalculated      Smith's   sentencing    range    to   be    100-125    months     of\n\nimprisonment, but then sentenced Smith to 46 months of imprisonment\n\n(followed by six years of supervised release).              The government now\n\nappeals, arguing that Smith's sentence is unreasonably low.\n\n            In October and November of 2003, Smith--who was twenty-\n\none years old at the time--facilitated four sales and made three\n\ndirect sales of crack cocaine to Adolfo Brito, an undercover police\n\nofficer.       All of the transactions, save perhaps one, took place\n\nwithin 1,000 feet of either the George A. Lewis Middle School or\n\nthe Little Scobie Playground.            Smith was arrested on April 15,\n\n2004,    and    eventually    pled     guilty    to   six    counts      of    crack\n\ndistribution and one count of conspiring to sell crack.                  21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(a) (2000).\n\n            Soon after his arrest, Smith was released to an in-\n\npatient drug treatment program at Spectrum House and successfully\n\ncompleted the initial treatment program.              In January      2005, after\n\nhis guilty plea, he was transferred to a \"sober house\" run by the\n\nSouth Middlesex Opportunity Council.            After a series of violations\n\nof   the   sober    house's    rules--including        staying     out        without\n\nauthorization--Smith's release was revoked by a magistrate judge on\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fFebruary 8, 2005, and he was thereafter detained until April 19,\n\n2005, when his sentence was imposed.\n\n          The pre-sentence report calculated Smith's total offense\n\nlevel as 25, based on the quantity of crack (14.25 grams), the\n\nproximity of his offenses to a school and playground, and Smith's\n\nacceptance of responsibility.     Because of prior convictions for\n\nvarious offenses, including the possession of marijuana with the\n\nintent to distribute, Smith had a criminal history category of V\n\n(based on eleven criminal history points).1\n\n          The probation officer found no basis for a downward\n\ndeparture under the guidelines.    This meant that Smith's guideline\n\nsentencing range was 100 to 125 months.     However, the sentencing\n\noccurred after United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), so\n\nthe district court was not restricted to a guideline sentence.   It\n\nappears that the probation officer recommended a below-guideline\n\nsentence of sixty months based on considerations such as Smith's\n\nlimited role in the offenses, his rehabilitation from his drug\n\nhabit, and the allegedly minor nature of his prior offenses.\n\n          After hearing argument from the government and defense\n\ncounsel, and after an allocution by the defendant, the district\n\n\n\n     1\n      Smith was convicted of these crimes embracing six separate\nincidents spanning the period May 16, 2000, to December 3, 2002.\nHe served time in prison after violating the conditions of his\nprobation stemming from his drug possession conviction, and it was\nsoon after his release from that period of incarceration that he\nwas arrested for the crime in question here.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fjudge (over the government's objection) sentenced Smith to 46\n\nmonths in prison followed by six years of supervised release, and\n\nrecommended   drug   treatment   for    Smith   while   in   prison.   In\n\nexplaining the sentence, the district judge addressed Smith as\n\nfollows:\n\n           I think you're a man who has done wrong\n           things, gotten in trouble, find yourself in a\n           fix, but you're young and you may turn around\n           and I'd like to see you turn around rather\n           than get crushed. . . .\n\n           Against you is the nature of the offense that\n           you committed, an aggravated selling of\n           controlled substance regularly in a location\n           close to a school, and although I don't\n           suppose you sat and thought about whether it's\n           close to a school or not, I'm sure you knew\n           there were a lot of little kids in that area,\n           and that's a hell of a place to be selling\n           cocaine, and the law makes it more of an\n           offense, but in your favor is the fact that\n           you were involved in the offense for a limited\n           period of time and [d]o not appear to have\n           been a leader. You appear to have committed\n           the crime to support your drug habit.\n\n           While on pretrial release you did participate\n           in drug abuse treatment and, for the most\n           part, you received positive reports, although\n           I guess you had a couple of slips, didn't you?\n           And during pretrial release, you did obtain\n           employment.\n\n           Bearing all these things in mind and the\n           requirements of the statute that the sentence\n           imposed be serious -- I mean, be sufficient to\n           take into consideration the seriousness of the\n           offense, the protection of society, your own\n           needs to improve and to make sure that the\n           sentence is sufficient but not excessive, and\n           bearing in mind that the Probation Department\n           concludes that in accordance with this\n           statute, a sentence substantially below the\n\n                                  -4-\n\f                 guidelines is appropriate. I'm imposing the\n                 same sentence on you as I have imposed on the\n                 two defendants in this case who have appeared\n                 before me already, although that sentence is\n                 somewhat below what the probation guideline\n                 recommends in your case.\n\n                 In     Booker,       the    Supreme    Court     held    that    mandatory\n\nguidelines            based    on     judge-made       findings    violated       the   Sixth\n\nAmendment,        but,        after    a    severance     analysis,       ruled    that   the\n\nguidelines should be treated as \"effectively advisory.\" 125 S.

However,\n\ncircumstances may make a major variance reasonable.\n\n                 Here,    the    district       court     relied     on    six    factors    to\n\ndistinguish this case: Smith's youth; his involvement in the\n\noffense \"for a limited period of time\"; the fact that Smith did not\n\n\"appear to have been a leader\"; the fact that Smith \"appear[ed] to\n\nhave committed the crime to support [his] drug habit\"; Smith's\n\nparticipation            in     drug    abuse       treatment       and    his    subsequent\n\nemployment; and the probation officer's suggestion that a \"sentence\n\nsubstantially below the guidelines is appropriate.\"3\n\n                 The government first argues that the district court\n\ncommitted legal error because some of the factors relied upon--such\n\nas age, drug use, lack of a leadership role, and post-offense\n\nrehabilitation--are \"either discouraged or prohibited bases for\n\ndeparture\" under the sentencing guidelines and circuit precedent.\n\nLegal errors are reviewed de novo and are themselves a basis for\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      The district judge also told Smith that he was \"imposing the\nsame sentence on you as I have imposed on the two defendants in\nthis case who have appeared before me already.\"        One of the\ndefendants was sentenced to 46 months of imprisonment, while the\nother was sentenced to 57 months of imprisonment.\n\n                                                -7-\n\fremand, Pho, 433 F.3d at 60-61, unless the error had no effect upon\n\nthe sentence.\n\n             For    the    most   part,    the   Commission's     decision    to\n\ndiscourage or exclude a factor seemingly rested either on a doubt\n\nwhether the factor had much relevance to the statutory goals of\n\nsentencing or a concern that the factor was of a kind that tended\n\nto promote the inequality in sentencing that the guidelines aimed\n\nto reduce.     U.S.S.G. § 5H1.1, intro. cmt. (2005); cf. id. § 5K2.0,\n\ncmt. (backg'd).           But, as we explained in Jiménez-Beltre, the\n\nguidelines are generalizations; the benefit of advisory guidelines\n\nis the room allowed for finer tuning.            </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">562154</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3.\n\n             That a factor is discouraged or forbidden under the\n\nguidelines does not automatically make it irrelevant when a court\n\nis weighing the statutory factors apart from the guidelines.                 The\n\nguidelines--being advisory--are no longer decisive as to factors\n\nany more than as to results.          About the best one can say for the\n\ngovernment's argument is that reliance on a discounted or excluded\n\nfactor may, like the extent of the variance, have some bearing on\n\nreasonableness.\n\n             The government also argues that the district court erred\n\nin   relying   on    the    pre-sentence    recommendation   of    a   sentence\n\nsubstantially below the guidelines range, contending that this\n\nfactor is \"irrelevant\" under section 3553(a).

The government says that this misconstrues section\n\n3553(a)(6),      which    requires     district     courts     to   avoid   creating\n\n\"unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar\n\nrecords who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\"                           The\n\ngovernment argues that the \"disparity\" referenced in the statutory\n\nlanguage refers only to variations from a national norm.\n\n            We    agree    that     Congress'      goal   of   equality     primarily\n\nenvisions a national norm; the guidelines were in some measure a\n\nresponse to disparities among sentences for like individuals in\n\ndifferent parts of the country.

In\n\nany event, the district judge in this case was apparently stressing\n\nhis   own   consistency           rather    than    supplying       an   independent\n\njustification of the 46 month sentence.\n\n            Having rejected the government's legal-error arguments,\n\nwe turn now to its claim that the sentence was unreasonably low.\n\nIn doing so, we do not think that the district court made any clear\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\ferror as to underlying fact warranting a remand.                Robinson, 433\n\nF.3d at 38 (sentence may be vacated if \"predicated on a clearly\n\nerroneous view of material facts\").4         The issue, rather, is one of\n\nreasonableness: the plausibility of both the explanation and the\n\nresult.   Jiménez-Beltre, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">562154</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4.\n\n           The first fact relied on by the district court--Smith's\n\nyouth--is a discouraged factor, but one that has a conventional\n\nappeal; among the concerns are that the crime may be a youthful\n\naberration and that a young man may have a greater chance for\n\nrehabilitation.     The district judge did not rely upon aberration--\n\nSmith, after all, had participated in six crack transactions and\n\nhad a substantial criminal history continuing over several years--\n\nbut the judge did express a hope of rehabilitation.\n\n           Yet     Smith's     criminal   career   has    progressed    fairly\n\nsteadily toward more serious crimes (from license plate theft and\n\nmarijuana possession, for example, to crack distribution near a\n\nschool and playground).        He served time in prison after violating\n\nthe   conditions    of   his   probation    stemming     from   his   marijuana\n\npossession conviction, and it was soon after his release from that\n\n\n\n      4\n      The government says that the evidence did not support the\ndistrict court's statements about drugs as a cause of Smith's\ncrimes or his rehabilitation. A close reading indicates that the\nstatements were quite qualified--that Smith \"appear[ed]\" to have\nengaged in his crimes in order to support a drug habit, and, in\ntreatment, \"received positive reports,\" though he \"had a couple of\nslips.\" The former statement, so qualified, has some basis in the\nPSR; the latter is a matter of characterization.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fperiod of incarceration that he was arrested for the crime in\n\nquestion here.\n\n          The district judge also relied upon Smith's involvement\n\nin the present offenses \"for a limited period of time.\"          But Smith\n\nalready had a significant criminal history; his first conviction\n\n(not necessarily his first crime) occurred more than three years\n\nbefore his crack transactions, which means that he was engaged in\n\noffenses from the age of 18 through the age of 21.           During this\n\nperiod, he accumulated nine criminal history points, so his present\n\noffenses appear a further extension of his criminal history.\n\n          Further, the court said that Smith did not \"appear to\n\nhave been a leader,\" and this is true even though Smith progressed\n\nin the six transactions from aiding others to making his own sales.\n\nBut the guideline calculations already account for this fact.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1 (2005).    If there is some more specific aspect of\n\nhis role that mitigates over and above the usual guideline sentence\n\nfor an ordinary participant, which in principle could be true, it\n\nis not stated.\n\n          Finally,   the   district    judge   mentioned   the   potential\n\ncontribution of drug addiction.       The probation officer apparently\n\nsaid that the defendant \"appear[ed] to have committed\" the crimes\n\nto support a drug habit.        At sentencing, the district judge\n\nessentially echoed the probation officer's qualified statement\n\nabout the role of Smith's drug problems in his crimes.                 The\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fgovernment argues that this finding was without basis, and the\n\ndefendant does not point to any specific facts on the record that\n\nsupport such a conclusion.\n\n              In any case, we note that Smith, as soon as he had\n\ncompleted his first phase of rehabilitation, immediately began to\n\nbreak   the    rules      of   the    sober       house,       which     resulted    in   the\n\ntermination of his release. Regardless of the extent to which drug\n\ndependence may have played a role in his crimes, this relapse into\n\nmisbehavior almost as soon as controls lessened does not speak well\n\nfor his prospects of future self-control, whatever the cause for\n\nthe relapse may have been.\n\n              We    are   hard-put        to    see    any     basis    for    finding    this\n\nsentence reasonable.           This is equally true if one turns from the\n\nfacts   relied       upon      by    the       district        judge     to    the   general\n\nconsiderations        provided       by    the    statute.             Both    vantages    are\n\npertinent in assessing reasonableness, and other circuits that have\n\nreviewed sentences for reasonableness have been willing to look at\n\nthe matter from either end of the telescope.

Here, the offense\n\ninvolved repeatedly selling crack near a school and playground, and\n\nthe   defendant,      although    young,       has    accumulated    a   significant\n\ncriminal history.       Even after some rehabilitation and while this\n\ncase was pending, he was unable to conform to the rules of the\n\nsober house to which he was sent.\n\n            Three more factors, grouped together by the statute, are\n\nthe seriousness of the offense, need for respect for law, and need\n\nfor just punishment.        18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).                Selling crack\n\nnear facilities where children gather speaks directly to these\n\nfactors.     The offense, and the defendant's developing criminal\n\ncareer, is also pertinent, again in ways unhelpful to him, to two\n\nother statutory factors: the need \"to afford adequate deterrence\"\n\nand \"to protect the public.\"               Id. § 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C).\n\n            The statute also refers to the need \"to provide the\n\ndefendant with needed . . . medical care[] or other correctional\n\ntreatment . . . .\"       18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(D).               If drug treatment\n\nis required by Smith, this can presumably be done whether the\n\nsentence    is   46   months     or    a    longer    guideline     sentence.     The\n\nstatute's    language     does        not    itself    make   drug    addiction   an\n\nextenuating circumstance, and in any event, as we have seen, there\n\nis no very clear evidence of a causal link between drug abuse and\n\nSmith's crimes in this case.\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\f           The next pertinent sentencing factor in the statute is\n\nthe guideline range itself, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4)(A), which in\n\nturn is the principal means for complying with the last pertinent\n\ngoal, namely, \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\n\namong defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\n\nsimilar conduct.\"    Id. § 3553(a)(6).       The factor in question--the\n\nguideline range--is obviously not one that supports the district\n\ncourt's   non-guideline     sentence,     and,   to   the    extent   that   the\n\nguidelines are given force, pushes in the other direction.\n\n           In a nutshell, the offense is quite serious and the\n\ndefendant's record unpromising, and there are no developed findings\n\nto indicate that rehabilitation is a better prospect than usual.\n\nA sentence less than half the minimum range appears to us plainly\n\nunreasonable.     Although    we    are   unhappy     to   disagree   with   the\n\nrespected and experienced district judge in this case, we cannot\n\nsustain the sentence on the findings and explanation before us.5\n\n           The   sentence    is    vacated   and    the    case   remanded   for\n\nresentencing consistent with this decision. Framing a new sentence\n\nafter any proceedings deemed appropriate is, in the first instance,\n\nthe responsibility of the district judge.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n     5\n      Compare United States v.
