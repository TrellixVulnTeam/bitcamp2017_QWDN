We have reviewed the record and the parties'\n\nsubmissions.        We affirm the lower court's judgment on the ground\n\nthat the federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction under the\n\nprinciples set out in District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.\n\nFeldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476 (1983), and Rooker v. Fidelity Trust\n\nCo., 263 U.S. 413, 415-16 (1923).\n\n             Appellant Thomas M. Mangan (\"Mangan\") claims that the\n\nappellees violated his constitutional rights during the proceedings\n\nbefore     the    Maine    Supreme      Judicial      Court;    that    these    alleged\n\nviolations tainted those proceedings; and that the result of those\n\nproceedings -- his disbarment -- is therefore called into question.\n\nIf   the   federal       court   were    to    exercise      jurisdiction       here,   it\n\neffectively would be second-guessing the Maine SJC's decision that\n\nMangan received a fair trial and that he should be disbarred.                       This\n\nis precisely what Rooker-Feldman prohibits.\n\n             It    does    not    matter      to    our   analysis     whether    Mangan\n\nexplicitly raised a federal constitutional claim in the state court\n\nproceedings.        The relevant inquiry is not whether a particular\n\nargument was raised in the state court.                        Rather, the relevant\n\ninquiry is whether the constitutional challenge is of a general\n\nnature     (e.g.,    a    claim    that       the    rules     governing    disbarment\n\nproceedings violate due process), or whether, instead, it targets\n\nparticular actions taken by the appellees and/or the court during\n\nthe proceedings and approved of by the SJC. See generally Feldman,\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\f460 U.S. at 486.   Mangan's claims clearly are barred by the Rooker-\n\nFeldman doctrine because he alleges that certain actions in the\n\nstate court proceeding by bar counsel and by the complainant\n\nviolated his constitutional rights; he does not allege that the\n\nstate rules themselves are unconstitutional.    Mangan's claims are\n\n\"inextricably intertwined\" with the state court claims.         See\n\nSheehan v. Marr, 207 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 2000).         Thus, the\n\nfederal courts (other than the United States Supreme Court) may not\n\nexercise jurisdiction over those claims.\n\n          Affirmed.   See 1st Cir.
