Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                   Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                     and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Carlos Del Valle, with whom Anabelle Rodriguez, Attorney\nGeneral, Eileen Landrón Guardiola, and Eduardo A. Vera Ramírez were\non brief, for appellant.\n     Alejandra Bird Lopez, with whom Carlos V. García Gutiérrez,\nManuel Rodríguez Banchs, Rafael E. Rodrígues Rivera, and Civil\nAction and Education Corporation were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                           July 15, 2002\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge. This interlocutory appeal requires\n\nus to revisit a marathon class-action suit brought to remedy\n\nunconstitutional conditions of confinement in the Puerto Rico\n\nprison system.   On this occasion, the Secretary of the Puerto Rico\n\nDepartment of Health (the Secretary) alleges that the district\n\ncourt's assignment of certain duties to the so-called chief health\n\ncare coordinator (the CHCC) constitutes an unwarranted modification\n\nof a prior injunction and, in the bargain, violates the Prisoner\n\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110\n\nStat. 1321 (1996) (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18\n\nU.S.C., 28 U.S.C., & 42 U.S.C.).   The plaintiff class (composed of\n\nprison inmates) responds that this court lacks jurisdiction to\n\nconsider the appeal on an interlocutory basis, and that, in all\n\nevents, the challenged order is a proper exercise of the district\n\ncourt's authority.    We agree with the first of the plaintiffs'\n\nassertions:   the challenged order merely clarifies the court's\n\nprior decrees and imposes no serious consequences on the Secretary.\n\nMoreover, the order, in the last analysis, is a procedural measure\n\nthat constitutes an exercise of the district court's housekeeping\n\npowers.   For these reasons, immediate appellate review is not\n\navailable to the Secretary as of right.   Consequently, we dismiss\n\nthe appeal without addressing the remaining issues briefed and\n\nargued by the parties.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            Although the lore of this case is Byzantine, we confine\n\nour   introductory    remarks   to   those   events     that   are   directly\n\npertinent to this appeal.       We refer readers who hunger for more\n\nexegetic detail to the district court's myriad opinions.                E.g.,\n\nMorales Feliciano v. Roselló González, 13 F. Supp. 2d 151 (D.P.R.\n\n1998) (Morales II); Morales Feliciano v. Romero Barcelo, 497 F.\n\nSupp. 14 (D.P.R. 1979) (Morales I).\n\n            In early 1979, representatives of the plaintiff class\n\ncommenced this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.           They named several\n\npublic    officials   as   defendants,     including,    pertinently,    the\n\nSecretary.    The suit alleged dire shortcomings in virtually every\n\naspect of prisoner confinement.       The district court found that the\n\nplaintiffs were likely to succeed on some of their claims and\n\nissued a preliminary injunction ordering the defendants to address\n\nthe most pressing of the identified concerns.           See Morales I, 497\n\nF. Supp. at 38-41.    The court gave very high priority to inadequate\n\nmedical and mental health care.        See id. at 37-38.\n\n            Over time, the district court grew frustrated with the\n\ndefendants' desultory responses to the preliminary injunction.             To\n\nexpedite compliance, the court appointed a monitor in March of\n\n1986.     The court charged the monitor with studying the relevant\n\nelements of the corrections program and recommending remedial\n\naction.     With the monitor in place, the court became actively\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\finvolved in certain aspects of the management of the prison system.\n\nNot surprisingly, the court found inertia to be a persistent\n\nproblem and, to overcome it, issued temporary restraining orders\n\nand contempt citations against the defendants when and as required.\n\nThe court also began to impose fines for the defendants' most\n\negregious failures to comply with its decrees (particularly those\n\nfailures relating to overcrowding).       Those fines escalated as the\n\nfoot-dragging continued and the court's level of exasperation\n\nmounted.    To date, the court has levied aggregate fines totaling\n\nnearly $135,000,000.\n\n            In October of 1990, the court ordered the implementation\n\nof medical and mental health care plans (the Plans) recommended by\n\nthe monitor.    By their terms, the Plans contemplated that overall\n\nresponsibility    for   inmate   health   care   would   pass   from   the\n\nAdministration of Corrections to the Department of Health.             The\n\nPlans also required the Secretary to employ, for at least three\n\nyears, a designated official — the CHCC — who would be responsible\n\nfor easing the transition and coordinating compliance with the\n\nPlans.1    In April of 1993, the Secretary nominated Dr. Aida Guzmán\n\nFont to assume the position. The district court approved financial\n\nsupport (from the fine fund) for her endeavors.           When her term\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The designated official initially was called the \"chief\nmedical coordinator.\" The title was changed in December of 1992.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fexpired three years later, the parties jointly requested that the\n\ncourt approve her reappointment.            The court obliged.\n\n               In January of 1996, the district court entered what it\n\ntermed a \"partial final judgment.\"                 In this decree, the court\n\nsettled several disputed issues and urged the parties to focus\n\ntheir energies on \"consensus-based compliance efforts, and the\n\nresolution of yet unresolved areas of the case.\"                    In the same\n\ndocument, the court enumerated certain prior orders that it now\n\nconsidered final (including the order approving the Plans and the\n\norders containing the job description for the CHCC position).\n\n               The passage of time revealed that the remedial framework\n\nwas not functioning smoothly.          In April of 1997, a court-appointed\n\nexpert found that the extant correctional health program was a\n\nbureaucratic morass incapable of meeting constitutional standards.\n\nTo rectify this situation, the expert suggested the appointment of\n\na receiver for the ailing program.                 The parties closed ranks to\n\noppose this recommendation, proposing instead the creation of a\n\nprivate   non-profit     corporation        (the    Corporation),   which   would\n\neventually assume total responsibility for providing medical and\n\nmental health services to the inmate population.\n\n               On September 26, 1997, the parties filed a stipulation\n\ndesigned to flesh out this joint proposal.                Under its terms, the\n\nCorporation would provide health care services, consistent with the\n\nPlans,    to    all   persons   held   in    institutions    operated   by    the\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fAdministration of Corrections.              The stipulation promised \"full\n\ncoordination    among   all       parties     concerned\"         and    required       the\n\ndefendants     (including     the      Secretary)         to   take     a     series    of\n\npreparatory steps to lay the groundwork for an effective transition\n\nfrom the existing correctional health program to the new model.\n\nThe stipulation also memorialized the parties' agreement to engage\n\nin further discussions \"concerning the role and authority of the\n\nCHCC with respect to monitoring the Corporation.\"                           Finally, the\n\nprocess of     privatization       —   that   is,    the       transition      from    the\n\nexisting remedial framework to the stipulated alternative — was\n\nmade subject to the district court's supervision.                      The court would\n\nbe kept informed by, inter alia, the submission of regular progress\n\nreports from the CHCC.\n\n             In an ensuing opinion, the district court elaborated on\n\nthe   constitutional    deficiencies          of    the    existing         health     care\n\nprograms, but declined to rule on the receivership recommendation.\n\nMorales II, 13 F. Supp. 2d at 213.                 Instead, the court issued a\n\nseries of orders designed to \"build on the remedial structure . .\n\n. already in place.\"        Id.     In so doing, the court reaffirmed its\n\nearlier support for the Plans and expressed a willingness to listen\n\nshould the parties or the CHCC \"request modifications of the\n\n[Plans] to keep abreast of health care developments or to enhance\n\nadministrative and fiscal efficiency.\"               Id. at 158.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f            The court also acknowledged the recommendation for the\n\ncreation of a private non-profit corporation as a vehicle for the\n\ndelivery of inmate health care services.           See id. at 203 (citing\n\nthe testimony of an expert in correctional health care to the\n\neffect that \"[t]he objective of an adequate budget process and a\n\nsense of relative permanency can be accomplished through a private\n\nnot-for-profit health care corporation whose primary mission is\n\ncorrectional health care\").       But the court expressed skepticism\n\nabout the parties' abilities to establish such an entity and\n\nordered class counsel to report within ten days on the progress\n\nmade in organizing the Corporation.           Id. at 214.           Within the\n\nallotted period, class counsel outlined the steps that were being\n\ntaken to create the Corporation.\n\n            Although   Morales   II    provides,   at   best,   a     tentative\n\nendorsement    of   the   parties'     suggested    remedy,     the    court's\n\nsubsequent statements and actions indicate full support for the\n\nnascent Corporation.      That support has been unwavering:             despite\n\nslower-than-expected progress on the path to privatization, the\n\ncourt has regularly reviewed and approved annual budgets for the\n\nCorporation and has authorized the disbursement of substantial\n\nmonies from the fine fund to cover the Corporation's operating\n\nexpenses.    To date, these disbursements total around $20,000,000.\n\n            On March 31, 2000, Dr. Guzmán resigned.             The district\n\ncourt believed that recruiting a new CHCC would be inopportune\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fgiven the Corporation's \"advanced stage of development\" and the\n\ncourt's expectation that the Corporation would take over the\n\ndelivery of correctional health care services within the next\n\neighteen months.      Still, the vacancy left a void.           To bridge the\n\ngap temporarily, the court entered an order transferring some of\n\nthe CHCC's duties to the executive director of the correctional\n\nhealth program (Dr. Ernesto Torres Arroyo).\n\n            A   new   administration   came   to   power   in    Puerto   Rico\n\nfollowing the November 2000 general elections.                  The following\n\nFebruary,   the   Secretary   —   an   appointee   of   the     newly-elected\n\ngovernor — sought to terminate Dr. Torres' employment as executive\n\ndirector of the correctional health program.            In response to the\n\nplaintiffs' objection, the district court restrained the Secretary\n\nfrom cashiering Dr. Torres until such time as the court chose to\n\nrelieve him of the duties assigned to him after Dr. Guzmán's\n\nresignation.\n\n            The Secretary did not appeal from this order, but,\n\nrather, notified the court that he was reappointing Dr. Guzmán to\n\nthe vacant CHCC position.      In the same motion, he asked the court\n\nto approve the appointment.        The court ordered the parties to\n\nconfer and submit a joint proposal designed to harmonize the CHCC's\n\njob description with the court's prior orders.             The parties were\n\nunable to reach agreement.         The principal bone of contention\n\ncentered on the extent to which the Secretary (and, to some degree,\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fthe   CHCC)    would    be    in   control    of    decisions    regarding    the\n\nprivatization process.\n\n              The district court resolved the matter by issuing the\n\norder underlying the instant appeal.               That ukase, entered on May\n\n23, 2001, noted that the court had \"ordered, as a solution to the\n\nmyriad of problems affecting delivery of mental and medical health\n\nservices to the plaintiff class in this case, the creation and\n\norganization of a private, not-for-profit corporation, to replace\n\nthe present Correctional Health Program.\" This made it \"imperative\n\nthat the [CHCC] cooperate[] fully with the [Corporation] during the\n\ntransition period.\"          To achieve this goal, the court directed the\n\nCHCC to (1) provide the Corporation with information reasonably\n\nnecessary for the performance of its obligations; (2) ensure\n\nattendance of correctional health program workers at training\n\nseminars organized by the Corporation; (3) appoint coordinators to\n\nassist   in     the    development     of    the    training    seminars,     the\n\nreorganization of work areas, and the installation of electronic\n\nand telephonic equipment in the medical areas of correctional\n\ninstitutions; (4) guard against the improper use of installed\n\nequipment; (5) require the presence of Corporation personnel during\n\nconsultations with higher officials anent matters related to the\n\nprovision      of   correctional     health    services;       (6)   inform   the\n\nCorporation's chief executive officer (CEO) of the times and\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\flocations of certain meetings; and (7) attend relevant meetings\n\ncalled by the Corporation's board or its CEO.\n\n           The Secretary chafed at this directive and asked the\n\ndistrict court to reconsider it.          He argued, inter alia, that the\n\norder was superfluous because the CHCC, of her own volition, was\n\ncooperating fully with the Corporation.                The plaintiff class\n\nopposed reconsideration, claiming that there was ample reason to\n\nbelieve that the Secretary and the CHCC were refusing to cede\n\ncontrol   over   the   provision    of    inmate   health     services   while\n\nsimultaneously     conspiring      to    appropriate    the    Corporation's\n\nresources.   When the district court denied reconsideration, the\n\nSecretary appealed.\n\n           On appeal, the Secretary asseverates that the assignment\n\nof new duties to the CHCC contravenes the district court's January\n\n1996 partial judgment, which purported to make final several\n\nearlier orders (including the orders that collectively contained\n\nthe CHCC's job description).            Building on that foundation, the\n\nSecretary posits that the district court lacked jurisdiction to\n\nmodify the January 1996 judgment and, alternatively, that the May\n\n23 order fails to comport with the requirements of the PLRA.               The\n\nplaintiffs counter that this interlocutory appeal must be dismissed\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction; and that, in all events, the May 23 order\n\nis unimpugnable.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fII.    APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n            It is black-letter law that \"[f]ederal courts are courts\n\nof limited jurisdiction, and thus must take pains to act only\n\nwithin the margins of that jurisdiction.\"                  Cumberland Farms, Inc.\n\nv. Me. Tax Assessor, 116 F.3d 943, 945 (1st Cir. 1997).                  Hence, the\n\npreferred — and often the obligatory — practice is that a court,\n\nwhen confronted with a colorable challenge to its subject-matter\n\njurisdiction, should resolve that question before weighing the\n\nmerits of a pending action.             See Berner v. Delahanty, 129 F.3d 20,\n\n23 (1st Cir. 1997); see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better\n\nEnvironment, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).                  This principle holds true\n\nwhen an appellate court's right to exercise appellate jurisdiction\n\nis called into question.             In re Cusumano, 162 F.3d 708, 712 (1st\n\nCir. 1998); Director, OWCP v. Bath Iron Works Corp., 853 F.2d 11,\n\n12-13 (1st Cir. 1988).          Thus, we turn first to the question of our\n\nown jurisdiction. We start this inquiry by elucidating the general\n\ntenets that govern the existence of appellate jurisdiction and then\n\nproceed to apply those tenets to the case at hand.\n\n                           A.       The Legal Landscape.\n\n            There     is        a    well-established        legislative    policy\n\ndisfavoring inchmeal appellate review.                    See Anderson v. City of\n\nBoston, 244 F.3d 236, 238 (1st Cir. 2001).                  This policy makes very\n\ngood   sense.       \"Multiple         appeals    in   a    single   litigation   are\n\nnecessarily disruptive and, if freely allowed, subject to abuse.\"\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fSierra Club v. Marsh, 907 F.2d 210, 214 (1st Cir. 1990).                      Thus, a\n\nfederal court of appeals, as a general rule, will review decisions\n\nmade by a district court only after that court enters a final\n\njudgment.     See 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n            This rule, like virtually every general rule, admits of\n\ncertain     exceptions.       One     exception     to     the    rule        against\n\ninterlocutory appeals is embedded in 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).                     That\n\nstatute   authorizes      immediate   review   of   district          court    orders\n\n\"granting,     continuing,        modifying,    refusing         or     dissolving\n\ninjunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.\"                      Id.\n\nThis exception must be strictly construed.               Sierra Club, 907 F.2d\n\nat 214.   Strict construction prevents the statute from being used\n\nas a means of evading the final judgment rule.\n\n            To determine whether a particular trial court order is\n\nappealable under section 1292(a)(1), a reviewing court must look to\n\nthe practical effect of the order rather than its verbiage.                       See\n\nCarson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981).                          The\n\nCarson Court also made plain that a party seeking the benefit of\n\nsection 1292(a)(1) must establish that the contested order imposes\n\n\"serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence[s]\" and that it may be\n\nchallenged effectively only by immediate appeal.                 Id.\n\n            Another line of cases has relevance here.                     Although\n\norders that modify injunctions may be appealable under section\n\n1292(a)(1),     orders     that    merely    clarify      previously          entered\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\finjunctions are not. See, e.g., Birmingham Fire Fighters Ass'n 117\n\nv. Jefferson County, 280 F.3d 1289, 1292-93 (11th Cir. 2002);\n\nUnited States Fire Ins. Co. v. Asbestospray, Inc., 182 F.3d 201,\n\n207 (7th Cir. 1999); Mikel v. Gourley, 951 F.2d 166, 168 (8th Cir.\n\n1991).      To ascertain whether an order modifies an injunction, we\n\nmust determine whether the underlying decree is of an injunctive\n\ncharacter, and if so, whether the ruling complained of can be said\n\nto   have    altered    the    underlying     decree   in   a    jurisdictionally\n\nsignificant way.         Sierra Club, 907 F.2d at 212.               A change is\n\njurisdictionally significant if it substantially readjusts the\n\nlegal relations of the parties, see Cunningham v. David Special\n\nCommitment Ctr., 158 F.3d 1035, 1037 (9th Cir. 1998), and does not\n\nrelate simply      to   the    conduct   or    progress     of   litigation,   see\n\nGulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U.S. 271, 279\n\n(1988).     Doubts as to the applicability of section 1292(a)(1) are\n\nto be resolved against immediate appealability.\n\n                              B.   The Case at Hand.\n\n             Here, the Secretary appeals from the district court's\n\norder of May 23, 2001, claiming that it modifies a previously\n\nissued injunction.        He maintains that the underlying injunctive\n\ndecree — the decree modified by the order appealed from — is the\n\nJanuary 1996 partial final judgment.             This designation strikes us\n\nas arbitrary.     The district court created the CHCC position in an\n\norder dated October 22, 1990; broadened its purview somewhat by\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\forder dated December 18, 1992; and continued the office in effect\n\nwithout any appreciable change in the 1996 partial final judgment.\n\nBy the same token, the court issued several orders affecting the\n\nCHCC position in the period between January of 1996 and May of\n\n2001.2    Last — but far from least — the district court did not\n\nrefer at all to the 1996 partial final judgment in crafting the\n\norder of May 23, 2001.          Given this history, the Secretary's\n\ndesignation of the 1996 partial final judgment as the underlying\n\ninjunction seems odd.      The most that can be said is that the\n\ncombination of orders composing the status quo as of May 23, 2001\n\namounted to an injunction.\n\n           Leaving   to   one   side   this   obvious   weakness   in   the\n\nSecretary's case, the question remains whether the May 23 order\n\nrepresented a jurisdictionally significant change in the status\n\nquo. See Sierra Club, 907 F.2d at 212-13.       Answering this question\n\nrequires us to focus on the practical effect of the order.         See id.\n\nat 213.\n\n           As a practical matter, the May 23 order did not break new\n\nground. The stipulation entered into by and between the parties on\n\nSeptember 26, 1997 heralded the dawning of a new era, paving the\n\nway for a phase-out of the preexisting correctional health program\n\n\n     2\n      These include an order of May 16, 1997 (directing the CHCC to\ntake contractual steps to maintain continuity of health services)\nand an order of April 19, 2000 (declining to name a new CHCC\nbecause the position would become obsolete within \"a brief period\nof time\").\n\n                                  -14-\n\fand the creation of the Corporation as a new and different way to\n\nprovide health services to inmates.               That stipulation itself\n\nimposed obligations on the CHCC to report on the progress, and\n\notherwise monitor the activities, of the new Corporation.              While\n\nthese changes constituted a dramatic modification of the status quo\n\nante, the Secretary certainly cannot complain about them; they were\n\nintroduced   with    the   consent     and   active   cooperation    of    his\n\npredecessor in office and, thus, bind the Secretary now.                   See\n\nCornelius v. Hogan, 663 F.2d 330, 334-35 (1st Cir. 1981) (finding,\n\nin an official-capacity suit, that a successor in office was bound\n\nby his predecessor's consent decree); see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n25(d)(1). A party's stipulations are binding on that party and may\n\nnot be contradicted by him at trial or on appeal.         Keller v. United\n\nStates, 58 F.3d 1194, 1199 n.8 (7th Cir. 1995).           It follows from\n\nthese two propositions that a government official, sued in his\n\nrepresentative     capacity,    cannot   freely    repudiate    stipulations\n\nentered into by his predecessor in office during an earlier stage\n\nof the same litigation.\n\n          The Secretary tries to wiggle off this hook by arguing\n\nthat we   should    disregard    the   stipulation    because   it   was   not\n\nexplicitly entered by the district court. This argument borders on\n\nthe jejune. The parties docketed the stipulation and, although the\n\ndistrict court did not instantly embrace it, the court's subsequent\n\nactions — particularly the entry of orders designed to facilitate\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthe establishment of the new remedial framework and the release of\n\nfunds to finance those activities — made manifest the court's\n\nadoption of the concept.               In all events, the court certainly\n\nbelieved that it had approved the stipulation and its serial orders\n\nput the Secretary on clear notice of its belief.               See, e.g., Order\n\nof July 2, 1998 (reminding the parties that \"[c]orrectional health\n\nservices w[ould] soon begin to undergo the transition to a private\n\nnon-profit corporation\"); Order of April 19, 2000 (stating that the\n\ncourt previously had \"accepted and ordered the implementation of\n\nthe parties' stipulations and proposals to create a not-for-profit\n\nCorrectional Health Services Corporation\").                   If the Secretary\n\nwished to hold the district court to a particular punctilio in the\n\nentry of the stipulation, the Secretary had an obligation to assert\n\nthat position in a timely manner. See Putnam Resources v. Pateman,\n\n958 F.2d 448, 456-57 (1st Cir. 1992) (explaining that an aggrieved\n\nparty    must    act    expeditiously     to    cure    perceived    error);      see\n\ngenerally United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 972 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(stating that \"a litigant who deems himself aggrieved\" by a ruling\n\nof the trial judge \"ordinarily must object then and there, or\n\nforfeit any right to complain at a latter time\").                  His failure to\n\ndo so constitutes a waiver.\n\n              Against this backdrop, it is surpassingly difficult to\n\nsee how the May 23 order worked a jurisdictionally significant\n\nchange   in     the    status   quo.     In    some    respects,    this   case    is\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\freminiscent of Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority, 178 F.3d 951\n\n(7th Cir. 1999).       There, the Seventh Circuit held that an order\n\ndirecting    a    housing    authority    to   involve       a   receiver   in   any\n\nsettlement       negotiations    with   tenants     of   a   particular     housing\n\nproject was merely a reiteration of an earlier receivership decree\n\nthat required \"full cooperation\" with the receiver.                   Id. at 953.\n\nOn that basis, the court deemed the order unappealable under\n\nsection 1292(a)(1).         Id. at 958.\n\n            This case is similarly configured.                   The stipulation\n\nobligated    the    parties,    in   effect,   to    cooperate      fully   in   the\n\nprivatization process.          The assignment of specific duties to the\n\nCHCC — the part of the May 23 order that rankles the Secretary — is\n\nsimply another way of expressing what is reasonably to be expected\n\nfrom the stipulated promise of full cooperation. In short, the May\n\n23 order is a logical corollary to the Secretary's stipulated\n\ncommitment to assist in the privatization of the delivery of\n\ncorrectional health services.3\n\n            The particulars of the May 23 order do not alter this\n\nanalysis.    The specific dictates contained in that order — for\n\ninstance, those requiring consultation with Corporation personnel\n\n\n     3\n      This conclusion is fortified by the fact that the CHCC\nposition was created for the express purpose of implementing the\nPlans.   The parties (through the stipulation) and the district\ncourt have now determined that privatization is the best route to\nachieve that goal. From that standpoint, a failure on the part of\nthe CHCC to assist in executing the privatization process would\nviolate her longstanding duty to implement the Plans.\n\n                                        -17-\n\fand support of training programs — do no more than identify\n\nparticular areas in which cooperation is required.                        Thus, the\n\nenumerated duties, taken as a whole, do not modify the status quo\n\nin any meaningful way. Confirming this conclusion is the fact that\n\nthe Secretary initially objected to the May 23 order on the ground\n\nthat it added nothing new to what the CHCC already was doing.                      His\n\nbelated attempt to press the opposite view in this venue is\n\nuntenable.    Cf. Lydon v. Boston Sand & Gravel Co., 175 F.3d 6, 12\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (warning that \"if parties feel free to select\n\ncontradictory positions before different tribunals to suit their\n\nends, the integrity and efficacy of the courts will suffer\")\n\n(quoting Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. Gen. Cinema Corp., 834 F.2d 208,\n\n214 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n            For   much   the   same    reasons,    we       do    not    accept   the\n\nSecretary's plaint that the May 23 order has serious consequences.\n\nThe order is disruptive, he tells us, because it undermines his\n\nauthority    to   control      the    actions     of    a        subordinate      and,\n\nconcomitantly, forces that subordinate — the CHCC — to preside over\n\nthe dismantling of the correctional health program.                     This tale is\n\nunconvincing — and mischaracterizes the record to boot.\n\n            In the first place, it was the Secretary — not the\n\ndistrict court — who insisted on filling the CHCC position.                         He\n\nnominated Dr. Guzmán for the post knowing full well that a court-\n\nordered privatization of health care services was in full swing.\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fHe cannot seriously contend that his unilateral decision to fill\n\nthis vacancy somehow wipes the slate clean, allowing him to throw\n\na monkey wrench into the privatization process and scuttle the\n\nreforms to which his predecessor had stipulated.\n\n            In the second place, the consequences that the Secretary\n\ncites are the natural sequelae of the earlier agreement to transfer\n\ncorrectional health services to the Corporation.     Those woes are\n\nnot fairly attributable to the May 23 order.    By first consenting\n\nto the privatization plan and then seeking to fill the CHCC\n\nposition while the transition to privatization was underway, the\n\nSecretary became the author of his own misfortune.\n\n            If more were needed on this point — and we doubt that it\n\nis — the Secretary's argument misstates the nature of the CHCC\n\nposition.    That position has never been exclusively under the\n\nSecretary's hegemony.    From the very beginning, the CHCC has been\n\nsubject to dual oversight, reporting both to the Secretary and the\n\ndistrict court.4   This dual reporting relationship dovetails with\n\nthe remedial framework that the court erected when it created the\n\nCHCC position to address constitutional shortcomings in inmate\n\nhealth services.    Given the hybrid nature of the position, fine-\n\ntuning the CHCC's role to accommodate the stipulated changeover to\n\n\n\n     4\n      The process by which the Secretary aspired to reappoint Dr.\nGuzmán as the CHCC illustrates this dichotomy.       Although the\nSecretary selected her for the position, he submitted the\nnomination to the district court for the court's approval.\n\n                                -19-\n\fprivatization does little to alter the legal relations of the\n\nparties as they existed on May 23, 2001.          The alteration, as we\n\nhave said, dates back to the execution of the stipulation.\n\n           There is yet another basis for our conclusion that the\n\nMay 23 order does not significantly modify the status quo.            The\n\nparties, through the stipulation, explicitly agreed that \"[t]he\n\nprivatization process must be subject to Court supervision.\"          This\n\nlanguage gave the court substantial latitude in procedural matters\n\nrelating   to   how   best   to   achieve   privatization.    Given   that\n\nfostering compliance with the district court's remedial framework\n\nis the CHCC's raison être, the order that the Secretary challenges\n\nhere can be viewed as procedural in nature (akin, say, to the\n\nappointment of a monitor).\n\n           The Ninth Circuit dealt with an analogous procedural\n\norder in Thompson v. Enomoto, 815 F.2d 1323 (9th Cir. 1987), a\n\nprisoner class action.       There, the court had to decide whether the\n\nappointment of a special master to supervise compliance with a\n\nconsent    decree     constituted    a   modification   of   the   decree.\n\nEmphasizing the interim nature of the position, the court found no\n\n\"serious or irreparable harm\" stemming from the appointment.           Id.\n\nat 1327.   We think that here, as in Thompson, the order appealed\n\nfrom was within the lower court's reserved power to establish\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fprocedures for compliance with the court's earlier decrees.5               Id.\n\nSo viewed, the May 23 order was simply \"a step in controlling the\n\nlitigation      before   the   court,\"   Baltimore   Contractors,   Inc.   v.\n\nBodinger, 348 U.S. 176, 185 (1955).         Orders of that stripe are not\n\nimmediately appealable.        See, e.g., Van Orman v. Am. Ins. Co., 680\n\nF.2d 301, 314 (3d Cir. 1982) (dismissing interlocutory appeal when\n\nthe order appealed from was merely a \"judicial housekeeping measure\n\ndesigned to assist the court in framing ultimate relief in the\n\ncase\").\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               To recapitulate, the May 23 order is not a modification\n\nof a previous injunction, but, rather, a clarification of the\n\nCHCC's role in light of other developments in the case.              At any\n\nrate, the order does not have serious or irreparable consequences\n\nfor the Secretary because any infringement on his autonomy is a\n\nfunction of previously ordered relief.         Finally, the nature of the\n\nobligations imposed on the CHCC places the May 23 order in the\n\ncategory of procedural orders that are not immediately appealable.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      As was true of the court-appointed special master in\nThompson, the CHCC position was never meant to exist in perpetuity.\nTo the contrary, the Plans contemplate that the CHCC will serve a\nthree-year term, and the court has made it abundantly clear that\nthe position will become obsolete once the transition to\nprivatization has been completed.      Thus, the May 23 order is\ntemporary in the sense that it applies only to the transition\nperiod.\n\n                                     -21-\n\f          We need go no further.   For the reasons discussed above,\n\nwe dismiss the appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n          Appeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -22-\n\f",

On this occasion, the Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Health (the Secretary) alleges that the district court's assignment of certain duties to the so-called chief health care coordinator (the CHCC) constitutes an unwarranted modification of a prior injunction and, in the bargain, violates the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), Pub.L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996) (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18 U.S.C., 28 U.S.C., &amp; 42 U.S.C.). The plaintiff class (composed of prison inmates) responds that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal on an interlocutory basis, and that, in all events, the challenged order is a proper exercise of the district court's authority. We agree with the first of the plaintiffs' assertions: the challenged order merely clarifies the court's prior decrees and imposes no serious consequences on the Secretary. Moreover, the order, in the last analysis, is a procedural measure that constitutes an exercise of the district court's housekeeping powers. For these reasons, immediate appellate review is not available to the Secretary as of right. Consequently, we dismiss the appeal without addressing the remaining issues briefed and argued by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the lore of this case is Byzantine, we confine our introductory remarks to those events that are directly pertinent to this appeal. We refer readers who hunger for more exegetic detail to the district court's myriad opinions. <i>E.g., Morales Feliciano v. Rosell&#243; Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 13 F.Supp.2d 151 (D.P.R.1998) (<i>Morales II</i>); <i>Morales Feliciano v. Romero Barcelo,</i> 497 F.Supp. 14 (D.P.R.1979) (<i>Morales I</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1979, representatives of the plaintiff class commenced this action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. They named several public officials as defendants, including, pertinently, the Secretary. The suit alleged dire shortcomings in virtually every aspect of prisoner confinement. The district court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on some of their claims and issued a preliminary injunction ordering the defendants to address the most pressing of the identified concerns. <i>See Morales I,</i> 497 F.Supp. at 38-41. The court gave very high priority to inadequate medical and mental health care. <i>See id.</i> at 37-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over time, the district court grew frustrated with the defendants' desultory responses to the preliminary injunction. To expedite compliance, the court appointed a monitor in March of 1986. The court charged the monitor with studying the relevant elements of the corrections program and recommending remedial action. With the monitor in place, the court became actively involved in certain aspects of the management of the prison system. Not surprisingly, the court found inertia to be a persistent problem and, to overcome it, issued temporary restraining orders and contempt citations against the defendants when and as required. The court also began to impose fines for the defendants' most egregious failures to comply with its decrees (particularly those failures relating to overcrowding). Those fines escalated as the foot-dragging continued and the court's level of exasperation mounted. To date, the court has levied aggregate fines totaling nearly $135,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 1990, the court ordered the implementation of medical and mental health care plans (the Plans) recommended by the monitor. By their terms, the Plans contemplated that overall responsibility for inmate health care would pass from the Administration of Corrections to the Department of Health. The Plans also required the Secretary to employ, for at least three years, a designated official &#8212; the CHCC &#8212; who would be responsible for easing the transition and coordinating compliance with the Plans.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In April of 1993, the Secretary nominated Dr. Aida Guzm&#225;n Font to assume the position. The district court approved financial support (from the fine fund) for her endeavors. When her term expired three years later, the parties jointly requested that the court approve her reappointment. The court obliged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January of 1996, the district court entered what it termed a \"partial final judgment.\" In this decree, the court settled several disputed issues and urged the parties to focus their energies on \"consensus-based compliance efforts, and the resolution of yet unresolved areas of the case.\" In the same document, the court enumerated certain prior orders that it now considered final (including the order approving the Plans and the orders containing the job description for the CHCC position).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The passage of time revealed that the remedial framework was not functioning smoothly. In April of 1997, a court-appointed expert found that the extant correctional health program was a bureaucratic morass incapable of meeting constitutional standards. To rectify this situation, the expert suggested the appointment of a receiver for the ailing program. The parties closed ranks to oppose this recommendation, proposing instead the creation of a private non-profit corporation (the Corporation), which would eventually assume total responsibility for providing medical and mental health services to the inmate population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 26, 1997, the parties filed a stipulation designed to flesh out this joint proposal. Under its terms, the Corporation would provide health care services, consistent with the Plans, to all persons held in institutions operated by the Administration of Corrections. The stipulation promised \"full coordination among all parties concerned\" and required the defendants (including the Secretary) to take a series of preparatory steps to lay the groundwork for an effective transition from the existing correctional health program to the new model. The stipulation also memorialized the parties' agreement to engage in further discussions \"concerning the role and authority of the CHCC with respect to monitoring the Corporation.\" Finally, the process of privatization &#8212; that is, the transition from the existing remedial framework to the stipulated alternative &#8212; was made subject to the district court's supervision. The court would be kept informed by, inter alia, the submission of regular progress reports from the CHCC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an ensuing opinion, the district court elaborated on the constitutional deficiencies of the existing health care programs, but declined to rule on the receivership recommendation. <i>Morales II,</i> 13 F.Supp.2d at 213. Instead, the court issued a series of orders designed to \"build on the remedial structure ... already in place.\" <i>Id.</i> In so doing, the court reaffirmed its earlier support for the Plans and expressed a willingness to listen should the parties or the CHCC \"request modifications of the [Plans] to keep abreast of health care developments or to enhance administrative and fiscal efficiency.\" <i>Id.</i> at 158.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also acknowledged the recommendation for the creation of a private non-profit corporation as a vehicle for the delivery of inmate health care services. <i>See id.</i> at 203 (citing the testimony of an expert in correctional health care to the effect that \"[t]he objective of an adequate budget process and a sense of relative permanency can be accomplished through a private not-for-profit health care corporation whose primary mission is correctional health care\"). But the court expressed skepticism about the parties' abilities to establish such an entity and ordered class counsel to report within ten days on the progress made in organizing the Corporation. <i>Id.</i> at 214. Within the allotted period, class counsel outlined the steps that were being taken to create the Corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Morales II</i> provides, at best, a tentative endorsement of the parties' suggested remedy, the court's subsequent statements and actions indicate full support for the nascent Corporation. That support has been unwavering: despite slower-than-expected progress on the path to privatization, the court has regularly reviewed and approved annual budgets for the Corporation and has authorized the disbursement of substantial monies from the fine fund to cover the Corporation's operating expenses. To date, these disbursements total around $20,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 31, 2000, Dr. Guzm&#225;n resigned. The district court believed that recruiting a new CHCC would be inopportune given the Corporation's \"advanced stage of development\" and the court's expectation that the Corporation would take over the delivery of correctional health care services within the next eighteen months. Still, the vacancy left a void. To bridge the gap temporarily, the court entered an order transferring some of the CHCC's duties to the executive director of the correctional health program (Dr. Ernesto Torres Arroyo).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new administration came to power in Puerto Rico following the November 2000 general elections. The following February, the Secretary &#8212; an appointee of the newly-elected governor &#8212; sought to terminate Dr. Torres' employment as executive director of the correctional health program. In response to the plaintiffs' objection, the district court restrained the Secretary from cashiering Dr. Torres until such time as the court chose to relieve him of the duties assigned to him after Dr. Guzm&#225;n's resignation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary did not appeal from this order, but, rather, notified the court that he was reappointing Dr. Guzm&#225;n to the vacant CHCC position. In the same motion, he asked the court to approve the appointment. The court ordered the parties to confer and submit a joint proposal designed to harmonize the CHCC's job description with the court's prior orders. The parties were unable to reach agreement. The principal bone of contention centered on the extent to which the Secretary (and, to some degree, the CHCC) would be in control of decisions regarding the privatization process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court resolved the matter by issuing the order underlying the instant appeal. That ukase, entered on May 23, 2001, noted that the court had \"ordered, as a solution to the myriad of problems affecting delivery of mental and medical health services to the plaintiff class in this case, the creation and organization of a private, not-for-profit corporation, to replace the present Correctional Health Program.\" This made it \"imperative that the [CHCC] cooperate[] fully with the [Corporation] during the transition period.\" To achieve this goal, the court directed the CHCC to (1) provide the Corporation with information reasonably necessary for the performance of its obligations; (2) ensure attendance of correctional health program workers at training seminars organized by the Corporation; (3) appoint coordinators to assist in the development of the training seminars, the reorganization of work areas, and the installation of electronic and telephonic equipment in the medical areas of correctional institutions; (4) guard against the improper use of installed equipment; (5) require the presence of Corporation personnel during consultations with higher officials anent matters related to the provision of correctional health services; (6) inform the Corporation's chief executive officer (CEO) of the times and locations of certain meetings; and (7) attend relevant meetings called by the Corporation's board or its CEO.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary chafed at this directive and asked the district court to reconsider it. He argued, inter alia, that the order was superfluous because the CHCC, of her own volition, was cooperating fully with the Corporation. The plaintiff class opposed reconsideration, claiming that there was ample reason to believe that the Secretary and the CHCC were refusing to cede control over the provision of inmate health services while simultaneously conspiring to appropriate the Corporation's resources. When the district court denied reconsideration, the Secretary appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Secretary asseverates that the assignment of new duties to the CHCC contravenes the district court's January 1996 partial judgment, which purported to make final several earlier orders (including the orders that collectively contained the CHCC's job description). Building on that foundation, the Secretary posits that the district court lacked jurisdiction to modify the January 1996 judgment and, alternatively, that the May 23 order fails to comport with the requirements of the PLRA. The plaintiffs counter that this interlocutory appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction; and that, in all events, the May 23 order is unimpugnable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is black-letter law that \"[f]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and thus must take pains to act only within the margins of that jurisdiction.\" <i>Cumberland Farms, Inc. v. Me. Tax Assessor,</i> 116 F.3d 943, 945 (1st Cir.1997). Hence, the preferred &#8212; and often the obligatory &#8212; practice is that a court, when confronted with a colorable challenge to its subject-matter jurisdiction, should resolve that question before weighing the merits of a pending action. <i>See Berner v. Delahanty,</i> 129 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1997); <i>see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 94, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). This principle holds true when an appellate court's right to exercise appellate jurisdiction is called into question. <i>In re Cusumano,</i> 162 F.3d 708, 712 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Director, OWCP v. Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 853 F.2d 11, 12-13 (1st Cir.1988). Thus, we turn first to the question of our own jurisdiction. We start this inquiry by elucidating the general tenets that govern the existence of appellate jurisdiction and then proceed to apply those tenets to the case at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Legal Landscape.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a well-established legislative policy disfavoring inchmeal appellate review. <i>See Anderson v. City of Boston,</i> 244 F.3d 236, 238 (1st Cir.2001). This policy makes very good sense. \"Multiple appeals in a single litigation are necessarily disruptive and, if freely allowed, subject to abuse.\" <i>Sierra Club v. Marsh,</i> 907 F.2d 210, 214 (1st Cir.1990). Thus, a federal court of appeals, as a general rule, will review decisions made by a district court only after that court enters a final judgment. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rule, like virtually every general rule, admits of certain exceptions. One exception to the rule against interlocutory appeals is embedded in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1). That statute authorizes immediate review of district court orders \"granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.\" <i>Id.</i> This exception must be strictly construed. <i>Sierra Club,</i> 907 F.2d at 214. Strict construction prevents the statute from being used as a means of evading the final judgment rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether a particular trial court order is appealable under section 1292(a)(1), a reviewing court must look to the practical effect of the order rather than its verbiage. <i>See Carson v. American Brands, Inc.,</i> 450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981). The <i>Carson</i> Court also made plain that a party seeking the benefit of section 1292(a)(1) must establish that the contested order imposes \"serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence[s]\" and that it may be challenged effectively only by immediate appeal. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another line of cases has relevance here. Although orders that <i>modify</i> injunctions may be appealable under section 1292(a)(1), orders that merely <i>clarify</i> previously entered injunctions are not. <i>See, e.g., Birmingham Fire Fighters Ass'n 117 v. Jefferson County,</i> 280 F.3d 1289, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2002); <i>United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Asbestospray, Inc.,</i> 182 F.3d 201, 207 (3rd Cir.1999); <i>Mikel v. Gourley,</i> 951 F.2d 166, 168 (8th Cir.1991). To ascertain whether an order modifies an injunction, we must determine whether the underlying decree is of an injunctive character, and if so, whether the ruling complained of can be said to have altered the underlying decree in a jurisdictionally significant way. <i>Sierra Club,</i> 907 F.2d at 212. A change is jurisdictionally significant if it substantially readjusts the legal relations of the parties, <i>see Cunningham v. David Special Commitment Ctr.,</i> 158 F.3d 1035, 1037 (9th Cir.1998), and does not relate simply to the conduct or progress of litigation, <i>see Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp.,</i> 485 U.S. 271, 279, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 99 L.Ed.2d 296 (1988). Doubts as to the applicability of section 1292(a)(1) are to be resolved against immediate appealability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Case at Hand.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Secretary appeals from the district court's order of May 23, 2001, claiming that it modifies a previously issued injunction. He maintains that the underlying injunctive decree &#8212; the decree modified by the order appealed from &#8212; is the January 1996 partial final judgment. This designation strikes us as arbitrary. The district court created the CHCC position in an order dated October 22, 1990; broadened its purview somewhat by order dated December 18, 1992; and continued the office in effect without any appreciable change in the 1996 partial final judgment. By the same token, the court issued several orders affecting the CHCC position in the period between January of 1996 and May of 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; the district court did not refer at all to the 1996 partial final judgment in crafting the order of May 23, 2001. Given this history, the Secretary's designation of the 1996 partial final judgment as the underlying injunction seems odd. The most that can be said is that the combination of orders composing the status quo as of May 23, 2001 amounted to an injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leaving to one side this obvious weakness in the Secretary's case, the question remains whether the May 23 order represented a jurisdictionally significant change in the status quo. <i>See Sierra Club,</i> 907 F.2d at 212-13. Answering this question requires us to focus on the practical effect of the order. <i>See id.</i> at 213.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, the May 23 order did not break new ground. The stipulation entered into by and between the parties on September 26, 1997 heralded the dawning of a new era, paving the way for a phase-out of the preexisting correctional health program and the creation of the Corporation as a new and different way to provide health services to inmates. That stipulation itself imposed obligations on the CHCC to report on the progress, and otherwise monitor the activities, of the new Corporation. While these changes constituted a dramatic modification of the status quo ante, the Secretary certainly cannot complain about them; they were introduced with the consent and active cooperation of his predecessor in office and, thus, bind the Secretary now. <i>See Cornelius v. Hogan,</i> 663 F.2d 330, 334-35 (1st Cir.1981) (finding, in an official-capacity suit, that a successor in office was bound by his predecessor's consent decree); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d)(1). A party's stipulations are binding on that party and may not be contradicted by him at trial or on appeal. <i>Keller v. United States,</i> 58 F.3d 1194, 1199 n. 8 (7th Cir.1995). It follows from these two propositions that a government official, sued in his representative capacity, cannot freely repudiate stipulations entered into by his predecessor in office during an earlier stage of the same litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary tries to wiggle off this hook by arguing that we should disregard the stipulation because it was not explicitly entered by the district court. This argument borders on the jejune. The parties docketed the stipulation and, although the district court did not instantly embrace it, the court's subsequent actions &#8212; particularly the entry of orders designed to facilitate the establishment of the new remedial framework and the release of funds to finance those activities &#8212; made manifest the court's adoption of the concept. In all events, the court certainly believed that it had approved the stipulation and its serial orders put the Secretary on clear notice of its belief. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Order of July 2, 1998 (reminding the parties that \"[c]orrectional health services w[ould] soon begin to undergo the transition to a private non-profit corporation\"); Order of April 19, 2000 (stating that the court previously had \"accepted and ordered the implementation of the parties' stipulations and proposals to create a not-for-profit Correctional Health Services Corporation\"). If the Secretary wished to hold the district court to a particular punctilio in the entry of the stipulation, the Secretary had an obligation to assert that position in a timely manner. <i>See Putnam Resources v. Pateman,</i> 958 F.2d 448, 456-57 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that an aggrieved party must act expeditiously to cure perceived error); <i>see generally United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 972 (1st Cir.1995) (stating that \"a litigant who deems himself aggrieved\" by a ruling of the trial judge \"ordinarily must object then and there, or forfeit any right to complain at a latter time\"). His failure to do so constitutes a waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, it is surpassingly difficult to see how the May 23 order worked a jurisdictionally significant change in the status quo. In some respects, this case is reminiscent of <i>Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority,</i> 178 F.3d 951 (7th Cir.1999). There, the Seventh Circuit held that an order directing a housing authority to involve a receiver in any settlement negotiations with tenants of a particular housing project was merely a reiteration of an earlier receivership decree that required \"full cooperation\" with the receiver. <i>Id.</i> at 953. On that basis, the court deemed the order unappealable under section 1292(a)(1). <i>Id.</i> at 958.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is similarly configured. The stipulation obligated the parties, in effect, to cooperate fully in the privatization process. The assignment of specific duties to the CHCC &#8212; the part of the May 23 order that rankles the Secretary &#8212; is simply another way of expressing what is reasonably to be expected from the stipulated promise of full cooperation. In short, the May 23 order is a logical corollary to the Secretary's stipulated commitment to assist in the privatization of the delivery of correctional health services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The particulars of the May 23 order do not alter this analysis. The specific dictates contained in that order &#8212; for instance, those requiring consultation with Corporation personnel and support of training programs &#8212; do no more than identify particular areas in which cooperation is required. Thus, the enumerated duties, taken as a whole, do not modify the status quo in any meaningful way. Confirming this conclusion is the fact that the Secretary initially objected to the May 23 order on the ground that it added nothing new to what the CHCC already was doing. His belated attempt to press the opposite view in this venue is untenable. <i>Cf. Lydon v. Boston Sand &amp; Gravel Co.,</i> 175 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir.1999) (warning that \"if parties feel free to select contradictory positions before different tribunals to suit their ends, the integrity and efficacy of the courts will suffer\") (quoting <i>Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. Gen. Cinema Corp.,</i> 834 F.2d 208, 214 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For much the same reasons, we do not accept the Secretary's plaint that the May 23 order has serious consequences. The order is disruptive, he tells us, because it undermines his authority to control the actions of a subordinate and, concomitantly, forces that subordinate &#8212; the CHCC &#8212; to preside over the dismantling of the correctional health program. This tale is unconvincing &#8212; and mischaracterizes the record to boot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, it was the Secretary &#8212; not the district court &#8212; who insisted on filling the CHCC position. He nominated Dr. Guzm&#225;n for the post knowing full well that a court-ordered privatization of health care services was in full swing. He cannot seriously contend that his unilateral decision to fill this vacancy somehow wipes the slate clean, allowing him to throw a monkey wrench into the privatization process and scuttle the reforms to which his predecessor had stipulated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, the consequences that the Secretary cites are the natural sequelae of the earlier agreement to transfer correctional health services to the Corporation. Those woes are not fairly attributable to the May 23 order. By first consenting to the privatization plan and then seeking to fill the CHCC position while the transition to privatization was underway, the Secretary became the author of his own misfortune.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed on this point &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; the Secretary's argument misstates the nature of the CHCC position. That position has never been exclusively under the Secretary's hegemony. From the very beginning, the CHCC has been subject to dual oversight, reporting both to the Secretary and the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This dual reporting relationship dovetails with the remedial framework that the court erected when it created the CHCC position to address constitutional shortcomings in inmate health services. Given the hybrid nature of the position, fine-tuning the CHCC's role to accommodate the stipulated changeover to privatization does little to alter the legal relations of the parties <i>as they existed on May 23, 2001.</i> The alteration, as we have said, dates back to the execution of the stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is yet another basis for our conclusion that the May 23 order does not significantly modify the status quo. The parties, through the stipulation, explicitly agreed that \"[t]he privatization process must be subject to Court supervision.\" This language gave the court substantial latitude in procedural matters relating to how best to achieve privatization. Given that fostering compliance with the district court's remedial framework is the CHCC's raison &#234;tre, the order that the Secretary challenges here can be viewed as procedural in nature (akin, say, to the appointment of a monitor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit dealt with an analogous procedural order in <i>Thompson v. Enomoto,</i> 815 F.2d 1323 (9th Cir.1987), a prisoner class action. There, the court had to decide whether the appointment of a special master to supervise compliance with a consent decree constituted a modification of the decree. Emphasizing the interim nature of the position, the court found no \"serious or irreparable harm\" stemming from the appointment. <i>Id.</i> at 1327. We think that here, as in <i>Thompson,</i> the order appealed from was within the lower court's reserved power to establish procedures for compliance with the court's earlier decrees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Id.</i> So viewed, the May 23 order was simply \"a step in controlling the litigation before the court,\" <i>Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger,</i> 348 U.S. 176, 185, 75 S.Ct. 249, 99 L.Ed. 233 (1955). Orders of that stripe are not immediately appealable. <i>See, e.g., Van Orman v. Am. Ins. Co.,</i> 680 F.2d 301, 314 (3d Cir.1982) (dismissing interlocutory appeal when the order appealed from was merely a \"judicial housekeeping measure designed to assist the court in framing ultimate relief in the case\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, the May 23 order is not a modification of a previous injunction, but, rather, a clarification of the CHCC's role in light of other developments in the case. At any rate, the order does not have serious or irreparable consequences for the Secretary because any infringement on his autonomy is a function of previously ordered relief. Finally, the nature of the obligations imposed on the CHCC places the May 23 order in the category of procedural orders that are not immediately appealable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons discussed above, we dismiss the appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Appeal dismissed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The designated official initially was called the \"chief medical coordinator.\" The title was changed in December of 1992</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> These include an order of May 16, 1997 (directing the CHCC to take contractual steps to maintain continuity of health services) and an order of April 19, 2000 (declining to name a new CHCC because the position would become obsolete within \"a brief period of time\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This conclusion is fortified by the fact that the CHCC position was created for the express purpose of implementing the Plans. The parties (through the stipulation) and the district court have now determined that privatization is the best route to achieve that goal. From that standpoint, a failure on the part of the CHCC to assist in executing the privatization process would violate her longstanding duty to implement the Plans</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The process by which the Secretary aspired to reappoint Dr. Guzm&#225;n as the CHCC illustrates this dichotomy. Although the Secretary selected her for the position, he submitted the nomination to the district court for the court's approval</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> As was true of the court-appointed special master in<i>Thompson,</i> the CHCC position was never meant to exist in perpetuity. To the contrary, the Plans contemplate that the CHCC will serve a three-year term, and the court has made it abundantly clear that the position will become obsolete once the transition to privatization has been completed. Thus, the May 23 order is temporary in the sense that it applies only to the transition period.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996) (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18 U.S.C., 28 U.S.C., &amp; 42 U.S.C.). The plaintiff class (composed of prison inmates) responds that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal on an interlocutory basis, and that, in all events, the challenged order is a proper exercise of the district court's authority. We agree with the first of the plaintiffs' assertions: the challenged order merely clarifies the court's prior decrees and imposes no serious consequences on the Secretary. Moreover, the order, in the last analysis, is a procedural measure that constitutes an exercise of the district court's housekeeping powers. For these reasons, immediate appellate review is not available to the Secretary as of right. Consequently, we dismiss the appeal without addressing the remaining issues briefed and argued by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the lore of this case is Byzantine, we confine our introductory remarks to those events that are directly pertinent to this appeal. We refer readers who hunger for more exegetic detail to the district court's myriad opinions. <i>E.g., Morales Feliciano v. Rosell&#243; Gonz&#225;lez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2311865\"><a href=\"/opinion/2311865/morales-feliciano-v-rossello-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span> (D.P.R.1998) (<i>Morales II</i>); <i>Morales Feliciano v. Romero Barcelo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1614272\"><a href=\"/opinion/1614272/feliciano-v-barcelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span> (D.P.R.1979) (<i>Morales I</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1979, representatives of the plaintiff class commenced this action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. They named several public officials as defendants, including, pertinently, the Secretary. The suit alleged dire shortcomings in virtually every aspect of prisoner confinement. The district court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on some of their claims and issued a preliminary injunction ordering the defendants to address the most pressing of the identified concerns. <i>See Morales I,</i> 497 F.Supp. at 38-41. The court gave very high priority to inadequate medical and mental health care. <i>See id.</i> at 37-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over time, the district court grew frustrated with the defendants' desultory responses to the preliminary injunction. To expedite compliance, the court appointed a monitor in March of 1986. The court charged the monitor with studying the relevant elements of the corrections program and recommending remedial action. With the monitor in place, the court became actively involved in certain aspects of the management of the prison system. Not surprisingly, the court found inertia to be a persistent problem and, to overcome it, issued temporary restraining orders and contempt citations against the defendants when and as required. The court also began to impose fines for the defendants' most egregious failures to comply with its decrees (particularly those failures relating to overcrowding). Those fines escalated as the foot-dragging continued and the court's level of exasperation mounted. To date, the court has levied aggregate fines totaling nearly $135,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 1990, the court ordered the implementation of medical and mental health care plans (the Plans) recommended by the monitor. By their terms, the Plans contemplated that overall responsibility for inmate health care would pass from the Administration of Corrections to the Department of Health. The Plans also required the Secretary to employ, for at least three years, a designated official &#8212; the CHCC &#8212; who would be responsible for easing the transition and coordinating compliance with the Plans.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In April of 1993, the Secretary nominated Dr. Aida Guzm&#225;n Font to assume the position. The district court approved financial support (from the fine fund) for her endeavors. When her term expired three years later, the parties jointly requested that the court approve her reappointment. The court obliged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January of 1996, the district court entered what it termed a \"partial final judgment.\" In this decree, the court settled several disputed issues and urged the parties to focus their energies on \"consensus-based compliance efforts, and the resolution of yet unresolved areas of the case.\" In the same document, the court enumerated certain prior orders that it now considered final (including the order approving the Plans and the orders containing the job description for the CHCC position).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The passage of time revealed that the remedial framework was not functioning smoothly. In April of 1997, a court-appointed expert found that the extant correctional health program was a bureaucratic morass incapable of meeting constitutional standards. To rectify this situation, the expert suggested the appointment of a receiver for the ailing program. The parties closed ranks to oppose this recommendation, proposing instead the creation of a private non-profit corporation (the Corporation), which would eventually assume total responsibility for providing medical and mental health services to the inmate population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 26, 1997, the parties filed a stipulation designed to flesh out this joint proposal. Under its terms, the Corporation would provide health care services, consistent with the Plans, to all persons held in institutions operated by the Administration of Corrections. The stipulation promised \"full coordination among all parties concerned\" and required the defendants (including the Secretary) to take a series of preparatory steps to lay the groundwork for an effective transition from the existing correctional health program to the new model. The stipulation also memorialized the parties' agreement to engage in further discussions \"concerning the role and authority of the CHCC with respect to monitoring the Corporation.\" Finally, the process of privatization &#8212; that is, the transition from the existing remedial framework to the stipulated alternative &#8212; was made subject to the district court's supervision. The court would be kept informed by, inter alia, the submission of regular progress reports from the CHCC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an ensuing opinion, the district court elaborated on the constitutional deficiencies of the existing health care programs, but declined to rule on the receivership recommendation. <i>Morales II,</i> 13 F.Supp.2d at 213. Instead, the court issued a series of orders designed to \"build on the remedial structure ... already in place.\" <i>Id.</i> In so doing, the court reaffirmed its earlier support for the Plans and expressed a willingness to listen should the parties or the CHCC \"request modifications of the [Plans] to keep abreast of health care developments or to enhance administrative and fiscal efficiency.\" <i>Id.</i> at 158.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also acknowledged the recommendation for the creation of a private non-profit corporation as a vehicle for the delivery of inmate health care services. <i>See id.</i> at 203 (citing the testimony of an expert in correctional health care to the effect that \"[t]he objective of an adequate budget process and a sense of relative permanency can be accomplished through a private not-for-profit health care corporation whose primary mission is correctional health care\"). But the court expressed skepticism about the parties' abilities to establish such an entity and ordered class counsel to report within ten days on the progress made in organizing the Corporation. <i>Id.</i> at 214. Within the allotted period, class counsel outlined the steps that were being taken to create the Corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Morales II</i> provides, at best, a tentative endorsement of the parties' suggested remedy, the court's subsequent statements and actions indicate full support for the nascent Corporation. That support has been unwavering: despite slower-than-expected progress on the path to privatization, the court has regularly reviewed and approved annual budgets for the Corporation and has authorized the disbursement of substantial monies from the fine fund to cover the Corporation's operating expenses. To date, these disbursements total around $20,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 31, 2000, Dr. Guzm&#225;n resigned. The district court believed that recruiting a new CHCC would be inopportune given the Corporation's \"advanced stage of development\" and the court's expectation that the Corporation would take over the delivery of correctional health care services within the next eighteen months. Still, the vacancy left a void. To bridge the gap temporarily, the court entered an order transferring some of the CHCC's duties to the executive director of the correctional health program (Dr. Ernesto Torres Arroyo).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new administration came to power in Puerto Rico following the November 2000 general elections. The following February, the Secretary &#8212; an appointee of the newly-elected governor &#8212; sought to terminate Dr. Torres' employment as executive director of the correctional health program. In response to the plaintiffs' objection, the district court restrained the Secretary from cashiering Dr. Torres until such time as the court chose to relieve him of the duties assigned to him after Dr. Guzm&#225;n's resignation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary did not appeal from this order, but, rather, notified the court that he was reappointing Dr. Guzm&#225;n to the vacant CHCC position. In the same motion, he asked the court to approve the appointment. The court ordered the parties to confer and submit a joint proposal designed to harmonize the CHCC's job description with the court's prior orders. The parties were unable to reach agreement. The principal bone of contention centered on the extent to which the Secretary (and, to some degree, the CHCC) would be in control of decisions regarding the privatization process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court resolved the matter by issuing the order underlying the instant appeal. That ukase, entered on May 23, 2001, noted that the court had \"ordered, as a solution to the myriad of problems affecting delivery of mental and medical health services to the plaintiff class in this case, the creation and organization of a private, not-for-profit corporation, to replace the present Correctional Health Program.\" This made it \"imperative that the [CHCC] cooperate[] fully with the [Corporation] during the transition period.\" To achieve this goal, the court directed the CHCC to (1) provide the Corporation with information reasonably necessary for the performance of its obligations; (2) ensure attendance of correctional health program workers at training seminars organized by the Corporation; (3) appoint coordinators to assist in the development of the training seminars, the reorganization of work areas, and the installation of electronic and telephonic equipment in the medical areas of correctional institutions; (4) guard against the improper use of installed equipment; (5) require the presence of Corporation personnel during consultations with higher officials anent matters related to the provision of correctional health services; (6) inform the Corporation's chief executive officer (CEO) of the times and locations of certain meetings; and (7) attend relevant meetings called by the Corporation's board or its CEO.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary chafed at this directive and asked the district court to reconsider it. He argued, inter alia, that the order was superfluous because the CHCC, of her own volition, was cooperating fully with the Corporation. The plaintiff class opposed reconsideration, claiming that there was ample reason to believe that the Secretary and the CHCC were refusing to cede control over the provision of inmate health services while simultaneously conspiring to appropriate the Corporation's resources. When the district court denied reconsideration, the Secretary appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Secretary asseverates that the assignment of new duties to the CHCC contravenes the district court's January 1996 partial judgment, which purported to make final several earlier orders (including the orders that collectively contained the CHCC's job description). Building on that foundation, the Secretary posits that the district court lacked jurisdiction to modify the January 1996 judgment and, alternatively, that the May 23 order fails to comport with the requirements of the PLRA. The plaintiffs counter that this interlocutory appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction; and that, in all events, the May 23 order is unimpugnable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is black-letter law that \"[f]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and thus must take pains to act only within the margins of that jurisdiction.\" <i>Cumberland Farms, Inc. v. Me. Tax Assessor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197427\"><a href=\"/opinion/197427/cumberland-farms-v-state-of-maine-tax/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">943</span></a></span>, 945 (1st Cir.1997). Hence, the preferred &#8212; and often the obligatory &#8212; practice is that a court, when confronted with a colorable challenge to its subject-matter jurisdiction, should resolve that question before weighing the merits of a pending action. <i>See Berner v. Delahanty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197623\"><a href=\"/opinion/197623/berner-v-delahanty/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1997); <i>see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span> (1998). This principle holds true when an appellate court's right to exercise appellate jurisdiction is called into question. <i>In re Cusumano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198247\"><a href=\"/opinion/198247/microsoft-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 712 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Director, OWCP v. Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509520\"><a href=\"/opinion/509520/director-office-of-workers-compensation-programs-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 12-13 (1st Cir.1988). Thus, we turn first to the question of our own jurisdiction. We start this inquiry by elucidating the general tenets that govern the existence of appellate jurisdiction and then proceed to apply those tenets to the case at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Legal Landscape.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a well-established legislative policy disfavoring inchmeal appellate review. <i>See Anderson v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199354\"><a href=\"/opinion/199354/boston-childrens-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 238 (1st Cir.2001). This policy makes very good sense. \"Multiple appeals in a single litigation are necessarily disruptive and, if freely allowed, subject to abuse.\" <i>Sierra Club v. Marsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544223\"><a href=\"/opinion/544223/sierra-club-v-john-o-marsh-jr-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 214 (1st Cir.1990). Thus, a federal court of appeals, as a general rule, will review decisions made by a district court only after that court enters a final judgment. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rule, like virtually every general rule, admits of certain exceptions. One exception to the rule against interlocutory appeals is embedded in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1). That statute authorizes immediate review of district court orders \"granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.\" <i>Id.</i> This exception must be strictly construed. <i>Sierra Club,</i> 907 F.2d at 214. Strict construction prevents the statute from being used as a means of evading the final judgment rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether a particular trial court order is appealable under section 1292(a)(1), a reviewing court must look to the practical effect of the order rather than its verbiage. <i>See Carson v. American Brands, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110416\"><a href=\"/opinion/110416/carson-v-american-brands-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110416\"><a href=\"/opinion/110416/carson-v-american-brands-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110416\"><a href=\"/opinion/110416/carson-v-american-brands-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span> (1981). The <i>Carson</i> Court also made plain that a party seeking the benefit of section 1292(a)(1) must establish that the contested order imposes \"serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence[s]\" and that it may be challenged effectively only by immediate appeal. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another line of cases has relevance here. Although orders that <i>modify</i> injunctions may be appealable under section 1292(a)(1), orders that merely <i>clarify</i> previously entered injunctions are not. <i>See, e.g., Birmingham Fire Fighters Ass'n 117 v. Jefferson County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776622\"><a href=\"/opinion/776622/birmingham-fire-fighters-association-117-wilks-class-v-jefferson-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span>, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2002); <i>United States Fire Ins. Co. v.

To ascertain whether an order modifies an injunction, we must determine whether the underlying decree is of an injunctive character, and if so, whether the ruling complained of can be said to have altered the underlying decree in a jurisdictionally significant way. <i>Sierra Club,</i> 907 F.2d at 212. A change is jurisdictionally significant if it substantially readjusts the legal relations of the parties, <i>see Cunningham v. David Special Commitment Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758703\"><a href=\"/opinion/758703/vance-r-cunningham-and-richard-garrett-turay-and-laura-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1035</span></a></span>, 1037 (9th Cir.1998), and does not relate simply to the conduct or progress of litigation, <i>see Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112025\"><a href=\"/opinion/112025/gulfstream-aerospace-corp-v-mayacamas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 279, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112025\"><a href=\"/opinion/112025/gulfstream-aerospace-corp-v-mayacamas-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span> (1988). Doubts as to the applicability of section 1292(a)(1) are to be resolved against immediate appealability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Case at Hand.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Secretary appeals from the district court's order of May 23, 2001, claiming that it modifies a previously issued injunction. He maintains that the underlying injunctive decree &#8212; the decree modified by the order appealed from &#8212; is the January 1996 partial final judgment. This designation strikes us as arbitrary. The district court created the CHCC position in an order dated October 22, 1990; broadened its purview somewhat by order dated December 18, 1992; and continued the office in effect without any appreciable change in the 1996 partial final judgment. By the same token, the court issued several orders affecting the CHCC position in the period between January of 1996 and May of 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; the district court did not refer at all to the 1996 partial final judgment in crafting the order of May 23, 2001. Given this history, the Secretary's designation of the 1996 partial final judgment as the underlying injunction seems odd. The most that can be said is that the combination of orders composing the status quo as of May 23, 2001 amounted to an injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leaving to one side this obvious weakness in the Secretary's case, the question remains whether the May 23 order represented a jurisdictionally significant change in the status quo. <i>See Sierra Club,</i> 907 F.2d at 212-13. Answering this question requires us to focus on the practical effect of the order. <i>See id.</i> at 213.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, the May 23 order did not break new ground. The stipulation entered into by and between the parties on September 26, 1997 heralded the dawning of a new era, paving the way for a phase-out of the preexisting correctional health program and the creation of the Corporation as a new and different way to provide health services to inmates. That stipulation itself imposed obligations on the CHCC to report on the progress, and otherwise monitor the activities, of the new Corporation. While these changes constituted a dramatic modification of the status quo ante, the Secretary certainly cannot complain about them; they were introduced with the consent and active cooperation of his predecessor in office and, thus, bind the Secretary now. <i>See Cornelius v. Hogan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396511\"><a href=\"/opinion/396511/cora-cornelius-v-william-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 334-35 (1st Cir.1981) (finding, in an official-capacity suit, that a successor in office was bound by his predecessor's consent decree); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d)(1). A party's stipulations are binding on that party and may not be contradicted by him at trial or on appeal. <i>Keller v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698686\"><a href=\"/opinion/698686/david-keller-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1199 n. 8 (7th Cir.1995). It follows from these two propositions that a government official, sued in his representative capacity, cannot freely repudiate stipulations entered into by his predecessor in office during an earlier stage of the same litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary tries to wiggle off this hook by arguing that we should disregard the stipulation because it was not explicitly entered by the district court. This argument borders on the jejune. The parties docketed the stipulation and, although the district court did not instantly embrace it, the court's subsequent actions &#8212; particularly the entry of orders designed to facilitate the establishment of the new remedial framework and the release of funds to finance those activities &#8212; made manifest the court's adoption of the concept. In all events, the court certainly believed that it had approved the stipulation and its serial orders put the Secretary on clear notice of its belief. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Order of July 2, 1998 (reminding the parties that \"[c]orrectional health services w[ould] soon begin to undergo the transition to a private non-profit corporation\"); Order of April 19, 2000 (stating that the court previously had \"accepted and ordered the implementation of the parties' stipulations and proposals to create a not-for-profit Correctional Health Services Corporation\"). If the Secretary wished to hold the district court to a particular punctilio in the entry of the stipulation, the Secretary had an obligation to assert that position in a timely manner. <i>See Putnam Resources v. Pateman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579198\"><a href=\"/opinion/579198/putnam-resources-v-ronald-m-pateman-ronald-m-pateman-v-frenkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, 456-57 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that an aggrieved party must act expeditiously to cure perceived error); <i>see generally United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 972 (1st Cir.1995) (stating that \"a litigant who deems himself aggrieved\" by a ruling of the trial judge \"ordinarily must object then and there, or forfeit any right to complain at a latter time\"). His failure to do so constitutes a waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, it is surpassingly difficult to see how the May 23 order worked a jurisdictionally significant change in the status quo. In some respects, this case is reminiscent of <i>Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764455\"><a href=\"/opinion/764455/dorothy-gautreaux-v-chicago-housing-authority-a-corporation-and-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">951</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1999). There, the Seventh Circuit held that an order directing a housing authority to involve a receiver in any settlement negotiations with tenants of a particular housing project was merely a reiteration of an earlier receivership decree that required \"full cooperation\" with the receiver. <i>Id.</i> at 953. On that basis, the court deemed the order unappealable under section 1292(a)(1). <i>Id.</i> at 958.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is similarly configured. The stipulation obligated the parties, in effect, to cooperate fully in the privatization process. The assignment of specific duties to the CHCC &#8212; the part of the May 23 order that rankles the Secretary &#8212; is simply another way of expressing what is reasonably to be expected from the stipulated promise of full cooperation. In short, the May 23 order is a logical corollary to the Secretary's stipulated commitment to assist in the privatization of the delivery of correctional health services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The particulars of the May 23 order do not alter this analysis. The specific dictates contained in that order &#8212; for instance, those requiring consultation with Corporation personnel and support of training programs &#8212; do no more than identify particular areas in which cooperation is required. Thus, the enumerated duties, taken as a whole, do not modify the status quo in any meaningful way. Confirming this conclusion is the fact that the Secretary initially objected to the May 23 order on the ground that it added nothing new to what the CHCC already was doing. His belated attempt to press the opposite view in this venue is untenable. <i>Cf. Lydon v. Boston Sand &amp; Gravel Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763554\"><a href=\"/opinion/763554/joseph-lydon-v-boston-sand-gravel-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1999) (warning that \"if parties feel free to select contradictory positions before different tribunals to suit their ends, the integrity and efficacy of the courts will suffer\") (quoting <i>Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. Gen. Cinema Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498115\"><a href=\"/opinion/498115/patriot-cinemas-inc-v-general-cinema-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 214 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For much the same reasons, we do not accept the Secretary's plaint that the May 23 order has serious consequences. The order is disruptive, he tells us, because it undermines his authority to control the actions of a subordinate and, concomitantly, forces that subordinate &#8212; the CHCC &#8212; to preside over the dismantling of the correctional health program. This tale is unconvincing &#8212; and mischaracterizes the record to boot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, it was the Secretary &#8212; not the district court &#8212; who insisted on filling the CHCC position. He nominated Dr. Guzm&#225;n for the post knowing full well that a court-ordered privatization of health care services was in full swing. He cannot seriously contend that his unilateral decision to fill this vacancy somehow wipes the slate clean, allowing him to throw a monkey wrench into the privatization process and scuttle the reforms to which his predecessor had stipulated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, the consequences that the Secretary cites are the natural sequelae of the earlier agreement to transfer correctional health services to the Corporation. Those woes are not fairly attributable to the May 23 order. By first consenting to the privatization plan and then seeking to fill the CHCC position while the transition to privatization was underway, the Secretary became the author of his own misfortune.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed on this point &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; the Secretary's argument misstates the nature of the CHCC position. That position has never been exclusively under the Secretary's hegemony. From the very beginning, the CHCC has been subject to dual oversight, reporting both to the Secretary and the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This dual reporting relationship dovetails with the remedial framework that the court erected when it created the CHCC position to address constitutional shortcomings in inmate health services. Given the hybrid nature of the position, fine-tuning the CHCC's role to accommodate the stipulated changeover to privatization does little to alter the legal relations of the parties <i>as they existed on May 23, 2001.</i> The alteration, as we have said, dates back to the execution of the stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is yet another basis for our conclusion that the May 23 order does not significantly modify the status quo. The parties, through the stipulation, explicitly agreed that \"[t]he privatization process must be subject to Court supervision.\" This language gave the court substantial latitude in procedural matters relating to how best to achieve privatization. Given that fostering compliance with the district court's remedial framework is the CHCC's raison &#234;tre, the order that the Secretary challenges here can be viewed as procedural in nature (akin, say, to the appointment of a monitor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit dealt with an analogous procedural order in <i>Thompson v. Enomoto,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1323</span></span> (9th Cir.1987), a prisoner class action. There, the court had to decide whether the appointment of a special master to supervise compliance with a consent decree constituted a modification of the decree. Emphasizing the interim nature of the position, the court found no \"serious or irreparable harm\" stemming from the appointment. <i>Id.</i> at 1327. We think that here, as in <i>Thompson,</i> the order appealed from was within the lower court's reserved power to establish procedures for compliance with the court's earlier decrees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Id.</i> So viewed, the May 23 order was simply \"a step in controlling the litigation before the court,\" <i>Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105259\"><a href=\"/opinion/105259/baltimore-contractors-inc-v-bodinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span>, 185, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105259\"><a href=\"/opinion/105259/baltimore-contractors-inc-v-bodinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105259\"><a href=\"/opinion/105259/baltimore-contractors-inc-v-bodinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span> (1955). Orders of that stripe are not immediately appealable. <i>See, e.g., Van Orman v. Am. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405068\"><a href=\"/opinion/405068/francis-van-orman-on-his-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-a-class-of-all/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 314 (3d Cir.1982) (dismissing interlocutory appeal when the order appealed from was merely a \"judicial housekeeping measure designed to assist the court in framing ultimate relief in the case\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, the May 23 order is not a modification of a previous injunction, but, rather, a clarification of the CHCC's role in light of other developments in the case. At any rate, the order does not have serious or irreparable consequences for the Secretary because any infringement on his autonomy is a function of previously ordered relief. Finally, the nature of the obligations imposed on the CHCC places the May 23 order in the category of procedural orders that are not immediately appealable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons discussed above, we dismiss the appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Appeal dismissed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The designated official initially was called the \"chief medical coordinator.\" The title was changed in December of 1992</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> These include an order of May 16, 1997 (directing the CHCC to take contractual steps to maintain continuity of health services) and an order of April 19, 2000 (declining to name a new CHCC because the position would become obsolete within \"a brief period of time\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This conclusion is fortified by the fact that the CHCC position was created for the express purpose of implementing the Plans. The parties (through the stipulation) and the district court have now determined that privatization is the best route to achieve that goal. From that standpoint, a failure on the part of the CHCC to assist in executing the privatization process would violate her longstanding duty to implement the Plans</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The process by which the Secretary aspired to reappoint Dr. Guzm&#225;n as the CHCC illustrates this dichotomy. Although the Secretary selected her for the position, he submitted the nomination to the district court for the court's approval</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> As was true of the court-appointed special master in<i>Thompson,</i> the CHCC position was never meant to exist in perpetuity. To the contrary, the Plans contemplate that the CHCC will serve a three-year term, and the court has made it abundantly clear that the position will become obsolete once the transition to privatization has been completed. Thus, the May 23 order is temporary in the sense that it applies only to the transition period.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
