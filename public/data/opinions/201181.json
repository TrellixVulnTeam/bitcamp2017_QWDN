Cianci was the\n\nMayor of Providence, Rhode Island; Frank E. Corrente was the City's\n\nDirector of Administration; Richard E. Autiello was a member of the\n\nProvidence           City   Towing   Association,     a    private    organization.\n\nBetween April 23 and June 24, 2002, the three were jointly tried on\n\na superseding indictment that charged them and others with forty-\n\nsix violations of federal statutes prohibiting public corruption.\n\nThe district court entered judgments of acquittal on eight of the\n\ncharges but submitted the rest to the jury.\n\n                On June 24, 2002, the jury returned a total of eight\n\nguilty verdicts but acquitted on the remaining thirty counts.                    All\n\nthree defendants were convicted on a single count charging a\n\nconspiracy to violate the RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\n\nOrganizations) statute.              See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).         Corrente and\n\nAutiello were convicted on a count charging a federal bribery\n\nconspiracy.           See 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 & 666(a)(1)(B).            Corrente was\n\nconvicted on a count charging a substantive RICO violation, see 18\n\nU.S.C.      §    1962(c),     two    counts     charging   Hobbs     Act   extortion\n\nconspiracies, see 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), and two counts charging\n\nHobbs Act attempted extortions, see id.               Autiello was convicted on\n\nan additional count charging a second federal bribery conspiracy.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 & 666(a)(1)(B).               The jury also answered \"YES\"\n\nto   four       of    thirty-seven    special    interrogatories,      which   asked\n\nwhether the government had \"proven\" the alleged predicate acts\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\funderlying        the     racketeering      counts;       all     other          special\n\ninterrogatories         were   answered   \"NO\"     or   not   answered      at    all.\n\n           The district court subsequently granted a judgment of\n\nacquittal on one of the extortion conspiracy charges of which\n\nCorrente had been convicted; ordered the forfeiture of $250,000 in\n\na campaign contribution fund controlled by Cianci and Corrente\n\npursuant     to    RICO's      forfeiture       provisions,     see    18   U.S.C.       §\n\n1963(a)(1); and sentenced the defendants to prison terms of sixty-\n\nfour months (Cianci), sixty-three months (Corrente), and forty-six\n\nmonths (Autiello).\n\n             Cianci, Corrente, and Autiello appeal their convictions\n\nand sentences, and Cianci and the government cross appeals the\n\ndistrict court's forfeiture ruling.                We begin with challenges to\n\ndefendants' RICO convictions.\n\nI.     The RICO Convictions (All Defendants)\n\n             A.         Indictment\n\n             Count One of the indictment charged Cianci, Autiello, and\n\nCorrente with conspiracy to operate the affairs of an enterprise\n\nconsisting of the defendants themselves, the City of Providence,\n\n\"various officers, agencies and entities of Providence\" including\n\nthirteen specified agencies, Jere Realty, and Friends of Cianci,\n\nand others \"known or unknown to the Grand Jury.\"                      The purpose of\n\nthe enterprise \"included the following: a. Enriching Defendant\n\nVincent A. Cianci . . . Friends of Cianci through extortion, mail\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\ffraud, bribery, money laundering, and witness tampering, and b.\n\nThrough the same means enriching, promoting and protecting the\n\npower and assets of the leaders and associates of the enterprise.\"\n\nIn   a       pre-trial   motion,   defendants   moved   to   dismiss   the   RICO\n\nallegations, asserting that the enterprise as charged was improper\n\nin that it was overly broad, vague, and legally impossible.1                  The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion. The issues raised by this motion\n\nwere revisited on motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new\n\ntrial.        The court denied these motions as well.\n\n                Defendants argue that the enterprise charged in the\n\nindictment was purposefully obscure and did not provide adequate\n\nnotice to defendants of the crimes for which they were charged and\n\nultimately convicted. The argument is couched in two ways: that 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1961(4) is unconstitutional as applied for failure to\n\nprovide “fair warning” of the alleged criminal conduct and that the\n\ncharged enterprise failed to provide adequate notice against which\n\nthe defendants could defend themselves.             The government counters\n\nthat, under the RICO statute, enterprise is defined broadly and\n\nthat defendants were sufficiently apprised of the nature and extent\n\nof the charges.\n\n                RICO makes it unlawful \"for any person employed by or\n\nassociated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of\n\n\n         1\n      We address this legal impossibility argument later in the\ncontext of whether sufficient evidence supported the charged RICO\nenterprise.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fwhich   affect,      interstate    or   foreign   commerce,     to   conduct    or\n\nparticipate,       directly   or   indirectly,    in   the    conduct    of   such\n\nenterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity[.]\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).          The statute also outlaws conspiracies to\n\nviolate § 1962(c).         See id. § 1962(d).     As stated above, Corrente\n\nwas convicted of a substantive violation of § 1962(c), and all\n\nthree defendants were convicted of RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d).\n\n              A     RICO    \"enterprise\"      \"includes       any    individual,\n\npartnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and\n\nany union or group of individuals associated in fact although not\n\na legal entity.\"           18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).        See United States v.\n\nDeCologero, 364 F.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 2004).                 It is important to\n\nstress that the Supreme Court has admonished that RICO and the term\n\n\"enterprise\" be construed expansively.                 See United States v.\n\nTurkette, 452 U.S. 576, 586-87 (1981); Sedina, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex\n\nCo., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 497-98 (1985); see also United States v.\n\nLondon, 66 F.3d 1227, 1243-44 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Lee\n\nStoller Enterprises, Inc., 652 F.2d 1313, 1318 (7th Cir. 1981).\n\nThe term’s flexibility is denoted by the use of the word “includes”\n\nrather than “means” or “is limited to”; it does not purport to be\n\nexhaustive. See United States v. Masters, 924 F.2d 1362, 1366 (7th\n\nCir. 1991) (Posner, J.); United States v. Perholtz, 842 F.2d 343,\n\n353   (D.C.       Cir.   1988).    Accordingly,     “enterprise”        has   been\n\ninterpreted inter alia to include (1) legal entities such as\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\flegitimate     business      partnerships    and    corporations,     and    (2)\n\nillegitimate associations-in-fact marked by an ongoing formal or\n\ninformal organization of individual or legal-entity associates, see\n\nLondon, 66 F.3d at 1243-44 (associations-in-fact may include legal\n\nentities    such     as   corporations),    who    or   which   function    as   a\n\ncontinuing organized crime unit \"for a common purpose of engaging\n\nin a course of conduct.\"         Turkette, 452 U.S. at 580-83; see also\n\nUnited States v. Patrick, 248 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir. 2001), cert.\n\ndenied, 535 U.S. 910 (2002).        The enterprise charged in this case\n\nis of the latter, associated-in-fact variety.\n\n             Here, the superseding indictment delineated the members\n\nof the enterprise, the roles of the defendants in the enterprise,\n\nthe purposes and goals of the racket, and the ways in which the\n\ndefendants used other members of the enterprise--specifically,\n\nmunicipal entities that they controlled as part of the conspiracy--\n\nto further those purposes and goals.              It alleged that defendants\n\nconspired to violate and did in fact violate RICO through their\n\ninvolvement     in    an    associated-in-fact      enterprise     devoted       to\n\nenriching and empowering defendants and others through unlawful\n\nmeans.     The enterprise was alleged to have been comprised of the\n\nindividual defendants; the City of Providence \"including, but not\n\nlimited to\" many of its departments, offices, and agencies; the\n\ncampaign contribution fund controlled by Cianci and Corrente; and\n\nothers known and unknown to the grand jury.                     The enterprise\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fallegations, which we reproduce as redacted following the district\n\ncourt's entry of the eight judgments of acquittal prior to the jury\n\ncharge, read as follows:\n\n                   THE RACKETEERING ENTERPRISE\n\n               Defendants VINCENT A. CIANCI, JR., a/k/a\n          \"Buddy\"; FRANK E. CORRENTE; RICHARD E.\n          AUTIELLO;     the    City     of    Providence\n          (\"Providence\"), including, but not limited to,\n          the Office of Mayor, the Office of the\n          Director of Administration, the Providence\n          City Solicitor's Office, the Department of\n          Planning and Development, the Providence\n          Redevelopment Agency, the Tax Collector's\n          Office, the Tax Assessor's Office, the Board\n          of   Tax  Assessment    Review,  the   Finance\n          Department, the Department of Public Safety,\n          the   Providence    School   Department,   the\n          Department of Inspection and Standards, and\n          the Building Board of Review; Friends of\n          Cianci,   the    political   organization   of\n          Defendant VINCENT A. CIANCI, JR., a/k/a\n          \"Buddy\"; and others known and unknown to the\n          Grand Jury, constituted an \"enterprise\" as\n          defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), that is, a\n          group of individuals and entities associated\n          in fact. This enterprise, which operated in\n          the District of Rhode Island and elsewhere,\n          was engaged in, and its activities affected\n          interstate commerce.\n\n                    PURPOSES OF THE ENTERPRISE\n\n                The purposes of the enterprise included\n          the following:\n\n                 a.    Enriching Defendant VINCENT A.\n          CIANCI, JR., a/k/a \"Buddy\" and Friends of\n          Cianci through extortion, mail fraud, bribery,\n          money laundering, and witness tampering; and\n\n                  b. Through the same means enriching,\n          promoting, and protecting the power and assets\n          of   the  leaders   and  associates   of   the\n          enterprise.\n\n                               -7-\n\f             DEFENDANTS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE ENTERPRISE\n\n               Defendants VINCENT A. CIANCI, JR., a/k/a\n          \"Buddy;\" and FRANK E. CORRENTE were the\n          leaders of the enterprise . . . .\n\n               Defendant RICHARD E. AUTIELLO, and others\n          known and unknown to the Grand Jury, were\n          associated    with,    and    conducted    and\n          participated, directly and indirectly, in the\n          conduct of the enterprise's affairs, including\n          but not limited to extortion, mail fraud, and\n          bribery.\n\nSuperseding Redacted Indictment, ¶¶ 38-41.        This enterprise was\n\nalleged to have existed \"from in or about January 1991 through in\n\nor about December 1999.\"\n\n          The balance of the indictment (again, in the redacted\n\nform in which it went to the jury) also detailed the \"pattern of\n\nracketeering activity\" underlying the grand jury's RICO and RICO\n\nconspiracy    allegations.    The   unlawful   conduct   comprising   the\n\nalleged pattern was set forth in a section detailing the predicate\n\nRICO \"Racketeering Acts\" and in separate offense counts.              The\n\npattern was itself subdivided into nine alleged schemes:\n\n             1.   A scheme, carried out between 1991 and\n             late 1999, in which Corrente (with Autiello\n             serving   as  his   intermediary)  pressured\n             companies with whom the Providence Police\n             Department contracted for towing services to\n             make campaign contributions totaling some\n             $250,000 to Friends of Cianci in order to\n             remain on the tow list (\"the Tow List\n             scheme\");\n\n             2.   A scheme, carried out between 1991 and\n             1998, in which the owner of Jere Realty, a\n             local real estate company, was alleged to have\n             paid bribes and kickbacks which made their way\n\n                                    -8-\n\fto Corrente in order to secure a Providence\nSchool Department lease for one of the\ncompany's Providence buildings (\"the Jere\nLease scheme\");\n\n3. A 1998 scheme in which Cianci was alleged\nto have been involved in extorting a $10,000\ncontribution from the estate of Fernando Ronci\n(which owed the City some $500,000 in back\ntaxes) in exchange for his support in the\nestate's efforts to secure a tax abatement\nfrom the corrupt Board of Tax Assessment\nReview, which was chaired by co-conspirator\nJoseph Pannone and vice-chaired by co-\nconspirator David Ead (\"the Ronci Estate\nscheme\");\n\n4.   A 1996-97 scheme in which Cianci was\nalleged to have arranged for Christopher Ise\nto obtain a job in the City's Department of\nPlanning and Development in return for a\n$5,000 contribution (\"the Ise Job scheme\");\n\n5. A 1999 scheme in which Cianci was alleged\nto have supported the contemplated sale of two\nCity lots to a City vendor, Anthony Freitas,\nin return for a $10,000 contribution (\"the\nFreitas Lots scheme\");\n\n6.   A 1998-99 scheme in which Corrente was\nalleged to have attempted to influence the\nProvidence School Department to encourage a\ncity contractor entitled to reimbursement from\nthe City for its lease expenses to lease a\nbuilding owned by Anthony Freitas in return\nfor   contributions  totaling   $2,000   (\"the\nFreitas Lease scheme\");\n\n7.   A 1998 scheme in which Corrente, acting\nthrough Joseph Pannone, was alleged to have\nfacilitated   prompt   payments  of invoices\nsubmitted to the City by a business owned by\nAnthony Freitas in return for contributions\ntotaling   $1,100    (\"the  Freitas Invoices\nscheme\");\n\n8. A 1998 scheme in which Cianci was alleged\n(a) to have attempted to influence the City's\n\n                     -9-\n\f           Building Board of Review to deny a request for\n           construction variances made by the private\n           University Club in retaliation for the Club's\n           having refused to admit him as a member back\n           in the 1970s and its continuing refusal to\n           admit him, and (b) to have extorted a free\n           honorary membership from the Club as the\n           construction variance dispute was unfolding\n           (\"the University Club scheme\"); and\n\n           9. A 1996 scheme in which Autiello conspired\n           with an unnamed public official to facilitate\n           the   hiring  of   Joseph   Maggiacomo  as   a\n           Providence police officer in return for a\n           $5,000 cash contribution by Joseph's mother,\n           Mary Maggiacomo (\"the Maggiacomo Job scheme\").\n\n           \"[A]n indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the\n\nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendants of\n\nthe charge against which he must defend, and, second, enables him\n\nto plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions\n\nfor the same offense.\"   Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117\n\n(1974).   \"It is generally sufficient that an indictment set forth\n\nthe offense in the words of the statute itself, as long as 'those\n\nwords of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, without any\n\nuncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to\n\nconstitute the offense intended to be punished.'\"    Id. (citations\n\nomitted); see also United States v. McDonough, 959 F.2d 1137, 1140\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           The indictment not only tracks the language of the RICO\n\nstatute, but also goes into considerable detail with respect to the\n\nunderlying factual allegations. Hence, we conclude that defendants\n\nwere more than sufficiently apprised of the charges.\n\n                                -10-\n\f           B.      Enterprise\n\n           The defendants also argue that their RICO convictions\n\ncannot stand because there was insufficient evidence to ground the\n\njury's foundational finding that the government had proved the\n\nexistence of the RICO \"enterprise\" that the government charged.2\n\nWe begin our analysis by summarizing the relevant legal principles\n\nand the government's RICO theory and proof.\n\n           In cases involving an alleged associated-in-fact RICO\n\nenterprise, the existence of the charged enterprise does not\n\nfollow,   ipso   facto,   from   evidence   that   those   named   as   the\n\nenterprise's associates engaged in crimes that collectively may be\n\ncharacterized as a \"pattern of racketeering activity\":\n\n           While the proof used to establish these\n           separate elements [i.e., the \"enterprise\" and\n           the \"pattern of racketeering activity\"] may in\n           particular cases coalesce, proof of one does\n           not necessarily establish the other.       The\n           \"enterprise\"   is    not   the   \"pattern   of\n           racketeering activity\"; it is an entity\n           separate and apart from the pattern of\n           activity in which it engages. The existence\n           of an enterprise at all times remains a\n           separate element which must be proved by the\n           Government.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The indictment and the jury instructions required that the\ngovernment prove the same enterprise, described below, in order to\nsecure convictions on both the substantive RICO count and the RICO\nconspiracy count. The analysis that follows therefore applies with\nequal force to the substantive RICO conviction returned against\nCorrente and to the RICO conspiracy convictions returned against\nCianci, Corrente, and Autiello.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fTurkette, 452 U.S. at 583.     In other words, criminal actors who\n\njointly engage in criminal conduct that amounts to a pattern of\n\n\"racketeering activity\" do not automatically thereby constitute an\n\nassociation-in-fact RICO enterprise simply by virtue of having\n\nengaged in the joint conduct.     Something more must be found --\n\nsomething that distinguishes RICO enterprises from ad hoc one-time\n\ncriminal ventures.   See Bachman v. Bear Stearns & Co., Inc., 178\n\nF.3d 930, 932 (7th Cir. 1999) (Posner, C.J.) (noting that a\n\ncontrary rule would erroneously make \"every conspiracy to commit\n\nfraud . . . a RICO [enterprise] and consequently every fraud that\n\nrequires more than one person to commit . . . a RICO violation\").\n\n          Courts have divided over the legal standards that guide\n\nthe drawing of this distinction.       Some require proof that an\n\nalleged   associated-in-fact   enterprise   have   an   \"ascertainable\n\nstructure distinct from that inherent in the conduct of a pattern\n\nof racketeering activity . . ., which might be demonstrated by\n\nproof that a group engaged in a diverse pattern of crimes or that\n\nit has an organizational pattern or system of authority beyond what\n\nwas necessary to perpetrate the predicate crimes.\"       Patrick, 248\n\nF.3d at 18 (quoting United States v. Bledsoe, 674 F.2d 647, 664\n\n(8th Cir. 1982), and discussing cases from other circuits that have\n\nadopted Bledsoe's \"ascertainable structure\" standard) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).      Courts following the \"ascertainable\n\nstructure\" approach do so out of concern that the factfinder not be\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fmisled into \"collaps[ing] . . . the enterprise element with the\n\nseparate    pattern      of   racketeering         activity     element       of   a   RICO\n\noffense.\"        Id. (quoting           Bledsoe,   674   F.2d    at    664)    (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n            This circuit has cast its lot with courts that have\n\ndeclined to make Bledsoe's \"ascertainable structure\" criterion a\n\nmandatory    component        of    a    district    court's     jury       instructions\n\nexplaining RICO associated-in-fact enterprises.                      See id. at 18-19.\n\nInstead, we have approved instructions based strictly on Turkette's\n\nexplanation of how a criminal association might qualify as a RICO\n\nenterprise.      See, e.g., Patrick, 248 F.3d at 17-19.                     In doing so,\n\nwe have read Turkette to impose a requirement that those associated\n\nin fact “function as an ongoing unit” and constitute an “ongoing\n\norganization.”      Id. at 19. Also important to such an enterprise is\n\nthat its members share a \"common purpose.\"                            See, e.g., id.;\n\nClemente v. Ryan, 901 F.2d 177, 180 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[A]lthough\n\nmuch about the RICO statute is not clear, it is very clear that\n\nthose who are 'associates' . . . of a criminal enterprise must\n\nshare a 'common purpose' . . . .\") (citations omitted).\n\n            We    turn    now      to    the   particulars      of    the    defendants'\n\nargument.    First, they contend that the indictment charged a legal\n\nimpossibility in alleging that municipal entities were themselves\n\npart of the unlawful purpose associated-in-fact enterprise.                            They\n\nbase this argument on the requirement that members of such an\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fenterprise share a common unlawful purpose and cases holding that\n\nmunicipalities cannot be found to have acted with unlawful intent.\n\nSee, e.g., Lancaster Comm. Hosp. v. Antelope Valley Hosp. Dist.,\n\n940 F.2d 397, 404 (9th Cir. 1991) (“[G]overnment entities are\n\nincapable of forming a malicious intent.”); United States v.\n\nThompson, 685 F.2d 993, 1001 (6th Cir. 1982) (\"Criminal activity is\n\nprivate activity even when it is carried out in a public forum and\n\neven though the activity can only be undertaken by an official's\n\nuse of a state given power[.]\").\n\n           Defendants’ argument misses the mark because neither the\n\nindictment nor the jury instructions compel the conclusion that the\n\nCity   itself    had   to   have   formed   an   unlawful   intent.    It   is\n\nuncontroversial that corporate entities, including municipal and\n\ncounty   ones,   can   be   included   within     association-in-fact    RICO\n\nenterprises. See, e.g., London, 66 F.3d at 1244; Masters, 924 F.2d\n\nat 1366.   It is also beyond dispute, as the Supreme Court held in\n\nTurkette, that “the term ‘enterprise’ as used in RICO encompasses\n\nboth legitimate and illegitimate enterprises.”              452 U.S. at 578.\n\nAs the D.C. Circuit elucidated:\n\n           [A restrictive] reading of 1961(4) would lead\n           to the bizarre result that only criminals who\n           failed to form corporate shells to aid their\n           illicit schemes could be reached by RICO.\n           [Such an] interpretation hardly accords with\n           Congress’ remedial purposes: to design RICO as\n           a weapon against the sophisticated racketeer\n           as well as (and perhaps more than) the\n           artless.\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fPerholtz, 842 F.2d at 353.       Municipal entities can be part of an\n\nunlawful purpose association-in-fact enterprise so long as those\n\nwho control the entities share the purposes of the enterprise.\n\n“RICO does not require intentional or ‘purposeful’ behavior by\n\ncorporations charged as members of an association-in-fact.” United\n\nStates v. Feldman, 853 F.2d 648, 657 (9th Cir. 1988).                   A RICO\n\nenterprise animated by an illicit common purpose can be comprised\n\nof an association-in-fact of municipal entities and human members\n\nwhen the latter exploits the former to carry out that purpose.\n\nCianci, Corrente, and Autiello – those who wielded influence,\n\nexerted pressure, and effectively controlled the City’s various\n\ncomponents    –   are   the   criminals      here.        Defendants’    legal\n\nimpossibility argument holds water only had the government sought\n\nprosecution of the City itself.              The City and its component\n\nagencies are not the defendants in this case; they were deemed\n\nmembers of the enterprise because without them, Cianci, Corrente,\n\nand Autiello would not have been able to even attempt to perpetrate\n\nthe charged racketeering schemes.           Indeed, this is not the first\n\ntime an association-in-fact enterprise composed in this manner has\n\nbeen found to exist.    See, e.g., Masters, 924 F.2d at 1362; United\n\nStates   v.   McDade,   28    F.3d    283    (3d   Cir.    1994)   (upholding\n\nassociation-in-fact enterprise consisting of congressman, his two\n\noffices, and congressional subcommittees that he chaired); United\n\nStates v. Dischner, 974 F.2d 1502 (9th Cir. 1992) (upholding\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fassociation-in-fact enterprise consisting of municipal officials,\n\noffice of mayor, and department of public works); United States v.\n\nAngelilli, 660 F.2d 23, 31-33 (2d Cir. 1981) (“We view the language\n\nof § 1961(4), . . . as unambiguously encompassing governmental\n\nunits, . . . and the substance of RICO’s provisions demonstrate a\n\nclear congressional intent that RICO be interpreted to apply to\n\nactivities that corrupt public or governmental entities.”).     In\n\neach of these cases, the groupings of individuals and corporate or\n\nmunicipal entities were sufficiently organized and devoted to the\n\nalleged illicit purposes that the resulting whole functioned as a\n\ncontinuing unit.   The common purpose was dictated by individuals\n\nwho controlled the corporate or municipal entities’ activities and\n\nmanipulated them to the desired illicit ends.\n\n          The indictment and jury instructions are consistent with\n\nthis framing of the enterprise.   The district court instructed the\n\njury, without objection from either party, that “the Government\n\nmust prove that the alleged enterprise had an ongoing organization,\n\nwhether it be formal or informal, and that its various associates\n\nfunctioned together as a continuing unit to achieve common goals.”\n\nThe court continued, “It is not necessary in proving the existence\n\nof an enterprise to show that each member of the enterprise\n\nparticipated in or even knew of all of its activities, but it is\n\nnecessary to show that all members of the alleged enterprise shared\n\na common purpose.”   Requiring the government to prove that all\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fmembers   named   in   the   enterprise   shared   a   common   purpose   of\n\nillegality did not compel the government to show that the City\n\nitself had the mens rea to seek bribes and to extort.            The Ninth\n\nand Sixth Circuits articulated what in some sense is the obvious:\n\nthat a corporate or municipal entity does not have a mind of its\n\nown for purposes of RICO.      Lancaster Comm. Hosp., 940 F.2d at 404;\n\nThompson, 685 F.2d at 1001.      Unlawful common purpose is imputed to\n\nthe City by way of the individual defendants’ control, influence,\n\nand manipulation of the City for their illicit ends.            Whether the\n\ndefendants did exercise sufficient control over the City for\n\npurposes of the enterprise is one of fact for the jury and\n\nevidentiary sufficiency.\n\n           It follows that the defendants also have an evidence-\n\nbased argument.    They contend that their RICO convictions must be\n\nreversed because the evidence introduced at trial in support of the\n\nalleged schemes set forth above -- the only proof from which the\n\njury might have inferred that the schemes were carried out, or were\n\nintended to be carried out, by means of a RICO enterprise, see\n\nTurkette, 452 U.S. at 583 (observing that proof of the pattern of\n\nracketeering activity may in particular cases also constitute the\n\nproof of the enterprise itself) -- was insufficient to ground a\n\nfinding that the schemes were conducted through the specific entity\n\nalleged in the indictment to have constituted a RICO enterprise.\n\nDefendants base this argument on an assertion that there was no\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fevidence from which the jury might have inferred a shared purpose\n\nbetween defendants and the municipal entities named as associates\n\nof the enterprise and through which many of the schemes were\n\nconducted.     In support of this argument, the defendants point to\n\nspecific statements           by    the   district   court   that       \"there    is   no\n\nevidence that the [City] departments and/or agencies, themselves,\n\nshared [the enterprise's] purposes,\" United States v. Cianci, 210\n\nF. Supp. 2d 71, 73 (D. R.I. 2002) (denying defendants' motions for\n\njudgments of acquittal), and that \"none of [defendants'] acts . .\n\n.   resulted    in   any      significant       disruption   of     a    Governmental\n\nfunction.\"     Id.     The defendants also emphasize that, even if we\n\nwere to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the\n\nRICO convictions by construing the entire record in the light most\n\nfavorable to the government, the evidence is insufficient.\n\n               As set forth above, we have identified Turkette's\n\n“ongoing organization,” “continuing unit,” and \"common purpose\"\n\nrequirements as the principal tools a factfinder should use to\n\ndistinguish     a      RICO        enterprise    from   an    ad        hoc   criminal\n\nconfederation.       We have applied these requirements to unlawful\n\npurpose associations-in-fact involving corporate legal entities.\n\nSee London, 66 F.3d at 1243-45.             The district court adequately set\n\nout these requirements to the jury; hence, we see no basis for\n\ndisregarding     the    court’s        instructions     in   the    course       of    our\n\nsufficiency review.           See, e.g., United States v. Zanghi, 189 F.3d\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f71, 79-80 (1st Cir. 1999) (an unchallenged jury instruction that is\n\nfaithful    to    the    indictment   and       \"not    patently        incorrect     or\n\ninternally inconsistent\" becomes the standard by which evidentiary\n\nsufficiency is to be measured) (citing United States v. Gomes, 969\n\nF.2d 1290, 1294 (1st. Cir. 1992)).\n\n            After careful scrutiny of the record and setting the\n\nevidence against the jury instructions, we conclude that the jury\n\ncould have found the above requirements, specifically that the\n\ndefendants and others named as enterprise members comprised an\n\nongoing organization that functioned as a continuing unit and was\n\nanimated by common purposes or goals.\n\n            We agree with the government's assertion that the jury's\n\nenterprise finding is sustainable because there was sufficient\n\nevidence that Cianci and Corrente exercised substantial control\n\nover the municipal entities named as members of the enterprise.\n\nCianci     was    the    City's    mayor     and       Corrente     its    chief      of\n\nadministration.         They were alleged and were shown to have used\n\ntheir positions         and   influence    to   sell     municipal      favors   on    a\n\ncontinuing basis.        The evidence indicates a close relationship \"in\n\nfact\" among them, the City they managed, and Cianci's political\n\norganization. Cianci, as mayor, and Corrente and Autiello, as city\n\nofficials,       were   strongly    connected      to     and     had    considerable\n\ninfluence over the various City employees and departments.                       Their\n\nillegal schemes could function only with the cooperation, witting\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\for unwitting, of certain City agencies and officials.              Insofar as\n\nCianci's and the other defendants' criminal schemes were or would\n\nbe carried out by themselves and others acting in their municipal\n\nroles, the City--if only to that extent--did share in the same\n\ncommon criminal purpose.3           The defendants were not only human\n\nmembers of the enterprise, but were the City’s official leaders\n\nwith       considerable   express   and     implicit   authority   over   its\n\ndepartments and employees.           Moreover, the enterprise’s corrupt\n\npurposes were aimed at exploiting the City’s resources.                It is\n\nbecause of this control and these close connections that the jury\n\ncould have imputed the enterprise's common purpose to the City.\n\nSee Masters, 924 F.2d at 1366 (“Surely if three individuals can\n\n\n\n       3\n      The evidence depicted a behavioral spectrum ranging from\ninnocent cooperation to willful complicity in unlawful conduct.\nFor example, with respect to the Freitas Invoices scheme, the\nevidence was merely that an employee within the City's Finance\nDepartment (Lorraine Lisi), acting at Corrente's request, paid\nvalid invoices more promptly than usual. Similarly, with respect\nto the Ise Job scheme, the evidence was merely that the Deputy\nDirector of the Department of Planning and Development (Thomas\nDeller) created a temporary position for Ise within the department\nat Cianci's request. At the more culpable end of the spectrum,\nhowever, there was evidence that, in connection with the Jere Lease\nscheme, the head of the Department of Public Property (Alan Sepe)\nand the Director of Business Relations for the School Department\n(Mark Dunham) were influenced by Corrente to tailor the\nspecifications in a School Department lease bid to fit the\ndimensions of Jere Realty's building, and then to support the Jere\nRealty lease before the Board of Contract and Supply (which was the\nentity formally empowered to accept or reject bids of City\ncontracts).    Similarly, in connection with the Freitas Lease\nscheme, there was evidence that Corrente again contacted Dunham\nprior to finalization of the lease and influenced him to drop\nconsideration of an alternative lease.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fconstitute a RICO enterprise, . . ., then the larger association\n\nthat consists of them plus entities that they control can be a RICO\n\nenterprise too.”).\n\n             Evidence of defendants’ control, both titular and actual,\n\nwas sufficient to deem the enterprise a “continuing unit” and\n\n“ongoing organization.”         The jury could easily glean from taped\n\nconversations and the trial testimony of David Ead –- a co-\n\nconspirator and vice-chair of the Board of Tax Assessment Review –-\n\nthat there existed an organized structure with Cianci at the top,\n\nCorrente     as   a   middle   man   facilitating   and   often   initiating\n\ntransactions, and others, including Autiello, Ead, and Pannone,\n\nthat fed deals into the organization (or in Ead’s case, sometimes\n\ntried to replace Corrente as the middle man).               The defendants\n\nattempted to use, to varying degrees of success, various municipal\n\nagencies in committing a series of related bribes and extortions.\n\nThese agencies were used in this manner on an ongoing basis from\n\n1991 through 1999.       The fact that other persons and entities were\n\nused in some transactions but not in others does not matter; the\n\njury instructions reflected this flexibility.4\n\n\n     4\n         The court instructed, in relevant part:\n\n     “An enterprise may exist even though individual members come\nand go as long as it continues in an essentially unchanged form\nduring substantially the entire period alleged in the indictment,\n. . . .”\n\n     “It is not necessary in proving the existence of an enterprise\nto show that each member of the enterprise participated in or even\n\n                                      -21-\n\f          There was detailed evidence, moreover, placing Cianci,\n\nthe City’s mayor, in the middle of at least four of the enumerated\n\nracketeering acts.   With regard to the Ronci Estate scheme, David\n\nEad testified at trial that he suggested to Ronci’s attorney that\n\nthe estate settle its tax claim with the City for $100,000 in\n\nexchange for a $10,000 contribution to the Friends of Cianci.    Ead\n\nmet with Cianci and discussed the proposed deal.    The settlement\n\nwas approved by the City’s Board of Tax Assessment Review.       Ead\n\ntestified that shortly thereafter, he was contacted by Corrente,\n\nwho told him that Cianci wanted Corrente to collect the money.   Ead\n\nresponded that he was waiting for the Ronci attorney, to which\n\nCorrente replied, “Well you know that the Mayor he’s on my back –\n\ndo your best.”   After receiving the money from Ronci’s attorney,\n\nEad brought the money to Corrente who put his finger on his lips\n\nand took the envelope. A tape-recorded conversation between Joseph\n\nPannone and Anthony Freitas provided additional evidence.5       Our\n\ndissenting brother recognizes that there was enough evidence for\n\n\n\n\nknew of all of its activities, . . . .”\n\n     “. . . a Defendant need not have been associated with an\nenterprise for the entire time that the enterprise existed in order\nto have been associated with the enterprise, but a Defendant must\nshare some common goal or objective of the enterprise in order to\nbe a member.”\n     5\n      Pannone said to Freitas, “Ead took care of the Mayor, don’t\nknow what he gave the Mayor . . . He took care of me, too. He\npushed the Ronci settlement through.”\n\n                               -22-\n\fthe jury to conclude that defendants functionally controlled the\n\nBoard of Tax Assessment Review, often for criminal purposes.\n\n           With regard to the Ise Job, Ead again testified that he\n\nserved as a middleman for Mayor Cianci, this time arranging a\n\n$5,000 bribe in exchange for a municipal job.            According to Ead,\n\nCianci asked during their conversation about Ise, cautious about\n\nwhether “he’s alright” and looking for assurances that “he’s not\n\ngoing to say nothing.” Upon learning that the City’s Department of\n\nPlanning and Development had no positions available, Cianci ordered\n\nthe   Department   to   “make    one.”       Upon   receiving    the    $5,000\n\n“contribution,” Cianci told Ead, “Don’t get nervous.”\n\n           In their trial testimony, which closely tracked taped\n\nconversations among Freitas, Pannone, and other City officials,\n\nboth Freitas and Ead implicated Cianci in the Freitas Lots scheme,\n\nin which Cianci pressured the Providence Redevelopment Authority,\n\nthe entity empowered to sell the lots, to expedite the sale of two\n\nCity-owned lots to Freitas in exchange for a $10,000 “contribution”\n\nby Freitas to the Cianci political fund.            Finally, with regard to\n\nthe Tow List scheme, Dorothy Deveraux –- Corrente’s assistant and\n\nthe   Friends’   bookkeeper     –-   wrote   a   note   to   Corrente    which\n\nimplicated all three defendants in that scheme.6                Moreover, as\n\n\n      6\n      Deveraux’s note supported the prosecution theory that when\ntowers occasionally “contributed” too much money under the same\nname, the defendants arranged for “replacement” checks to be made\nby third-party straw contributors.     The note read, “FRANK –\nattached are two over checks – Please sign and Dick Autiello will\n\n                                     -23-\n\fJudge Howard concedes, the jury could have found, based primarily\n\non taped statements and the trial testimony of towing association\n\nchairman Kenneth Rocha, that Corrente effectively controlled who\n\nmade it onto the police department’s tow list.\n\n           We recognize that the defendants did not always get their\n\nway with municipal departments and employees.7          But the fact that\n\nsome racketeering schemes did not go as planned, and that certain\n\nelements within the City may not have completely complied with the\n\ndefendants’ wishes, does not defeat the integrity of the charged\n\nenterprise.     The jury could have concluded that these glitches in\n\nthe   schemes   only   meant   that    certain   substantive   crimes   went\n\nuncompleted and that otherwise, defendants possessed and exercised\n\nconsiderable control over crucial elements of the City.                  The\n\nevidence amply establishes a close relationship between defendants\n\nand the City in which they exercised their leadership roles.             The\n\n\nbe by today to replace with new checks – I need your help with the\nother people – these overages total $3,420.00. I know the Mayor\ndoes not want to part with that – without money being replaced.\nPlease assign someone to talk to these people.”\n      7\n      For example, in connection with the Freitas Lots scheme,\nCianci was displeased that elements within the Providence\nRedevelopment Agency did not sufficiently accede to his wishes,\nspecifically when the PRA sold one of the “Freitas lots” before\nCianci had a chance to finalize a deal with Freitas. In connection\nwith the University Club scheme, Cianci was displeased when members\nof the Providence Building Board of Review ignored his wishes and\ngranted the club some of the variances that it sought. Finally, in\nconnection with the Maggiacomo Job scheme, the Chief of Police\ndeclined to admit Maggiacomo to the police academy because he had\na criminal history and had been untruthful during a screening\ninterview.\n\n                                      -24-\n\fenterprise and the conspiracy still thrived and the defendants were\n\nable to complete other schemes through their abuse of the municipal\n\napparatus.\n\n           Defendants attempt to expose what they deem an error by\n\nthe government in charging an overly broad enterprise that places\n\na criminal onus on a largely innocent City.                 They warn that an\n\nenterprise   such    as    that   charged   here   implicates     non-culpable\n\nmunicipal parties in associations which they had little or no idea\n\nwere engaged in illicit activities.           But this fear is misplaced.\n\nHere, as long as elements within the City, such as the police chief\n\nand   members   of   the    Building   Review      Board    and   Redevelopment\n\nAgencies, in fact did not actively share in the defendants' illegal\n\npurposes, we see no reason why we run into now-Justice Breyer’s\n\nadmonition in Ryan: that of failing to differentiate between\n\nassociations that fall within the sweep of RICO and associations\n\ninvolving only the exploitation of others by criminals.                See 901\n\nF.2d at 180-81 (emphasizing the need to limit \"the potentially\n\nboundless scope of the word 'enterprise' so as to distinguish\n\nculpable from    non-culpable       associations,     and    recognizing   \"the\n\nserious consequences for any man or woman, state official or\n\nprivate person, who is publicly accused of racketeering\"); see\n\nalso Fitzgerald v. Chrysler Corp., 116 F.3d 225, 226-28 (7th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\f1997).8     Justice Breyer’s limiting principle of a shared common\n\npurpose among members of an association-in-fact enterprise still\n\nfunctions    here   to   prevent   a    “boundless   enterprise.”      Those\n\nemployees of a city that do not exhibit the requisite mens rea with\n\nregard to the enterprise’s illicit purposes will not be criminally\n\nor civilly implicated.       In the present litigation, the City was\n\nnamed a member of the charged enterprise, not a defendant.               The\n\nCity “shared” in the enterprise’s purpose only to the extent of the\n\ndefendants’ considerable influence and control over the relevant\n\nmunicipal agencies, and to the extent of those officials and\n\ndepartments who were wittingly or unwittingly involved in the\n\nvarious schemes.     Being named in the enterprise does not make the\n\nCity itself criminally or civilly liable under RICO.9               It bears\n\nrepeating that the RICO statute defines “enterprise” broadly and\n\n\n     8\n      We distinguish Judge Howard’s law firm hypothetical on the\nsame basis by which defendants’ criminal purpose is imputed to the\nCity: that defendants, as City officials and leaders, had effective\ntitular and actual control over these municipal agencies. The same\npresumably cannot be said for the hypothetical Providence law firm.\n     9\n      The definitions of an enterprise in the RICO statute and the\njury instructions in no way require an enterprise to include\nnothing but criminal actors.      To the contrary, a legitimate\nbusiness, exploited by racketeers, may be an enterprise. It is\ntrue that members of an association-in-fact enterprise, such as is\nnow charged, must be connected by a common thread of purpose; and\none might often expect such a purpose to be of a criminal nature.\nSee Turkette, 452 U.S. at 578.      But the ultimate question is\nwhether an association-in-fact exists.      For this, it is not\nrequired that each participant have a separate mens rea so long as\neach can reasonably be said to share in the common purpose. The\nCity’s role here in the overall plans of the defendants suffices\nfor it be part of the association-in-fact enterprise.\n\n                                       -26-\n\fthat the Supreme Court has consistently instructed that we read the\n\noverall statute expansively.            See Turkette, 452 U.S. at 586-87;\n\nSedina, S.P.R.L., 473 U.S. at 497-98.             A liberal construal of the\n\nRICO statute and in particular, the term “enterprise,” leads us to\n\nthe conclusion that the enterprise, as charged, is supported by the\n\nevidence.\n\n              C.       Pattern of racketeering activity\n\n              Defendants     also   argue      that   there   was       insufficient\n\nevidence of a pattern of racketeering activity.                For purposes of a\n\nRICO conspiracy, the sufficiency questions boils down to whether a\n\njury could have found that the defendants intended to further an\n\nendeavor which, if completed, would have satisfied the “pattern”\n\nrequirement of RICO.         See Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52,\n\n61-66 (1997); United States v. Edwards, 303 F.3d 606, 642 (5th Cir.\n\n2002).   Here, the evidence shows that the endeavor resulted in a\n\nseries   of    completed     crimes.        Evidence    of    all       nine   schemes\n\nenumerated in the indictment, including the two that underlie\n\nCorrente’s         substantive   RICO   conviction,     shows       a    pattern    of\n\nracketeering activity.\n\n              Two or more RICO predicate acts form a “pattern” if they\n\nare (1) “related” and (2) “amount to or pose a threat of continued\n\ncriminal activity.”        H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492\n\nU.S. 229, 239 (1989); Systems Mgmt., Inc. v. Loiselle, 303 F.3d\n\n100, 105 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\f            Predicate acts are “related” for RICO purposes if they\n\n“have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims,\n\nor   methods    of    commission,     or    otherwise   are     interrelated    by\n\ndistinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.” H.J.,\n\nInc., 492 U.S. at 240 (quotation marks omitted).                We must bear in\n\nmind that “a criminal enterprise is more, not less, dangerous if it\n\nis versatile, flexible, diverse in its objectives and capabilities.\n\nVersatility, flexibility, and diversity are not inconsistent with\n\npattern.”      Masters, 924 F.2d at 1367.\n\n            The evidence shows that the defendants, and ultimately\n\nCianci, were the beneficiaries of most if not all of the nine\n\nschemes.     The jury could have concluded that the schemes were\n\ndesigned to line Cianci’s pockets as well as to maintain his\n\npolitical power in the City.          As for methods, most of the schemes\n\ninvolved either Cianci or Corrente calling or personally meeting\n\nwith city      officials    and    influencing      municipal   decision-making\n\neither through explicit or implicit orders.                   As the government\n\npoints out, important “sub-trends” underlay the schemes.                   The Jere\n\nRealty     Lease     and   the    Freitas   Lease    dealt    with   the    School\n\nDepartment.        The Tow List and Maggiacomo Job involved the Police\n\nDepartment.        The Ise and Maggiocomo Jobs both involved pawning of\n\nmunicipal jobs.        Both the Ronci Estate and Freitas Lots schemes\n\ninvolved extortions for tax abatements.                 All of the offenses\n\ninvolve trading jobs, contracts, and official acts for money,\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fcontributions to Cianci’s political fund, or other items of value.\n\nIn most of the schemes, the money was solicited by, paid to, or\n\ncollected by Corrente.\n\n              In addition, the schemes often shared the same players.\n\nCorrente, Ead, Pannone, and Autiello were all fundraisers for the\n\nFriends of Cianci.        Ead participated in the Ronci Estate, the Ise\n\nJob, and the Freitas Lots schemes, while Pannone played important\n\nroles in the Ronci Estate, the Freitas Lease, and Pay-to-Get-Paid\n\nschemes.       Autiello    was    the   chief    associate   in   the   Tow   List\n\nextortion and Maggiacomo Job sale.               Overall, the evidence shows\n\nthat the individual racketeering acts were not isolated events but\n\nrather parts of a pattern of racketeering activity contemplated and\n\ncommitted by an overarching RICO conspiracy to which all three\n\ndefendants, along with other co-conspirators, belonged.\n\n              “Continuity” of the pattern of racketeering may be shown\n\nby   either    “a   series   of    related      predicates   extending   over    a\n\nsubstantial period of time,” or a pattern of more limited duration\n\nwhere “the racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat\n\nof repetition extending indefinitely into the future” or “the\n\npredicate acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entity’s regular\n\nway of doing business.”          H.J., Inc., 492 U.S. at 242.\n\n              Defendants were accused of conducting a RICO conspiracy\n\nthat lasted nine years.          The Tow List scheme spanned approximately\n\nthe entire period.        During this time, Autiello regularly channeled\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\fcontributions to Corrente.    When towers contributed too much money\n\nunder the same name, the conspirators scrambled to find other straw\n\ncontributors, or “replacement” contributors.\n\n           The Jere Realty and Freitas Lots schemes both involved\n\nkickbacks to the defendants in exchange for pressure on the City to\n\ngrant   leases.   As   the   district   court   concluded,   “[I]t   was\n\nreasonable for the jury to infer that additional payments would be\n\nmade in order to renew the lease[s].”     The Pay-to-Get-Paid scheme\n\npresented the same danger: “[T]he City’s habitual tardiness in\n\npaying its vendors, and the period of time over which Freitas made\n\npayments to expedite payment of his invoices, provided ample\n\njustification for the jury to conclude that such payments would\n\ncontinue to be made in the future.”\n\n           Evidence concerning the Ise and Maggiocomo Jobs, both\n\ntranspiring in 1996, was enough for the jury to conclude that these\n\nbribes were part of the same, continuous pattern that jobs in the\n\nCity could be had for a price.     The Freitas Lots, Freitas Lease,\n\nand Freitas Invoices schemes revolved around deals with Anthony\n\nFreitas, whose testimony revealed an especially active stage of the\n\nconspiracy in and 1998 and 1999.\n\n           There is no need to go into more detail.      The evidence\n\nspeaks more than enough to the conclusion that the jury could have\n\nfound the requisite “pattern of racketeering activity” here.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f           D.         Conspiracy\n\n             Based on the same evidence, the jury could have found a\n\nconspiracy involving all three defendants.            We reiterate that RICO\n\nconspiracy     does   not   require   proof   that    a   defendant   “himself\n\ncommitted or agreed to commit the two predicate acts requisite for\n\na substantive RICO offense under § 1962(c).”              Salinas, 522 U.S. at\n\n61-66.    Rather, he “must intend to further an endeavor which, if\n\ncompleted, would satisfy all of the elements of a substantive\n\ncriminal offense, but it suffices that he adopt the goal of\n\nfurthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor.”               Id. at 65.   We\n\nhave noted that \"[t]he conspiratorial agreement need not be express\n\nso long as its existence can plausibly be inferred from the\n\ndefendants' words and actions and the interdependence of activities\n\nand persons involved.\" United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 241-\n\n42 (1st Cir. 1990).         The evidence, detailed above and throughout\n\nthis opinion, amply fills this requirement.\n\n           As for Cianci, Ead's testimony placed Cianci at the head\n\nof the Ronci Estate, Ise Job, and Freitas Lots schemes.                    Taped\n\nremarks   by    Corrente    implicated    Cianci     in   the   Freitas   Lease.\n\nCorrente's position as Cianci's Director of Administration is\n\nitself    circumstantial       evidence      of    Cianci's     conspiratorial\n\ninvolvement.\n\n             Corrente was implicated in at least five of the nine\n\nracketeering schemes.        He initiated the Tow List scheme and played\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fa major part in maintaining it throughout the duration of the\n\nconspiracy.      Corrente received cash payments as part of the Jere\n\nRealty, Ronci Estate, Freitas Lease, and Pay-to-Get-Paid schemes.\n\n            Testimony by Kenneth Rocha, the chairman of the towers'\n\nassociation, revealed that Autiello was the point person for towers\n\nwhen it came time to make contributions to Cianci's political fund.\n\nAutiello took in the payments and reminded towers when their\n\npayments were due.        As for Autiello's part in the Maggiocomo Job\n\nscheme, Mary Maggiacomo testified that she asked Autiello, who was\n\nin charge of maintenance of police cruisers, to help her son obtain\n\na job on the City force.         She delivered the $5,000 payment to him.\n\nWhen her son was ultimately denied admission into the police,\n\nAutiello refused to return the payment to Mrs. Maggiacomo.\n\n            E.      Special verdict\n\n            At the government's request, the district court submitted\n\nto the jury a special verdict form.               Under the substantive RICO\n\ncount   (Count      Two),       the     verdict    form    contained     special\n\ninterrogatories for each of the RICO predicates, listing them\n\nseparately for each defendant.            For each of the RICO predicates,\n\nthe form asked the jury to check off \"yes\" or \"no\" to indicate\n\nwhether the government had proven the predicate with respect to\n\neach defendant.     As to Cianci, the jury returned the verdict form\n\nwith “no”     checked     for   every    box   (except    one)    indicating   the\n\ngovernment    had   not    proven     those    racketeering      acts.   The   one\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\funchecked box was for Act Ten (University Club); we offer no\n\nopinion on why the jury decided to leave it blank.               For Corrente,\n\nthe jury checked off \"no\" for all racketeering acts except Act\n\nEight (Freitas Lease) and Act 9(a) (\"Pay-to-Get-Paid\"), for which\n\nthe jury checked off \"yes.\"          For Autiello, the jury checked off\n\n\"no\" for all racketeering acts except Act Twelve (Maggiacomo job),\n\nwhich the jury concluded the government had proven.                Ultimately,\n\nonly Corrente was convicted on Count Two, substantive RICO, and all\n\nthree defendants were found guilty on Count One, RICO conspiracy.\n\n            Defendants   argue   that       the   jury's   responses     to    the\n\ninterrogatories in the special verdict form under Count Two (the\n\nsubstantive RICO count) should bear on the verdict as to Count One\n\n(the RICO    conspiracy).     They     claim      that   the   jury's   negative\n\nresponses to these interrogatories indicate their rejection of the\n\nevidence proffered by the government for each of those offenses to\n\nwhich the jury responded \"no.\"          Defendants further contend that\n\ngiven the jury's specific findings, the evidence is insufficient to\n\nsupport the conspiracy verdict as a matter of law.              They postulate\n\nthat the specific purpose of the special verdict form is to limit\n\nthe facts found at trial for the purpose of assessing on appeal the\n\nsufficiency of the prevailing party's case.                Ordinarily, when a\n\njury returns a general verdict of guilty on a substantive RICO\n\ncount and one of the predicate acts is later found to be legally\n\ninsufficient   by   a    reviewing    court,      the    conviction     must   be\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\foverturned where it is impossible to determine whether two legally\n\nsufficient predicate acts support a RICO conviction.                    See United\n\nStates v. Holzer, 840 F.2d 1343, 1352 (7th Cir. 1988); United\n\nStates v. Kragness, 830 F.2d 842, 861 (8th Cir. 1987).\n\n           The special verdict form allows juries to specifically\n\nidentify the predicates for the general verdict.                   In United States\n\nv. Torres Lopez, 851 F.2d 520 (1st Cir. 1988), we reversed a\n\nsubstantive    RICO    conviction       where     the    jury's      responses   to\n\ninterrogatories on a special verdict form properly related to the\n\nsubstantive conviction revealed that the government proved only\n\ntime-barred predicates. The defendants in that case argued that as\n\nindicated by the special verdict, the jury found them guilty of\n\nonly two predicates.        When both of those predicates were shown to\n\nbe   outside   the     statute     of    limitations,         we   overturned    the\n\nsubstantive RICO conviction.             Other circuits have employed the\n\nspecial verdict form similarly.           See United States v. Edwards, 303\n\nF.3d 606 (5th Cir. 2002) (court used special verdict to uphold RICO\n\nconviction as being based on two valid predicates); United States\n\nv.   Kramer,   73    F.3d   1067   (11th       Cir.   1996)    (money   laundering\n\nconviction cannot stand where special verdict established defendant\n\ninvolvement in only foreign transactions).\n\n           The government counters that defendants' argument fails\n\nunder the doctrine articulated by the Supreme Court in Dunn v.\n\nUnited States, 284 U.S. 390 (1932) and United States v. Powell, 469\n\n\n                                        -34-\n\fU.S. 57 (1984).     In both cases, the Court held that acquittals on\n\ncertain counts of an indictment play no role in the analysis of\n\nwhether there is sufficient evidence supporting the surviving\n\ncounts.   Powell, 469 U.S. at 64-69; Dunn, 284 U.S. at 392-94; see\n\nalso United States v. Alicea, 205 F.3d 480 (1st Cir. 2000).                  The\n\nreasoning is that a jury's decision to acquit on a particular count\n\nor counts may well be the product of \"mistake, compromise, and\n\nlenity\" and \"a criminal defendant already is afforded protection\n\nagainst jury irrationality or error by the independent review of\n\nthe sufficiency     of   the   evidence   undertaken     by   the   trial     and\n\nappellate courts.\"10      Powell, 469 U.S. at 65-67.          The Court was\n\nconcerned with the impracticality of a rule that would allow\n\ndefendants   to    challenge    inconsistent    verdicts      where    such    a\n\nchallenge was speculative or would require inquiries into the\n\njury's deliberations.      See id. at 68.\n\n          The     defendants    claim   that   neither    Powell      nor   Dunn\n\nundermines the purpose and viability of special verdict forms in\n\ndefining the universe of resolved facts.        They assert that in this\n\ncase, we should exempt from our sufficiency review those pieces of\n\nevidence that have \"been conclusively contradicted[.]\" Chongris v.\n\nBd. of Appeals, 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir. 1987).              In reviewing a\n\n\n\n     10\n      This rationale applies more directly to defendants' other\nargument that the jury's acquittals on the substantive, non-RICO\ncounts should influence our review of the sufficiency of the\nevidence on the RICO conspiracy count.\n\n                                   -35-\n\fcriminal     conviction         for   sufficiency,      we     do   not   assess   the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses, \"which is the sole function of the\n\ntrier of fact.\"           Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 16 (1978);\n\nTorres Lopez, 851 F.2d at 527.\n\n             We have been steadfast with Powell and have repeatedly\n\nrefused to carve out exceptions to the rule.                        United States v.\n\nBucavalas, 909 F.2d 593, 595-97 (1st Cir. 1990) (adhering to Powell\n\nrule in affirming bribery conspiracy conviction of defendant, where\n\njury acquitted all of the charged conspirators except defendant);\n\nAlicea,    205     F.3d    at   484   (\"[I]n    a    single,    multi-count    trial,\n\nacquittal on one or more counts does not preclude conviction on\n\nother counts based upon the same evidence, as long as that evidence\n\nis legally sufficient to support a finding of guilt on the count(s)\n\nof conviction.\"); see also United States v. Richard, 234 F.3d 763,\n\n768 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Hernandez, 146 F.3d 30, 33\n\n(1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Crochiere, 129 F.3d 233, 239 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).\n\n             We are similarly hard pressed to make an exception here.\n\nThe RICO conspiracy count and substantive RICO count are separate.\n\nThe   list    of    racketeering        acts    to    which     the   jury   answered\n\ninterrogatories is part of the substantive RICO count only.                        The\n\ngovernment requested the form so that if the jury did convict on\n\nsubstantive RICO, the conviction would be buttressed by express\n\njury findings as to the two-predicate requirement.                           The jury\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\fappears to have understood the two-predicate requirement, in that\n\nit checked off two predicates (extortion conspiracies for the\n\nFreitas Lease and “Pay-to-Get-Paid” schemes) for Corrente, who was\n\nthe only defendant convicted on the substantive RICO count.               No\n\npredicates were checked off for Cianci, and only one (bribery\n\nconspiracy in connection with the Maggiacomo Job) was found proven\n\nfor Autiello; hence, neither was convicted of substantive RICO.\n\n             The \"separate-ness\" of the counts in the indictment,\n\nhowever, is not the central point of contention in this issue.\n\nPowell, 469 U.S. at 64.      Defendants concede that \"a person may be\n\nconvicted of RICO conspiracy and acquitted of all substantive\n\nacts.\"   (emphasis added).        If proof of the requisite criminal\n\nagreement exists, \"whether or not the substantive crime ensues\" is\n\nirrelevant.     Salinas, 522 U.S. at 65.       Hence, the jury did not go\n\nout-of-bounds by convicting on the RICO conspiracy count while\n\nconcluding    the   government   failed   to    prove   certain   predicate\n\nracketeering acts underlying the substantive RICO count.                 See\n\nUnited States v. Weiner, 3 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1993) (“[D]espite\n\nthe dismissal of the separate [substantive] counts, the jury was\n\nentitled to consider the evidence [underlying those substantive\n\ncounts] in support of the RICO counts”).\n\n             Most instructive is United States v. Connolly, 341 F.3d\n\n16 (1st Cir. 2003), where we upheld a substantive RICO and RICO\n\nconspiracy     conviction.       The   defendant    contended     that   the\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\fgovernment's failure to prove an “enterprise” was evidenced by the\n\njury’s finding that nine of fourteen racketeering acts listed in\n\nthe indictment had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSpecifically, the defendant argued that the evidence did not\n\nestablish    that    the    charged    enterprise   was    “continuous”   or\n\n“ongoing.”    We stated that\n\n            simply because the jury found a specified\n            racketeering act as “unproven beyond a\n            reasonable doubt” does not mean that the jury\n            found the evidence relating to that act\n            unpersuasive,   in  combination   with   other\n            evidence in the case, on the existence of an\n            association-in-fact enterprise.    Rather, it\n            may only mean that the government did not\n            prove a requisite element of the underlying\n            crime alleged as a racketeering act. . . . In\n            returning a finding of “unproven,” the jury\n            could have concluded that the evidence\n            underlying a [particular racketeering act],\n            while failing to [prove all the elements of\n            the crime committed by the act], nevertheless\n            demonstrated a corrupt gratuity evidencing the\n            existence of an illegal enterprise.\n\nId. at 26-27.     The evidence relating to those acts that were found\n\n“unproven” by the jury was still available to the jury in its\n\nevaluation of the overall RICO charge. “That being so, the inquiry\n\non appeal is whether the jury, in light of the totality of the\n\nevidence, was presented with sufficient evidence of “continuity” to\n\nsupport a conviction.”         Id. at 27.     The jury verdict may be a\n\ncompromise reflecting evil preparations by all three defendants but\n\nsome doubt about implementation by Cianci and Autiello.            In other\n\nwords,   though     the    evidence   might   not   have   shown   completed\n\n\n                                      -38-\n\fcommission of the racketeering acts, it could have led the jury to\n\nfind the requisites of a RICO conspiracy among the defendants to\n\ncommit the racketeering acts.\n\n            F.        Amendment and variance\n\n            Defendants claim that the district court was only able to\n\ndeny   their     dismissal        motions   by    constructively       amending    the\n\nindictment.      They point to the court's statement, in denying these\n\nmotions, that \"it seems to the Court that the indictment alleges\n\nthat what the Defendants are accused of doing is having conducted\n\nthe    affairs    of    the   City    through      a    pattern   of    racketeering\n\nactivity.\"       Defendants also claim that post-trial, the district\n\ncourt erroneously concluded that the indictment could have alleged\n\nthat the     City      was   an   innocent,      unwitting    participant     in   the\n\ncriminal enterprise.          This, defendants contend, conflicts with how\n\nthey understood the indictment--that the City was a culpable\n\nparticipant      in    the    RICO   enterprise--and         hence     constituted   a\n\nconstructive amendment of the indictment.\n\n             An amendment of the indictment occurs when the charging\n\nterms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect,\n\nby the prosecutor or the court after the grand jury has returned\n\nthe indictment. United States v. Dubon-Otero, 292 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).    Amending the indictment is considered prejudicial per se\n\nand thus demands reversal.            Id. at 4.        The government argues that\n\nregardless of the alleged disparity between the indictment and the\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\ftrial judge's characterization thereof, there was no constructive\n\namendment where the court instructed the jury \"on the theory as\n\ncharged.\"      Indeed, the court specifically instructed, without\n\nobjection from either party, that “the Government must prove that\n\nthe Defendant[s] knowingly and willfully joined the conspiracy with\n\nknowledge of its unlawful purpose and with the intent that the\n\npurpose would be accomplished.”\n\n            We find defendants’ claimed understanding of the illicit-\n\npurpose RICO enterprise charged in the indictment to be both\n\ninaccurate and disingenuous.      The indictment does not compel a\n\nreading that the City itself (or its constituent agencies) had to\n\nbe found criminally culpable, as we explain in more detail supra.\n\nDefendants allude to United States v. Weissman, 899 F.2d 1111, 1115\n\n(11th Cir. 1990), where the Eleventh Circuit held that the district\n\ncourt’s jury charge “in effect altered an essential element of the\n\ncrime charged” in the indictment.         Here, the charge was taken\n\nlargely from the indictment.     No intimations by the court recast\n\nthe “essential” elements of RICO outlined in the indictment. At no\n\npoint, pre-trial or post-trial, did the district court transform\n\nthe charged association-in-fact enterprise into a legal-purpose or\n\nlegal-entity    enterprise.     The     court’s   descriptions   of   the\n\nenterprise were in accord with the breadth of the enterprise\n\ncharged in the indictment and the breadth the Supreme Court has\n\nassigned to RICO overall.\n\n\n                                 -40-\n\f             Alternatively,       defendants   contend    that       disparities\n\nbetween the indictment and the evidence resulted in a prejudicial\n\nvariance.     “A variance arises when the proof at trial depicts a\n\nscenario that differs materially from the scenario limned in the\n\nindictment.”     United States v. Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d 1, 12\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).                  A variance\n\nrequires reversal only when it is “both material and prejudicial,\n\nfor example, if the variance works a substantial interference with\n\nthe defendant’s right to be informed of the charges laid at his\n\ndoorstep.”     Id.   (internal quotations marks omitted).\n\n             First, we reiterate that the jury’s acquittals on the\n\nsubstantive counts and negative decisions on the racketeering acts\n\nlisted under Count Two do not make the evidence underlying those\n\ncounts and acts irrelevant to the RICO conspiracy count.                 Second,\n\nwe repeat that the evidence as a whole, viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict, is sufficient as to the RICO conspiracy\n\nconvictions for all three defendants.            Accordingly, defendants’\n\nreliance on United States v. Morales, 185 F.3d 74 (2d Cir. 1999)\n\n(reversing    RICO    convictions     where    evidence   established      that\n\ndefendants    had    all   been   incarcerated   early    in   the    period   of\n\nracketeering activity alleged in the indictment), is misplaced.\n\nThe evidence at trial, covering acts that occurred from 1991 to\n\n1999 as charged in the indictment, tracked and satisfied the RICO\n\nelements and factual allegations contained in the indictment.\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\f          G.     “Associate” Liability\n\n          Autiello, and Corrente by adoption, argues that the\n\ncourt’s instructions on “associate” liability under RICO failed to\n\ncomply with the standard set out by the Supreme Court in Reves v.\n\nErnst & Young, 507 U.S. 170 (1993).        The Court in Reves created the\n\n“operation    management”   test   for    determining     RICO    “associate”\n\nliability.    In order to have taken part in, or associated with the\n\nconduct of an enterprise, an “associate” must have had some part in\n\ndirecting those affairs of the enterprise.              Id. at 177-78.       The\n\nCourt also stated that “an enterprise is operated not just by upper\n\nmanagement but also by lower-rung participants in the enterprise\n\nwho are under the direction of upper management.”           Id. at 184.      The\n\nCourt further elucidated:\n\n          Of course, the word “participate” makes clear\n          that RICO liability is not limited to those\n          with    primary   responsibility    for    the\n          enterprise’s affairs, just as the phrase\n          “directly or indirectly” makes clear that RICO\n          liability is not limited to those with a\n          formal position in the enterprise, but some\n          part in directing the enterprise’s affairs is\n          required. The “operation or management” test\n          expresses this requirement in a formulation\n          that is easy to apply.\n\nId. at 179.\n\n          Autiello and Corrente argue that the district court\n\n“watered down”    the   government’s      burden   of   proof    in   its   jury\n\n\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\finstruction on “associate” RICO liability.11                 Specifically, they\n\nclaim that the instructions permitted conviction for performing\n\nacts without control over some part of the “direction” of the\n\nenterprise.\n\n           We    find   no   merit      in     defendants’    objection.        The\n\ninstructions did not misstate the law; in fact, they reflected\n\nReves nearly verbatim.        Defendants argue that the buzz word on\n\n“associate”     liability    is   that       an   associate    \"direct\"    or   be\n\n“integral” to the affairs of the enterprise.                 The crucial words,\n\nhowever,   are    “operation      and     management,”       which   effectively\n\n\n     11\n      The court instructed, in relevant part:\n     “I told you that the Government has to prove that a Defendant\nis employed by or associated with an enterprise.       A person is\nconsidered to be associated with an enterprise if he or she\nknowingly participates directly or indirectly in the conduct of the\nenterprise’s affairs or business.\n     A person doesn’t have to have a formal relationship with or an\nofficial position in an enterprise in order to be associated with\nthat enterprise.\n     Association may include an informal relationship or agreement\nbetween a person and an enterprise.        A person also may be\nassociated with an enterprise even though his or her role is a\nrelatively minor role, just as the case with respect to conspiracy.\n. . . In order to establish that Defendant conducted or\nparticipated directly or indirectly in the conduct of an\nenterprise’s affairs, the Government must prove that the Defendant\nplayed some part in the operation or management of the enterprise.\n     Conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise’s\naffairs includes things like performing acts, function or duties\nwhich are related to the operation of the enterprise.           The\nGovernment doesn’t have to prove that a Defendant exercised\nsignificant control over or within the enterprise, and the\nGovernment doesn’t have to prove that the Defendant was an upper\nechelon member of the enterprise.\n     An enterprise is operated not only upper management but also\nby lower rung participants who work under the direction of the\nmanagers of the enterprise.”\n\n                                        -43-\n\fcommunicate to a jury that in order for a defendant to have been an\n\nassociate of the RICO enterprise, his participation needs to have\n\nhad “an element of direction” of the enterprise’s affairs.             Id. at\n\n178; United States v. Marino, 277 F.3d 11, 33 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 536 U.S. 948 (2002); United States v. Oreto, 37 F.3d 739,\n\n750 (1st Cir. 1994).       The court more than sufficiently accounted\n\nfor this requirement by instructing that the defendant must have\n\n“played   some     part   in   the   operation      or   management   of   the\n\nenterprise.”\n\n           In general, we have fashioned the Reves “operation or\n\nmanagement” test in accordance with the breadth with which we must\n\nconstrue RICO:\n\n           The requirement of association with the\n           enterprise is not strict.    The RICO net is\n           woven tightly to trap even the smallest fish,\n           those   peripherally    involved   with   the\n           enterprise.    The RICO statute seeks to\n           encompass people who are merely associated\n           with the enterprise. The defendant need only\n           be aware of at least the general existence of\n           the enterprise named in the indictment, and\n           know about its related activities.\n\nMarino, 277 F.3d at 33 (citations and internal quotations omitted).\n\nHence, as an evidentiary matter, the government presented more than\n\nenough to establish that, if there was an enterprise, the two, at\n\nvarious   times,    played     important    roles   in   the   direction   and\n\nsupervision of the enterprise’s operations.               Neither was merely\n\n“peripherally involved with the enterprise.”             The direct testimony\n\nof Kenneth Rocha demonstrated that not only was Autiello aware of\n\n                                     -44-\n\fthe general existence of the enterprise, but that he was central to\n\nfurthering    the    goals    of   the    enterprise,     specifically   as   the\n\ncollection agent for Corrente in obtaining payments from the Tow\n\nList members. His participation in the Maggiacomo Job scheme again\n\nevinced his awareness of the general enterprise as well as his\n\ndirect   involvement     in    the     direction    and    management    of   the\n\nenterprise.    As for Corrente, we need not rehash the evidence that\n\namply establishes his role in the enterprise.              The fact that he was\n\nCianci’s right-hand man, in addition to evidence specifically\n\nshowing his directorial or supervisory involvement in individual\n\nracketeering acts, puts him in the heartland of “associate” RICO\n\nliability as set out in Reves.\n\nII.      The Joint Federal Bribery Conspiracy Convictions (Corrente\n         and Autiello)\n\n            In relevant part, the federal bribery statute provides:\n\n                      (a) Whoever, if the circumstance\n                    described in subsection (b) of this\n                    section exists--\n\n                           (1) being an agent of an\n                    organization, or of a State, local,\n                    or Indian tribal government, or any\n                    agency thereof–\n\n                                   *      *     *\n\n                         (B)   corruptly  solicits   or\n                    demands for the benefit of any\n                    person, or accepts or agrees to\n                    accept, anything of value from any\n                    person, intending to be influenced\n                    or rewarded in connection with any\n                    business, transaction, or series of\n                    transactions of such organization,\n\n                                         -45-\n\f                government or agency involving any\n                thing of value of $5000 or more. . .\n\n                             *          *         *\n\n                shall be fined under this title,\n                imprisoned not more than 10 years,\n                or both.\n\n                 (b) The circumstance referred to in\n                subsection (a) of this section is\n                that the organization, government,\n                or agency receives, in any one year\n                period,   benefits   in  excess   of\n                $10,000 under a Federal program\n                involving    a   grant,    contract,\n                subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance,\n                or other form of Federal assistance.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(B).     Corrente and Autiello were convicted of\n\nconspiring to violate this statute, see 18 U.S.C. § 371, for their\n\nroles in the Tow List scheme.      The government's theory was that, in\n\nrequiring \"campaign contributions\" from those who wished to remain\n\non the police department's tow list, Corrente (in cahoots with\n\nAutiello, who acted as the towers' agent) acted as an \"agent\" of\n\nthe police department within the meaning of subsection (a)(1). The\n\ndepartment qualified as an \"agency\" under subsection (b) because it\n\nreceived an average of about $1 million in federal aid annually\n\n(and never less than $10,000) between 1991 and 1999.               A portion of\n\nthat aid (conferred in connection with a federal anti-domestic\n\nviolence   program)   was   used   in       and   around   1996   (1)   to   train\n\ndispatchers for the police unit that, among their other duties,\n\ncalled companies on the City's tow list when towing was needed, and\n\n\n\n                                   -46-\n\f(2) to purchase the communications and computer equipment used by\n\nthe dispatchers who made these calls.\n\n           Corrente and Autiello argue that their convictions cannot\n\nstand because there is insufficient evidence of a connection\n\nbetween their conduct and the federal funds received by the police\n\ndepartment.     The district court instructed the jury, without\n\nobjection, that such a connection is required. The court described\n\nthe connection (in relevant part) as follows: \"[T]he Government\n\nmust . . . prove that there is some connection between the alleged\n\nbribe and the federal funds received by the local government or\n\nagency . . . .\"     Corrente and Autiello contend that the \"federal\n\nfunds\" evidence described in the preceding paragraph is patently\n\ninadequate to ground a finding that such a connection existed in\n\nthis case.\n\n           The two concede that the statute itself does not require\n\nthat the offense conduct have an effect on the federal funds.        See\n\nSalinas, 522 U.S. at 61 (\"[A]s a matter of statutory construction,\n\n§ 666(a)(1)(B) does not require the Government to prove the bribe\n\nin question had any particular influence on federal funds . . . .\")\n\n(emphasis supplied).     They also acknowledge that, at the time of\n\noral argument, a post-Salinas circuit split had emerged over\n\nwhether,   as   a   statutory   and/or   constitutional   matter,   some\n\nconnection between the offense conduct and a federal interest (if\n\nnot federal funds themselves) was required.      Compare, e.g., United\n\n\n                                  -47-\n\fStates v. Zwick, 199 F.3d 672, 682-88 (3d Cir. 1999) (treating the\n\nstatute as having been enacted under the Spending Clause and\n\nholding,   in   part      because      the   Constitution     requires    that\n\n\"legislation regulating behavior of entities receiving federal\n\nfunds must . . . be based upon a federal interest in the particular\n\nconduct,\" (citing South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987)),\n\nthat the statute requires the government to prove that a federal\n\ninterest is implicated by the offense conduct), and United States\n\nv.   Santopietro,   166   F.3d   88,    92-93   (2d   Cir.   1999)   (similar,\n\nendorsing the post-Salinas vitality of prior Second Circuit law\n\ninterpreting the statute to require that the offense conduct\n\nthreaten the integrity and proper operation of a federal program),\n\nwith, e.g., United States v. Sabri, 326 F.3d 937, 940-53 (8th Cir.\n\n2003) (no connection between the offense conduct and a case-\n\nspecific federal interest is required by either the Constitution or\n\nthe statute, which was lawfully enacted under the Necessary and\n\nProper Clause and not the Spending Clause).\n\n           Unsurprisingly, Corrente and Autiello prefer the approach\n\nexemplified by Zwick and Santopietro.           They emphasize that Salinas\n\nexplicitly left open whether some connection between the offense\n\nconduct and a federal interest is required for the statute to be\n\nconstitutionally applied.        See 522 U.S. at 60-61 (declining to\n\ndecide the broader constitutional issue because the statute was\n\nconstitutionally applied on the case facts).                 They argue that\n\n\n                                    -48-\n\frequiring a connection such as the one identified in Zwick and\n\nSantopietro is necessary to maintain an appropriate state-federal\n\nbalance in a criminal law area that has been the traditional\n\nprovince of the states.\n\n           While these appeals were under advisement, the Supreme\n\nCourt granted a writ of certiorari in Sabri and resolved the\n\ncircuit split in favor of the position adopted by the Eighth\n\nCircuit.   See Sabri v. United States, 124 S. Ct. 1941, 1945-49\n\n(2004).    If error can be \"plain\" within the meaning of Fed. R.\n\nCrim.

Cianci was the\n\nMayor of Providence, Rhode Island; Frank E. Corrente was the City's\n\nDirector of Administration; Richard E. Autiello was a member of the\n\nProvidence           City   Towing   Association,     a    private    organization.\n\nBetween April 23 and June 24, 2002, the three were jointly tried on\n\na superseding indictment that charged them and others with forty-\n\nsix violations of federal statutes prohibiting public corruption.\n\nThe district court entered judgments of acquittal on eight of the\n\ncharges but submitted the rest to the jury.\n\n                On June 24, 2002, the jury returned a total of eight\n\nguilty verdicts but acquitted on the remaining thirty counts.                    All\n\nthree defendants were convicted on a single count charging a\n\nconspiracy to violate the RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\n\nOrganizations) statute.              See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).         Corrente and\n\nAutiello were convicted on a count charging a federal bribery\n\nconspiracy.           See 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 & 666(a)(1)(B).            Corrente was\n\nconvicted on a count charging a substantive RICO violation, see 18\n\nU.S.C.      §    1962(c),     two    counts     charging   Hobbs     Act   extortion\n\nconspiracies, see 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), and two counts charging\n\nHobbs Act attempted extortions, see id.               Autiello was convicted on\n\nan additional count charging a second federal bribery conspiracy.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 & 666(a)(1)(B).               The jury also answered \"YES\"\n\nto   four       of    thirty-seven    special    interrogatories,      which   asked\n\nwhether the government had \"proven\" the alleged predicate acts\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\funderlying        the     racketeering      counts;       all     other          special\n\ninterrogatories         were   answered   \"NO\"     or   not   answered      at    all.\n\n           The district court subsequently granted a judgment of\n\nacquittal on one of the extortion conspiracy charges of which\n\nCorrente had been convicted; ordered the forfeiture of $250,000 in\n\na campaign contribution fund controlled by Cianci and Corrente\n\npursuant     to    RICO's      forfeiture       provisions,     see    18   U.S.C.       §\n\n1963(a)(1); and sentenced the defendants to prison terms of sixty-\n\nfour months (Cianci), sixty-three months (Corrente), and forty-six\n\nmonths (Autiello).\n\n             Cianci, Corrente, and Autiello appeal their convictions\n\nand sentences, and Cianci and the government cross appeals the\n\ndistrict court's forfeiture ruling.                We begin with challenges to\n\ndefendants' RICO convictions.\n\nI.     The RICO Convictions (All Defendants)\n\n             A.         Indictment\n\n             Count One of the indictment charged Cianci, Autiello, and\n\nCorrente with conspiracy to operate the affairs of an enterprise\n\nconsisting of the defendants themselves, the City of Providence,\n\n\"various officers, agencies and entities of Providence\" including\n\nthirteen specified agencies, Jere Realty, and Friends of Cianci,\n\nand others \"known or unknown to the Grand Jury.\"                      The purpose of\n\nthe enterprise \"included the following: a. Enriching Defendant\n\nVincent A. Cianci . . . Friends of Cianci through extortion, mail\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\ffraud, bribery, money laundering, and witness tampering, and b.\n\nThrough the same means enriching, promoting and protecting the\n\npower and assets of the leaders and associates of the enterprise.\"\n\nIn   a       pre-trial   motion,   defendants   moved   to   dismiss   the   RICO\n\nallegations, asserting that the enterprise as charged was improper\n\nin that it was overly broad, vague, and legally impossible.1                  The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion. The issues raised by this motion\n\nwere revisited on motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new\n\ntrial.        The court denied these motions as well.\n\n                Defendants argue that the enterprise charged in the\n\nindictment was purposefully obscure and did not provide adequate\n\nnotice to defendants of the crimes for which they were charged and\n\nultimately convicted. The argument is couched in two ways: that 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1961(4) is unconstitutional as applied for failure to\n\nprovide “fair warning” of the alleged criminal conduct and that the\n\ncharged enterprise failed to provide adequate notice against which\n\nthe defendants could defend themselves.             The government counters\n\nthat, under the RICO statute, enterprise is defined broadly and\n\nthat defendants were sufficiently apprised of the nature and extent\n\nof the charges.\n\n                RICO makes it unlawful \"for any person employed by or\n\nassociated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of\n\n\n         1\n      We address this legal impossibility argument later in the\ncontext of whether sufficient evidence supported the charged RICO\nenterprise.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fwhich   affect,      interstate    or   foreign   commerce,     to   conduct    or\n\nparticipate,       directly   or   indirectly,    in   the    conduct    of   such\n\nenterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity[.]\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).          The statute also outlaws conspiracies to\n\nviolate § 1962(c).         See id. § 1962(d).     As stated above, Corrente\n\nwas convicted of a substantive violation of § 1962(c), and all\n\nthree defendants were convicted of RICO conspiracy under § 1962(d).\n\n              A     RICO    \"enterprise\"      \"includes       any    individual,\n\npartnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and\n\nany union or group of individuals associated in fact although not\n\na legal entity.\"           18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).

The enterprise charged in this case\n\nis of the latter, associated-in-fact variety.\n\n             Here, the superseding indictment delineated the members\n\nof the enterprise, the roles of the defendants in the enterprise,\n\nthe purposes and goals of the racket, and the ways in which the\n\ndefendants used other members of the enterprise--specifically,\n\nmunicipal entities that they controlled as part of the conspiracy--\n\nto further those purposes and goals.              It alleged that defendants\n\nconspired to violate and did in fact violate RICO through their\n\ninvolvement     in    an    associated-in-fact      enterprise     devoted       to\n\nenriching and empowering defendants and others through unlawful\n\nmeans.     The enterprise was alleged to have been comprised of the\n\nindividual defendants; the City of Providence \"including, but not\n\nlimited to\" many of its departments, offices, and agencies; the\n\ncampaign contribution fund controlled by Cianci and Corrente; and\n\nothers known and unknown to the grand jury.

This enterprise was\n\nalleged to have existed \"from in or about January 1991 through in\n\nor about December 1999.\"\n\n          The balance of the indictment (again, in the redacted\n\nform in which it went to the jury) also detailed the \"pattern of\n\nracketeering activity\" underlying the grand jury's RICO and RICO\n\nconspiracy    allegations.    The   unlawful   conduct   comprising   the\n\nalleged pattern was set forth in a section detailing the predicate\n\nRICO \"Racketeering Acts\" and in separate offense counts.              The\n\npattern was itself subdivided into nine alleged schemes:\n\n             1.   A scheme, carried out between 1991 and\n             late 1999, in which Corrente (with Autiello\n             serving   as  his   intermediary)  pressured\n             companies with whom the Providence Police\n             Department contracted for towing services to\n             make campaign contributions totaling some\n             $250,000 to Friends of Cianci in order to\n             remain on the tow list (\"the Tow List\n             scheme\");\n\n             2.   A scheme, carried out between 1991 and\n             1998, in which the owner of Jere Realty, a\n             local real estate company, was alleged to have\n             paid bribes and kickbacks which made their way\n\n                                    -8-\n\fto Corrente in order to secure a Providence\nSchool Department lease for one of the\ncompany's Providence buildings (\"the Jere\nLease scheme\");\n\n3. A 1998 scheme in which Cianci was alleged\nto have been involved in extorting a $10,000\ncontribution from the estate of Fernando Ronci\n(which owed the City some $500,000 in back\ntaxes) in exchange for his support in the\nestate's efforts to secure a tax abatement\nfrom the corrupt Board of Tax Assessment\nReview, which was chaired by co-conspirator\nJoseph Pannone and vice-chaired by co-\nconspirator David Ead (\"the Ronci Estate\nscheme\");\n\n4.   A 1996-97 scheme in which Cianci was\nalleged to have arranged for Christopher Ise\nto obtain a job in the City's Department of\nPlanning and Development in return for a\n$5,000 contribution (\"the Ise Job scheme\");\n\n5. A 1999 scheme in which Cianci was alleged\nto have supported the contemplated sale of two\nCity lots to a City vendor, Anthony Freitas,\nin return for a $10,000 contribution (\"the\nFreitas Lots scheme\");\n\n6.   A 1998-99 scheme in which Corrente was\nalleged to have attempted to influence the\nProvidence School Department to encourage a\ncity contractor entitled to reimbursement from\nthe City for its lease expenses to lease a\nbuilding owned by Anthony Freitas in return\nfor   contributions  totaling   $2,000   (\"the\nFreitas Lease scheme\");\n\n7.   A 1998 scheme in which Corrente, acting\nthrough Joseph Pannone, was alleged to have\nfacilitated   prompt   payments  of invoices\nsubmitted to the City by a business owned by\nAnthony Freitas in return for contributions\ntotaling   $1,100    (\"the  Freitas Invoices\nscheme\");\n\n8. A 1998 scheme in which Cianci was alleged\n(a) to have attempted to influence the City's\n\n                     -9-\n\f           Building Board of Review to deny a request for\n           construction variances made by the private\n           University Club in retaliation for the Club's\n           having refused to admit him as a member back\n           in the 1970s and its continuing refusal to\n           admit him, and (b) to have extorted a free\n           honorary membership from the Club as the\n           construction variance dispute was unfolding\n           (\"the University Club scheme\"); and\n\n           9. A 1996 scheme in which Autiello conspired\n           with an unnamed public official to facilitate\n           the   hiring  of   Joseph   Maggiacomo  as   a\n           Providence police officer in return for a\n           $5,000 cash contribution by Joseph's mother,\n           Mary Maggiacomo (\"the Maggiacomo Job scheme\").\n\n           \"[A]n indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the\n\nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendants of\n\nthe charge against which he must defend, and, second, enables him\n\nto plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions\n\nfor the same offense.\"   Hamling v.

Hence, we conclude that defendants\n\nwere more than sufficiently apprised of the charges.\n\n                                -10-\n\f           B.      Enterprise\n\n           The defendants also argue that their RICO convictions\n\ncannot stand because there was insufficient evidence to ground the\n\njury's foundational finding that the government had proved the\n\nexistence of the RICO \"enterprise\" that the government charged.2\n\nWe begin our analysis by summarizing the relevant legal principles\n\nand the government's RICO theory and proof.\n\n           In cases involving an alleged associated-in-fact RICO\n\nenterprise, the existence of the charged enterprise does not\n\nfollow,   ipso   facto,   from   evidence   that   those   named   as   the\n\nenterprise's associates engaged in crimes that collectively may be\n\ncharacterized as a \"pattern of racketeering activity\":\n\n           While the proof used to establish these\n           separate elements [i.e., the \"enterprise\" and\n           the \"pattern of racketeering activity\"] may in\n           particular cases coalesce, proof of one does\n           not necessarily establish the other.       The\n           \"enterprise\"   is    not   the   \"pattern   of\n           racketeering activity\"; it is an entity\n           separate and apart from the pattern of\n           activity in which it engages. The existence\n           of an enterprise at all times remains a\n           separate element which must be proved by the\n           Government.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The indictment and the jury instructions required that the\ngovernment prove the same enterprise, described below, in order to\nsecure convictions on both the substantive RICO count and the RICO\nconspiracy count. The analysis that follows therefore applies with\nequal force to the substantive RICO conviction returned against\nCorrente and to the RICO conspiracy convictions returned against\nCianci, Corrente, and Autiello.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fTurkette, 452 U.S. at 583.     In other words, criminal actors who\n\njointly engage in criminal conduct that amounts to a pattern of\n\n\"racketeering activity\" do not automatically thereby constitute an\n\nassociation-in-fact RICO enterprise simply by virtue of having\n\nengaged in the joint conduct.

It   is\n\nuncontroversial that corporate entities, including municipal and\n\ncounty   ones,   can   be   included   within     association-in-fact    RICO\n\nenterprises. See, e.g., London, 66 F.3d at 1244; Masters, 924 F.2d\n\nat 1366.   It is also beyond dispute, as the Supreme Court held in\n\nTurkette, that “the term ‘enterprise’ as used in RICO encompasses\n\nboth legitimate and illegitimate enterprises.”              452 U.S. at 578.\n\nAs the D.C.

A RICO\n\nenterprise animated by an illicit common purpose can be comprised\n\nof an association-in-fact of municipal entities and human members\n\nwhen the latter exploits the former to carry out that purpose.\n\nCianci, Corrente, and Autiello – those who wielded influence,\n\nexerted pressure, and effectively controlled the City’s various\n\ncomponents    –   are   the   criminals      here.

In\n\neach of these cases, the groupings of individuals and corporate or\n\nmunicipal entities were sufficiently organized and devoted to the\n\nalleged illicit purposes that the resulting whole functioned as a\n\ncontinuing unit.   The common purpose was dictated by individuals\n\nwho controlled the corporate or municipal entities’ activities and\n\nmanipulated them to the desired illicit ends.\n\n          The indictment and jury instructions are consistent with\n\nthis framing of the enterprise.   The district court instructed the\n\njury, without objection from either party, that “the Government\n\nmust prove that the alleged enterprise had an ongoing organization,\n\nwhether it be formal or informal, and that its various associates\n\nfunctioned together as a continuing unit to achieve common goals.”\n\nThe court continued, “It is not necessary in proving the existence\n\nof an enterprise to show that each member of the enterprise\n\nparticipated in or even knew of all of its activities, but it is\n\nnecessary to show that all members of the alleged enterprise shared\n\na common purpose.”   Requiring the government to prove that all\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fmembers   named   in   the   enterprise   shared   a   common   purpose   of\n\nillegality did not compel the government to show that the City\n\nitself had the mens rea to seek bribes and to extort.            The Ninth\n\nand Sixth Circuits articulated what in some sense is the obvious:\n\nthat a corporate or municipal entity does not have a mind of its\n\nown for purposes of RICO.      Lancaster Comm. Hosp., 940 F.2d at 404;\n\nThompson, 685 F.2d at 1001.      Unlawful common purpose is imputed to\n\nthe City by way of the individual defendants’ control, influence,\n\nand manipulation of the City for their illicit ends.            Whether the\n\ndefendants did exercise sufficient control over the City for\n\npurposes of the enterprise is one of fact for the jury and\n\nevidentiary sufficiency.\n\n           It follows that the defendants also have an evidence-\n\nbased argument.    They contend that their RICO convictions must be\n\nreversed because the evidence introduced at trial in support of the\n\nalleged schemes set forth above -- the only proof from which the\n\njury might have inferred that the schemes were carried out, or were\n\nintended to be carried out, by means of a RICO enterprise, see\n\nTurkette, 452 U.S. at 583 (observing that proof of the pattern of\n\nracketeering activity may in particular cases also constitute the\n\nproof of the enterprise itself) -- was insufficient to ground a\n\nfinding that the schemes were conducted through the specific entity\n\nalleged in the indictment to have constituted a RICO enterprise.\n\nDefendants base this argument on an assertion that there was no\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fevidence from which the jury might have inferred a shared purpose\n\nbetween defendants and the municipal entities named as associates\n\nof the enterprise and through which many of the schemes were\n\nconducted.     In support of this argument, the defendants point to\n\nspecific statements           by    the   district   court   that       \"there    is   no\n\nevidence that the [City] departments and/or agencies, themselves,\n\nshared [the enterprise's] purposes,\" United States v.

The defendants also emphasize that, even if we\n\nwere to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the\n\nRICO convictions by construing the entire record in the light most\n\nfavorable to the government, the evidence is insufficient.\n\n               As set forth above, we have identified Turkette's\n\n“ongoing organization,” “continuing unit,” and \"common purpose\"\n\nrequirements as the principal tools a factfinder should use to\n\ndistinguish     a      RICO        enterprise    from   an    ad        hoc   criminal\n\nconfederation.       We have applied these requirements to unlawful\n\npurpose associations-in-fact involving corporate legal entities.\n\nSee London, 66 F.3d at 1243-45.             The district court adequately set\n\nout these requirements to the jury; hence, we see no basis for\n\ndisregarding     the    court’s        instructions     in   the    course       of    our\n\nsufficiency review.           See, e.g., United States v. Zanghi, 189 F.3d\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f71, 79-80 (1st Cir. 1999) (an unchallenged jury instruction that is\n\nfaithful    to    the    indictment   and       \"not    patently        incorrect     or\n\ninternally inconsistent\" becomes the standard by which evidentiary\n\nsufficiency is to be measured) (citing United States v.

Cir. 1992)).\n\n            After careful scrutiny of the record and setting the\n\nevidence against the jury instructions, we conclude that the jury\n\ncould have found the above requirements, specifically that the\n\ndefendants and others named as enterprise members comprised an\n\nongoing organization that functioned as a continuing unit and was\n\nanimated by common purposes or goals.\n\n            We agree with the government's assertion that the jury's\n\nenterprise finding is sustainable because there was sufficient\n\nevidence that Cianci and Corrente exercised substantial control\n\nover the municipal entities named as members of the enterprise.\n\nCianci     was    the    City's    mayor     and       Corrente     its    chief      of\n\nadministration.         They were alleged and were shown to have used\n\ntheir positions         and   influence    to   sell     municipal      favors   on    a\n\ncontinuing basis.        The evidence indicates a close relationship \"in\n\nfact\" among them, the City they managed, and Cianci's political\n\norganization. Cianci, as mayor, and Corrente and Autiello, as city\n\nofficials,       were   strongly    connected      to     and     had    considerable\n\ninfluence over the various City employees and departments.                       Their\n\nillegal schemes could function only with the cooperation, witting\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\for unwitting, of certain City agencies and officials.              Insofar as\n\nCianci's and the other defendants' criminal schemes were or would\n\nbe carried out by themselves and others acting in their municipal\n\nroles, the City--if only to that extent--did share in the same\n\ncommon criminal purpose.3           The defendants were not only human\n\nmembers of the enterprise, but were the City’s official leaders\n\nwith       considerable   express   and     implicit   authority   over   its\n\ndepartments and employees.           Moreover, the enterprise’s corrupt\n\npurposes were aimed at exploiting the City’s resources.                It is\n\nbecause of this control and these close connections that the jury\n\ncould have imputed the enterprise's common purpose to the City.\n\nSee Masters, 924 F.2d at 1366 (“Surely if three individuals can\n\n\n\n       3\n      The evidence depicted a behavioral spectrum ranging from\ninnocent cooperation to willful complicity in unlawful conduct.\nFor example, with respect to the Freitas Invoices scheme, the\nevidence was merely that an employee within the City's Finance\nDepartment (Lorraine Lisi), acting at Corrente's request, paid\nvalid invoices more promptly than usual. Similarly, with respect\nto the Ise Job scheme, the evidence was merely that the Deputy\nDirector of the Department of Planning and Development (Thomas\nDeller) created a temporary position for Ise within the department\nat Cianci's request. At the more culpable end of the spectrum,\nhowever, there was evidence that, in connection with the Jere Lease\nscheme, the head of the Department of Public Property (Alan Sepe)\nand the Director of Business Relations for the School Department\n(Mark Dunham) were influenced by Corrente to tailor the\nspecifications in a School Department lease bid to fit the\ndimensions of Jere Realty's building, and then to support the Jere\nRealty lease before the Board of Contract and Supply (which was the\nentity formally empowered to accept or reject bids of City\ncontracts).    Similarly, in connection with the Freitas Lease\nscheme, there was evidence that Corrente again contacted Dunham\nprior to finalization of the lease and influenced him to drop\nconsideration of an alternative lease.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fconstitute a RICO enterprise, . . ., then the larger association\n\nthat consists of them plus entities that they control can be a RICO\n\nenterprise too.”).\n\n             Evidence of defendants’ control, both titular and actual,\n\nwas sufficient to deem the enterprise a “continuing unit” and\n\n“ongoing organization.”         The jury could easily glean from taped\n\nconversations and the trial testimony of David Ead –- a co-\n\nconspirator and vice-chair of the Board of Tax Assessment Review –-\n\nthat there existed an organized structure with Cianci at the top,\n\nCorrente     as   a   middle   man   facilitating   and   often   initiating\n\ntransactions, and others, including Autiello, Ead, and Pannone,\n\nthat fed deals into the organization (or in Ead’s case, sometimes\n\ntried to replace Corrente as the middle man).               The defendants\n\nattempted to use, to varying degrees of success, various municipal\n\nagencies in committing a series of related bribes and extortions.\n\nThese agencies were used in this manner on an ongoing basis from\n\n1991 through 1999.       The fact that other persons and entities were\n\nused in some transactions but not in others does not matter; the\n\njury instructions reflected this flexibility.4\n\n\n     4\n         The court instructed, in relevant part:\n\n     “An enterprise may exist even though individual members come\nand go as long as it continues in an essentially unchanged form\nduring substantially the entire period alleged in the indictment,\n. . . .”\n\n     “It is not necessary in proving the existence of an enterprise\nto show that each member of the enterprise participated in or even\n\n                                      -21-\n\f          There was detailed evidence, moreover, placing Cianci,\n\nthe City’s mayor, in the middle of at least four of the enumerated\n\nracketeering acts.   With regard to the Ronci Estate scheme, David\n\nEad testified at trial that he suggested to Ronci’s attorney that\n\nthe estate settle its tax claim with the City for $100,000 in\n\nexchange for a $10,000 contribution to the Friends of Cianci.    Ead\n\nmet with Cianci and discussed the proposed deal.    The settlement\n\nwas approved by the City’s Board of Tax Assessment Review.       Ead\n\ntestified that shortly thereafter, he was contacted by Corrente,\n\nwho told him that Cianci wanted Corrente to collect the money.   Ead\n\nresponded that he was waiting for the Ronci attorney, to which\n\nCorrente replied, “Well you know that the Mayor he’s on my back –\n\ndo your best.”   After receiving the money from Ronci’s attorney,\n\nEad brought the money to Corrente who put his finger on his lips\n\nand took the envelope. A tape-recorded conversation between Joseph\n\nPannone and Anthony Freitas provided additional evidence.5       Our\n\ndissenting brother recognizes that there was enough evidence for\n\n\n\n\nknew of all of its activities, . . . .”\n\n     “. . . a Defendant need not have been associated with an\nenterprise for the entire time that the enterprise existed in order\nto have been associated with the enterprise, but a Defendant must\nshare some common goal or objective of the enterprise in order to\nbe a member.”\n     5\n      Pannone said to Freitas, “Ead took care of the Mayor, don’t\nknow what he gave the Mayor . . . He took care of me, too. He\npushed the Ronci settlement through.”\n\n                               -22-\n\fthe jury to conclude that defendants functionally controlled the\n\nBoard of Tax Assessment Review, often for criminal purposes.\n\n           With regard to the Ise Job, Ead again testified that he\n\nserved as a middleman for Mayor Cianci, this time arranging a\n\n$5,000 bribe in exchange for a municipal job.            According to Ead,\n\nCianci asked during their conversation about Ise, cautious about\n\nwhether “he’s alright” and looking for assurances that “he’s not\n\ngoing to say nothing.” Upon learning that the City’s Department of\n\nPlanning and Development had no positions available, Cianci ordered\n\nthe   Department   to   “make    one.”       Upon   receiving    the    $5,000\n\n“contribution,” Cianci told Ead, “Don’t get nervous.”\n\n           In their trial testimony, which closely tracked taped\n\nconversations among Freitas, Pannone, and other City officials,\n\nboth Freitas and Ead implicated Cianci in the Freitas Lots scheme,\n\nin which Cianci pressured the Providence Redevelopment Authority,\n\nthe entity empowered to sell the lots, to expedite the sale of two\n\nCity-owned lots to Freitas in exchange for a $10,000 “contribution”\n\nby Freitas to the Cianci political fund.            Finally, with regard to\n\nthe Tow List scheme, Dorothy Deveraux –- Corrente’s assistant and\n\nthe   Friends’   bookkeeper     –-   wrote   a   note   to   Corrente    which\n\nimplicated all three defendants in that scheme.6                Moreover, as\n\n\n      6\n      Deveraux’s note supported the prosecution theory that when\ntowers occasionally “contributed” too much money under the same\nname, the defendants arranged for “replacement” checks to be made\nby third-party straw contributors.     The note read, “FRANK –\nattached are two over checks – Please sign and Dick Autiello will\n\n                                     -23-\n\fJudge Howard concedes, the jury could have found, based primarily\n\non taped statements and the trial testimony of towing association\n\nchairman Kenneth Rocha, that Corrente effectively controlled who\n\nmade it onto the police department’s tow list.\n\n           We recognize that the defendants did not always get their\n\nway with municipal departments and employees.7          But the fact that\n\nsome racketeering schemes did not go as planned, and that certain\n\nelements within the City may not have completely complied with the\n\ndefendants’ wishes, does not defeat the integrity of the charged\n\nenterprise.     The jury could have concluded that these glitches in\n\nthe   schemes   only   meant   that    certain   substantive   crimes   went\n\nuncompleted and that otherwise, defendants possessed and exercised\n\nconsiderable control over crucial elements of the City.                  The\n\nevidence amply establishes a close relationship between defendants\n\nand the City in which they exercised their leadership roles.             The\n\n\nbe by today to replace with new checks – I need your help with the\nother people – these overages total $3,420.00. I know the Mayor\ndoes not want to part with that – without money being replaced.\nPlease assign someone to talk to these people.”\n      7\n      For example, in connection with the Freitas Lots scheme,\nCianci was displeased that elements within the Providence\nRedevelopment Agency did not sufficiently accede to his wishes,\nspecifically when the PRA sold one of the “Freitas lots” before\nCianci had a chance to finalize a deal with Freitas. In connection\nwith the University Club scheme, Cianci was displeased when members\nof the Providence Building Board of Review ignored his wishes and\ngranted the club some of the variances that it sought. Finally, in\nconnection with the Maggiacomo Job scheme, the Chief of Police\ndeclined to admit Maggiacomo to the police academy because he had\na criminal history and had been untruthful during a screening\ninterview.\n\n                                      -24-\n\fenterprise and the conspiracy still thrived and the defendants were\n\nable to complete other schemes through their abuse of the municipal\n\napparatus.\n\n           Defendants attempt to expose what they deem an error by\n\nthe government in charging an overly broad enterprise that places\n\na criminal onus on a largely innocent City.                 They warn that an\n\nenterprise   such    as    that   charged   here   implicates     non-culpable\n\nmunicipal parties in associations which they had little or no idea\n\nwere engaged in illicit activities.           But this fear is misplaced.\n\nHere, as long as elements within the City, such as the police chief\n\nand   members   of   the    Building   Review      Board    and   Redevelopment\n\nAgencies, in fact did not actively share in the defendants' illegal\n\npurposes, we see no reason why we run into now-Justice Breyer’s\n\nadmonition in Ryan: that of failing to differentiate between\n\nassociations that fall within the sweep of RICO and associations\n\ninvolving only the exploitation of others by criminals.                See 901\n\nF.2d at 180-81 (emphasizing the need to limit \"the potentially\n\nboundless scope of the word 'enterprise' so as to distinguish\n\nculpable from    non-culpable       associations,     and    recognizing   \"the\n\nserious consequences for any man or woman, state official or\n\nprivate person, who is publicly accused of racketeering\"); see\n\nalso Fitzgerald v.

In the present litigation, the City was\n\nnamed a member of the charged enterprise, not a defendant.               The\n\nCity “shared” in the enterprise’s purpose only to the extent of the\n\ndefendants’ considerable influence and control over the relevant\n\nmunicipal agencies, and to the extent of those officials and\n\ndepartments who were wittingly or unwittingly involved in the\n\nvarious schemes.     Being named in the enterprise does not make the\n\nCity itself criminally or civilly liable under RICO.9               It bears\n\nrepeating that the RICO statute defines “enterprise” broadly and\n\n\n     8\n      We distinguish Judge Howard’s law firm hypothetical on the\nsame basis by which defendants’ criminal purpose is imputed to the\nCity: that defendants, as City officials and leaders, had effective\ntitular and actual control over these municipal agencies. The same\npresumably cannot be said for the hypothetical Providence law firm.\n     9\n      The definitions of an enterprise in the RICO statute and the\njury instructions in no way require an enterprise to include\nnothing but criminal actors.      To the contrary, a legitimate\nbusiness, exploited by racketeers, may be an enterprise. It is\ntrue that members of an association-in-fact enterprise, such as is\nnow charged, must be connected by a common thread of purpose; and\none might often expect such a purpose to be of a criminal nature.\nSee Turkette, 452 U.S. at 578.      But the ultimate question is\nwhether an association-in-fact exists.      For this, it is not\nrequired that each participant have a separate mens rea so long as\neach can reasonably be said to share in the common purpose. The\nCity’s role here in the overall plans of the defendants suffices\nfor it be part of the association-in-fact enterprise.\n\n                                       -26-\n\fthat the Supreme Court has consistently instructed that we read the\n\noverall statute expansively.            See Turkette, 452 U.S. at 586-87;\n\nSedina, S.P.R.L., 473 U.S. at 497-98.             A liberal construal of the\n\nRICO statute and in particular, the term “enterprise,” leads us to\n\nthe conclusion that the enterprise, as charged, is supported by the\n\nevidence.\n\n              C.       Pattern of racketeering activity\n\n              Defendants     also   argue      that   there   was       insufficient\n\nevidence of a pattern of racketeering activity.                For purposes of a\n\nRICO conspiracy, the sufficiency questions boils down to whether a\n\njury could have found that the defendants intended to further an\n\nendeavor which, if completed, would have satisfied the “pattern”\n\nrequirement of RICO.

We must bear in\n\nmind that “a criminal enterprise is more, not less, dangerous if it\n\nis versatile, flexible, diverse in its objectives and capabilities.\n\nVersatility, flexibility, and diversity are not inconsistent with\n\npattern.”      Masters, 924 F.2d at 1367.\n\n            The evidence shows that the defendants, and ultimately\n\nCianci, were the beneficiaries of most if not all of the nine\n\nschemes.     The jury could have concluded that the schemes were\n\ndesigned to line Cianci’s pockets as well as to maintain his\n\npolitical power in the City.          As for methods, most of the schemes\n\ninvolved either Cianci or Corrente calling or personally meeting\n\nwith city      officials    and    influencing      municipal   decision-making\n\neither through explicit or implicit orders.                   As the government\n\npoints out, important “sub-trends” underlay the schemes.                   The Jere\n\nRealty     Lease     and   the    Freitas   Lease    dealt    with   the    School\n\nDepartment.        The Tow List and Maggiacomo Job involved the Police\n\nDepartment.        The Ise and Maggiocomo Jobs both involved pawning of\n\nmunicipal jobs.        Both the Ronci Estate and Freitas Lots schemes\n\ninvolved extortions for tax abatements.                 All of the offenses\n\ninvolve trading jobs, contracts, and official acts for money,\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fcontributions to Cianci’s political fund, or other items of value.\n\nIn most of the schemes, the money was solicited by, paid to, or\n\ncollected by Corrente.\n\n              In addition, the schemes often shared the same players.\n\nCorrente, Ead, Pannone, and Autiello were all fundraisers for the\n\nFriends of Cianci.        Ead participated in the Ronci Estate, the Ise\n\nJob, and the Freitas Lots schemes, while Pannone played important\n\nroles in the Ronci Estate, the Freitas Lease, and Pay-to-Get-Paid\n\nschemes.       Autiello    was    the   chief    associate   in   the   Tow   List\n\nextortion and Maggiacomo Job sale.               Overall, the evidence shows\n\nthat the individual racketeering acts were not isolated events but\n\nrather parts of a pattern of racketeering activity contemplated and\n\ncommitted by an overarching RICO conspiracy to which all three\n\ndefendants, along with other co-conspirators, belonged.\n\n              “Continuity” of the pattern of racketeering may be shown\n\nby   either    “a   series   of    related      predicates   extending   over    a\n\nsubstantial period of time,” or a pattern of more limited duration\n\nwhere “the racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat\n\nof repetition extending indefinitely into the future” or “the\n\npredicate acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entity’s regular\n\nway of doing business.”          H.J., Inc., 492 U.S. at 242.\n\n              Defendants were accused of conducting a RICO conspiracy\n\nthat lasted nine years.          The Tow List scheme spanned approximately\n\nthe entire period.        During this time, Autiello regularly channeled\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\fcontributions to Corrente.    When towers contributed too much money\n\nunder the same name, the conspirators scrambled to find other straw\n\ncontributors, or “replacement” contributors.\n\n           The Jere Realty and Freitas Lots schemes both involved\n\nkickbacks to the defendants in exchange for pressure on the City to\n\ngrant   leases.   As   the   district   court   concluded,   “[I]t   was\n\nreasonable for the jury to infer that additional payments would be\n\nmade in order to renew the lease[s].”     The Pay-to-Get-Paid scheme\n\npresented the same danger: “[T]he City’s habitual tardiness in\n\npaying its vendors, and the period of time over which Freitas made\n\npayments to expedite payment of his invoices, provided ample\n\njustification for the jury to conclude that such payments would\n\ncontinue to be made in the future.”\n\n           Evidence concerning the Ise and Maggiocomo Jobs, both\n\ntranspiring in 1996, was enough for the jury to conclude that these\n\nbribes were part of the same, continuous pattern that jobs in the\n\nCity could be had for a price.     The Freitas Lots, Freitas Lease,\n\nand Freitas Invoices schemes revolved around deals with Anthony\n\nFreitas, whose testimony revealed an especially active stage of the\n\nconspiracy in and 1998 and 1999.\n\n           There is no need to go into more detail.      The evidence\n\nspeaks more than enough to the conclusion that the jury could have\n\nfound the requisite “pattern of racketeering activity” here.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f           D.         Conspiracy\n\n             Based on the same evidence, the jury could have found a\n\nconspiracy involving all three defendants.            We reiterate that RICO\n\nconspiracy     does   not   require   proof   that    a   defendant   “himself\n\ncommitted or agreed to commit the two predicate acts requisite for\n\na substantive RICO offense under § 1962(c).”              Salinas, 522 U.S. at\n\n61-66.    Rather, he “must intend to further an endeavor which, if\n\ncompleted, would satisfy all of the elements of a substantive\n\ncriminal offense, but it suffices that he adopt the goal of\n\nfurthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor.”               Id. at 65.   We\n\nhave noted that \"[t]he conspiratorial agreement need not be express\n\nso long as its existence can plausibly be inferred from the\n\ndefendants' words and actions and the interdependence of activities\n\nand persons involved.\" United States v.

The evidence, detailed above and throughout\n\nthis opinion, amply fills this requirement.\n\n           As for Cianci, Ead's testimony placed Cianci at the head\n\nof the Ronci Estate, Ise Job, and Freitas Lots schemes.                    Taped\n\nremarks   by    Corrente    implicated    Cianci     in   the   Freitas   Lease.\n\nCorrente's position as Cianci's Director of Administration is\n\nitself    circumstantial       evidence      of    Cianci's     conspiratorial\n\ninvolvement.\n\n             Corrente was implicated in at least five of the nine\n\nracketeering schemes.        He initiated the Tow List scheme and played\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fa major part in maintaining it throughout the duration of the\n\nconspiracy.      Corrente received cash payments as part of the Jere\n\nRealty, Ronci Estate, Freitas Lease, and Pay-to-Get-Paid schemes.\n\n            Testimony by Kenneth Rocha, the chairman of the towers'\n\nassociation, revealed that Autiello was the point person for towers\n\nwhen it came time to make contributions to Cianci's political fund.\n\nAutiello took in the payments and reminded towers when their\n\npayments were due.        As for Autiello's part in the Maggiocomo Job\n\nscheme, Mary Maggiacomo testified that she asked Autiello, who was\n\nin charge of maintenance of police cruisers, to help her son obtain\n\na job on the City force.         She delivered the $5,000 payment to him.\n\nWhen her son was ultimately denied admission into the police,\n\nAutiello refused to return the payment to Mrs. Maggiacomo.\n\n            E.      Special verdict\n\n            At the government's request, the district court submitted\n\nto the jury a special verdict form.               Under the substantive RICO\n\ncount   (Count      Two),       the     verdict    form    contained     special\n\ninterrogatories for each of the RICO predicates, listing them\n\nseparately for each defendant.            For each of the RICO predicates,\n\nthe form asked the jury to check off \"yes\" or \"no\" to indicate\n\nwhether the government had proven the predicate with respect to\n\neach defendant.     As to Cianci, the jury returned the verdict form\n\nwith “no”     checked     for   every    box   (except    one)    indicating   the\n\ngovernment    had   not    proven     those    racketeering      acts.   The   one\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\funchecked box was for Act Ten (University Club); we offer no\n\nopinion on why the jury decided to leave it blank.               For Corrente,\n\nthe jury checked off \"no\" for all racketeering acts except Act\n\nEight (Freitas Lease) and Act 9(a) (\"Pay-to-Get-Paid\"), for which\n\nthe jury checked off \"yes.\"          For Autiello, the jury checked off\n\n\"no\" for all racketeering acts except Act Twelve (Maggiacomo job),\n\nwhich the jury concluded the government had proven.                Ultimately,\n\nonly Corrente was convicted on Count Two, substantive RICO, and all\n\nthree defendants were found guilty on Count One, RICO conspiracy.\n\n            Defendants   argue   that       the   jury's   responses     to    the\n\ninterrogatories in the special verdict form under Count Two (the\n\nsubstantive RICO count) should bear on the verdict as to Count One\n\n(the RICO    conspiracy).     They     claim      that   the   jury's   negative\n\nresponses to these interrogatories indicate their rejection of the\n\nevidence proffered by the government for each of those offenses to\n\nwhich the jury responded \"no.\"          Defendants further contend that\n\ngiven the jury's specific findings, the evidence is insufficient to\n\nsupport the conspiracy verdict as a matter of law.              They postulate\n\nthat the specific purpose of the special verdict form is to limit\n\nthe facts found at trial for the purpose of assessing on appeal the\n\nsufficiency of the prevailing party's case.                Ordinarily, when a\n\njury returns a general verdict of guilty on a substantive RICO\n\ncount and one of the predicate acts is later found to be legally\n\ninsufficient   by   a    reviewing    court,      the    conviction     must   be\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\foverturned where it is impossible to determine whether two legally\n\nsufficient predicate acts support a RICO conviction.

The\n\ngovernment requested the form so that if the jury did convict on\n\nsubstantive RICO, the conviction would be buttressed by express\n\njury findings as to the two-predicate requirement.                           The jury\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\fappears to have understood the two-predicate requirement, in that\n\nit checked off two predicates (extortion conspiracies for the\n\nFreitas Lease and “Pay-to-Get-Paid” schemes) for Corrente, who was\n\nthe only defendant convicted on the substantive RICO count.               No\n\npredicates were checked off for Cianci, and only one (bribery\n\nconspiracy in connection with the Maggiacomo Job) was found proven\n\nfor Autiello; hence, neither was convicted of substantive RICO.\n\n             The \"separate-ness\" of the counts in the indictment,\n\nhowever, is not the central point of contention in this issue.\n\nPowell, 469 U.S. at 64.

Hence, the jury did not go\n\nout-of-bounds by convicting on the RICO conspiracy count while\n\nconcluding    the   government   failed   to    prove   certain   predicate\n\nracketeering acts underlying the substantive RICO count.

Rather, it\n            may only mean that the government did not\n            prove a requisite element of the underlying\n            crime alleged as a racketeering act. . . . In\n            returning a finding of “unproven,” the jury\n            could have concluded that the evidence\n            underlying a [particular racketeering act],\n            while failing to [prove all the elements of\n            the crime committed by the act], nevertheless\n            demonstrated a corrupt gratuity evidencing the\n            existence of an illegal enterprise.\n\nId. at 26-27.     The evidence relating to those acts that were found\n\n“unproven” by the jury was still available to the jury in its\n\nevaluation of the overall RICO charge. “That being so, the inquiry\n\non appeal is whether the jury, in light of the totality of the\n\nevidence, was presented with sufficient evidence of “continuity” to\n\nsupport a conviction.”         Id. at 27.     The jury verdict may be a\n\ncompromise reflecting evil preparations by all three defendants but\n\nsome doubt about implementation by Cianci and Autiello.

Amendment and variance\n\n            Defendants claim that the district court was only able to\n\ndeny   their     dismissal        motions   by    constructively       amending    the\n\nindictment.      They point to the court's statement, in denying these\n\nmotions, that \"it seems to the Court that the indictment alleges\n\nthat what the Defendants are accused of doing is having conducted\n\nthe    affairs    of    the   City    through      a    pattern   of    racketeering\n\nactivity.\"       Defendants also claim that post-trial, the district\n\ncourt erroneously concluded that the indictment could have alleged\n\nthat the     City      was   an   innocent,      unwitting    participant     in   the\n\ncriminal enterprise.          This, defendants contend, conflicts with how\n\nthey understood the indictment--that the City was a culpable\n\nparticipant      in    the    RICO   enterprise--and         hence     constituted   a\n\nconstructive amendment of the indictment.\n\n             An amendment of the indictment occurs when the charging\n\nterms of the indictment are altered, either literally or in effect,\n\nby the prosecutor or the court after the grand jury has returned\n\nthe indictment.

The “operation or management” test\n          expresses this requirement in a formulation\n          that is easy to apply.\n\nId. at 179.\n\n          Autiello and Corrente argue that the district court\n\n“watered down”    the   government’s      burden   of   proof    in   its   jury\n\n\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\finstruction on “associate” RICO liability.11                 Specifically, they\n\nclaim that the instructions permitted conviction for performing\n\nacts without control over some part of the “direction” of the\n\nenterprise.\n\n           We    find   no   merit      in     defendants’    objection.        The\n\ninstructions did not misstate the law; in fact, they reflected\n\nReves nearly verbatim.        Defendants argue that the buzz word on\n\n“associate”     liability    is   that       an   associate    \"direct\"    or   be\n\n“integral” to the affairs of the enterprise.                 The crucial words,\n\nhowever,   are    “operation      and     management,”       which   effectively\n\n\n     11\n      The court instructed, in relevant part:\n     “I told you that the Government has to prove that a Defendant\nis employed by or associated with an enterprise.       A person is\nconsidered to be associated with an enterprise if he or she\nknowingly participates directly or indirectly in the conduct of the\nenterprise’s affairs or business.\n     A person doesn’t have to have a formal relationship with or an\nofficial position in an enterprise in order to be associated with\nthat enterprise.\n     Association may include an informal relationship or agreement\nbetween a person and an enterprise.        A person also may be\nassociated with an enterprise even though his or her role is a\nrelatively minor role, just as the case with respect to conspiracy.\n. . . In order to establish that Defendant conducted or\nparticipated directly or indirectly in the conduct of an\nenterprise’s affairs, the Government must prove that the Defendant\nplayed some part in the operation or management of the enterprise.\n     Conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise’s\naffairs includes things like performing acts, function or duties\nwhich are related to the operation of the enterprise.           The\nGovernment doesn’t have to prove that a Defendant exercised\nsignificant control over or within the enterprise, and the\nGovernment doesn’t have to prove that the Defendant was an upper\nechelon member of the enterprise.\n     An enterprise is operated not only upper management but also\nby lower rung participants who work under the direction of the\nmanagers of the enterprise.”\n\n                                        -43-\n\fcommunicate to a jury that in order for a defendant to have been an\n\nassociate of the RICO enterprise, his participation needs to have\n\nhad “an element of direction” of the enterprise’s affairs.             Id. at\n\n178; United States v. Marino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199776\"><a href=\"/opinion/199776/united-states-v-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002); United States v.

The court more than sufficiently accounted\n\nfor this requirement by instructing that the defendant must have\n\n“played   some     part   in   the   operation      or   management   of   the\n\nenterprise.”\n\n           In general, we have fashioned the Reves “operation or\n\nmanagement” test in accordance with the breadth with which we must\n\nconstrue RICO:\n\n           The requirement of association with the\n           enterprise is not strict.    The RICO net is\n           woven tightly to trap even the smallest fish,\n           those   peripherally    involved   with   the\n           enterprise.    The RICO statute seeks to\n           encompass people who are merely associated\n           with the enterprise. The defendant need only\n           be aware of at least the general existence of\n           the enterprise named in the indictment, and\n           know about its related activities.\n\nMarino, 277 F.3d at 33 (citations and internal quotations omitted).\n\nHence, as an evidentiary matter, the government presented more than\n\nenough to establish that, if there was an enterprise, the two, at\n\nvarious   times,    played     important    roles   in   the   direction   and\n\nsupervision of the enterprise’s operations.               Neither was merely\n\n“peripherally involved with the enterprise.”             The direct testimony\n\nof Kenneth Rocha demonstrated that not only was Autiello aware of\n\n                                     -44-\n\fthe general existence of the enterprise, but that he was central to\n\nfurthering    the    goals    of   the    enterprise,     specifically   as   the\n\ncollection agent for Corrente in obtaining payments from the Tow\n\nList members. His participation in the Maggiacomo Job scheme again\n\nevinced his awareness of the general enterprise as well as his\n\ndirect   involvement     in    the     direction    and    management    of   the\n\nenterprise.    As for Corrente, we need not rehash the evidence that\n\namply establishes his role in the enterprise.              The fact that he was\n\nCianci’s right-hand man, in addition to evidence specifically\n\nshowing his directorial or supervisory involvement in individual\n\nracketeering acts, puts him in the heartland of “associate” RICO\n\nliability as set out in Reves.\n\nII.      The Joint Federal Bribery Conspiracy Convictions (Corrente\n         and Autiello)\n\n            In relevant part, the federal bribery statute provides:\n\n                      (a) Whoever, if the circumstance\n                    described in subsection (b) of this\n                    section exists--\n\n                           (1) being an agent of an\n                    organization, or of a State, local,\n                    or Indian tribal government, or any\n                    agency thereof–\n\n                                   *      *     *\n\n                         (B)   corruptly  solicits   or\n                    demands for the benefit of any\n                    person, or accepts or agrees to\n                    accept, anything of value from any\n                    person, intending to be influenced\n                    or rewarded in connection with any\n                    business, transaction, or series of\n                    transactions of such organization,\n\n                                         -45-\n\f                government or agency involving any\n                thing of value of $5000 or more. . .\n\n                             *          *         *\n\n                shall be fined under this title,\n                imprisoned not more than 10 years,\n                or both.\n\n                 (b) The circumstance referred to in\n                subsection (a) of this section is\n                that the organization, government,\n                or agency receives, in any one year\n                period,   benefits   in  excess   of\n                $10,000 under a Federal program\n                involving    a   grant,    contract,\n                subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance,\n                or other form of Federal assistance.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(B).     Corrente and Autiello were convicted of\n\nconspiring to violate this statute, see 18 U.S.C. § 371, for their\n\nroles in the Tow List scheme.      The government's theory was that, in\n\nrequiring \"campaign contributions\" from those who wished to remain\n\non the police department's tow list, Corrente (in cahoots with\n\nAutiello, who acted as the towers' agent) acted as an \"agent\" of\n\nthe police department within the meaning of subsection (a)(1). The\n\ndepartment qualified as an \"agency\" under subsection (b) because it\n\nreceived an average of about $1 million in federal aid annually\n\n(and never less than $10,000) between 1991 and 1999.               A portion of\n\nthat aid (conferred in connection with a federal anti-domestic\n\nviolence   program)   was   used   in       and   around   1996   (1)   to   train\n\ndispatchers for the police unit that, among their other duties,\n\ncalled companies on the City's tow list when towing was needed, and\n\n\n\n                                   -46-\n\f(2) to purchase the communications and computer equipment used by\n\nthe dispatchers who made these calls.\n\n           Corrente and Autiello argue that their convictions cannot\n\nstand because there is insufficient evidence of a connection\n\nbetween their conduct and the federal funds received by the police\n\ndepartment.     The district court instructed the jury, without\n\nobjection, that such a connection is required. The court described\n\nthe connection (in relevant part) as follows: \"[T]he Government\n\nmust . . . prove that there is some connection between the alleged\n\nbribe and the federal funds received by the local government or\n\nagency . . . .\"     Corrente and Autiello contend that the \"federal\n\nfunds\" evidence described in the preceding paragraph is patently\n\ninadequate to ground a finding that such a connection existed in\n\nthis case.\n\n           The two concede that the statute itself does not require\n\nthat the offense conduct have an effect on the federal funds.        See\n\nSalinas, 522 U.S. at 61 (\"[A]s a matter of statutory construction,\n\n§ 666(a)(1)(B) does not require the Government to prove the bribe\n\nin question had any particular influence on federal funds . . . .\")\n\n(emphasis supplied).     They also acknowledge that, at the time of\n\noral argument, a post-Salinas circuit split had emerged over\n\nwhether,   as   a   statutory   and/or   constitutional   matter,   some\n\nconnection between the offense conduct and a federal interest (if\n\nnot federal funds themselves) was required.      Compare, e.g., United\n\n\n                                  -47-\n\fStates v.

They emphasize that Salinas\n\nexplicitly left open whether some connection between the offense\n\nconduct and a federal interest is required for the statute to be\n\nconstitutionally applied.        See 522 U.S. at 60-61 (declining to\n\ndecide the broader constitutional issue because the statute was\n\nconstitutionally applied on the case facts).                 They argue that\n\n\n                                    -48-\n\frequiring a connection such as the one identified in Zwick and\n\nSantopietro is necessary to maintain an appropriate state-federal\n\nbalance in a criminal law area that has been the traditional\n\nprovince of the states.\n\n           While these appeals were under advisement, the Supreme\n\nCourt granted a writ of certiorari in Sabri and resolved the\n\ncircuit split in favor of the position adopted by the Eighth\n\nCircuit.
