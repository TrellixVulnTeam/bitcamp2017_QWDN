R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 04-1489\n\n                     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                       SIMEON PENA-HERNANDEZ,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rodney S. Dowell and Berman & Dowell on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-Sosa,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            August 26, 2005\n\f            Per    Curiam.         Defendant      Simeon    Peña-Hernandez        was\n\nindicted on one count of conspiring with others to possess with\n\nintent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine in\n\nviolation    of   21     U.S.C.    §§   841(a)(1),       846,   which    carries     a\n\nmandatory     minimum       sentence        of     120     months,      21     U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A)(ii).         After pleading guilty to that offense, he\n\nwas sentenced to 135 months' imprisonment.\n\n            In this appeal, defendant initially challenged his\n\nsentence on the sole ground that the district court should have\n\nconsidered his eligibility for the \"safety valve,\" despite his\n\nrefusal to submit to a debriefing.               After appellate briefing was\n\ncomplete, defendant submitted a letter, under Fed. R. App. P.\n\n28(j), further arguing that the case should be remanded for\n\nresentencing in light of United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005). In reviewing the record, we noticed a plain error in the\n\napplication of the Guidelines, and we remand on that ground\n\nwithout     reaching       defendant's          Booker    argument.           Because\n\ndefendant's eligibility for a safety-valve departure will be\n\nrelevant on remand, we address defendant's safety-valve argument\n\nand find it to be without merit.\n\nA.   Guidelines Calculation Error\n\n            Under      Amendment     640    to    the    Guidelines,     effective\n\nNovember    1,    2002    (prior     to    defendant's      sentencing),        if   a\n\ndefendant    receives       a     minor-role      adjustment     under       U.S.S.G.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f§ 3B1.2, the defendant's base offense level is capped at level\n\n30.    U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(a)(3).       As explained by the Sentencing\n\nCommission, this cap was intended to \"respond[] to concerns that\n\nbase offense levels derived from the Drug Quantity Table in §\n\n2D1.1 overstate the culpability of certain drug offenders who\n\nmeet   the   criteria   for   a   mitigating   role   adjustment   under\n\n§ 3B1.2.\"     U.S.S.G. App. C, Amendment 640.\n\n             Although   defendant    here   was   given   a   minor-role\n\nreduction, he was not given the benefit of the cap on his base\n\noffense level.     Rather, his base offense level was deemed to be\n\n38, based on the Drug Quantity Table, U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A.          If\n\nhe had been given the benefit of the cap, along with the other\n\nreductions already applied by the district court, his total\n\noffense level would have been 25, with a sentencing range of 57\n\nto 71 months, id., although a sentence below the mandatory\n\nminimum would not have been possible without a safety-valve\n\ndeparture.     Thus, with the benefit of the cap but without the\n\nbenefit of the safety valve, defendant should have been sentenced\n\nto the mandatory minimum of 120 months, rather than the 135\n\nmonths he received.\n\n             Although defendant did not raise this argument either\n\nbelow or on appeal, the government correctly concedes that the\n\nerror should be corrected under plain error review. As discussed\n\nabove, the district court erred in failing to cap defendant's\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fbase       offense   level      at   30    as     plainly     required     by   section\n\n2D1.1(a)(3)      of     the     Guidelines.            That   error   in    Guidelines\n\napplication also satisfies the third and fourth prongs of the\n\nplain error standard, United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732\n\n(1993), because it caused the court to substantially increase\n\ndefendant's sentence.              United States v. Sedoma, 332 F.3d 20, 29\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).         For that reason, we vacate the sentence and\n\nremand the case for resentencing.1\n\nB.    Safety-Valve Eligibility\n\n               The primary argument that defendant makes on appeal is\n\nthat the district court erred in failing to consider whether\n\ndefendant's initial statement, upon his arrest, sufficed to satisfy\n\nthe    fifth    requirement          for   a     safety-valve     departure--that        he\n\n\"truthfully      provide[]         to     the    Government     all   information     and\n\nevidence [he] has concerning the offense,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(5);\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a)(5)2–-despite defendant's refusal to submit to\n\na safety-valve debriefing.\n\n               While    it    is     true,      at    least   theoretically,      that    a\n\ndefendant      may     comply      with    the       fifth   safety-valve   requirement\n\nwithout submitting to a debriefing, United States v. Montanez, 82\n\n\n       1\n      Because we remand on the above ground, we need not consider\nthe Booker-based argument for remand raised in defendant's Rule\n28(j) letter. United States v. Caro-Muñiz, 406 F.3d 22, 24 n.1 (1st\nCir. 2005).\n       2\n      It is undisputed that defendant satisfied the four other\nsafety-valve requirements.\n\n                                                -4-\n\fF.3d 520, 523 (1st Cir. 1996), it remains defendant's burden \"to\n\npersuade the district court that he has 'truthfully provided' the\n\nrequired information and evidence to the government.\"               Id.   Here,\n\nthe defendant made no attempt to satisfy that burden or to seek a\n\nsafety-valve departure at all.          At the sentencing hearing, defense\n\ncounsel repeatedly stated that he was seeking only a minor-role\n\nadjustment, not a safety-valve departure.                  Thus, the district\n\ncourt had no reason to consider or rule on defendant's eligibility\n\nfor the safety valve, and it did not err in failing to do so.                Cf.\n\nid. at 522 (finding error where district court denied a safety-\n\nvalve departure because defendant had not been debriefed).                     A\n\nfortiori, the court did not err in failing to hold an evidentiary\n\nhearing on this issue where no such hearing was requested.                Id. at\n\n523.\n\n           The    sentence   is   vacated      and   the   case   remanded   for\n\nresentencing.     See Local R. 27(c).         On remand, the district court\n\nshould   take    into   account   the    now-advisory      Guidelines     range,\n\nincluding the 30-level cap on defendant's base offense level, along\n\nwith the other factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), and may\n\nalso consider, with or without taking additional evidence, whether\n\ndefendant's     initial   statement      on   arrest   satisfied    the   fifth\n\nrequirement for the safety valve.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f",
