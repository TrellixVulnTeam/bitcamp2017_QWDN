Marrero, Research and Writing Specialist, with\nwhom Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, and Patricia\nA. Garrity, Assistant Federal Public Defender, were on brief, for\nappellant Correa-Alicea.\n     Rafael F. Castro-Lang for appellant Santiago-Torres.\n     Luke Cass, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Rosa\nEmilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivision, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 27, 2009\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.     After a six-day trial, appellants\n\nEmilio Correa-Alicea and Geraldo Santiago-Torres were convicted of\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute certain narcotics\n\nas part of a drug point operating in the Arístedes Chavier public\n\nhousing     project   in   Ponce,   Puerto    Rico.1    See   21   U.S.C.    §§\n\n841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846, 860.           Correa-Alicea was sentenced to\n\na 360-month term of imprisonment, and Santiago-Torres was sentenced\n\nto a 324-month term.       In this consolidated appeal, Correa-Alicea\n\nraises several challenges to his sentence, and Santiago-Torres\n\nargues that the cumulative effect of a number of trial errors\n\nrequires a new trial.       We affirm in all respects.\n\n                                     I.\n\n             We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict.     United States v. Flores-de-Jesús, 569 F.3d 8, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).\n\n             Between November 2005 and November 2006, approximately\n\nsix drug points operated at the Arístedes Chavier Housing Project.\n\nAppellant Correa-Alicea was \"in charge\" of one of the drug points,\n\nand appellant Santiago-Torres was a runner at that point, although\n\nhe   also   sold   drugs   on   occasion.      Correa-Alicea's     drug   point\n\noperated every day of the year, from 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. until 11:00\n\n\n\n      1\n       Correa-Alicea and Santiago-Torres were indicted along with\nsix co-defendants.     The six co-defendants entered into plea\nagreements, while Correa-Alicea and Santiago-Torres proceeded to a\njoint trial.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fp.m., and had a large number of customers daily.             The drug point\n\nsold cocaine base as well as other narcotics.\n\n              At trial, two government informants testified as to\n\ncontrolled purchases they had made from Correa-Alicea's drug point,\n\nand the court admitted into evidence the audio recordings of those\n\npurchases.      Angélica Colón-González, a lifelong resident of the\n\nhousing project, testified that she had seen appellants selling\n\ndrugs to others behind her house in the housing project.                   She\n\nstated that she had known appellants her entire life, although on\n\ncross-examination, she clarified that she had known Santiago-Torres\n\nfor three years. She began cooperating with the DEA in early 2006,\n\nand on February 16, 2006, she made a controlled drug purchase of\n\nsix   large    packages,   each   of    which   contained    twenty-five    to\n\ntwenty-six individual packages of cocaine base.             Although she and\n\nthe seller, Sergio Martínez, had agreed the previous day that she\n\nwould purchase fifteen large packages, he had only four packages\n\navailable on February 16. Martínez then called appellant Santiago-\n\nTorres to see whether Santiago-Torres had any additional drugs, and\n\nlater that day Santiago-Torres brought Colón-González two more\n\npackages of cocaine base.         The parties stipulated that the net\n\nweight of the cocaine base purchased in the February 16 transaction\n\nwas 17.1 grams.\n\n              Another long-time resident of the housing project, Javier\n\nOrtiz-Cruz, had grown up with Correa-Alicea and had known him for\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fmost of his life, and had known Santiago-Torres for more than\n\nfifteen years. Ortiz-Cruz sold heroin and crack at Correa–Alicea’s\n\ndrug point in the fall of 2005, during which time Santiago-Torres\n\nalso       acted   as   a   drug   runner    and   seller.   Ortiz-Cruz   began\n\ncooperating with the DEA in 2006, and, on April 12, 2006, he made\n\na controlled purchase of fifteen packets of heroin.2                On May 4,\n\n2006, Ortiz-Cruz made a purchase of eight packets of cocaine base\n\nfrom Santiago-Torres, whom he identified as one of Correa-Alicea’s\n\nsellers.       Correa-Alicea was also present at this purchase, and the\n\nwitness identified both Correa-Alicea and Santiago-Torres on the\n\naudio recording of the purchase.              The parties stipulated that the\n\nnet weight of the cocaine base purchased in the May 4 transaction\n\nwas 24.3 grams.\n\n               The government also presented the testimony of Eddie\n\nVidal-Gil, a Puerto Rico Police Department agent in charge of the\n\ninvestigation conducted at the housing project. The district court\n\naccepted Agent Vidal-Gil as an expert on drug trafficking.                Vidal-\n\nGil testified that Correa-Alicea's drug point sold cocaine base in\n\n\n\n       2\n       The government acknowledges in its brief that Ortiz-Cruz\nprovided inconsistent testimony as to whom he purchased heroin from\non April 12. On direct examination, he stated that he bought drugs\nfrom \"Colin [Correa-Alicea] and Geraldo [Santiago-Torres]\" on or\nabout April 12.    However, he subsequently claimed that he had\npurchased the drugs on April 12 \"[f]rom Colin,\" which he then\nrepeated on cross-examination.      The government now takes the\nposition that the April 12 purchase did not involve Santiago-Torres\nat all, noting that the transcript of the audio recording of this\npurchase does not list Santiago-Torres as a speaker.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fsmall plastic bags, each with a net weight of .07 grams.        He\n\nfurther testified, over defense counsel's objection, as to the\n\nquantity of drugs sold during his surveillance of the drug point:\n\n          Q      Okay.   And during the times that you\n          actually   performed   surveillance   at   the\n          Defendants' drug point, how many buys of those\n          little baggies did you see occur during the\n          time period that you were looking at the drug\n          point?\n          A      Well, so many that I couldn't really\n          count them.   I would say in a period of 25\n          minutes or half an hour that I would be\n          surveilling the drug point, many more than 10,\n          15, of these small bags containing crack would\n          be sold in that period of time.\n\n          The jury found appellants guilty of conspiracy to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base and\n\ndetectable amounts of cocaine and heroin in the housing project,\n\nwithin 1,000 feet of a public school.   See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1),\n\n841(b)(1)(A), 846, 860.   At sentencing, the district court found\n\nCorrea-Alicea accountable for in excess of 4.5 kilograms of cocaine\n\nbase, and sentenced him to a prison term of 360 months.       In a\n\nseparate sentencing proceeding, the court found Santiago-Torres\n\naccountable for in excess of 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, and\n\nsentenced him to a 324-month term.\n\n          On appeal, Correa-Alicea challenges his sentence, and\n\nSantiago-Torres contends that his conviction should be reversed.\n\nWe address each appellant's claims in turn.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f                                      II.\n\nA. Correa-Alicea's Sentence\n\n           Correa-Alicea's Presentence Investigation Report (PSR)\n\nrecommended that he be held accountable for approximately six\n\nkilograms of cocaine base over a one-year period.        The PSR did not\n\nexplain   how   it   reached   this   drug-quantity   determination,   but\n\ninstead merely stated that the finding was based on \"the evidence\n\npresented at trial, and the testimony of drug expert Eddie Vidal.\"\n\n           Correa-Alicea filed objections to the PSR, contending\n\nthat the drug-quantity finding was incorrect because it was based\n\non unreliable expert witness testimony from Agent Vidal-Gil.            At\n\nthe sentencing hearing, after argument from counsel on this point,\n\nthe district court adopted the PSR's recommendation and found that\n\nCorrea-Alicea was responsible for in excess of 4.5 kilograms of\n\ncrack cocaine.       Like the PSR, the district court did not explain\n\nhow it reached its drug-quantity determination, but instead simply\n\nstated that its finding was based on \"the evidence presented at\n\ntrial.\"\n\n           Based on the finding that Correa-Alicea was responsible\n\nfor in excess of 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, the district court\n\nassigned him a base offense level of 38.        U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(1).\n\nThe court applied a one-level enhancement because the offense was\n\ncommitted in a protected location, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.2(a)(2), and a\n\nthree-level enhancement because Correa-Alicea was a leader in the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fcriminal activity, U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b), for a total offense level\n\nof 42.     Combined with a Criminal History Category of I, this\n\noffense level resulted in a guidelines imprisonment range of 360\n\nmonths to life, and the court sentenced Correa-Alicea to a prison\n\nterm of 360 months.\n\nB. Calculating Drug Quantity\n\n            Under the sentencing guidelines, the base offense level\n\nlargely depends upon the total drug quantities involved in the\n\noffense.    U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c).        If the quantity of drugs seized\n\ndoes not accurately reflect the scale of a drug-distribution\n\nconspiracy,    the   district   court    must     \"approximate     the   [total]\n\nquantity of the controlled substance.\"              U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, cmt.\n\nn.12.      Because   Correa-Alicea   was    convicted     of   conspiring    to\n\ndistribute controlled substances, he is responsible \"not only for\n\nthe drugs he actually handled but also for the full amount of drugs\n\nthat he could reasonably have anticipated would be within the ambit\n\nof the conspiracy.\"      United States v. Santos, 357 F.3d 136, 140\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            A district court's finding as to drug quantity \"need only\n\nbe by a preponderance of the evidence and is not required to be an\n\nexact    determination    but   rather     only     a   reasoned    estimate.\"\n\nRodríguez, 525 F.3d at 107; see also United States v. Laboy, 351\n\nF.3d 578, 584 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that when \"it is impossible\n\nor impractical to obtain an exact drug quantity for sentencing\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fpurposes, a reasoned estimate will suffice\"). The sentencing court\n\nhas \"broad discretion in determining which data are sufficiently\n\ndependable for sentencing purposes.\"                   United States v. Rivera-\n\nMaldonado, 194 F.3d 224, 228 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999).                         Although the\n\ncourt \"may rely on reasonable estimates and averages\" to reach its\n\ndrug-quantity determination, those estimates must possess adequate\n\nindicia of reliability and demonstrable record support.                          Id. at\n\n228.   We \"cannot uphold a drug quantity calculation on the basis of\n\nhunch or intuition.\" United States v. Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768,\n\n780 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              We review the district court's factual finding as to drug\n\nquantity for clear error.               Rodríguez, 525 F.3d at 107.                    In\n\nreviewing     the    court's    drug-quantity          finding,    our    task   is    to\n\n\"determine whether the government presented sufficient reliable\n\ninformation     to     permit   the    court      reasonably      to    conclude   that\n\n[Correa-Alicia was] responsible for a quantity of drugs at least\n\nequal to the quantity threshold for the assigned base offense\n\nlevel.\"     United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 553 (1st Cir.\n\n1993); see also United States v. Pizarro-Berríos, 448 F.3d 1, 8\n\n(1st   Cir.    2006)    (holding      that   if    a   district        court   makes   an\n\nerroneous factual finding under the sentencing guidelines, yet\n\n\"there is enough evidence to support the alternative explanation\n\nfor the court's finding, the error would be harmless and there\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fwould be no reason to remand to the district court when the result\n\nwill be the same.\").\n\nC. Correa-Alicea's Challenge to the Drug-Quantity Determination\n\n           Correa-Alicea argues that the district court erroneously\n\nfound that he was individually responsible for more than 4.5\n\nkilograms of cocaine base.            Relatedly, he challenges the admission\n\nof Agent Vidal-Gil’s testimony, which he claims provided the basis\n\nfor the court's drug-quantity determination. He argues that Vidal-\n\nGil's   testimony        was   unreliable         and    not    based    on     recognized\n\nscientific techniques, and therefore was improperly admitted as\n\nexpert testimony.         The government responds that, even if Vidal-\n\nGil's testimony was unreliable, an alternate calculation based on\n\nthe   stipulated     quantities        of    cocaine       base     purchased      in    two\n\ncontrolled transactions adequately supports the district court's\n\n4.5 kilogram finding.          We agree with the government's contention.\n\nBecause   we   conclude        that    the    district         court's    drug-quantity\n\ndetermination       is   sufficiently        supported         by   reliable      evidence\n\nindependent    of    Vidal-Gil's       testimony,         we     need    not    reach   the\n\nquestion of whether the district court erred in admitting Vidal-\n\nGil's   testimony.         See    Barnett,         989    F.2d      at   553;    see    also\n\nPizarro-Berríos, 448 F.3d at 8.\n\n           At trial, the parties stipulated to the quantity of\n\ncocaine base recovered from each of two controlled purchases:                            on\n\nFebruary 16, 2006, Colón-González purchased cocaine base with a net\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fweight of 17.1 grams, and on May 4, 2006, Ortiz-Cruz purchased\n\ncocaine base with a net weight of 24.3 grams.3      These controlled\n\npurchases were recorded on audio tape, and the audio recordings\n\nwere admitted as evidence at trial.     According to the testimony of\n\nOrtiz-Cruz and Colón-González, long-time residents of the housing\n\nproject, Correa-Alicea was \"in charge\" of the drug point and was\n\ninvolved in the conspiracy from November 2005 until November 2006.\n\nThe drug point operated for at least sixteen hours every day, and\n\na large number of people visited the drug point daily.\n\n          Based on this evidence, it is reasonable to conclude\n\nthat, over the course of the year-long conspiracy, Correa-Alicea's\n\ndrug point made at least one cocaine base sale per day in an amount\n\ncomparable   to   the   controlled   purchases.   Using   the   smaller\n\ncontrolled purchase of 17.1 grams as a sample, 6.2415 kilograms of\n\ncocaine base are reasonably attributable to Correa-Alicea over the\n\none-year conspiracy (17.1 grams of cocaine base sold per day,\n\nmultiplied by 365 days per year).        Using the larger controlled\n\npurchase of 24.3 grams, he is accountable for 8.8695 kilograms\n\n(24.3 grams of cocaine base sold per day, multiplied by 365 days\n\nper year).   Even the more conservative estimate of 6.24 kilograms\n\nis significantly more than the 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base\n\nattributed to Correa-Alicea by the district court.        The court's\n\n\n     3\n       The third controlled purchase, made by Ortiz-Cruz on April\n12, 2006, was for heroin rather than cocaine base, and therefore is\nnot relevant to this calculus.\n\n                                 -10-\n\ffinding as to drug quantity was not a mere \"hunch or intuition,\"\n\nsee Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d at 780, but was a \"reasoned estimate\"\n\nbased on reliable evidence in the record.         See Rodríguez, 525 F.3d\n\nat 107.\n\n            Relying on our decision in Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d\n\n224, Correa-Alicea contends that the quantity of drugs purchased in\n\nthe two controlled buys does not provide a reasonable basis for the\n\ndistrict   court's    4.5   kilogram   finding,   and    asserts   that   any\n\nestimate of drug quantity based on these two buys \"would not have\n\nbeen arrived at in a scientifically sound and methodologically\n\nreliable manner.\"     We disagree.\n\n            In Rivera-Maldonado, we recognized that \"[g]enerally\n\nspeaking, the smaller the sampling, the less reliable the resulting\n\nprobability estimate,\" and an estimate of drug quantity may be\n\nunreliable if based on an extrapolation from too small a sample.\n\nId. at 231.    We held that it was improper for the sentencing court\n\nto estimate the average drug transaction size using a very small\n\nsample    of   controlled   buys   over   the   course    of   a   six-month\n\ninvestigation.       Id. at 233.       The sampling in that case was\n\n\"minuscule,\" \"twelve controlled buys drawn from a set of 86,400\n\ntransactions (20 transactions per hour, times 24 hours per day,\n\ntimes 180 days),\" and there was no evidence that the twelve\n\ncontrolled buys were representative of ordinary drug transactions\n\nat the drug     point.      Id. at 231-32.        Furthermore, the other\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\festimates upon which the total drug-quantity finding was based,\n\nincluding the average number of transactions per hour and average\n\noperating hours per day, were also unreliable, and therefore \"the\n\nrisk of error was compounded by pyramiding unreliable inferences.\"\n\nId. at 233. We concluded that the sentencing court's drug-quantity\n\ndetermination was not based on sufficiently reliable information,\n\nand remanded the case for resentencing.              Id. at 233; see also\n\nUnited States v. Culps, 300 F.3d 1069, 1078 (9th Cir. 2002)\n\n(holding that an estimate of average drug quantity for 60,250\n\ntransactions based on nine controlled buys was statistically and\n\nlegally unreliable); United States v. Butler, 41 F.3d 1435, 1447\n\n(11th    Cir.    1995)   (rejecting    an    estimate   of    sixty-six   drug\n\ntransactions per day based solely on a videotape of transactions\n\noccurring on a single day, where there was no evidence that single\n\nday was \"typical\" or \"average\").\n\n            In this case, however, the sample used for calculating\n\naverage drug transaction size is proportionately much larger, and\n\ntherefore more reliable, than in Rivera-Maldonado:             two controlled\n\nbuys drawn from a set of 365 transactions (one per day for a year),\n\nrather    than    twelve    buys   drawn      from   86,400     transactions.\n\nFurthermore, unlike in Rivera-Maldonado, the other estimates upon\n\nwhich the total drug-quantity finding is based are reliable, even\n\nconservative.      The estimate of one transaction per day, or 365\n\ntransactions per year, is highly conservative in light of testimony\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fthat the drug point operated for sixteen to seventeen hours per\n\nday, 365 days per year, and had a large number of customers daily.\n\nThe    district       court's    ultimate     finding   that     Correa-Alicea     was\n\naccountable for in excess of 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base is\n\nlikewise conservative, given that even calculations based on the\n\nsmaller of the two controlled buys would yield a figure of 6.24\n\nkilograms.            The   court's      finding,     although     not    an   \"exact\n\ndetermination\" of drug quantity, see Rodríguez, 525 F.3d at 107, is\n\na   reasonable        estimate    with     \"demonstrable     record   support\"    and\n\n\"adequate indicia of reliability.\"                See Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d\n\nat 229.4\n\n                  In sum, because there is clear record support for the\n\ndistrict court's finding that Correa-Alicea was accountable for\n\nmore       than    4.5   kilograms    of    cocaine   base   during      the   charged\n\nconspiracy, we affirm the sentence imposed.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n       Although Correa-Alicea does not raise the argument, it could\nbe contended that an estimate of drug quantity based on controlled\nbuys arranged by government agents is particularly unreliable, as\nthere is no evidence that these buys are representative of sales by\nordinary customers.     See Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d at 232.\nHowever, even if the controlled buys stipulated to in this case are\nsomewhat larger than the average buys by ordinary customers at\nCorrea-Alicea's drug point, the calculation outlined above more\nthan compensates for any overestimate in the average drug\ntransaction size by using the extremely conservative estimate of\njust one drug purchase per day.\n\n                                           -13-\n\f                                  III.\n\n          Santiago-Torres contends that the cumulative effect of\n\nseveral errors requires a new trial.     We disagree and affirm his\n\nconviction.\n\nA. Voice Identification Expert\n\n          Santiago-Torres's principal argument is that the district\n\ncourt erred in denying his request to retain a voice identification\n\nexpert and his related motion for a continuance to secure that\n\nexpert's presence at trial.   We review a denial of a request to\n\nfund expert services for abuse of discretion.       United States v.\n\nQuiñones-Medina, 553 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 2009).    The denial of a\n\ncontinuance is likewise reviewed for abuse of discretion.     United\n\nStates v. Rodríguez-Durán, 507 F.3d 749, 762 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          Prior to trial, upon defense counsel's request, the\n\ndistrict court ordered that the defendants and their counsel be\n\npermitted to listen on March 6, 2007, to the audio recordings of\n\nthe controlled purchases.   Nearly two months later, on April 30,\n\nSantiago-Torres and other defendants filed a motion to continue the\n\ntrial date set for May 14, citing ongoing investigations and plea\n\nnegotiations.   On May 1, Santiago-Torres submitted a sealed, ex\n\nparte motion requesting funds to retain a voice identification\n\nexpert, asserting that it was not his voice on the incriminating\n\naudio recordings, and the only way he could present a defense\n\nagainst the evidence contained in the audio recordings was through\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fsuch an expert.    Two days later, in an order denying the April 30\n\nmotion for continuance of trial, the court referenced, but did not\n\nexpressly rule on, Santiago-Torres's ex parte request for a voice\n\nidentification expert:       \"Furthermore, defendants' counsel listened\n\nto the United States' evidence on March 6, 2007 and only now\n\nrequest[s] an expert on voice identification.\"5\n\n           Santiago-Torres      renewed    his   request   for    a        voice\n\nidentification expert in a second sealed ex parte motion on May 7.\n\nThe following day, the court issued sealed orders denying both ex\n\nparte    motions   without    prejudice    pending   completion       of     the\n\ngovernment's case in chief.        The district court did not further\n\nexplain the basis for its denial. On May 14, the day trial was\n\nscheduled to start, Santiago-Torres filed a motion again requesting\n\nfunds to retain a voice identification expert and a continuance to\n\nensure the expert's availability for trial.            The court orally\n\ndenied the motion.    At trial, audio recordings of the February 16\n\npurchase by government witness Colón-González and the April 12 and\n\nMay 4 purchases by government witness Ortiz-Cruz were admitted into\n\nevidence over defense counsel's objections.\n\n           As an indigent, Santiago-Torres was entitled to the\n\nbenefits of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA), 18 U.S.C. § 3006A.              The\n\n\n     5\n       Santiago-Torres also contends on appeal that the district\ncourt erred by stating in this order that Santiago-Torres\n\"request[s] an expert on voice identification,\" thereby disclosing\nhis ex parte request for a voice identification expert. We discuss\nthis claim of error below.\n\n                                    -15-\n\fCJA provides that \"a person who is financially unable to obtain            .\n\n. . expert . . . services necessary for an adequate defense\" may\n\nobtain them after demonstrating in an ex parte hearing that such\n\nservices are \"necessary.\"    18 U.S.C. § 3006A(e)(1).        \"Generally,\n\nexpert services have been found necessary when the proffered expert\n\ntestimony was pivotal to the indigent defendant's defense.\" United\n\nStates v. Manning, 79 F.3d 212, 218 (1st Cir. 1996).        For example,\n\n\"courts have appointed a fingerprint expert when a fingerprint,\n\nalleged to be the defendant's, was the primary means of connecting\n\nthe defendant to the crime, and a psychiatrist when the defendant's\n\nsanity at the time of the offense was at issue.\"           Id. (internal\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n          We discern no abuse of discretion in the district court's\n\ndenial of Santiago-Torres's ex parte motion for funds to retain a\n\nvoice   identification   expert,    or    his   related   motion   for     a\n\ncontinuance to secure that expert's presence at trial.         Santiago-\n\nTorres's proffered expert testimony was not pivotal to his defense.\n\nThe audio recordings were not the \"primary means of connecting\n\n[Santiago-Torres] to the crime,\" see id., but instead merely served\n\nas corroboration for the ample eyewitness testimony that Santiago-\n\nTorres had acted as a runner and seller for the drug point.\n\n          Colón-González testified that she had known Santiago-\n\nTorres for three years, and had seen him acting as the runner at\n\nthe drug point and selling drugs to others behind her house.             She\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\ffurther   testified      that    during       the   February   16   controlled\n\ntransaction, the seller, Martínez, called Santiago-Torres to see\n\nwhether he had any additional drugs, and Santiago-Torres brought\n\nher two more packages of cocaine base later that day.               Ortiz-Cruz\n\ntestified that he had known Santiago-Torres for more than fifteen\n\nyears, and had sold drugs at Correa-Alicea's drug point in late\n\n2005, during which time Santiago-Torres also worked as a drug\n\nrunner and seller.       Ortiz-Cruz also testified that he purchased\n\ncocaine base directly from Santiago-Torres in the May 4 controlled\n\ntransaction.    In light of this eyewitness testimony, none of which\n\ndepended on identification of Santiago-Torres's voice on the audio\n\nrecordings, the voice identification expert services were not\n\ncritical or necessary to his defense.\n\n           Moreover, as the district court noted, Santiago-Torres's\n\ncounsel had the opportunity to listen to the audio recordings at\n\nissue on March 6, but did not request a continuance until April 30\n\nand did not request funds to retain a voice identification expert\n\nuntil May 1, less than two weeks before his trial was scheduled to\n\nbegin. Santiago-Torres contends on appeal, as he did in his motion\n\nto the district court, that his requests were delayed because he\n\nspent   weeks   trying    to    locate    a    voice   identification   expert\n\navailable to come to Puerto Rico.         However, he does not explain why\n\nhe could not have made his requests for expert services and for a\n\ncontinuance prior to locating an available expert, and the district\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fcourt     could    reasonably      have    found     that    the    requests       were\n\nunreasonably dilatory. In light of these facts, we cannot conclude\n\nthat the court abused its discretion in denying Santiago-Torres's\n\nrequests for a continuance and for funds to retain the proffered\n\nexpert.\n\n            Santiago-Torres further contends that the district court\n\nerred in disclosing his ex parte request for a voice identification\n\nexpert in its May 3, 2007 denial of his motion for a continuance.\n\nThe government correctly concedes error on this point.                   See United\n\nStates v. Abreu, 202 F.3d 386, 391 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that\n\ndistrict court erred in not handling entire application for expert\n\nservices under 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(e)(1) on an ex parte basis, and\n\nexplaining that the \"manifest purpose of requiring that the inquiry\n\nbe ex parte is to insure that the defendant will not have to make\n\na premature disclosure of his case\" (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).        However, voice identification was not pivotal to\n\nSantiago-Torres's defense.          Even absent the audio recordings, the\n\ngovernment        presented      overwhelming       evidence       of   his    guilt.\n\nTherefore, we find that the court's error in not handling his\n\nexpert request on an ex parte basis was harmless.\n\nB. Alleged Discovery Violations\n\n            Santiago-Torres further contends that the district court\n\nfailed     to     remedy   two    alleged        discovery   violations       by   the\n\ngovernment.\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f            1. Disclosure of Photograph\n\n            First, Santiago-Torres contends that the court erred in\n\nnot ordering the government to produce a photograph shown to Colón-\n\nGonzález prior to trial, which he argues was subject to disclosure\n\nunder Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.                             We\n\nreview   the   court's    determination       under    Rule      16   for    abuse    of\n\ndiscretion. United States v. Caro-Muñiz, 406 F.3d 22, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   We find no such abuse here.\n\n            Colón-González       testified      that       she    had       personally\n\nidentified both defendants to DEA agents while she and the agents\n\nwere riding in an undercover car, and she had later identified\n\nSantiago-Torres    in    a   photograph      shown    to    her   by    DEA   agents.\n\nSantiago-Torres objected on the ground that, during discovery, he\n\nhad asked the prosecution for information about any identification\n\nprocedures used in the investigation, such as photographic line-\n\nups, and the government had responded that no such procedures had\n\noccurred.      Santiago-Torres contended that the government should\n\nhave disclosed the photograph during discovery so that he could\n\ncross-examine     Colón-González       about     her        identification,          and\n\nrequested that the court order production of the photograph.                         The\n\ngovernment     argued    that   the   photograph      was    irrelevant        because\n\nColón-González knew Santiago-Torres from personal interactions, and\n\ndid not identify him based on the photograph.                     The court denied\n\nSantiago-Torres's request, accepting the government’s assertion\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fthat the photograph was not the basis for her identification of\n\nSantiago-Torres because she knew him personally.\n\n             The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nrefusing to order production of the pretrial photograph.                Rule 16\n\nrequires      disclosure      of    documents       and   objects   within    the\n\ngovernment's possession, custody or control upon a defendant's\n\nrequest if \"(i) the item is material to preparing the defense; (ii)\n\nthe government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at\n\ntrial; or (iii) the item was obtained from or belongs to the\n\ndefendant.\"       Fed.   R.    Crim.       P.   16(a)(1)(E).   Santiago-Torres\n\ncontends that the photograph was material to his defense because it\n\ncould have been used during cross-examination of Colón-González and\n\ncould have formed the basis for a \"pretrial motion to suppress the\n\nreliability of her identification.\" However, nothing in the record\n\nindicates that Colón-González identified Santiago-Torres on the\n\nbasis of the photograph.           To the contrary, she testified that she\n\nhad known Santiago-Torres for three years and purchased drugs from\n\nhim,   and    that,   before       being    shown   the   photograph,   she   had\n\nidentified him in-person while riding in an undercover car with DEA\n\nagents.      Thus, the photograph was not material and the government\n\nwas not required to disclose it.\n\n             2. Disclosure of Audio Recording\n\n             Santiago-Torres contends that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his request for a mistrial based on the government's\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\falleged failure to produce the April 12, 2006 audio recording\n\nduring pretrial discovery.          We review the court's denial of a\n\nmistrial motion for a manifest abuse of discretion.             United States\n\nv. Van Anh, 523 F.3d 43, 54 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n              At trial, after the audio recording of Ortiz-Cruz's April\n\n12 controlled purchase was played for the jury, defense counsel\n\nmoved for a mistrial, claiming that he had not received the\n\nrecording     during   discovery.     He    stated   that    during    pretrial\n\ndiscovery he had received a recording marked \"April 12\" along with\n\na transcript, but the recording was inaudible.              He then requested\n\nand received a second copy of the recording and transcript from the\n\ngovernment, also marked \"April 12,\" but he claimed that this was\n\nnot the recording played at trial.         The government maintained that\n\nit had provided defense counsel with copies of the April 12\n\nrecording and the transcript on two occasions well in advance of\n\ntrial, and defense counsel should have notified the government if\n\nthe recording did not match the transcript.               The district court\n\nthen listened to the recording at issue and denied Santiago-\n\nTorres's motion, explaining that \"whatever the CD was -- that was\n\nprovided -- I mean, it was easily determined that it -- it wasn't\n\nthe proper CD by just looking at the transcript.\"\n\n              We find no abuse of discretion in the court's ruling.\n\nThe   court    reasonably   concluded      that,   even   if   the    incorrect\n\nrecording was mistakenly provided, defense counsel could have\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\feasily discovered the error and requested the correct recording\n\nfrom the government.      Moreover, Santiago-Torres has not shown that\n\nhe was prejudiced by the government's alleged failure to produce\n\nthe correct recording prior to trial.            See   United States v. Devin,\n\n918   F.2d   280,   290   (1st   Cir.    1990)    (\"[I]n    cases   of   delayed\n\ndisclosure, a court's principal concern must be whether learning\n\nthe   information    altered     the   subsequent      defense   strategy,   and\n\nwhether, given timeous disclosure, a more effective strategy would\n\nlikely have resulted.\"). He contends that the government's alleged\n\ndiscovery failure caused him to rely on the wrong trial strategy,\n\nbecause his strategy \"was to obtain suppression of the April 12\n\nrecording because it was inaudible and therefore inadmissible.\" He\n\nfurther claims that if he had received the correct recording prior\n\nto trial, he might have accepted the government's plea offer,\n\n\"since the strategy of having the tape excluded on inaudibility\n\ngrounds would have been foreclosed.\"\n\n             Santiago-Torres's claims of prejudice are not plausible.\n\nDefense counsel conceded to the district court that after receiving\n\nthe first recording, which he claimed was inaudible, he requested\n\nand received a second copy of the recording from the government.\n\nHe did not claim that this second recording was inaudible; instead,\n\nhe conceded that he listened to the recording and \"understood that\n\nthis transcript was not really right, that you could not really\n\nread -- you could not really hear what is in the transcript.\"                In\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\faddition,    defense    counsel    was    permitted   to   listen   to   the\n\ngovernment's audio recordings in court on March 6, 2007, prior to\n\ntrial.    Defense counsel admitted to the district court that he\n\n\"wasn't   present   for   the     whole   session.\"    Finally,     although\n\nSantiago-Torres claims that his trial strategy was to file a motion\n\nto suppress the audio recording, he did not file any such pretrial\n\nmotion.     Santiago-Torres has failed to credibly demonstrate that\n\nthe alleged discovery failure caused him to adopt a less effective\n\ndefense strategy, and we are therefore satisfied that any discovery\n\nfailure was harmless.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\f",

Correa-Alicea was sentenced to a 360-month term of imprisonment, and Santiago-Torres was sentenced to a 324-month term. In this consolidated appeal, Correa-Alicea raises several challenges to his sentence, and Santiago-Torres argues that the cumulative effect of a number of trial errors requires a new trial. We affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>United States v. Flores-de-Jesús,</i> 569 F.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p>Between November 2005 and November 2006, approximately six drug points operated at the Arístedes Chavier Housing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*487</span> Project. Appellant Correa-Alicea was \"in charge\" of one of the drug points, and appellant Santiago-Torres was a runner at that point, although he also sold drugs on occasion. Correa-Alicea's drug point operated every day of the year, from 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m., and had a large number of customers daily. The drug point sold cocaine base as well as other narcotics.</p>\n<p>At trial, two government informants testified as to controlled purchases they had made from Correa-Alicea's drug point, and the court admitted into evidence the audio recordings of those purchases. Angélica Colón-González, a lifelong resident of the housing project, testified that she had seen appellants selling drugs to others behind her house in the housing project. She stated that she had known appellants her entire life, although on cross-examination, she clarified that she had known Santiago-Torres for three years. She began cooperating with the DEA in early 2006, and on February 16, 2006, she made a controlled drug purchase of six large packages, each of which contained twenty-five to twenty-six individual packages of cocaine base. Although she and the seller, Sergio Martínez, had agreed the previous day that she would purchase fifteen large packages, he had only four packages available on February 16. Martínez then called appellant Santiago-Torres to see whether Santiago-Torres had any additional drugs, and later that day Santiago-Torres brought Colón-González two more packages of cocaine base. The parties stipulated that the net weight of the cocaine base purchased in the February 16 transaction was 17.1 grams.</p>\n<p>Another long-time resident of the housing project, Javier Ortiz-Cruz, had grown up with Correa-Alicea and had known him for most of his life, and had known Santiago-Torres for more than fifteen years. Ortiz-Cruz sold heroin and crack at Correa-Alicea's drug point in the fall of 2005, during which time Santiago-Torres also acted as a drug runner and seller. Ortiz-Cruz began cooperating with the DEA in 2006, and, on April 12, 2006, he made a controlled purchase of fifteen packets of heroin.<sup>[2]</sup> On May 4, 2006, Ortiz-Cruz made a purchase of eight packets of cocaine base from Santiago-Torres, whom he identified as one of Correa-Alicea's sellers. Correa-Alicea was also present at this purchase, and the witness identified both Correa-Alicea and Santiago-Torres on the audio recording of the purchase. The parties stipulated that the net weight of the cocaine base purchased in the May 4 transaction was 24.3 grams.</p>\n<p>The government also presented the testimony of Eddie Vidal-Gil, a Puerto Rico Police Department agent in charge of the investigation conducted at the housing project. The district court accepted Agent Vidal-Gil as an expert on drug trafficking. Vidal-Gil testified that Correa-Alicea's drug point sold cocaine base in small plastic bags, each with a net weight of .07 grams. He further testified, over defense counsel's objection, as to the quantity of drugs sold during his surveillance of the drug point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> Q Okay. And during the times that you actually performed surveillance at the Defendants' drug point, how many buys of those little baggies did you see occur during the time period that you were looking at the drug point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A Well, so many that I couldn't really count them. I would say in a period of 25 minutes or half an hour that I would be surveilling the drug point, many more than 10, 15, of these small bags containing crack would be sold in that period of time.</blockquote>\n<p>The jury found appellants guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base and detectable amounts of cocaine and heroin in the housing project, within 1,000 feet of a public school. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846, 860. At sentencing, the district court found Correa-Alicea accountable for in excess of 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, and sentenced him to a prison term of 360 months. In a separate sentencing proceeding, the court found Santiago-Torres accountable for in excess of 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, and sentenced him to a 324-month term.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Correa-Alicea challenges his sentence, and Santiago-Torres contends that his conviction should be reversed. We address each appellant's claims in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Correa-Alicea's Sentence</h2>\n<p>Correa-Alicea's Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) recommended that he be held accountable for approximately six kilograms of cocaine base over a one-year period. The PSR did not explain how it reached this drug-quantity determination, but instead merely stated that the finding was based on \"the evidence presented at trial, and the testimony of drug expert Eddie Vidal.\"</p>\n<p>Correa-Alicea filed objections to the PSR, contending that the drug-quantity finding was incorrect because it was based on unreliable expert witness testimony from Agent Vidal-Gil. At the sentencing hearing, after argument from counsel on this point, the district court adopted the PSR's recommendation and found that Correa-Alicea was responsible for in excess of 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Like the PSR, the district court did not explain how it reached its drug-quantity determination, but instead simply stated that its finding was based on \"the evidence presented at trial.\"</p>\n<p>Based on the finding that Correa-Alicea was responsible for in excess of 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, the district court assigned him a base offense level of 38. U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(1). The court applied a one-level enhancement because the offense was committed in a protected location, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.2(a)(2), and a three-level enhancement because Correa-Alicea was a leader in the criminal activity, U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b), for a total offense level of 42. Combined with a Criminal History Category of I, this offense level resulted in a guidelines imprisonment range of 360 months to life, and the court sentenced Correa-Alicea to a prison term of 360 months.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Calculating Drug Quantity</h2>\n<p>Under the sentencing guidelines, the base offense level largely depends upon the total drug quantities involved in the offense. U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c). If the quantity of drugs seized does not accurately reflect the scale of a drug-distribution conspiracy, the district court must \"approximate the [total] quantity of the controlled substance.\" U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12. Because Correa-Alicea was convicted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> of conspiring to distribute controlled substances, he is responsible \"not only for the drugs he actually handled but also for the full amount of drugs that he could reasonably have anticipated would be within the ambit of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Santos,</i> 357 F.3d 136, 140 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>A district court's finding as to drug quantity \"need only be by a preponderance of the evidence and is not required to be an exact determination but rather only a reasoned estimate.\" <i>Rodríguez,</i> 525 F.3d at 107; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Laboy,</i> 351 F.3d 578, 584 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that when \"it is impossible or impractical to obtain an exact drug quantity for sentencing purposes, a reasoned estimate will suffice\"). The sentencing court has \"broad discretion in determining which data are sufficiently dependable for sentencing purposes.\" <i>United States v. Rivera-Maldonado,</i> 194 F.3d 224, 228 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999). Although the court \"may rely on reasonable estimates and averages\" to reach its drug-quantity determination, those estimates must possess adequate indicia of reliability and demonstrable record support. <i>Id.</i> at 228. We \"cannot uphold a drug quantity calculation on the basis of hunch or intuition.\" <i>United States v. Marrero-Ortiz,</i> 160 F.3d 768, 780 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p>We review the district court's factual finding as to drug quantity for clear error. <i>Rodríguez,</i> 525 F.3d at 107. In reviewing the court's drug-quantity finding, our task is to \"determine whether the government presented sufficient reliable information to permit the court reasonably to conclude that [Correa-Alicia was] responsible for a quantity of drugs at least equal to the quantity threshold for the assigned base offense level.\" <i>United States v. Barnett,</i> 989 F.2d 546, 553 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Pizarro-Berríos,</i> 448 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2006) (holding that if a district court makes an erroneous factual finding under the sentencing guidelines, yet \"there is enough evidence to support the alternative explanation for the court's finding, the error would be harmless and there would be no reason to remand to the district court when the result will be the same.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Correa-Alicea's Challenge to the Drug-Quantity Determination</h2>\n<p>Correa-Alicea argues that the district court erroneously found that he was individually responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base. Relatedly, he challenges the admission of Agent Vidal-Gil's testimony, which he claims provided the basis for the court's drug-quantity determination. He argues that Vidal-Gil's testimony was unreliable and not based on recognized scientific techniques, and therefore was improperly admitted as expert testimony. The government responds that, even if Vidal-Gil's testimony was unreliable, an alternate calculation based on the stipulated quantities of cocaine base purchased in two controlled transactions adequately supports the district court's 4.5 kilogram finding. We agree with the government's contention. Because we conclude that the district court's drug-quantity determination is sufficiently supported by reliable evidence independent of Vidal-Gil's testimony, we need not reach the question of whether the district court erred in admitting Vidal-Gil's testimony. <i>See </i><i>Barnett,</i> 989 F.2d at 553; <i>see also </i><i>Pizarro-Berríos,</i> 448 F.3d at 8.</p>\n<p>At trial, the parties stipulated to the quantity of cocaine base recovered from each of two controlled purchases: on February 16, 2006, Colón-González purchased cocaine base with a net weight of 17.1 grams, and on May 4, 2006, Ortiz-Cruz purchased cocaine base with a net weight <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> of 24.3 grams.<sup>[3]</sup> These controlled purchases were recorded on audio tape, and the audio recordings were admitted as evidence at trial. According to the testimony of Ortiz-Cruz and Colón-González, long-time residents of the housing project, Correa-Alicea was \"in charge\" of the drug point and was involved in the conspiracy from November 2005 until November 2006. The drug point operated for at least sixteen hours every day, and a large number of people visited the drug point daily.</p>\n<p>Based on this evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that, over the course of the year-long conspiracy, Correa-Alicea's drug point made <i>at least</i> one cocaine base sale per day in an amount comparable to the controlled purchases. Using the smaller controlled purchase of 17.1 grams as a sample, 6.2415 kilograms of cocaine base are reasonably attributable to Correa-Alicea over the one-year conspiracy (17.1 grams of cocaine base sold per day, multiplied by 365 days per year). Using the larger controlled purchase of 24.3 grams, he is accountable for 8.8695 kilograms (24.3 grams of cocaine base sold per day, multiplied by 365 days per year). Even the more conservative estimate of 6.24 kilograms is significantly more than the 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base attributed to Correa-Alicea by the district court. The court's finding as to drug quantity was not a mere \"hunch or intuition,\" <i>see </i><i>Marrero-Ortiz,</i> 160 F.3d at 780, but was a \"reasoned estimate\" based on reliable evidence in the record. <i>See Rodríguez,</i> 525 F.3d at 107.</p>\n<p>Relying on our decision in <i>Rivera-Maldonado,</i> 194 F.3d 224, Correa-Alicea contends that the quantity of drugs purchased in the two controlled buys does not provide a reasonable basis for the district court's 4.5 kilogram finding, and asserts that any estimate of drug quantity based on these two buys \"would not have been arrived at in a scientifically sound and methodologically reliable manner.\" We disagree.</p>\n<p>In <i>Rivera-Maldonado,</i> we recognized that \"[g]enerally speaking, the smaller the sampling, the less reliable the resulting probability estimate,\" and an estimate of drug quantity may be unreliable if based on an extrapolation from too small a sample. <i>Id.</i> at 231. We held that it was improper for the sentencing court to estimate the average drug transaction size using a very small sample of controlled buys over the course of a six-month investigation. <i>Id.</i> at 233. The sampling in that case was \"minuscule,\" \"twelve controlled buys drawn from a set of 86,400 transactions (20 transactions per hour, times 24 hours per day, times 180 days),\" and there was no evidence that the twelve controlled buys were representative of ordinary drug transactions at the drug point. <i>Id.</i> at 231-32. Furthermore, the other estimates upon which the total drug-quantity finding was based, including the average number of transactions per hour and average operating hours per day, were also unreliable, and therefore \"the risk of error was compounded by pyramiding unreliable inferences.\" <i>Id.</i> at 233. We concluded that the sentencing court's drug-quantity determination was not based on sufficiently reliable information, and remanded the case for resentencing. <i>Id.</i> at 233; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Culps,</i> 300 F.3d 1069, 1078 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that an estimate of average drug quantity for 60,250 transactions based on nine controlled buys was statistically and legally unreliable); <i>United States v. Butler,</i> 41 F.3d 1435, 1447 (11th Cir.1995) (rejecting an estimate of sixty-six drug transactions per day based solely on a videotape of transactions occurring on a single day, where there was no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> evidence that single day was \"typical\" or \"average\").</p>\n<p>In this case, however, the sample used for calculating average drug transaction size is proportionately much larger, and therefore more reliable, than in <i>Rivera-Maldonado:</i> two controlled buys drawn from a set of 365 transactions (one per day for a year), rather than twelve buys drawn from 86,400 transactions. Furthermore, unlike in <i>Rivera-Maldonado,</i> the other estimates upon which the total drug-quantity finding is based are reliable, even conservative. The estimate of one transaction per day, or 365 transactions per year, is highly conservative in light of testimony that the drug point operated for sixteen to seventeen hours per day, 365 days per year, and had a large number of customers daily. The district court's ultimate finding that Correa-Alicea was accountable for in excess of 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base is likewise conservative, given that even calculations based on the smaller of the two controlled buys would yield a figure of 6.24 kilograms. The court's finding, although not an \"exact determination\" of drug quantity, <i>see Rodríguez,</i> 525 F.3d at 107, is a reasonable estimate with \"demonstrable record support\" and \"adequate indicia of reliability.\" <i>See </i><i>Rivera-Maldonado,</i> 194 F.3d at 229.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, because there is clear record support for the district court's finding that Correa-Alicea was accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base during the charged conspiracy, we affirm the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Santiago-Torres contends that the cumulative effect of several errors requires a new trial. We disagree and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Voice Identification Expert</h2>\n<p>Santiago-Torres's principal argument is that the district court erred in denying his request to retain a voice identification expert and his related motion for a continuance to secure that expert's presence at trial. We review a denial of a request to fund expert services for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Quñones-Medina,</i> 553 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.2009). The denial of a continuance is likewise reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Durán,</i> 507 F.3d 749, 762 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Prior to trial, upon defense counsel's request, the district court ordered that the defendants and their counsel be permitted to listen on March 6, 2007, to the audio recordings of the controlled purchases. Nearly two months later, on April 30, Santiago-Torres and other defendants filed a motion to continue the trial date set for May 14, citing ongoing investigations and plea negotiations. On May 1, Santiago-Torres submitted a sealed, ex parte motion requesting funds to retain a voice identification expert, asserting that it was not his voice on the incriminating audio recordings, and the only way he could present a defense against the evidence contained in the audio recordings was through such an expert. Two days later, in an order denying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> the April 30 motion for continuance of trial, the court referenced, but did not expressly rule on, Santiago-Torres's ex parte request for a voice identification expert: \"Furthermore, defendants' counsel listened to the United States' evidence on March 6, 2007 and only now request[s] an expert on voice identification.\"<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Santiago-Torres renewed his request for a voice identification expert in a second sealed ex parte motion on May 7. The following day, the court issued sealed orders denying both ex parte motions without prejudice pending completion of the government's case in chief. The district court did not further explain the basis for its denial. On May 14, the day trial was scheduled to start, Santiago-Torres filed a motion again requesting funds to retain a voice identification expert and a continuance to ensure the expert's availability for trial. The court orally denied the motion. At trial, audio recordings of the February 16 purchase by government witness Colón-González and the April 12 and May 4 purchases by government witness Ortiz-Cruz were admitted into evidence over defense counsel's objections.</p>\n<p>As an indigent, Santiago-Torres was entitled to the benefits of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA), 18 U.S.C. § 3006A. The CJA provides that \"a person who is financially unable to obtain ... expert ... services necessary for an adequate defense\" may obtain them after demonstrating in an ex parte hearing that such services are \"necessary.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(e)(1). \"Generally, expert services have been found necessary when the proffered expert testimony was pivotal to the indigent defendant's defense.\" <i>United States v. Manning,</i> 79 F.3d 212, 218 (1st Cir.1996). For example, \"courts have appointed a fingerprint expert when a fingerprint, alleged to be the defendant's, was the primary means of connecting the defendant to the crime, and a psychiatrist when the defendant's sanity at the time of the offense was at issue.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>We discern no abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of Santiago-Torres's ex parte motion for funds to retain a voice identification expert, or his related motion for a continuance to secure that expert's presence at trial. Santiago-Torres's proffered expert testimony was not pivotal to his defense. The audio recordings were not the \"primary means of connecting [Santiago-Torres] to the crime,\" <i>see id.,</i> but instead merely served as corroboration for the ample eyewitness testimony that Santiago-Torres had acted as a runner and seller for the drug point.</p>\n<p>Colón-González testified that she had known Santiago-Torres for three years, and had seen him acting as the runner at the drug point and selling drugs to others behind her house. She further testified that during the February 16 controlled transaction, the seller, Martínez, called Santiago-Torres to see whether he had any additional drugs, and Santiago-Torres brought her two more packages of cocaine base later that day. Ortiz-Cruz testified that he had known Santiago-Torres for more than fifteen years, and had sold drugs at Correa-Alicea's drug point in late 2005, during which time Santiago-Torres also worked as a drug runner and seller. Ortiz-Cruz also testified that he purchased cocaine base directly from Santiago-Torres in the May 4 controlled transaction. In light of this eyewitness testimony, none of which depended on identification of Santiago-Torres's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*493</span> voice on the audio recordings, the voice identification expert services were not critical or necessary to his defense.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as the district court noted, Santiago-Torres's counsel had the opportunity to listen to the audio recordings at issue on March 6, but did not request a continuance until April 30 and did not request funds to retain a voice identification expert until May 1, less than two weeks before his trial was scheduled to begin. Santiago-Torres contends on appeal, as he did in his motion to the district court, that his requests were delayed because he spent weeks trying to locate a voice identification expert available to come to Puerto Rico. However, he does not explain why he could not have made his requests for expert services and for a continuance <i>prior</i> to locating an available expert, and the district court could reasonably have found that the requests were unreasonably dilatory. In light of these facts, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying Santiago-Torres's requests for a continuance and for funds to retain the proffered expert.</p>\n<p>Santiago-Torres further contends that the district court erred in disclosing his ex parte request for a voice identification expert in its May 3, 2007 denial of his motion for a continuance. The government correctly concedes error on this point. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Abreu,</i> 202 F.3d 386, 391 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that district court erred in not handling entire application for expert services under 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(e)(1) on an ex parte basis, and explaining that the \"manifest purpose of requiring that the inquiry be ex parte is to insure that the defendant will not have to make a premature disclosure of his case\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). However, voice identification was not pivotal to Santiago-Torres's defense. Even absent the audio recordings, the government presented overwhelming evidence of his guilt. Therefore, we find that the court's error in not handling his expert request on an ex parte basis was harmless.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Alleged Discovery Violations</h2>\n<p>Santiago-Torres further contends that the district court failed to remedy two alleged discovery violations by the government.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Disclosure of Photograph</h2>\n<p>First, Santiago-Torres contends that the court erred in not ordering the government to produce a photograph shown to Colón-González prior to trial, which he argues was subject to disclosure under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. We review the court's determination under Rule 16 for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Caro-Muñiz,</i> 406 F.3d 22, 29 (1st Cir. 2005). We find no such abuse here.</p>\n<p>Colón-González testified that she had personally identified both defendants to DEA agents while she and the agents were riding in an undercover car, and she had later identified Santiago-Torres in a photograph shown to her by DEA agents. Santiago-Torres objected on the ground that, during discovery, he had asked the prosecution for information about any identification procedures used in the investigation, such as photographic line-ups, and the government had responded that no such procedures had occurred. Santiago-Torres contended that the government should have disclosed the photograph during discovery so that he could cross-examine Colón-González about her identification, and requested that the court order production of the photograph. The government argued that the photograph was irrelevant because Colón-González knew Santiago-Torres from personal interactions, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*494</span> and did not identify him based on the photograph. The court denied Santiago-Torres's request, accepting the government's assertion that the photograph was not the basis for her identification of Santiago-Torres because she knew him personally.</p>\n<p>The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order production of the pretrial photograph. Rule 16 requires disclosure of documents and objects within the government's possession, custody or control upon a defendant's request if \"(i) the item is material to preparing the defense; (ii) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial; or (iii) the item was obtained from or belongs to the defendant.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(E). Santiago-Torres contends that the photograph was material to his defense because it could have been used during cross-examination of Colón-González and could have formed the basis for a \"pretrial motion to suppress the reliability of her identification.\" However, nothing in the record indicates that Colón-González identified Santiago-Torres on the basis of the photograph. To the contrary, she testified that she had known Santiago-Torres for three years and purchased drugs from him, and that, before being shown the photograph, she had identified him in-person while riding in an undercover car with DEA agents. Thus, the photograph was not material and the government was not required to disclose it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Disclosure of Audio Recording</h2>\n<p>Santiago-Torres contends that the district court erred in denying his request for a mistrial based on the government's alleged failure to produce the April 12, 2006 audio recording during pretrial discovery. We review the court's denial of a mistrial motion for a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Van Anh,</i> 523 F.3d 43, 54 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>At trial, after the audio recording of Ortiz-Cruz's April 12 controlled purchase was played for the jury, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, claiming that he had not received the recording during discovery. He stated that during pretrial discovery he had received a recording marked \"April 12\" along with a transcript, but the recording was inaudible. He then requested and received a second copy of the recording and transcript from the government, also marked \"April 12,\" but he claimed that this was not the recording played at trial. The government maintained that it had provided defense counsel with copies of the April 12 recording and the transcript on two occasions well in advance of trial, and defense counsel should have notified the government if the recording did not match the transcript. The district court then listened to the recording at issue and denied Santiago-Torres's motion, explaining that \"whatever the CD wasthat was providedI mean, it was easily determined that itit wasn't the proper CD by just looking at the transcript.\"</p>\n<p>We find no abuse of discretion in the court's ruling. The court reasonably concluded that, even if the incorrect recording was mistakenly provided, defense counsel could have easily discovered the error and requested the correct recording from the government. Moreover, Santiago-Torres has not shown that he was prejudiced by the government's alleged failure to produce the correct recording prior to trial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Devin,</i> 918 F.2d 280, 290 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]n cases of delayed disclosure, a court's principal concern must be whether learning the information altered the subsequent defense strategy, and whether, given timeous disclosure, a more effective strategy would likely have resulted.\"). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*495</span> He contends that the government's alleged discovery failure caused him to rely on the wrong trial strategy, because his strategy \"was to obtain suppression of the April 12 recording because it was inaudible and therefore inadmissible.\" He further claims that if he had received the correct recording prior to trial, he might have accepted the government's plea offer, \"since the strategy of having the tape excluded on inaudibility grounds would have been foreclosed.\"</p>\n<p>Santiago-Torres's claims of prejudice are not plausible. Defense counsel conceded to the district court that after receiving the first recording, which he claimed was inaudible, he requested and received a second copy of the recording from the government. He did not claim that this second recording was inaudible; instead, he conceded that he listened to the recording and \"understood that this transcript was not really right, that you could not really readyou could not really hear what is in the transcript.\" In addition, defense counsel was permitted to listen to the government's audio recordings in court on March 6, 2007, prior to trial. Defense counsel admitted to the district court that he \"wasn't present for the whole session.\" Finally, although Santiago-Torres claims that his trial strategy was to file a motion to suppress the audio recording, he did not file any such pretrial motion. Santiago-Torres has failed to credibly demonstrate that the alleged discovery failure caused him to adopt a less effective defense strategy, and we are therefore satisfied that any discovery failure was harmless.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Correa-Alicea and Santiago-Torres were indicted along with six co-defendants. The six co-defendants entered into plea agreements, while Correa-Alicea and Santiago-Torres proceeded to a joint trial.</p>\n<p>[2]  The government acknowledges in its brief that Ortiz-Cruz provided inconsistent testimony as to whom he purchased heroin from on April 12. On direct examination, he stated that he bought drugs from \"Colin [Correa-Alicea] and Geraldo [Santiago-Torres]\" on or about April 12. However, he subsequently claimed that he had purchased the drugs on April 12 \"[f]rom Colin,\" which he then repeated on cross-examination. The government now takes the position that the April 12 purchase did not involve Santiago-Torres at all, noting that the transcript of the audio recording of this purchase does not list Santiago-Torres as a speaker.</p>\n<p>[3]  The third controlled purchase, made by Ortiz-Cruz on April 12, 2006, was for heroin rather than cocaine base, and therefore is not relevant to this calculus.</p>\n<p>[4]  Although Correa-Alicea does not raise the argument, it could be contended that an estimate of drug quantity based on controlled buys arranged by government agents is particularly unreliable, as there is no evidence that these buys are representative of sales by ordinary customers. <i>See </i><i>Rivera-Maldonado,</i> 194 F.3d at 232. However, even if the controlled buys stipulated to in this case are somewhat larger than the average buys by ordinary customers at Correa-Alicea's drug point, the calculation outlined above more than compensates for any overestimate in the average drug transaction size by using the extremely conservative estimate of just one drug purchase per day.</p>\n<p>[5]  Santiago-Torres also contends on appeal that the district court erred by stating in this order that Santiago-Torres \"request[s] an expert on voice identification,\" thereby disclosing his ex parte request for a voice identification expert. We discuss this claim of error below.</p>\n\n</div>",

Correa-Alicea was sentenced to a 360-month term of imprisonment, and Santiago-Torres was sentenced to a 324-month term. In this consolidated appeal, Correa-Alicea raises several challenges to his sentence, and Santiago-Torres argues that the cumulative effect of a number of trial errors requires a new trial. We affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>United States v. Flores-de-Jesús,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203873\"><a href=\"/opinion/203873/united-states-v-flores-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p>Between November 2005 and November 2006, approximately six drug points operated at the Arístedes Chavier Housing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*487</span> Project. Appellant Correa-Alicea was \"in charge\" of one of the drug points, and appellant Santiago-Torres was a runner at that point, although he also sold drugs on occasion. Correa-Alicea's drug point operated every day of the year, from 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m., and had a large number of customers daily. The drug point sold cocaine base as well as other narcotics.</p>\n<p>At trial, two government informants testified as to controlled purchases they had made from Correa-Alicea's drug point, and the court admitted into evidence the audio recordings of those purchases. Angélica Colón-González, a lifelong resident of the housing project, testified that she had seen appellants selling drugs to others behind her house in the housing project. She stated that she had known appellants her entire life, although on cross-examination, she clarified that she had known Santiago-Torres for three years. She began cooperating with the DEA in early 2006, and on February 16, 2006, she made a controlled drug purchase of six large packages, each of which contained twenty-five to twenty-six individual packages of cocaine base. Although she and the seller, Sergio Martínez, had agreed the previous day that she would purchase fifteen large packages, he had only four packages available on February 16. Martínez then called appellant Santiago-Torres to see whether Santiago-Torres had any additional drugs, and later that day Santiago-Torres brought Colón-González two more packages of cocaine base. The parties stipulated that the net weight of the cocaine base purchased in the February 16 transaction was 17.1 grams.</p>\n<p>Another long-time resident of the housing project, Javier Ortiz-Cruz, had grown up with Correa-Alicea and had known him for most of his life, and had known Santiago-Torres for more than fifteen years. Ortiz-Cruz sold heroin and crack at Correa-Alicea's drug point in the fall of 2005, during which time Santiago-Torres also acted as a drug runner and seller. Ortiz-Cruz began cooperating with the DEA in 2006, and, on April 12, 2006, he made a controlled purchase of fifteen packets of heroin.<sup>[2]</sup> On May 4, 2006, Ortiz-Cruz made a purchase of eight packets of cocaine base from Santiago-Torres, whom he identified as one of Correa-Alicea's sellers. Correa-Alicea was also present at this purchase, and the witness identified both Correa-Alicea and Santiago-Torres on the audio recording of the purchase. The parties stipulated that the net weight of the cocaine base purchased in the May 4 transaction was 24.3 grams.</p>\n<p>The government also presented the testimony of Eddie Vidal-Gil, a Puerto Rico Police Department agent in charge of the investigation conducted at the housing project. The district court accepted Agent Vidal-Gil as an expert on drug trafficking. Vidal-Gil testified that Correa-Alicea's drug point sold cocaine base in small plastic bags, each with a net weight of .07 grams. He further testified, over defense counsel's objection, as to the quantity of drugs sold during his surveillance of the drug point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> Q Okay. And during the times that you actually performed surveillance at the Defendants' drug point, how many buys of those little baggies did you see occur during the time period that you were looking at the drug point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A Well, so many that I couldn't really count them. I would say in a period of 25 minutes or half an hour that I would be surveilling the drug point, many more than 10, 15, of these small bags containing crack would be sold in that period of time.</blockquote>\n<p>The jury found appellants guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base and detectable amounts of cocaine and heroin in the housing project, within 1,000 feet of a public school. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846, 860. At sentencing, the district court found Correa-Alicea accountable for in excess of 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, and sentenced him to a prison term of 360 months. In a separate sentencing proceeding, the court found Santiago-Torres accountable for in excess of 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, and sentenced him to a 324-month term.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Correa-Alicea challenges his sentence, and Santiago-Torres contends that his conviction should be reversed. We address each appellant's claims in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Correa-Alicea's Sentence</h2>\n<p>Correa-Alicea's Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) recommended that he be held accountable for approximately six kilograms of cocaine base over a one-year period. The PSR did not explain how it reached this drug-quantity determination, but instead merely stated that the finding was based on \"the evidence presented at trial, and the testimony of drug expert Eddie Vidal.\"</p>\n<p>Correa-Alicea filed objections to the PSR, contending that the drug-quantity finding was incorrect because it was based on unreliable expert witness testimony from Agent Vidal-Gil. At the sentencing hearing, after argument from counsel on this point, the district court adopted the PSR's recommendation and found that Correa-Alicea was responsible for in excess of 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Like the PSR, the district court did not explain how it reached its drug-quantity determination, but instead simply stated that its finding was based on \"the evidence presented at trial.\"</p>\n<p>Based on the finding that Correa-Alicea was responsible for in excess of 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, the district court assigned him a base offense level of 38. U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(1). The court applied a one-level enhancement because the offense was committed in a protected location, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.2(a)(2), and a three-level enhancement because Correa-Alicea was a leader in the criminal activity, U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b), for a total offense level of 42. Combined with a Criminal History Category of I, this offense level resulted in a guidelines imprisonment range of 360 months to life, and the court sentenced Correa-Alicea to a prison term of 360 months.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Calculating Drug Quantity</h2>\n<p>Under the sentencing guidelines, the base offense level largely depends upon the total drug quantities involved in the offense. U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c). If the quantity of drugs seized does not accurately reflect the scale of a drug-distribution conspiracy, the district court must \"approximate the [total] quantity of the controlled substance.\" U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12. Because Correa-Alicea was convicted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> of conspiring to distribute controlled substances, he is responsible \"not only for the drugs he actually handled but also for the full amount of drugs that he could reasonably have anticipated would be within the ambit of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Santos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200851\"><a href=\"/opinion/200851/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 140 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>A district court's finding as to drug quantity \"need only be by a preponderance of the evidence and is not required to be an exact determination but rather only a reasoned estimate.\" <i>Rodríguez,</i> 525 F.3d at 107; <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

In reviewing the court's drug-quantity finding, our task is to \"determine whether the government presented sufficient reliable information to permit the court reasonably to conclude that [Correa-Alicia was] responsible for a quantity of drugs at least equal to the quantity threshold for the assigned base offense level.\" <i>United States v. Barnett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603504\"><a href=\"/opinion/603504/united-states-v-michael-barnett-united-states-of-america-v-barry-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 553 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

Correa-Alicea's Challenge to the Drug-Quantity Determination</h2>\n<p>Correa-Alicea argues that the district court erroneously found that he was individually responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base. Relatedly, he challenges the admission of Agent Vidal-Gil's testimony, which he claims provided the basis for the court's drug-quantity determination. He argues that Vidal-Gil's testimony was unreliable and not based on recognized scientific techniques, and therefore was improperly admitted as expert testimony. The government responds that, even if Vidal-Gil's testimony was unreliable, an alternate calculation based on the stipulated quantities of cocaine base purchased in two controlled transactions adequately supports the district court's 4.5 kilogram finding. We agree with the government's contention. Because we conclude that the district court's drug-quantity determination is sufficiently supported by reliable evidence independent of Vidal-Gil's testimony, we need not reach the question of whether the district court erred in admitting Vidal-Gil's testimony. <i>See </i><i>Barnett,</i> 989 F.2d at 553; <i>see also </i><i>Pizarro-Berríos,</i> 448 F.3d at 8.</p>\n<p>At trial, the parties stipulated to the quantity of cocaine base recovered from each of two controlled purchases: on February 16, 2006, Colón-González purchased cocaine base with a net weight of 17.1 grams, and on May 4, 2006, Ortiz-Cruz purchased cocaine base with a net weight <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> of 24.3 grams.<sup>[3]</sup> These controlled purchases were recorded on audio tape, and the audio recordings were admitted as evidence at trial. According to the testimony of Ortiz-Cruz and Colón-González, long-time residents of the housing project, Correa-Alicea was \"in charge\" of the drug point and was involved in the conspiracy from November 2005 until November 2006. The drug point operated for at least sixteen hours every day, and a large number of people visited the drug point daily.</p>\n<p>Based on this evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that, over the course of the year-long conspiracy, Correa-Alicea's drug point made <i>at least</i> one cocaine base sale per day in an amount comparable to the controlled purchases. Using the smaller controlled purchase of 17.1 grams as a sample, 6.2415 kilograms of cocaine base are reasonably attributable to Correa-Alicea over the one-year conspiracy (17.1 grams of cocaine base sold per day, multiplied by 365 days per year). Using the larger controlled purchase of 24.3 grams, he is accountable for 8.8695 kilograms (24.3 grams of cocaine base sold per day, multiplied by 365 days per year). Even the more conservative estimate of 6.24 kilograms is significantly more than the 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base attributed to Correa-Alicea by the district court. The court's finding as to drug quantity was not a mere \"hunch or intuition,\" <i>see </i><i>Marrero-Ortiz,</i> 160 F.3d at 780, but was a \"reasoned estimate\" based on reliable evidence in the record. <i>See Rodríguez,</i> 525 F.3d at 107.</p>\n<p>Relying on our decision in <i>Rivera-Maldonado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198682\"><a href=\"/opinion/198682/united-states-v-rivera-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, Correa-Alicea contends that the quantity of drugs purchased in the two controlled buys does not provide a reasonable basis for the district court's 4.5 kilogram finding, and asserts that any estimate of drug quantity based on these two buys \"would not have been arrived at in a scientifically sound and methodologically reliable manner.\" We disagree.</p>\n<p>In <i>Rivera-Maldonado,</i> we recognized that \"[g]enerally speaking, the smaller the sampling, the less reliable the resulting probability estimate,\" and an estimate of drug quantity may be unreliable if based on an extrapolation from too small a sample. <i>Id.</i> at 231. We held that it was improper for the sentencing court to estimate the average drug transaction size using a very small sample of controlled buys over the course of a six-month investigation. <i>Id.</i> at 233. The sampling in that case was \"minuscule,\" \"twelve controlled buys drawn from a set of 86,400 transactions (20 transactions per hour, times 24 hours per day, times 180 days),\" and there was no evidence that the twelve controlled buys were representative of ordinary drug transactions at the drug point. <i>Id.</i> at 231-32. Furthermore, the other estimates upon which the total drug-quantity finding was based, including the average number of transactions per hour and average operating hours per day, were also unreliable, and therefore \"the risk of error was compounded by pyramiding unreliable inferences.\" <i>Id.</i> at 233. We concluded that the sentencing court's drug-quantity determination was not based on sufficiently reliable information, and remanded the case for resentencing. <i>Id.</i> at 233; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Culps,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778825\"><a href=\"/opinion/778825/united-states-v-levi-culps/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1069</span></a></span>, 1078 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that an estimate of average drug quantity for 60,250 transactions based on nine controlled buys was statistically and legally unreliable); <i>United States v. Butler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683603\"><a href=\"/opinion/683603/united-states-v-harvey-eugene-butler-justice-vandell-hudson-aka-jet/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1435</span></a></span>, 1447 (11th Cir.1995) (rejecting an estimate of sixty-six drug transactions per day based solely on a videotape of transactions occurring on a single day, where there was no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> evidence that single day was \"typical\" or \"average\").</p>\n<p>In this case, however, the sample used for calculating average drug transaction size is proportionately much larger, and therefore more reliable, than in <i>Rivera-Maldonado:</i> two controlled buys drawn from a set of 365 transactions (one per day for a year), rather than twelve buys drawn from 86,400 transactions. Furthermore, unlike in <i>Rivera-Maldonado,</i> the other estimates upon which the total drug-quantity finding is based are reliable, even conservative. The estimate of one transaction per day, or 365 transactions per year, is highly conservative in light of testimony that the drug point operated for sixteen to seventeen hours per day, 365 days per year, and had a large number of customers daily. The district court's ultimate finding that Correa-Alicea was accountable for in excess of 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base is likewise conservative, given that even calculations based on the smaller of the two controlled buys would yield a figure of 6.24 kilograms. The court's finding, although not an \"exact determination\" of drug quantity, <i>see Rodríguez,</i> 525 F.3d at 107, is a reasonable estimate with \"demonstrable record support\" and \"adequate indicia of reliability.\" <i>See </i><i>Rivera-Maldonado,</i> 194 F.3d at 229.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, because there is clear record support for the district court's finding that Correa-Alicea was accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base during the charged conspiracy, we affirm the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Santiago-Torres contends that the cumulative effect of several errors requires a new trial. We disagree and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Voice Identification Expert</h2>\n<p>Santiago-Torres's principal argument is that the district court erred in denying his request to retain a voice identification expert and his related motion for a continuance to secure that expert's presence at trial. We review a denial of a request to fund expert services for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Quñones-Medina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203622\"><a href=\"/opinion/203622/united-states-v-quinones-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2009). The denial of a continuance is likewise reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Durán,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203028\"><a href=\"/opinion/203028/united-states-v-rodriguez-duran/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, 762 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Prior to trial, upon defense counsel's request, the district court ordered that the defendants and their counsel be permitted to listen on March 6, 2007, to the audio recordings of the controlled purchases. Nearly two months later, on April 30, Santiago-Torres and other defendants filed a motion to continue the trial date set for May 14, citing ongoing investigations and plea negotiations. On May 1, Santiago-Torres submitted a sealed, ex parte motion requesting funds to retain a voice identification expert, asserting that it was not his voice on the incriminating audio recordings, and the only way he could present a defense against the evidence contained in the audio recordings was through such an expert. Two days later, in an order denying <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> the April 30 motion for continuance of trial, the court referenced, but did not expressly rule on, Santiago-Torres's ex parte request for a voice identification expert: \"Furthermore, defendants' counsel listened to the United States' evidence on March 6, 2007 and only now request[s] an expert on voice identification.\"<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Santiago-Torres renewed his request for a voice identification expert in a second sealed ex parte motion on May 7. The following day, the court issued sealed orders denying both ex parte motions without prejudice pending completion of the government's case in chief. The district court did not further explain the basis for its denial. On May 14, the day trial was scheduled to start, Santiago-Torres filed a motion again requesting funds to retain a voice identification expert and a continuance to ensure the expert's availability for trial. The court orally denied the motion. At trial, audio recordings of the February 16 purchase by government witness Colón-González and the April 12 and May 4 purchases by government witness Ortiz-Cruz were admitted into evidence over defense counsel's objections.</p>\n<p>As an indigent, Santiago-Torres was entitled to the benefits of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA), 18 U.S.C. § 3006A. The CJA provides that \"a person who is financially unable to obtain ... expert ... services necessary for an adequate defense\" may obtain them after demonstrating in an ex parte hearing that such services are \"necessary.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(e)(1). \"Generally, expert services have been found necessary when the proffered expert testimony was pivotal to the indigent defendant's defense.\" <i>United States v. Manning,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196640\"><a href=\"/opinion/196640/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 218 (1st Cir.1996). For example, \"courts have appointed a fingerprint expert when a fingerprint, alleged to be the defendant's, was the primary means of connecting the defendant to the crime, and a psychiatrist when the defendant's sanity at the time of the offense was at issue.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>We discern no abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of Santiago-Torres's ex parte motion for funds to retain a voice identification expert, or his related motion for a continuance to secure that expert's presence at trial. Santiago-Torres's proffered expert testimony was not pivotal to his defense. The audio recordings were not the \"primary means of connecting [Santiago-Torres] to the crime,\" <i>see id.,</i> but instead merely served as corroboration for the ample eyewitness testimony that Santiago-Torres had acted as a runner and seller for the drug point.</p>\n<p>Colón-González testified that she had known Santiago-Torres for three years, and had seen him acting as the runner at the drug point and selling drugs to others behind her house. She further testified that during the February 16 controlled transaction, the seller, Martínez, called Santiago-Torres to see whether he had any additional drugs, and Santiago-Torres brought her two more packages of cocaine base later that day. Ortiz-Cruz testified that he had known Santiago-Torres for more than fifteen years, and had sold drugs at Correa-Alicea's drug point in late 2005, during which time Santiago-Torres also worked as a drug runner and seller. Ortiz-Cruz also testified that he purchased cocaine base directly from Santiago-Torres in the May 4 controlled transaction. In light of this eyewitness testimony, none of which depended on identification of Santiago-Torres's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*493</span> voice on the audio recordings, the voice identification expert services were not critical or necessary to his defense.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as the district court noted, Santiago-Torres's counsel had the opportunity to listen to the audio recordings at issue on March 6, but did not request a continuance until April 30 and did not request funds to retain a voice identification expert until May 1, less than two weeks before his trial was scheduled to begin. Santiago-Torres contends on appeal, as he did in his motion to the district court, that his requests were delayed because he spent weeks trying to locate a voice identification expert available to come to Puerto Rico. However, he does not explain why he could not have made his requests for expert services and for a continuance <i>prior</i> to locating an available expert, and the district court could reasonably have found that the requests were unreasonably dilatory. In light of these facts, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying Santiago-Torres's requests for a continuance and for funds to retain the proffered expert.</p>\n<p>Santiago-Torres further contends that the district court erred in disclosing his ex parte request for a voice identification expert in its May 3, 2007 denial of his motion for a continuance. The government correctly concedes error on this point. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Abreu,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767479\"><a href=\"/opinion/767479/united-states-of-america-apellee-v-joselito-abreu-aka-jose-a-lora/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 391 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that district court erred in not handling entire application for expert services under 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(e)(1) on an ex parte basis, and explaining that the \"manifest purpose of requiring that the inquiry be ex parte is to insure that the defendant will not have to make a premature disclosure of his case\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). However, voice identification was not pivotal to Santiago-Torres's defense. Even absent the audio recordings, the government presented overwhelming evidence of his guilt. Therefore, we find that the court's error in not handling his expert request on an ex parte basis was harmless.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Alleged Discovery Violations</h2>\n<p>Santiago-Torres further contends that the district court failed to remedy two alleged discovery violations by the government.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Disclosure of Photograph</h2>\n<p>First, Santiago-Torres contends that the court erred in not ordering the government to produce a photograph shown to Colón-González prior to trial, which he argues was subject to disclosure under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. We review the court's determination under Rule 16 for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Caro-Muñiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201553\"><a href=\"/opinion/201553/united-states-v-caro-muniz/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir. 2005). We find no such abuse here.</p>\n<p>Colón-González testified that she had personally identified both defendants to DEA agents while she and the agents were riding in an undercover car, and she had later identified Santiago-Torres in a photograph shown to her by DEA agents. Santiago-Torres objected on the ground that, during discovery, he had asked the prosecution for information about any identification procedures used in the investigation, such as photographic line-ups, and the government had responded that no such procedures had occurred. Santiago-Torres contended that the government should have disclosed the photograph during discovery so that he could cross-examine Colón-González about her identification, and requested that the court order production of the photograph. The government argued that the photograph was irrelevant because Colón-González knew Santiago-Torres from personal interactions, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*494</span> and did not identify him based on the photograph. The court denied Santiago-Torres's request, accepting the government's assertion that the photograph was not the basis for her identification of Santiago-Torres because she knew him personally.</p>\n<p>The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order production of the pretrial photograph. Rule 16 requires disclosure of documents and objects within the government's possession, custody or control upon a defendant's request if \"(i) the item is material to preparing the defense; (ii) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial; or (iii) the item was obtained from or belongs to the defendant.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(E). Santiago-Torres contends that the photograph was material to his defense because it could have been used during cross-examination of Colón-González and could have formed the basis for a \"pretrial motion to suppress the reliability of her identification.\" However, nothing in the record indicates that Colón-González identified Santiago-Torres on the basis of the photograph. To the contrary, she testified that she had known Santiago-Torres for three years and purchased drugs from him, and that, before being shown the photograph, she had identified him in-person while riding in an undercover car with DEA agents. Thus, the photograph was not material and the government was not required to disclose it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Disclosure of Audio Recording</h2>\n<p>Santiago-Torres contends that the district court erred in denying his request for a mistrial based on the government's alleged failure to produce the April 12, 2006 audio recording during pretrial discovery. We review the court's denial of a mistrial motion for a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Van Anh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203238\"><a href=\"/opinion/203238/united-states-v-van-anh/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>At trial, after the audio recording of Ortiz-Cruz's April 12 controlled purchase was played for the jury, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, claiming that he had not received the recording during discovery. He stated that during pretrial discovery he had received a recording marked \"April 12\" along with a transcript, but the recording was inaudible. He then requested and received a second copy of the recording and transcript from the government, also marked \"April 12,\" but he claimed that this was not the recording played at trial. The government maintained that it had provided defense counsel with copies of the April 12 recording and the transcript on two occasions well in advance of trial, and defense counsel should have notified the government if the recording did not match the transcript. The district court then listened to the recording at issue and denied Santiago-Torres's motion, explaining that \"whatever the CD wasthat was providedI mean, it was easily determined that itit wasn't the proper CD by just looking at the transcript.\"</p>\n<p>We find no abuse of discretion in the court's ruling. The court reasonably concluded that, even if the incorrect recording was mistakenly provided, defense counsel could have easily discovered the error and requested the correct recording from the government. Moreover, Santiago-Torres has not shown that he was prejudiced by the government's alleged failure to produce the correct recording prior to trial. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Devin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551278\"><a href=\"/opinion/551278/united-states-v-francis-e-devin/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 290 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]n cases of delayed disclosure, a court's principal concern must be whether learning the information altered the subsequent defense strategy, and whether, given timeous disclosure, a more effective strategy would likely have resulted.\"). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*495</span> He contends that the government's alleged discovery failure caused him to rely on the wrong trial strategy, because his strategy \"was to obtain suppression of the April 12 recording because it was inaudible and therefore inadmissible.\" He further claims that if he had received the correct recording prior to trial, he might have accepted the government's plea offer, \"since the strategy of having the tape excluded on inaudibility grounds would have been foreclosed.\"</p>\n<p>Santiago-Torres's claims of prejudice are not plausible. Defense counsel conceded to the district court that after receiving the first recording, which he claimed was inaudible, he requested and received a second copy of the recording from the government. He did not claim that this second recording was inaudible; instead, he conceded that he listened to the recording and \"understood that this transcript was not really right, that you could not really readyou could not really hear what is in the transcript.\" In addition, defense counsel was permitted to listen to the government's audio recordings in court on March 6, 2007, prior to trial. Defense counsel admitted to the district court that he \"wasn't present for the whole session.\" Finally, although Santiago-Torres claims that his trial strategy was to file a motion to suppress the audio recording, he did not file any such pretrial motion. Santiago-Torres has failed to credibly demonstrate that the alleged discovery failure caused him to adopt a less effective defense strategy, and we are therefore satisfied that any discovery failure was harmless.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Correa-Alicea and Santiago-Torres were indicted along with six co-defendants. The six co-defendants entered into plea agreements, while Correa-Alicea and Santiago-Torres proceeded to a joint trial.</p>\n<p>[2]  The government acknowledges in its brief that Ortiz-Cruz provided inconsistent testimony as to whom he purchased heroin from on April 12. On direct examination, he stated that he bought drugs from \"Colin [Correa-Alicea] and Geraldo [Santiago-Torres]\" on or about April 12. However, he subsequently claimed that he had purchased the drugs on April 12 \"[f]rom Colin,\" which he then repeated on cross-examination. The government now takes the position that the April 12 purchase did not involve Santiago-Torres at all, noting that the transcript of the audio recording of this purchase does not list Santiago-Torres as a speaker.</p>\n<p>[3]  The third controlled purchase, made by Ortiz-Cruz on April 12, 2006, was for heroin rather than cocaine base, and therefore is not relevant to this calculus.</p>\n<p>[4]  Although Correa-Alicea does not raise the argument, it could be contended that an estimate of drug quantity based on controlled buys arranged by government agents is particularly unreliable, as there is no evidence that these buys are representative of sales by ordinary customers. <i>See </i><i>Rivera-Maldonado,</i> 194 F.3d at 232. However, even if the controlled buys stipulated to in this case are somewhat larger than the average buys by ordinary customers at Correa-Alicea's drug point, the calculation outlined above more than compensates for any overestimate in the average drug transaction size by using the extremely conservative estimate of just one drug purchase per day.</p>\n<p>[5]  Santiago-Torres also contends on appeal that the district court erred by stating in this order that Santiago-Torres \"request[s] an expert on voice identification,\" thereby disclosing his ex parte request for a voice identification expert. We discuss this claim of error below.</p>\n\n</div>",
