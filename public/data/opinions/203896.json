App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric\nH. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey as the respondent.\n     **\n          Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.       The petitioner, Zhou Zheng, is a\n\nChinese national.     She seeks judicial review of a final order of\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that affirmed both an order\n\nof removal and the concomitant denial of a cross-application for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United\n\nNations Convention Against Torture (CAT).          Concluding, as we do,\n\nthat the BIA's decision is supported by substantial evidence, we\n\ndeny the petition for judicial review.\n\n            The facts are straightforward.         The petitioner entered\n\nthe United States illegally in December of 1998.          While living in\n\nMassachusetts, she married and bore two children (one in 2002 and\n\nthe other in 2005).\n\n            On January 12, 2005, the petitioner applied for asylum\n\nand   withholding    of   removal.1    Following   an   asylum   interview,\n\nfederal authorities denied her application and referred the matter\n\nof    her   status   to   the   immigration    court.      See   8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(1)(B).     Removal proceedings began.\n\n            The petitioner appeared in the immigration court on\n\nOctober 24, 2006.     She conceded removability but cross-applied for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n\n      1\n       An alien ordinarily must file for asylum within one year of\nher arrival in the United States. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B);\nPan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 2007). Here, however,\nthe immigration judge found that the petitioner qualified for the\n\"extraordinary circumstances\" exception to this rule. See 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1158(a)(2)(D).      The respondent has not challenged that\ndetermination.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f            The petitioner testified that, even though she was unwed\n\nand had no children at the time, she left China in order to avoid\n\nthat country's repressive family planning restrictions.              Now that\n\nshe had two children, she feared that a return to her homeland\n\nwould lead either to forcible sterilization or some disadvantage to\n\nher children. In support, the petitioner presented affidavits from\n\nseveral family members who claimed to have been subjected to\n\ninvoluntary abortions or sterilization.                 In this regard, the\n\npetitioner    testified   that   her   mother     was   forcibly   sterilized\n\nfollowing the birth of her third child twenty-five years earlier.\n\nShe added, through testimony and other evidence, that her cousin's\n\nwife was sterilized in 1986 after having two children; that a\n\ndifferent cousin's wife was sterilized in 2004 after having two\n\nchildren; that her sister-in-law's husband was forcibly sterilized\n\nin 1997 after siring two children;2 and that her sister was forced\n\nto undergo an abortion in 2000. Finally, the government introduced\n\na 2005 State Department country conditions report (2005 Profile).\n\n            This   compendium    of    evidence     did    not   impress   the\n\nimmigration    judge   (IJ).     In    his   view,      the   petitioner   had\n\nestablished a genuine fear of forced sterilization, but she had\n\nfailed to establish that this subjective fear was objectively\n\n\n\n\n     2\n         All of the children mentioned in this paragraph were born in\nChina.\n\n                                      -3-\n\freasonable.    Consequently, the IJ denied the petitioner's requests\n\nfor relief and ordered her removal.\n\n            The petitioner appealed to the BIA, arguing that the 2005\n\nProfile showed that Chinese citizens returning to their homeland\n\nwere given \"no special treatment\" in terms of family planning\n\npolicies.     She also argued that simply because American diplomats\n\nwere \"unaware\" of any forced sterilizations imposed upon returnees\n\nwith children born in the United States did not mean that such\n\nincidents did not occur.\n\n            The BIA affirmed the IJ's decree in all respects.          It\n\nheld   that    the   petitioner   had    not   presented   \"specific   and\n\nindividualized evidence\" sufficient to show that she would likely\n\nbe forced to undergo sterilization either in China generally or in\n\nher hometown of Changle City (in Fujian Province) specifically. It\n\nfurther held that the petitioner had not shown that \"any economic\n\nsanctions that may be imposed on her would rise to the level of\n\npersecution.\"\n\n            This timely petition for judicial review followed.         We\n\nhave jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1).\n\n            In removal cases, judicial review ordinarily focuses on\n\nthe decision of the BIA.     Stroni v. Gonzales, 454 F.3d 82, 86 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).     That approach obtains when the BIA has conducted an\n\nindependent evaluation of the record and rested its decision on a\n\nself-generated rationale. See Acevedo-Aguilar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f8, 9 (1st Cir. 2008).           This is such a case.                  The devoir of\n\npersuasion abides with the petitioner. See Pulisir v. Mukasey, 524\n\nF.3d 302, 308 (1st Cir. 2008); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(a).\n\n            The    applicable       standard   of       review   is     the    familiar\n\nsubstantial evidence standard. See, e.g., Sok v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d\n\n48, 52 (1st Cir. 2008).             Absent an error of law,3 this \"highly\n\ndeferential\" standard results in a reversal only if the record\n\nwould compel a reasonable factfinder to reach a different outcome.\n\nLópez de Hincapie v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 218 (1st Cir. 2007);\n\nsee   Pan   v.    Gonzales,   489    F.3d   80,     85   (1st    Cir.      2007).    In\n\nconducting this tamisage, a reviewing court accepts the findings of\n\nfact on which the agency's determination rests so long as those\n\nfindings are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\"                        INS v. Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).\n\n            To    establish   eligibility         for    asylum,      an    alien   must\n\ndemonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.                        See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2); see also Rivas-Mira v.\n\n\n\n      3\n      \"Abstract legal propositions are reviewed de novo, with some\ndeference to the agency's reasonable interpretation of statutes and\nregulations within its ken.\" Chhay v. Mukasey, 540 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\nCir. 2008). There is no error of law apparent here.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fHolder, 556 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2009).                 Because the petitioner does\n\nnot claim to have been the victim of past persecution, she must\n\nprove that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution based\n\non one of the five statutorily protected grounds enumerated above.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); see also Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d\n\n75, 79 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Proof of a well-founded fear entails a showing that the\n\nfear is both subjectively felt and objectively reasonable.                            Jiang\n\nv. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2007).                     A well-founded fear\n\nof forced abortion or sterilization is considered a qualifying fear\n\nof persecution based on political opinion. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42);\n\nXie Mei Zheng v. Gonzales, 475 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            The BIA concluded that the petitioner had not proven that\n\nshe   had   this    well-founded         fear    of     future       persecution.        The\n\npetitioner    demurs;       she    offers    several          reasons    why    the    BIA's\n\nconclusion was unsupported by substantial evidence.                          To her way of\n\nthinking, the BIA misinterpreted the 2005 Profile, failed to give\n\nadequate    weight     to    precedent,         and    abused     its       discretion    in\n\nreferring to the State Department's 2007 country conditions report\n\n(2007   Profile)     without      pausing       to     take    administrative         notice\n\nthereof.    We examine these claims sequentially.\n\n            In     support   of    her     contention         that    the    BIA   did   not\n\nproperly weigh the evidence, the petitioner relies heavily on the\n\nunpublished      decision     in     Cao    v.        Bureau     of     Citizenship      and\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fImmigration Services, 272 F. App'x 14 (2d Cir. 2008).             In that non-\n\nprecedential opinion, see 2d Cir. R. 32.1(b), the court of appeals\n\nremanded because the BIA had \"mischaracterized\" the 2005 Profile,\n\nCao, 272 F. App'x at 15.      But Cao is, at best, only tangentially\n\nrelevant to the case at hand.          The BIA's error there was case-\n\nspecific, and the court of Cao's origin — the Second Circuit —\n\nsubsequently concluded that the 2005 Profile furnishes no concrete\n\nevidence that sterilization is forced upon citizens returning to\n\nFujian Province with American-born children.         See Shao v. Mukasey,\n\n546 F.3d 138, 164 (2d Cir. 2008) (noting that \"[t]he significance\n\nof the [2005] report is highlighted by the fact that, despite the\n\nvoluminous documentary records developed in these . . . cases, none\n\nof the petitioners points us to evidence of any person being\n\nforcibly   sterilized   on   removal   to   China   based    on    having    two\n\nchildren\"); see also Huang v. U.S. INS, 421 F.3d 125, 128-129 (2d\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n           More   importantly,   the     significance   of   Cao     pales    in\n\ncomparison to our own circuit precedent (which is, of course,\n\nbinding on this panel).      We recently adjudicated a petition for\n\nreview embodying facts nearly identical to those presented here.\n\nSee Yen Zheng Zheng v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 70 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nZheng, not Cao, is the beacon by which we must steer.              See United\n\nStates v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fthat, within a multi-panel circuit, panels ordinarily are bound by\n\nprior panel decisions closely on point).\n\n              Zheng, like this case,4 involved a Chinese woman from\n\nFujian Province who was the mother of two American-born children.\n\n546 F.3d at 71.       There, as here, the alien claimed a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution in the form of forced sterilization.\n\nId. at 72.     There as here, she alleged that the BIA had misread the\n\ncountry conditions reports.            Id. at 72-73.         There, as here, the\n\nalien relied mainly on anecdotal evidence to support her claim.5\n\nId. at 72.     The BIA denied relief and affirmed an order of removal.\n\nWe   upheld    that   decision,      ruling       that    nothing   in   the     record\n\ncompelled a contrary conclusion.             Id. at 73.\n\n              The petitioner labors to distinguish Zheng.                      Her most\n\nloudly    bruited     claim   is    that    the    case    arose    in   a    different\n\nprocedural      posture;      the    alien        was    seeking    an       order   for\n\nreinstatement of her appeal.                See id. at 71; see also Liu v.\n\nMukasey, 553 F.3d 37, 39 n.1 (1st Cir. 2009) (discussing standard\n\nof review for reinstatement of appeal).                   That is true, but it is\n\nonly half of the story.         In Zheng, the court found expressly that\n\n\n      4\n       The two cases are about two different (unrelated) women who\nhappen to share the same name.\n      5\n       By and large the evidence presented there was stronger than\nthat presented here.    For example, it included documents from\nFujian Provincial Population and Family Planning Commission and an\naffidavit from an expert on Chinese population control policy.\nZheng, 546 F.3d at 71. No comparable evidence was tendered in this\ncase.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fthe alien had not \"establish[ed] a prima facie case for the\n\n[granting of asylum].\"       546 F.3d at 73.    This was so, the court\n\nexplained, because the evidence did not call into legitimate\n\nquestion the BIA's determination that, among other things, she\n\nlacked a well-founded fear of future persecution.          Id.\n\n           This finding makes Zheng directly relevant to the instant\n\ncase.   It is clear from Zheng, as we said in our earlier case, that\n\nwhen an alien has adduced nothing more than \"background information\n\n[that does] not in any way shed light on this individualized\n\nissue,\" nothing compels a reviewing court to overturn the decision\n\nof the BIA.   Chhay v. Mukasey, 540 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2008).       That\n\nprinciple applies four-square in the instant case.\n\n           The petitioner's other effort to distinguish Zheng is\n\nequally unavailing.    That effort centers on a boast that her proof\n\nis more cogent because, unlike in Zheng, she corroborated her\n\nanecdotal evidence of coercive family planning tactics.              This\n\nrodomontade   misses   the   point:   the   petitioner's    corroborating\n\nevidence does not verify her asseveration that returnees with\n\nAmerican-born children are routinely subjected to coercive family\n\nplanning practices.     Consequently, that evidence is of limited\n\nutility.   See Lin v. Holder, No. 07-1853, 2009 WL 1220783, at *5-6\n\n(4th Cir. May 6, 2009) (unpublished).\n\n           This brings us to the petitioner's second claim of error:\n\nthat the BIA turned a blind eye to precedent.       In this regard, the\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fpetitioner relies on three cases: Cao, Li v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 488\n\nF.3d 1371 (11th Cir. 2007), and Yang v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 1117\n\n(8th Cir. 2005).     This reliance is mislaid.\n\n           The fundamental flaw in the petitioner's position is that\n\nthe cited cases, whether viewed singly or in combination, do not\n\nusurp the primacy of this court's opinion in Zheng.                 See Wogan, 938\n\nF.2d at 1449.       To cinch matters, none of the cited cases is\n\nmaterially similar to this case.\n\n           We    previously   have    distinguished       Cao       and    need    not\n\nrepastinate that ground.      Thus, we start with Li, which involved a\n\npetition to review the denial of a motion to reopen.                 The Eleventh\n\nCircuit's decision turned on the alien's proffer of specific\n\nevidence anent family planning practices in her village.                   488 F.3d\n\nat 1375.     So too in Yang; the court granted relief based on\n\nparticularized evidence demonstrating that Yang's and her husband's\n\nfamilies had been specifically targeted by government hierarchs for\n\nforced sterilization and abortions.           427 F.3d at 1121-22.\n\n           Evidence   such    as   that     presented    in    Li    and    Yang   is\n\nconspicuously absent from the record here.               The absence of such\n\nevidence makes a dispositive difference.\n\n           The    petitioner's     final      argument        is    different      in\n\ncharacter.   As said, the BIA based its decision to deny asylum on\n\ninformation contained in the 2005 Profile and the absence of any\n\nspecific evidence showing that Chinese repatriates with American-\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fborn    children      were   being   forcibly    sterilized     or   otherwise\n\npersecuted.      But the BIA also mentioned the 2007 Profile in a\n\nfootnote without formally taking administrative notice of that\n\nreport (which had not been offered into evidence before the IJ).\n\nThe petitioner asserts that the BIA's decision must be set aside\n\nbecause its actions in this respect offend due process.\n\n            We review a procedural due process claim of this type de\n\nnovo.    See, e.g., Pulisir, 524 F.3d at 311; Teng v. Mukasey, 516\n\nF.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2008).         To prevail, a complainant must, among\n\nother things, show prejudice.          Pulisir, 524 F.3d at 311.        In this\n\ncontext, prejudice equates with a showing that \"an abridgement of\n\ndue    process   is    likely   to   have    affected   the   outcome   of   the\n\nproceedings.\"      Id.\n\n            Admittedly, it would have been preferable for the BIA\n\neither to have eschewed any mention of the 2007 Profile or to have\n\ntaken administrative notice of it.               Despite the BIA's bevue,\n\nhowever, there was no apparent harm.           The 2005 Profile and the 2007\n\nProfile do not differ materially in content, see Cao, 272 F. App'x\n\nat 16 (terming the 2005 and 2007 Profiles \"largely repetitive\"),\n\nand the former document was properly before the BIA.            In any event,\n\nthe 2007 Profile had nothing to do with, and thus could not have\n\naffected the BIA's evaluation of, the petitioner's individualized\n\nsituation.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f             Under these circumstances, we conclude, without serious\n\nquestion, that the error neither prejudiced the petitioner nor\n\naffected the outcome of the proceeding. Accordingly, it affords no\n\nprincipled basis for setting aside the BIA's decision.             See Shao,\n\n546 F.3d at 168.\n\n             That ends this aspect of the matter.          Because the BIA\n\ngave consideration to the evidence as a whole, made supportable\n\nfindings, sufficiently explained its thought process, and committed\n\nno prejudicial error in the handling of the evidence, its decision\n\nto    deny   the   application   for   asylum   is   perforce   supported   by\n\nsubstantial evidence.      See Chhay, 540 F.3d at 8; Pan, 489 F.3d at\n\n87.\n\n             Given this holding, the petitioner's entreaty that we\n\nreverse the BIA's decision to deny withholding of removal is easily\n\ndispatched.        To succeed on that claim, the petitioner had to\n\nestablish that, if repatriated, she would more likely than not face\n\npersecution on account of a statutorily protected ground. 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1231(b)(3)(B)(i).        This standard is more demanding than the\n\nstandard for asylum.      See Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d\n\n120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005); Makhoul, 387 F.3d at 82.                It follows\n\ninexorably that because the petitioner's asylum claim fails, her\n\nwithholding of removal must fail as well.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\f          We need go no further.6    For the reasons elucidated\n\nabove, we deny the petition for judicial review.\n\n\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       The petitioner withdrew her CAT claim in her reply brief.\nThus, we have no occasion to address that claim.\n\n                              -13-\n\f",

Scadron, Assistant Director, and Siu P. Wong, Trial Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before: TORRUELLA, SELYA and TASHIMA,<sup>[**]</sup> Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>The petitioner, Zhou Zheng, is a Chinese national. She seeks judicial review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that affirmed both an order of removal and the concomitant denial of a cross-application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT). Concluding, as we do, that the BIA's decision is supported by substantial evidence, we deny the petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p>The facts are straightforward. The petitioner entered the United States illegally in December of 1998. While living in Massachusetts, she married and bore two children (one in 2002 and the other in 2005).</p>\n<p>On January 12, 2005, the petitioner applied for asylum and withholding of removal.<sup>[1]</sup> Following an asylum interview, federal authorities denied her application and referred the matter of her status to the immigration court. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). Removal proceedings began.</p>\n<p>The petitioner appeared in the immigration court on October 24, 2006. She conceded removability but cross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>The petitioner testified that, even though she was unwed and had no children at the time, she left China in order to avoid that country's repressive family planning restrictions. Now that she had two children, she feared that a return to her homeland would lead either to forcible sterilization or some disadvantage to her children. In support, the petitioner presented affidavits from several family members who claimed to have been subjected to involuntary abortions or sterilization. In this regard, the petitioner testified that her mother was forcibly sterilized following the birth of her third child twenty-five years earlier. She added, through testimony and other evidence, that her cousin's wife was sterilized in 1986 after having two children; that a different cousin's wife was sterilized in 2004 after having two children; that her sister-in-law's husband was forcibly sterilized in 1997 after siring two children;<sup>[2]</sup> and that her sister was forced to undergo an abortion in 2000. Finally, the government introduced a 2005 State Department country conditions report (2005 Profile).</p>\n<p>This compendium of evidence did not impress the immigration judge (IJ). In his view, the petitioner had established a genuine fear of forced sterilization, but she had failed to establish that this subjective fear was objectively reasonable. Consequently, the IJ denied the petitioner's requests for relief and ordered her removal.</p>\n<p>The petitioner appealed to the BIA, arguing that the 2005 Profile showed that Chinese citizens returning to their homeland were given \"no special treatment\" in terms of family planning policies. She also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*440</span> argued that simply because American diplomats were \"unaware\" of any forced sterilizations imposed upon returnees with children born in the United States did not mean that such incidents did not occur.</p>\n<p>The BIA affirmed the IJ's decree in all respects. It held that the petitioner had not presented \"specific and individualized evidence\" sufficient to show that she would likely be forced to undergo sterilization either in China generally or in her hometown of Changle City (in Fujian Province) specifically. It further held that the petitioner had not shown that \"any economic sanctions that may be imposed on her would rise to the level of persecution.\"</p>\n<p>This timely petition for judicial review followed. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1).</p>\n<p>In removal cases, judicial review ordinarily focuses on the decision of the BIA. <i>Stroni v. Gonzales,</i> 454 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.2006). That approach obtains when the BIA has conducted an independent evaluation of the record and rested its decision on a self-generated rationale. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo-Aguilar v. Mukasey,</i> 517 F.3d 8, 9 (1st Cir.2008). This is such a case. The devoir of persuasion abides with the petitioner. <i>See </i><i>Pulisir v. Mukasey,</i> 524 F.3d 302, 308 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).</p>\n<p>The applicable standard of review is the familiar substantial evidence standard. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sok v. Mukasey,</i> 526 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir.2008). Absent an error of law,<sup>[3]</sup> this \"highly deferential\" standard results in a reversal only if the record would compel a reasonable factfinder to reach a different outcome. <i>López de Hincapie v. Gonzales,</i> 494 F.3d 213, 218 (1st Cir.2007); <i>see </i><i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> 489 F.3d 80, 85 (1st Cir.2007). In conducting this tamisage, a reviewing court accepts the findings of fact on which the agency's determination rests so long as those findings are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p>To establish eligibility for asylum, an alien must demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2); <i>see also </i><i>Rivas-Mira v. Holder,</i> 556 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2009). Because the petitioner does not claim to have been the victim of past persecution, she must prove that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on one of the five statutorily protected grounds enumerated above. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); <i>see also </i><i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Proof of a well-founded fear entails a showing that the fear is both subjectively felt and objectively reasonable. <i>Jiang v. Gonzales,</i> 474 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir.2007). A well-founded fear of forced abortion or sterilization is considered a qualifying fear of persecution based on political opinion. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42); <i>Xie Mei Zheng v. Gonzales,</i> 475 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The BIA concluded that the petitioner had not proven that she had this well-founded fear of future persecution. The petitioner demurs; she offers several reasons why the BIA's conclusion was unsupported by substantial evidence. To her way of thinking, the BIA misinterpreted the 2005 Profile, failed to give adequate weight to precedent, and abused its discretion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*441</span> in referring to the State Department's 2007 country conditions report (2007 Profile) without pausing to take administrative notice thereof. We examine these claims sequentially.</p>\n<p>In support of her contention that the BIA did not properly weigh the evidence, the petitioner relies heavily on the unpublished decision in <i>Cao v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services,</i> 272 Fed.Appx. 14 (2d Cir.2008). In that non-precedential opinion, <i>see</i> 2d Cir. R. 32.1(b), the court of appeals remanded because the BIA had \"mischaracterized\" the 2005 Profile, <i>Cao,</i> 272 Fed.Appx. at 15. But <i>Cao</i> is, at best, only tangentially relevant to the case at hand. The BIA's error there was case-specific, and the court of <i>Cao's</i> originthe Second Circuitsubsequently concluded that the 2005 Profile furnishes no concrete evidence that sterilization is forced upon citizens returning to Fujian Province with American-born children. <i>See </i><i>Shao v. Mukasey,</i> 546 F.3d 138, 164 (2d Cir.2008) (noting that \"[t]he significance of the [2005] report is highlighted by the fact that, despite the voluminous documentary records developed in these ... cases, none of the petitioners points us to evidence of any person being forcibly sterilized on removal to China based on having two children\"); <i>see also </i><i>Huang v. U.S. INS,</i> 421 F.3d 125, 128-129 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>More importantly, the significance of <i>Cao</i> pales in comparison to our own circuit precedent (which is, of course, binding on this panel). We recently adjudicated a petition for review embodying facts nearly identical to those presented here. <i>See </i><i>Yen Zheng Zheng v. Mukasey,</i> 546 F.3d 70 (1st Cir.2008). <i>Zheng,</i> not <i>Cao,</i> is the beacon by which we must steer. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that, within a multi-panel circuit, panels ordinarily are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point).</p>\n<p><i>Zheng,</i> like this case,<sup>[4]</sup> involved a Chinese woman from Fujian Province who was the mother of two American-born children. 546 F.3d at 71. There, as here, the alien claimed a well-founded fear of future persecution in the form of forced sterilization. <i>Id.</i> at 72. There as here, she alleged that the BIA had misread the country conditions reports. <i>Id.</i> at 72-73. There, as here, the alien relied mainly on anecdotal evidence to support her claim.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 72. The BIA denied relief and affirmed an order of removal. We upheld that decision, ruling that nothing in the record compelled a contrary conclusion. <i>Id.</i> at 73.</p>\n<p>The petitioner labors to distinguish <i>Zheng.</i> Her most loudly bruited claim is that the case arose in a different procedural posture; the alien was seeking an order for reinstatement of her appeal. <i>See id.</i> at 71; <i>see also </i><i>Liu v. Mukasey,</i> 553 F.3d 37, 39 n. 1 (1st Cir.2009) (discussing standard of review for reinstatement of appeal). That is true, but it is only half of the story. In <i>Zheng,</i> the court found expressly that the alien had not \"establish[ed] a prima facie case for the [granting of asylum].\" 546 F.3d at 73. This was so, the court explained, because the evidence did not call into legitimate question the BIA's determination that, among other things, she lacked a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>This finding makes <i>Zheng</i> directly relevant to the instant case. It is clear from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*442</span> <i>Zheng,</i> as we said in our earlier case, that when an alien has adduced nothing more than \"background information [that does] not in any way shed light on this individualized issue,\" nothing compels a reviewing court to overturn the decision of the BIA. <i>Chhay v. Mukasey,</i> 540 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2008). That principle applies four-square in the instant case.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's other effort to distinguish <i>Zheng</i> is equally unavailing. That effort centers on a boast that her proof is more cogent because, unlike in <i>Zheng,</i> she corroborated her anecdotal evidence of coercive family planning tactics. This rodomontade misses the point: the petitioner's corroborating evidence does not verify her asseveration that returnees with American-born children are routinely subjected to coercive family planning practices. Consequently, that evidence is of limited utility. <i>See Lin v. Holder,</i> No. 07-1853, 2009 WL 1220783, at *5-6 (4th Cir. May 6, 2009) (unpublished).</p>\n<p>This brings us to the petitioner's second claim of error: that the BIA turned a blind eye to precedent. In this regard, the petitioner relies on three cases: <i>Cao, Li v. U.S. Atty. Gen.,</i> 488 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir. 2007), and <i>Yang v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 1117 (8th Cir.2005). This reliance is mislaid.</p>\n<p>The fundamental flaw in the petitioner's position is that the cited cases, whether viewed singly or in combination, do not usurp the primacy of this court's opinion in <i>Zheng. See </i><i>Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d at 1449. To cinch matters, none of the cited cases is materially similar to this case.</p>\n<p>We previously have distinguished <i>Cao</i> and need not repastinate that ground. Thus, we start with <i>Li,</i> which involved a petition to review the denial of a motion to reopen. The Eleventh Circuit's decision turned on the alien's proffer of specific evidence anent family planning practices in her village. 488 F.3d at 1375. So too in <i>Yang;</i> the court granted relief based on particularized evidence demonstrating that Yang's and her husband's families had been specifically targeted by government hierarchs for forced sterilization and abortions. 427 F.3d at 1121-22.</p>\n<p>Evidence such as that presented in <i>Li</i> and <i>Yang</i> is conspicuously absent from the record here. The absence of such evidence makes a dispositive difference.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's final argument is different in character. As said, the BIA based its decision to deny asylum on information contained in the 2005 Profile and the absence of any specific evidence showing that Chinese repatriates with American-born children were being forcibly sterilized or otherwise persecuted. But the BIA also mentioned the 2007 Profile in a footnote without formally taking administrative notice of that report (which had not been offered into evidence before the IJ). The petitioner asserts that the BIA's decision must be set aside because its actions in this respect offend due process.</p>\n<p>We review a procedural due process claim of this type de novo. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Pulisir,</i> 524 F.3d at 311; <i>Teng v. Mukasey,</i> 516 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.2008). To prevail, a complainant must, among other things, show prejudice. <i>Pulisir,</i> 524 F.3d at 311. In this context, prejudice equates with a showing that \"an abridgement of due process is likely to have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Admittedly, it would have been preferable for the BIA either to have eschewed any mention of the 2007 Profile or to have taken administrative notice of it. Despite the BIA's bevue, however, there was no apparent harm. The 2005 Profile and the 2007 Profile do not differ materially in content, <i>see Cao,</i> 272 Fed.Appx. at 16 (terming the 2005 and 2007 Profiles \"largely repetitive\"), and the former document was properly before the BIA. In any event, the 2007 Profile had nothing to do with, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*443</span> and thus could not have affected the BIA's evaluation of, the petitioner's individualized situation.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, we conclude, without serious question, that the error neither prejudiced the petitioner nor affected the outcome of the proceeding. Accordingly, it affords no principled basis for setting aside the BIA's decision. <i>See </i><i>Shao,</i> 546 F.3d at 168.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. Because the BIA gave consideration to the evidence as a whole, made supportable findings, sufficiently explained its thought process, and committed no prejudicial error in the handling of the evidence, its decision to deny the application for asylum is perforce supported by substantial evidence. <i>See </i><i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 8; <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 87.</p>\n<p>Given this holding, the petitioner's entreaty that we reverse the BIA's decision to deny withholding of removal is easily dispatched. To succeed on that claim, the petitioner had to establish that, if repatriated, she would more likely than not face persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). This standard is more demanding than the standard for asylum. <i>See </i><i>Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Makhoul,</i> 387 F.3d at 82. It follows inexorably that because the petitioner's asylum claim fails, her withholding of removal must fail as well.</p>\n<p>We need go no further.<sup>[6]</sup> For the reasons elucidated above, we deny the petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General Michael B.

Here, however, the immigration judge found that the petitioner qualified for the \"extraordinary circumstances\" exception to this rule. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D).

Elias-Zacarias,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 481, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span> (1992).</p>\n<p>To establish eligibility for asylum, an alien must demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2); <i>see also </i><i>Rivas-Mira v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2009). Because the petitioner does not claim to have been the victim of past persecution, she must prove that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on one of the five statutorily protected grounds enumerated above. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); <i>see also </i><i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Proof of a well-founded fear entails a showing that the fear is both subjectively felt and objectively reasonable. <i>Jiang v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202605\"><a href=\"/opinion/202605/jiang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2007). A well-founded fear of forced abortion or sterilization is considered a qualifying fear of persecution based on political opinion. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42); <i>Xie Mei Zheng v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202616\"><a href=\"/opinion/202616/zheng-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The BIA concluded that the petitioner had not proven that she had this well-founded fear of future persecution. The petitioner demurs; she offers several reasons why the BIA's conclusion was unsupported by substantial evidence. To her way of thinking, the BIA misinterpreted the 2005 Profile, failed to give adequate weight to precedent, and abused its discretion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*441</span> in referring to the State Department's 2007 country conditions report (2007 Profile) without pausing to take administrative notice thereof. We examine these claims sequentially.</p>\n<p>In support of her contention that the BIA did not properly weigh the evidence, the petitioner relies heavily on the unpublished decision in <i>Cao v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services,</i> 272 Fed.Appx. 14 (2d Cir.2008). In that non-precedential opinion, <i>see</i> 2d Cir. R. 32.1(b), the court of appeals remanded because the BIA had \"mischaracterized\" the 2005 Profile, <i>Cao,</i> 272 Fed.Appx. at 15. But <i>Cao</i> is, at best, only tangentially relevant to the case at hand. The BIA's error there was case-specific, and the court of <i>Cao's</i> originthe Second Circuitsubsequently concluded that the 2005 Profile furnishes no concrete evidence that sterilization is forced upon citizens returning to Fujian Province with American-born children. <i>See </i><i>Shao v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2567\"><a href=\"/opinion/2567/shao-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 164 (2d Cir.2008) (noting that \"[t]he significance of the [2005] report is highlighted by the fact that, despite the voluminous documentary records developed in these ... cases, none of the petitioners points us to evidence of any person being forcibly sterilized on removal to China based on having two children\"); <i>see also </i><i>Huang v. U.S. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791665\"><a href=\"/opinion/791665/jian-xing-huang-v-united-states-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span>, 128-129 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>More importantly, the significance of <i>Cao</i> pales in comparison to our own circuit precedent (which is, of course, binding on this panel). We recently adjudicated a petition for review embodying facts nearly identical to those presented here. <i>See </i><i>Yen Zheng Zheng v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></span> (1st Cir.2008). <i>Zheng,</i> not <i>Cao,</i> is the beacon by which we must steer. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wogan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564953\"><a href=\"/opinion/564953/united-states-v-russell-h-wogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1449 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that, within a multi-panel circuit, panels ordinarily are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point).</p>\n<p><i>Zheng,</i> like this case,<sup>[4]</sup> involved a Chinese woman from Fujian Province who was the mother of two American-born children. 546 F.3d at 71. There, as here, the alien claimed a well-founded fear of future persecution in the form of forced sterilization. <i>Id.</i> at 72. There as here, she alleged that the BIA had misread the country conditions reports. <i>Id.</i> at 72-73. There, as here, the alien relied mainly on anecdotal evidence to support her claim.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 72. The BIA denied relief and affirmed an order of removal. We upheld that decision, ruling that nothing in the record compelled a contrary conclusion. <i>Id.</i> at 73.</p>\n<p>The petitioner labors to distinguish <i>Zheng.</i> Her most loudly bruited claim is that the case arose in a different procedural posture; the alien was seeking an order for reinstatement of her appeal. <i>See id.</i> at 71; <i>see also </i><i>Liu v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203625\"><a href=\"/opinion/203625/liu-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 39 n. 1 (1st Cir.2009) (discussing standard of review for reinstatement of appeal). That is true, but it is only half of the story. In <i>Zheng,</i> the court found expressly that the alien had not \"establish[ed] a prima facie case for the [granting of asylum].\" 546 F.3d at 73. This was so, the court explained, because the evidence did not call into legitimate question the BIA's determination that, among other things, she lacked a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>This finding makes <i>Zheng</i> directly relevant to the instant case. It is clear from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*442</span> <i>Zheng,</i> as we said in our earlier case, that when an alien has adduced nothing more than \"background information [that does] not in any way shed light on this individualized issue,\" nothing compels a reviewing court to overturn the decision of the BIA. <i>Chhay v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203441\"><a href=\"/opinion/203441/chhay-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2008). That principle applies four-square in the instant case.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's other effort to distinguish <i>Zheng</i> is equally unavailing. That effort centers on a boast that her proof is more cogent because, unlike in <i>Zheng,</i> she corroborated her anecdotal evidence of coercive family planning tactics. This rodomontade misses the point: the petitioner's corroborating evidence does not verify her asseveration that returnees with American-born children are routinely subjected to coercive family planning practices. Consequently, that evidence is of limited utility. <i>See Lin v. Holder,</i> No. 07-1853, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1220783</span></span>, at *5-6 (4th Cir. May 6, 2009) (unpublished).</p>\n<p>This brings us to the petitioner's second claim of error: that the BIA turned a blind eye to precedent. In this regard, the petitioner relies on three cases: <i>Cao, Li v. U.S. Atty. Gen.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77712\"><a href=\"/opinion/77712/yaner-li-v-us-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1371</span></a></span> (11th Cir. 2007), and <i>Yang v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792336\"><a href=\"/opinion/792336/tu-kai-yang-xue-lin-wu-v-alberto-gonzales-1-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2005). This reliance is mislaid.</p>\n<p>The fundamental flaw in the petitioner's position is that the cited cases, whether viewed singly or in combination, do not usurp the primacy of this court's opinion in <i>Zheng. See </i><i>Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d at 1449. To cinch matters, none of the cited cases is materially similar to this case.</p>\n<p>We previously have distinguished <i>Cao</i> and need not repastinate that ground. Thus, we start with <i>Li,</i> which involved a petition to review the denial of a motion to reopen. The Eleventh Circuit's decision turned on the alien's proffer of specific evidence anent family planning practices in her village. 488 F.3d at 1375. So too in <i>Yang;</i> the court granted relief based on particularized evidence demonstrating that Yang's and her husband's families had been specifically targeted by government hierarchs for forced sterilization and abortions. 427 F.3d at 1121-22.</p>\n<p>Evidence such as that presented in <i>Li</i> and <i>Yang</i> is conspicuously absent from the record here. The absence of such evidence makes a dispositive difference.</p>\n<p>The petitioner's final argument is different in character. As said, the BIA based its decision to deny asylum on information contained in the 2005 Profile and the absence of any specific evidence showing that Chinese repatriates with American-born children were being forcibly sterilized or otherwise persecuted. But the BIA also mentioned the 2007 Profile in a footnote without formally taking administrative notice of that report (which had not been offered into evidence before the IJ). The petitioner asserts that the BIA's decision must be set aside because its actions in this respect offend due process.</p>\n<p>We review a procedural due process claim of this type de novo. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Pulisir,</i> 524 F.3d at 311; <i>Teng v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203153\"><a href=\"/opinion/203153/teng-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2008). To prevail, a complainant must, among other things, show prejudice. <i>Pulisir,</i> 524 F.3d at 311. In this context, prejudice equates with a showing that \"an abridgement of due process is likely to have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Admittedly, it would have been preferable for the BIA either to have eschewed any mention of the 2007 Profile or to have taken administrative notice of it. Despite the BIA's bevue, however, there was no apparent harm. The 2005 Profile and the 2007 Profile do not differ materially in content, <i>see Cao,</i> 272 Fed.Appx. at 16 (terming the 2005 and 2007 Profiles \"largely repetitive\"), and the former document was properly before the BIA. In any event, the 2007 Profile had nothing to do with, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*443</span> and thus could not have affected the BIA's evaluation of, the petitioner's individualized situation.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, we conclude, without serious question, that the error neither prejudiced the petitioner nor affected the outcome of the proceeding. Accordingly, it affords no principled basis for setting aside the BIA's decision. <i>See </i><i>Shao,</i> 546 F.3d at 168.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. Because the BIA gave consideration to the evidence as a whole, made supportable findings, sufficiently explained its thought process, and committed no prejudicial error in the handling of the evidence, its decision to deny the application for asylum is perforce supported by substantial evidence. <i>See </i><i>Chhay,</i> 540 F.3d at 8; <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 87.</p>\n<p>Given this holding, the petitioner's entreaty that we reverse the BIA's decision to deny withholding of removal is easily dispatched. To succeed on that claim, the petitioner had to establish that, if repatriated, she would more likely than not face persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). This standard is more demanding than the standard for asylum. <i>See </i><i>Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201454\"><a href=\"/opinion/201454/rodriguez-ramirez-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 123 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Makhoul,</i> 387 F.3d at 82. It follows inexorably that because the petitioner's asylum claim fails, her withholding of removal must fail as well.</p>\n<p>We need go no further.<sup>[6]</sup> For the reasons elucidated above, we deny the petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  An alien ordinarily must file for asylum within one year of her arrival in the United States. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); <i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2007). Here, however, the immigration judge found that the petitioner qualified for the \"extraordinary circumstances\" exception to this rule. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D). The respondent has not challenged that determination.</p>\n<p>[2]  All of the children mentioned in this paragraph were born in China.</p>\n<p>[3]  \"Abstract legal propositions are reviewed de novo, with some deference to the agency's reasonable interpretation of statutes and regulations within its ken.\" <i>Chhay v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203441\"><a href=\"/opinion/203441/chhay-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2008). There is no error of law apparent here.</p>\n<p>[4]  The two cases are about two different (unrelated) women who happen to share the same name.</p>\n<p>[5]  By and large the evidence presented there was stronger than that presented here. For example, it included documents from Fujian Provincial Population and Family Planning Commission and an affidavit from an expert on Chinese population control policy. <i>Zheng,</i> 546 F.3d at 71. No comparable evidence was tendered in this case.</p>\n<p>[6]  The petitioner withdrew her CAT claim in her reply brief. Thus, we have no occasion to address that claim.</p>\n\n</div>",
