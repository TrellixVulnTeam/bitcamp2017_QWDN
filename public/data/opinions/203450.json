D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                  Torruella, Selya, and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Gail M. Latouf, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 21, 2008\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. On December 1, 2006, Katherine\n\nMcKenzie pled guilty to distributing five or more grams of cocaine\n\nbase.    The district court sentenced McKenzie to forty-two months'\n\nimprisonment. McKenzie now appeals her sentence, claiming that the\n\ndistrict court incorrectly assigned two points to her Criminal\n\nHistory Category (\"CHC\") score, thus rendering her ineligible for\n\nsafety-valve      relief     under    18    U.S.C.    §   3553(f),   and   that    it\n\nimproperly credited computerized docket reports showing her past\n\nconvictions.      After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                                I.     Background\n\n            In April 2006, McKenzie and two others sold 8.7 grams of\n\ncrack cocaine to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration\n\nagent.     McKenzie was arrested and charged with distributing five\n\ngrams or more of cocaine base and aiding and abetting such conduct,\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2.                          The\n\nstatutory mandatory minimum for violations of § 841(a)(1) involving\n\nmore than five grams of crack is sixty months' imprisonment.                      21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B). A sentence below sixty months can, however,\n\nbe   imposed      if   the    defendant          satisfies   various    enumerated\n\nrequirements for safety-valve relief under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f).\n\nOne such requirement is that the defendant's criminal history score\n\nbe zero or one, yielding a CHC of I.\n\n            McKenzie pled guilty as charged, and the district court\n\naccepted    the    guilty     plea.        The    district   court     adopted    the\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\frecommended guidelines offense level of nineteen set forth in the\n\nProbation Office's pre-sentence report (\"PSR\").           To arrive at that\n\noffense level, the court began with a base level of twenty-six for\n\nthe charged offense, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(7)(2006); reduced the\n\noffense level by three for acceptance of responsibility, id.\n\n§ 3E1.1(a)-(b); and further reduced the offense level by four to\n\nreflect   McKenzie's    minimal    role    in   the   charged   offense,   id.\n\n§ 3B1.2(a).\n\n              The PSR also recommended a CHC of II due to McKenzie's\n\nprior Maine state convictions: (1) an October 2005 conviction of\n\nmisdemeanor assault for slapping a bar employee in the face; and\n\n(2) a June 2006 conviction of misdemeanor theft for shoplifting\n\nsleeping pills and baby diapers from a supermarket.                The proof\n\nproffered for these two convictions was the Maine state court\n\nelectronic docket record, which was attested to by a Maine court\n\nofficial as authentic.\n\n              An offense level of nineteen combined with a CHC of II\n\nyielded an advisory guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") of thirty-\n\nthree to forty-one months.        The PSR recommended, however, that the\n\nGSR be amended to sixty months, in accordance with the statutory\n\nminimum for McKenzie's conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n              At sentencing, McKenzie objected to several aspects of\n\nthe PSR, including the calculation of her CHC and criminal history\n\nscore   and    her   consequent    lack    of   safety-valve    eligibility.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fSpecifically, McKenzie took issue with the use of electronic docket\n\nrecords to prove her two prior Maine convictions.                     McKenzie also\n\nfocused particular attention on the shoplifting conviction and\n\nargued   that   it     should    not    have   counted   for       criminal    history\n\npurposes.       The    Government       maintained   that      a    CHC   of    II   was\n\nappropriate, and that the shoplifting conviction had to factor into\n\nMcKenzie's criminal history score because in United States v.\n\nSpaulding, 339 F.3d 20 (1st Cir. 2003), we held that the potential\n\nfor physical confrontation made it impossible to conclude that\n\nshoplifting was \"similar to\" certain offenses excluded from CHC\n\ncalculations under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c).              Id. at 22.\n\n            The district court found the facts as set forth in the\n\nPSR,   ruled    that    the     PSR    properly   calculated        the   two    Maine\n\nconvictions,     and    accepted       the   computerized   docket        reports     as\n\nsufficient proof of the convictions.              The court also held that it\n\nwas bound to count the shoplifting conviction in McKenzie's CHC\n\nbecause of our holding in Spaulding. The court did, however, grant\n\nthe Government's motion under U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1 for substantial\n\nassistance, which recommended that McKenzie receive a twelve-\n\npercent downward departure from the sixty-month statutory minimum.\n\nThe court went much further and gave McKenzie a thirty-percent\n\ndownward departure, resulting in a forty-two month sentence.                         The\n\ncourt's reasons for this departure centered on McKenzie's tragic\n\nchildhood and vulnerable psychological condition, threats made to\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fher in jail over the prospect that she might testify against\n\nothers, and the fact that she was pregnant and had a small child.\n\n           On   appeal,    McKenzie    challenges       her   sentence   on   two\n\ngrounds.   First, she argues that the district court applied an\n\nincorrect test to evaluate whether her prior Maine shoplifting\n\nconviction should have been considered for purposes of calculating\n\nher CHC.    Second, she argues that the district court erred in\n\naccepting computerized docket reports as adequate proof of her\n\nprior   Maine   state    convictions.        As    we   now   explain,   neither\n\nchallenge has merit.\n\n                             II.   Discussion\n\n           We   review    questions     of   law    involved    in   sentencing\n\ndeterminations de novo.       United States v. Jones, 523 F.3d 31, 41\n\n(1st Cir. 2008); United States v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 60-61 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough v. United States,\n\n128 S. Ct. 558, 574-75 (2007).\n\n           A.   Prior Maine Shoplifting Conviction\n\n           Where a defendant is convicted of an offense involving\n\nfive or more grams of crack cocaine, she must be given a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence of five years, even if her GSR is lower.                     21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B); see also United States v. Rodríguez, 938\n\nF.2d 319, 320 (1st Cir. 1991).          Even where the mandatory minimum\n\napplies, however, a sentencing court can apply a lower sentence\n\nunder the safety-valve provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) if the\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fdefendant meets five enumerated criteria.                 Only one of those\n\ncriteria is at issue here:          whether the district court properly\n\nfound McKenzie's CHC to be II.              If so, she is ineligible for\n\nsafety-valve relief.       See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1).\n\n               Section 4A1.2(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines governs the\n\ntypes of prior convictions that may be considered for purposes of\n\ncalculating a defendant's criminal history score.                All felony\n\noffenses are counted.        Misdemeanors are counted as well, with an\n\nimportant exception crucial to McKenzie's appeal:              if the prior\n\nconviction is for one of a listed number of misdemeanor offenses,\n\nor an offense \"similar to\" a listed offense, it is not counted as\n\nlong as the sentence served was not a term of probation of at least\n\none year, or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days.                Id.\n\n§ 4A1.2(c)(1).\n\n               At sentencing, the district court determined that the PSR\n\nproperly factored McKenzie's June 2006 shoplifting into her CHC\n\nscore.     The court agreed with the Government's argument that\n\nSpaulding controlled the issue.         McKenzie now urges us to reverse\n\nSpaulding and remand her case to the district court, substituting\n\nfor the \"similar to\" standard a \"common sense\" approach.               As the\n\nbasis    for    her   request,   McKenzie   points   to   amendments   to   the\n\nSentencing Guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing\n\nCommission (\"Commission\"), made effective on November 1, 2007.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fParticularly, McKenzie relies on the addition of Application Note\n\n12(A) to the Guidelines commentary, which in pertinent part reads:\n\n           In determining whether an unlisted offense is\n           similar to an offense listed in [§ 4A1.2]\n           (c)(1) . . . , the court should use a common\n           sense approach that includes consideration of\n           relevant factors such as (i) a comparison of\n           punishments imposed for the listed and\n           unlisted   offenses;   (ii)    the   perceived\n           seriousness of the offense as indicated by the\n           level of punishment; (iii) the elements of the\n           offense; (iv) the level of culpability\n           involved; and (v) the degree to which the\n           commission   of   the  offense   indicates   a\n           likelihood of recurring criminal conduct.\n\nId. § 4A1.2 n.12(A).\n\n           We reject McKenzie's call to depart from Spaulding.        Our\n\ncases are clear that three-judge panels are bound by prior panel\n\ndecisions absent extraordinary circumstances. See United States v.\n\nDuval, 496 F.3d 64, 85 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing United States v.\n\nAllen, 469 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir. 2006)); United States v. Allen,\n\n469 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"[W]e remain bound to prior panel\n\ndecisions 'in the absence of supervening authority sufficient to\n\nwarrant   disregard   of   established   precedent.'\"   (quoting   United\n\nStates v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991))).\n\n           The relevant facts in Spaulding are markedly similar to\n\nthose in this case.    There, we rejected the defendant's claim that\n\nhis prior conviction for shoplifting approximately $21 worth of\n\ngoods should be excluded from his criminal history score because it\n\nwas \"similar to\" an insufficient funds check conviction, an offense\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\flisted in § 4A1.2(c)(1), and therefore exempt from being counted in\n\na defendant's CHC.     Spaulding, 339 F.3d at 22.                 Doing so, we\n\nexplained:\n\n           [S]hoplifting poses a markedly greater risk to\n           the public. Passing a bad check poses little\n           risk of physical confrontation, because the\n           perpetrator is not present when the victim\n           realizes   that   he  has   been   victimized.\n           Shoplifting, on the other hand, creates the\n           very real risk of physical confrontation\n           between the perpetrator and the victim.      A\n           store employee or customer may confront the\n           perpetrator in an attempt to thwart the crime.\n           The   risk   of  confrontation   precludes   a\n           conclusion that shoplifting is \"similar to\"\n           passing a bad check.\n\nId.1\n\n           McKenzie   does   not   attempt       to    persuade   us   that   the\n\ncircumstances    surrounding       her    case        can   be    significantly\n\ndistinguished from those we addressed in Spaulding.               Instead, she\n\nasks us to remand her case for consideration of the criminal\n\nhistory applicability of her prior shoplifting conviction under the\n\nrecently established \"common sense\" standard.               McKenzie, however,\n\ndoes not present us with any meaningful basis to comply with her\n\nrequest.     The amendments to the Guidelines on which McKenzie\n\n\n1\n    With one exception, other circuits have agreed with this\nreasoning. See United States v. Ubiera, 486 F.3d 71, 74-76 (2d\nCir. 2007) (citing, inter alia, Spaulding, 339 F.3d at 22); United\nStates v. Osborne, 514 F.3d 377, 391-92 (4th Cir. 2008); United\nStates v. Lamm, 392 F.3d 130, 132-34 (5th Cir. 2004); United States\nv. Harris, 325 F.3d 865, 873 (7th Cir. 2003); United States v.\nGray, 126 F.3d 1109, 1110-11 (8th Cir. 1997); United States v.\nHooks, 65 F.3d 850, 854-56 (10th Cir. 1995); but see United States\nv. López-Pastrana, 244 F.3d 1025, 1027-31 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fanchors her claim were adopted after her sentencing in November\n\n2007.     We have no reason to believe that the Commission intended\n\nthe amendments to apply retroactively.            See     United States v.\n\nCrudup, 375 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Havener,\n\n905 F.2d 3, 5-7 (1st Cir. 1990).        Moreover, McKenzie has provided\n\nno basis for us to conclude that consideration of her prior\n\nconviction under a \"common sense\" standard would yield a different\n\nresult.2     Pursuant to Spaulding, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt     properly   included   McKenzie's    prior     Maine    shoplifting\n\nconviction in its criminal history calculation and that she was\n\naccordingly not entitled to a safety-valve downward adjustment.\n\n            B.   Use of Computerized Docket Reports\n\n            At    sentencing,   the    Government   has    the    burden    to\n\nestablish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of a\n\nprior conviction.     See United States v. Díaz, 519 F.3d 56, 67 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).      The Government may satisfy its burden by producing a\n\ncertified copy of the conviction or an equivalent proffer.              United\n\nStates v. Unger, 915 F.2d 759, 761 (1st Cir. 1990); see also\n\nShepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 26 (2005) (equivalent\n\nproffer    for   criminal   history    purposes   includes      the   charging\n\n\n\n\n2\n   Notably, McKenzie did not proffer an analysis of her prior\nshoplifting conviction through the rubric of Application Note 12(A)\nin an effort to show that any result other than that expounded in\nSpaulding would be reached.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fdocument, a written plea agreement, a transcript, or another\n\nofficial court document).\n\n             McKenzie challenges the district court's reliance on\n\nattested copies of computerized docket entries as proof of her\n\nprior Maine state convictions for shoplifting and misdemeanor\n\nassault.     She urges us to develop a higher standard of proof that\n\nwould     render    these      docket     reports   unacceptable       as    proof    of\n\nconviction.\n\n             We    find   no    reason     to    disturb    the    district    court's\n\njudgment on this issue.          Over McKenzie's objections at sentencing,\n\nthe district court correctly noted that electronic docket records\n\nare increasingly the norm in today's world.                       Moreover, McKenzie\n\ndid not attempt to show that the records were inaccurate and\n\nconceded that they were properly authenticated.                         We have not\n\npreviously    addressed        the   admissibility         of   attested    copies    of\n\ncomputerized       docket      entries     for    criminal      history     sentencing\n\npurposes but other courts have concluded that electronic docket\n\nrecords can sufficiently establish a defendant's criminal history\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence.                 See, e.g., United States v.\n\nCousin, 219 F. App'x. 190, 194 (3d Cir. 2007) (unpublished); United\n\nStates v. Zuñiga-Chávez, 376 F. Supp. 2d 1163, 1166 (D.N.M. 2004)\n\n(\"If docket sheets are sufficient, it follows that a certified copy\n\nof   an   abstract      judgment     is   also    sufficient      to   establish     the\n\nexistence     of    a   prior    conviction       by   a    preponderance      of    the\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fevidence.\").   We endorse these cases and hold that attested copies\n\nof electronic docket entries may be a sufficient proffer of prior\n\nconviction for sentencing proceedings before a district court.   We\n\ntherefore conclude that the court below properly admitted the Maine\n\nstate conviction documents and reject McKenzie's appeal.\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's sentence.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In April 2006, McKenzie and two others sold 8.7 grams of crack cocaine to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agent. McKenzie was arrested and charged with distributing five grams or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> more of cocaine base and aiding and abetting such conduct, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2. The statutory mandatory minimum for violations of § 841(a)(1) involving more than five grams of crack is sixty months' imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B). A sentence below sixty months can, however, be imposed if the defendant satisfies various enumerated requirements for safety-valve relief under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f). One such requirement is that the defendant's criminal history score be zero or one, yielding a CHC of I.</p>\n<p>McKenzie pled guilty as charged, and the district court accepted the guilty plea. The district court adopted the recommended guidelines offense level of nineteen set forth in the Probation Office's pre-sentence report (\"PSR\"). To arrive at that offense level, the court began with a base level of twenty-six for the charged offense, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(7)(2006); reduced the offense level by three for acceptance of responsibility, <i>id.</i> § 3E1.1(a)-(b); and further reduced the offense level by four to reflect McKenzie's minimal role in the charged offense, <i>id.</i> § 3B1.2(a).</p>\n<p>The PSR also recommended a CHC of II due to McKenzie's prior Maine state convictions: (1) an October 2005 conviction of misdemeanor assault for slapping a bar employee in the face; and (2) a June 2006 conviction of misdemeanor theft for shoplifting sleeping pills and baby diapers from a supermarket. The proof proffered for these two convictions was the Maine state court electronic docket record, which was attested to by a Maine court official as authentic.</p>\n<p>An offense level of nineteen combined with a CHC of II yielded an advisory guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") of thirty-three to forty-one months. The PSR recommended, however, that the GSR be amended to sixty months, in accordance with the statutory minimum for McKenzie's conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>At sentencing, McKenzie objected to several aspects of the PSR, including the calculation of her CHC and criminal history score and her consequent lack of safety-valve eligibility. Specifically, McKenzie took issue with the use of electronic docket records to prove her two prior Maine convictions. McKenzie also focused particular attention on the shoplifting conviction and argued that it should not have counted for criminal history purposes. The Government maintained that a CHC of II was appropriate, and that the shoplifting conviction had to factor into McKenzie's criminal history score because in <i>United States v. Spaulding,</i> 339 F.3d 20 (1st Cir.2003), we held that the potential for physical confrontation made it impossible to conclude that shoplifting was \"similar to\" certain offenses excluded from CHC calculations under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c). <i>Id.</i> at 22.</p>\n<p>The district court found the facts as set forth in the PSR, ruled that the PSR properly calculated the two Maine convictions, and accepted the computerized docket reports as sufficient proof of the convictions. The court also held that it was bound to count the shoplifting conviction in McKenzie's CHC because of our holding in <i>Spaulding.</i> The court did, however, grant the Government's motion under U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1 for substantial assistance, which recommended that McKenzie receive a twelve-percent downward departure from the sixty-month statutory minimum. The court went much further and gave McKenzie a thirty-percent downward departure, resulting in a forty-two month sentence. The court's reasons for this departure centered on McKenzie's tragic childhood and vulnerable psychological condition, threats made to her in jail over the prospect that she might testify against others, and the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> fact that she was pregnant and had a small child.</p>\n<p>On appeal, McKenzie challenges her sentence on two grounds. First, she argues that the district court applied an incorrect test to evaluate whether her prior Maine shoplifting conviction should have been considered for purposes of calculating her CHC. Second, she argues that the district court erred in accepting computerized docket reports as adequate proof of her prior Maine state convictions. As we now explain, neither challenge has merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review questions of law involved in sentencing determinations <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. Jones,</i> 523 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Pho,</i> 433 F.3d 53, 60-61 (1st Cir.2006), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Prior Maine Shoplifting Conviction</h2>\n<p>Where a defendant is convicted of an offense involving five or more grams of crack cocaine, she must be given a mandatory minimum sentence of five years, even if her GSR is lower. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez,</i> 938 F.2d 319, 320 (1st Cir. 1991). Even where the mandatory minimum applies, however, a sentencing court can apply a lower sentence under the safety-valve provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) if the defendant meets five enumerated criteria. Only one of those criteria is at issue here: whether the district court properly found McKenzie's CHC to be II. If so, she is ineligible for safety-valve relief. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1).</p>\n<p>Section 4A1.2(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines governs the types of prior convictions that may be considered for purposes of calculating a defendant's criminal history score. All felony offenses are counted. Misdemeanors are counted as well, with an important exception crucial to McKenzie's appeal: if the prior conviction is for one of a listed number of misdemeanor offenses, or an offense \"similar to\" a listed offense, it is not counted as long as the sentence served was not a term of probation of at least one year, or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days. <i>Id.</i> § 4A1.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the district court determined that the PSR properly factored McKenzie's June 2006 shoplifting into her CHC score. The court agreed with the Government's argument that <i>Spaulding</i> controlled the issue. McKenzie now urges us to reverse <i>Spaulding</i> and remand her case to the district court, substituting for the \"similar to\" standard a \"common sense\" approach. As the basis for her request, McKenzie points to amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission (\"Commission\"), made effective on November 1, 2007. Particularly, McKenzie relies on the addition of Application Note 12(A) to the Guidelines commentary, which in pertinent part reads:</p>\n<blockquote>In determining whether an unlisted offense is similar to an offense listed in [§ 4A1.2](c)(1) . . ., the court should use a common sense approach that includes consideration of relevant factors such as (i) a comparison of punishments imposed for the listed and unlisted offenses; (ii) the perceived seriousness of the offense as indicated by the level of punishment; (iii) the elements of the offense; (iv) the level of culpability involved; and (v) the degree to which the commission of the offense indicates a likelihood of recurring criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 4A1.2 n. 12(A).</p>\n<p>We reject McKenzie's call to depart from <i>Spaulding.</i> Our cases are clear that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> three-judge panels are bound by prior panel decisions absent extraordinary circumstances. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Duval,</i> 496 F.3d 64, 85 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 469 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir. 2006)); <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 469 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[W]e remain bound to prior panel decisions `in the absence of supervening authority sufficient to warrant disregard of established precedent.'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.1991))).</p>\n<p>The relevant facts in <i>Spaulding</i> are markedly similar to those in this case. There, we rejected the defendant's claim that his prior conviction for shoplifting approximately $21 worth of goods should be excluded from his criminal history score because it was \"similar to\" an insufficient funds check conviction, an offense listed in § 4A1.2(c)(1), and therefore exempt from being counted in a defendant's CHC. <i>Spaulding,</i> 339 F.3d at 22. Doing so, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote>[S]hoplifting poses a markedly greater risk to the public. Passing a bad check poses little risk of physical confrontation, because the perpetrator is not present when the victim realizes that he has been victimized. Shoplifting, on the other hand, creates the very real risk of physical confrontation between the perpetrator and the victim. A store employee or customer may confront the perpetrator in an attempt to thwart the crime. The risk of confrontation precludes a conclusion that shoplifting is \"similar to\" passing a bad check.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i><sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>McKenzie does not attempt to persuade us that the circumstances surrounding her case can be significantly distinguished from those we addressed in <i>Spaulding.</i> Instead, she asks us to remand her case for consideration of the criminal history applicability of her prior shoplifting conviction under the recently established \"common sense\" standard. McKenzie, however, does not present us with any meaningful basis to comply with her request. The amendments to the Guidelines on which McKenzie anchors her claim were adopted after her sentencing in November 2007. We have no reason to believe that the Commission intended the amendments to apply retroactively. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Crudup,</i> 375 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Havener,</i> 905 F.2d 3, 5-7 (1st Cir.1990). Moreover, McKenzie has provided no basis for us to conclude that consideration of her prior conviction under a \"common sense\" standard would yield a different result.<sup>[2]</sup> Pursuant to <i>Spaulding,</i> we conclude that the district court properly included McKenzie's prior Maine shoplifting conviction in its criminal history calculation and that she was accordingly not entitled to a safety-valve downward adjustment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Use of Computerized Docket Reports</h2>\n<p>At sentencing, the Government has the burden to establish, by a preponderance of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> the evidence, the existence of a prior conviction. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Díaz,</i> 519 F.3d 56, 67 (1st Cir.2008). The Government may satisfy its burden by producing a certified copy of the conviction or an equivalent proffer. <i>United States v. Unger,</i> 915 F.2d 759, 761 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also </i><i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (equivalent proffer for criminal history purposes includes the charging document, a written plea agreement, a transcript, or another official court document).</p>\n<p>McKenzie challenges the district court's reliance on attested copies of computerized docket entries as proof of her prior Maine state convictions for shoplifting and misdemeanor assault. She urges us to develop a higher standard of proof that would render these docket reports unacceptable as proof of conviction.</p>\n<p>We find no reason to disturb the district court's judgment on this issue. Over McKenzie's objections at sentencing, the district court correctly noted that electronic docket records are increasingly the norm in today's world. Moreover, McKenzie did not attempt to show that the records were inaccurate and conceded that they were properly authenticated. We have not previously addressed the admissibility of attested copies of computerized docket entries for criminal history sentencing purposes but other courts have concluded that electronic docket records can sufficiently establish a defendant's criminal history by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Cousin,</i> 219 Fed.Appx. 190, 194 (3d Cir.2007) (unpublished); <i>United States v. Zuñiga-Chávez,</i> 376 F.Supp.2d 1163, 1166 (D.N.M. 2004) (\"If docket sheets are sufficient, it follows that a certified copy of an abstract judgment is also sufficient to establish the existence of a prior conviction by a preponderance of the evidence.\"). We endorse these cases and hold that attested copies of electronic docket entries may be a sufficient proffer of prior conviction for sentencing proceedings before a district court. We therefore conclude that the court below properly admitted the Maine state conviction documents and reject McKenzie's appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  With one exception, other circuits have agreed with this reasoning. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ubiera,</i> 486 F.3d 71, 74-76 (2d Cir.2007) (citing, <i>inter alia, </i><i>Spaulding,</i> 339 F.3d at 22); <i>United States v. Osborne,</i> 514 F.3d 377, 391-92 (4th Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Lamm,</i> 392 F.3d 130, 132-34 (5th Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Harris,</i> 325 F.3d 865, 873 (7th Cir. 2003); <i>United States v.

López-Pastrana,</i> 244 F.3d 1025, 1027-31 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>[2]  Notably, McKenzie did not proffer an analysis of her prior shoplifting conviction through the rubric of Application Note 12(A) in an effort to show that any result other than that expounded in <i>Spaulding</i> would be reached.</p>\n\n</div>",

The district court sentenced McKenzie to forty-two months' imprisonment.

After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In April 2006, McKenzie and two others sold 8.7 grams of crack cocaine to an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agent. McKenzie was arrested and charged with distributing five grams or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> more of cocaine base and aiding and abetting such conduct, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2. The statutory mandatory minimum for violations of § 841(a)(1) involving more than five grams of crack is sixty months' imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B). A sentence below sixty months can, however, be imposed if the defendant satisfies various enumerated requirements for safety-valve relief under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f).

Prior Maine Shoplifting Conviction</h2>\n<p>Where a defendant is convicted of an offense involving five or more grams of crack cocaine, she must be given a mandatory minimum sentence of five years, even if her GSR is lower. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B); <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

She urges us to develop a higher standard of proof that would render these docket reports unacceptable as proof of conviction.</p>\n<p>We find no reason to disturb the district court's judgment on this issue. Over McKenzie's objections at sentencing, the district court correctly noted that electronic docket records are increasingly the norm in today's world. Moreover, McKenzie did not attempt to show that the records were inaccurate and conceded that they were properly authenticated. We have not previously addressed the admissibility of attested copies of computerized docket entries for criminal history sentencing purposes but other courts have concluded that electronic docket records can sufficiently establish a defendant's criminal history by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Cousin,</i> 219 Fed.Appx. 190, 194 (3d Cir.2007) (unpublished); <i>United States v. Zuñiga-Chávez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2469094\"><a href=\"/opinion/2469094/united-states-v-zuniga-chavez/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1163</span></a></span>, 1166 (D.N.M. 2004) (\"If docket sheets are sufficient, it follows that a certified copy of an abstract judgment is also sufficient to establish the existence of a prior conviction by a preponderance of the evidence.\"). We endorse these cases and hold that attested copies of electronic docket entries may be a sufficient proffer of prior conviction for sentencing proceedings before a district court. We therefore conclude that the court below properly admitted the Maine state conviction documents and reject McKenzie's appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  With one exception, other circuits have agreed with this reasoning. <i>See </i><i>United States v.
