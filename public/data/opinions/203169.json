The petition for\n\nrehearing having been denied by a majority of the panel of judges who decided the case and the\n\npetition for rehearing en banc having been submitted to the active judges of this court and a majority\n\nof the judges not having voted that the case be heard en banc, it is ordered that the petition for\n\nrehearing and petition for rehearing en banc be denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -1-\n\f       TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the denial of John\n\nCerqueira's petition for rehearing en banc. The panel opinion offers a sweeping interpretation of 49\n\nU.S.C. § 44902(b) which goes further than any other court and, more importantly, further than\n\nCongress had intended in enacting that provision. Its application to an airline's denial of rebooking\n\nis a matter of first impression; no other court has applied it in such a manner. The issue is of\n\nexceptional importance not only for its novelty but also in light of the high-security environs in\n\nwhich we find ourselves today.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       There are two distinct parts to this case: (1) the Captain's decision to remove Cerqueira from\n\nhis original flight and (2) American Airlines' refusal to rebook him on another, later flight. With\n\nrespect to the first, the panel opinion concludes that Section 44902(b) endows the Captain with\n\ntremendous immunity when making difficult, split-second decisions regarding a passenger on his\n\nflight. Indeed, \"even mistaken decisions are protected as long as they are not arbitrary or capricious\n\n. . . assum[ing] that . . . [a] responsible decisionmaker could credit the information provided.\" Slip\n\nOp. at 29. I agree that such considerations for the Captain are not only necessary but are also\n\nconsistent with the underlying legislative intent:\n\n       Congress was certainly aware that decisions under [§ 44902(b)] would in many\n       instances probably have to be made within minutes of the plane's scheduled take-off\n       time, and that the carrier's formulation of opinion would have to rest on something\n       less than absolute certainty.\n\n\nWilliams v. Trans World Airlines, 509 F.2d 942, 948 (2d Cir. 1975) (emphasis added).\n\n       The decision to deny rebooking is a separate and independent decision made by the SOC\n\nmanager. It is clear that Cerqueira was not going to reboard the original fight: after deciding to\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fremove Cerqueira (and the other two passengers) from the flight, the Captain was told by the state\n\npolice officers that \"[t]hese three gentlemen are not traveling with you today. It's out of your hands.\"\n\nSlip Op. at 14-15. The rebooking decision concerned whether Cerqueira was to be rebooked on\n\nanother, later flight after being cleared by the police. There was no imperative that the SOC manager\n\nmake an immediate decision with respect to rebooking; the decision was made without time pressure\n\nand with the benefit of additional information afforded by the police investigation.1\n\n        No other court has applied Section 44902(b) to this type of situation. All of the cases\n\ndiscussed in the opinion arise in a context in which a decisionmaker must determine whether to\n\nremove or bar a particular passenger from a flight because of security-related concerns. See, e.g.,\n\nCordero v. Cía. Mexicana de Aviación, S.A., 681 F.2d 669, 672 (9th Cir. 1982) (refusal to allow\n\nplaintiff to continue on the flight after an unscheduled stop); Williams, 509 F.2d at 944 (refusal to\n\ntransport plaintiff on his ticketed flight); Dasrath v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 467 F. Supp. 2d 431, 432-\n\n33 (D.N.J. 2006) (passengers removed by pilot for security reasons); Al-Qudhai'een v. Am. W.\n\nAirlines, Inc., 267 F. Supp. 2d 841 (S.D. Ohio 2003) (same). None have ever raised questions about\n\nfuture travel. In fact, in Williams, TWA had offered various alternate flight arrangements to the\n\nplaintiff after refusing him passage on his original flight. Williams, 509 F.2d at 945. In contrast,\n\nAmerican Airlines refunded the remaining portion of Cerqueira's trip, refused to rebook him on an\n\n\n\n\n1\n    The panel opinion's treatment of the SOC manager's decision conflates the fact that the decision\nwas made quickly with the need for that decision to be made so quickly. A captain's decision\nregarding a security threat is necessarily a hasty one because it involves a take-off schedule and\naffects all of those on the plane. The SOC manager's decision enjoys the luxury of time: the next\navailable flight was not scheduled to depart until that afternoon and Cerqueira was cleared by the\nstate police before 9:00 A.M.\n\n                                                  -3-\n\favailable flight later that afternoon, and simply informed him that the \"decision had been made by\n\nAA's corporate offices.\" Slip Op. at 18.\n\n       This case puts the rebooking scenario squarely in front of the court. Cerqueira's complaint\n\nclearly alleges two separate claims. Yet, with little to no discussion, the panel opinion takes a major\n\nleap in extending the mantle of decisional emergency to an airline decisionmaker who is removed\n\nfrom the exigencies of split-second passenger safety determinations. In so doing, the opinion\n\ntransforms Section 44902(b)'s exceptional immunity into a legal framework that may apply in all\n\nairline decisions. After concluding that Section 44902(b) governs the SOC manager's decision, the\n\nopinion states that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting methodology for evaluating indirect\n\nevidence of discriminatory intent is \"inconsistent\" with the Section 44902(b) test. Slip Op. at 37.\n\nThe opinion goes on to conclude that Cerqueira's challenge to the rebooking decision fails because\n\n\"[t]here is no evidence that the SOC manager's decision was based on race discrimination . . . there\n\nis no evidence that the SOC manager was aware of the plaintiff's appearance, race, or ethnicity . . .\n\n[and thus] the § 1981 claim against the SOC manager fails.\" Slip Op. at 36.\n\n       The McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework was crafted by the Supreme Court\n\nspecifically to ameliorate the difficulties in obtaining direct evidence of racial discrimination.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). Accordingly, we have used that\n\nframework in evaluating § 1981 claims. See, e.g., Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 250 F.3d 23,\n\n33 (1st Cir. 2001); Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp., 846 F.2d 103, 107 (1st Cir. 1988); T&S Serv.\n\nAssoc., Inc., v. Crenson, 666 F.2d 722, 724 (1st Cir. 1981). In requiring a plaintiff to submit direct\n\nevidence of discriminatory animus in the rebooking scenario, the opinion uses Section 44902(b) to\n\neffectively exempt a broad swath of airline decisions from the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fmethodology. Such was not the intent of Congress in promulgating Section 44902(b), and the\n\nopinion fails to provide a compelling rationale for doing so. I am firmly opposed to the expansion\n\nof the airline's immunity in this manner.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n       Additionally, I think that the panel opinion erroneously concludes that \"no properly instructed\n\njury could return a verdict against the air carrier.\" Slip Op. at 3. In so concluding, the opinion\n\nimproperly encroaches upon the fact-finding responsibilities of the jury. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nNascimento, 491 F.3d 25, 46-47 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Sifting through conflicting testimony and\n\ndetermining where the truth lies is the sort of work that falls squarely within the jury's province.\").\n\nUnder either a § 1981 burden-shifting analysis or the Section 44902(b) arbitrary and capricious\n\nstandard, a properly instructed and reasonable jury could find in favor of Cerqueira with respect to\n\nthe rebooking decision.\n\n       Applying McDonnell Douglas, a reasonable jury could conclude that the denial of rebooking\n\nwas based on the perception that Cerqueira was from the Middle East. The SOC manager based his\n\ndecision not to rebook Cerqueira on the security information provided by the Captain, a combination\n\nof his personal concerns and those of his flight attendants. Trial testimony and record evidence\n\nindicated that at least one flight attendant's information may have been race-based. While we\n\nremove any responsibility on the part of the Captain to conduct an inquiry into representations made\n\nby other air carrier employees, there is no convincing rationale for extending that consideration to\n\ndecisionmakers such as the SOC manager who are not compelled by exigent circumstances. After\n\nlistening to the testimony of the airline employees and reviewing the evidence, a jury should\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fdetermine whether it believes that the airline acted out of legitimate safety concerns in denying\n\nrebooking, or if the actions were based on race discrimination.\n\n       Alternatively, even if the Section 44902(b) standard applies to the SOC manager's decision,\n\na reasonable jury could conclude that the airline's failure to inquire into Cerqueira's status before\n\nissuing its denial was arbitrary and capricious.2 While we do not impose a burden on the Captain\n\nto conduct an investigation, the SOC manager can be held to greater scrutiny without compromising\n\nsafety. Cerqueira was released by the police with no charges; those facts were within the knowledge\n\nof the airline when the decision not to rebook was made, and, in any event, available sufficiently\n\nprior to the afternoon flight, to allow American Airlines time to rationally consider its rebooking\n\ndetermination. The failure of American Airlines to do so and its refusal to give any reason for acting\n\nin such an apparently arbitrary manner, when placed against the background of the earlier evidence,\n\npresents sufficient facts to have the rebooking issue go before a properly instructed jury. A\n\nreasonable jury \"might have concluded that the [airline] acted unreasonably in excluding [the\n\npassenger] without even the most cursory inquiry into the complaint against him.\" Cordero, 681\n\nF.2d at 672.\n\n\n\n\n2\n    Although the panel opinion emphasizes the \"short proximity\" (i.e. \"within minutes\") between\nthe Captain's decision not to allow Cerqueira to fly and the SOC manager's decision to deny\nrebooking, that assertion is unsupported by the record. See Slip Op. at 36. Prior to the flight's\noriginal estimated departure time of 6:35 A.M., Cerqueira was removed from the flight and taken\nby the police for questioning. He was released by the police around 9:00 A.M. Although the\nCaptain had contacted the SOC to provide a \"full report on the security issues and to notify them that\nthe flight would not be departing on time\" it was not until 9:01 A.M. that the customer service\nmanager, \"per SOC [manager],\" made an entry stating that Cerqueira was to have his ticket refunded.\nSeveral minutes later, another entry stated: \"Do not rebook on AA.\" Slip Op. at 11, 17.\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                III.\n\n       I am deeply troubled by the legal implications of the opinion and, therefore, dissent from the\n\ndenial of en banc review.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f        LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the denial of en banc\n\nrehearing for all of the reasons Judge Torruella sets forth in his dissent. I write separately to add one\n\nadditional point.\n\n        We recognized in Cariglia v. Hertz Equip. Rental Corp., 363 F.3d 77, 83 (1st Cir. 2004), that\n\ncorporate liability for discrimination could attach if a neutral decisionmaker relied on information\n\nthat was inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete because of another employee's discriminatory animus.\n\nThe Captain testified that he conveyed to the SOC what the flight attendants had reported to him,\n\nand the jury had evidence before it supporting an inference that at least one flight attendant's\n\ninformation may have been race-based. As such, the plaintiff would be entitled to rely on a Cariglia\n\ntheory that corporate liability could attach because the SOC manager relied on information that was\n\ninaccurate, misleading, or incomplete because of a flight attendant's discriminatory animus.\n\n        As the panel decision notes, we have not previously applied this theory of corporate liability\n\nto a discrimination claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981. However, we have noted that the standards of\n\nliability under § 1981, Title VII, and the Massachusetts state employment discrimination statute\n\n(under which Cariglia arose) are substantially identical. Villanueva v. Wellesley College, 930 F.2d\n\n124, 127 n.2 (1st Cir. 1991); see also T & S Serv. Assocs., Inc. v. Crenson, 666 F.2d 722, 724 (1st\n\nCir. 1981) (applying the McDonnell Douglas framework, developed under Title VII, in a\n\nnonemployment § 1981 case); cf. Danco, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 178 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(noting that the list of activities protected under § 1981 now includes \"the making, performance,\n\nmodification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and\n\nconditions of the contractual relationship,\" tracking the language of Title VII's prohibition on\n\ndiscrimination with respect to \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\").\n\n\n                                                  -8-\n\fAgainst this backdrop, the panel's conclusion that Cariglia should not extend to the rebooking\n\ndecision is dubious.\n\n       The panel concludes that \"[t]he § 1981 claim against the SOC manager's decision was\n\nderivative of the § 1981 claim against the Captain's decision\" because the SOC manager had only\n\nthe information conveyed to him by the Captain. I respectfully submit that this conclusion is flawed.\n\nThe SOC manager made a separate decision as to whether the passenger could be rebooked on a\n\nflight that was scheduled to depart hours later. In doing so, he may have relied – perhaps unwittingly\n\n– on information tainted by a flight attendant's racial animus. While the law affords the Captain\n\ngreat latitude because his decision must be made quickly, the SOC manager – and American Airlines\n\nas a whole – is not entitled to piggyback on that first decision and thereby multiply any\n\ndiscriminatory animus underlying it. This conflation of the Captain's decision and the SOC\n\nmanager's decision should have been considered and corrected by the en banc court. Accordingly,\n\nI dissent from the denial of en banc review.\n\n                                                       By the Court:\n\n\n\n                                                           /s/\n                                                       Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n[Certified copies to Hon.

In fact, in Williams, TWA had offered various alternate flight arrangements to the\n\nplaintiff after refusing him passage on his original flight. Williams, 509 F.2d at 945. In contrast,\n\nAmerican Airlines refunded the remaining portion of Cerqueira's trip, refused to rebook him on an\n\n\n\n\n1\n    The panel opinion's treatment of the SOC manager's decision conflates the fact that the decision\nwas made quickly with the need for that decision to be made so quickly. A captain's decision\nregarding a security threat is necessarily a hasty one because it involves a take-off schedule and\naffects all of those on the plane. The SOC manager's decision enjoys the luxury of time: the next\navailable flight was not scheduled to depart until that afternoon and Cerqueira was cleared by the\nstate police before 9:00 A.M.\n\n                                                  -3-\n\favailable flight later that afternoon, and simply informed him that the \"decision had been made by\n\nAA's corporate offices.\" Slip Op. at 18.\n\n       This case puts the rebooking scenario squarely in front of the court. Cerqueira's complaint\n\nclearly alleges two separate claims. Yet, with little to no discussion, the panel opinion takes a major\n\nleap in extending the mantle of decisional emergency to an airline decisionmaker who is removed\n\nfrom the exigencies of split-second passenger safety determinations. In so doing, the opinion\n\ntransforms Section 44902(b)'s exceptional immunity into a legal framework that may apply in all\n\nairline decisions. After concluding that Section 44902(b) governs the SOC manager's decision, the\n\nopinion states that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting methodology for evaluating indirect\n\nevidence of discriminatory intent is \"inconsistent\" with the Section 44902(b) test. Slip Op. at 37.\n\nThe opinion goes on to conclude that Cerqueira's challenge to the rebooking decision fails because\n\n\"[t]here is no evidence that the SOC manager's decision was based on race discrimination . . . there\n\nis no evidence that the SOC manager was aware of the plaintiff's appearance, race, or ethnicity . . .\n\n[and thus] the § 1981 claim against the SOC manager fails.\" Slip Op. at 36.\n\n       The McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework was crafted by the Supreme Court\n\nspecifically to ameliorate the difficulties in obtaining direct evidence of racial discrimination.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

In requiring a plaintiff to submit direct\n\nevidence of discriminatory animus in the rebooking scenario, the opinion uses Section 44902(b) to\n\neffectively exempt a broad swath of airline decisions from the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fmethodology. Such was not the intent of Congress in promulgating Section 44902(b), and the\n\nopinion fails to provide a compelling rationale for doing so. I am firmly opposed to the expansion\n\nof the airline's immunity in this manner.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n       Additionally, I think that the panel opinion erroneously concludes that \"no properly instructed\n\njury could return a verdict against the air carrier.\" Slip Op. at 3. In so concluding, the opinion\n\nimproperly encroaches upon the fact-finding responsibilities of the jury. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nNascimento, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202833\"><a href=\"/opinion/202833/united-states-v-nascimento/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 46-47 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Sifting through conflicting testimony and\n\ndetermining where the truth lies is the sort of work that falls squarely within the jury's province.\").\n\nUnder either a § 1981 burden-shifting analysis or the Section 44902(b) arbitrary and capricious\n\nstandard, a properly instructed and reasonable jury could find in favor of Cerqueira with respect to\n\nthe rebooking decision.\n\n       Applying McDonnell Douglas, a reasonable jury could conclude that the denial of rebooking\n\nwas based on the perception that Cerqueira was from the Middle East. The SOC manager based his\n\ndecision not to rebook Cerqueira on the security information provided by the Captain, a combination\n\nof his personal concerns and those of his flight attendants. Trial testimony and record evidence\n\nindicated that at least one flight attendant's information may have been race-based. While we\n\nremove any responsibility on the part of the Captain to conduct an inquiry into representations made\n\nby other air carrier employees, there is no convincing rationale for extending that consideration to\n\ndecisionmakers such as the SOC manager who are not compelled by exigent circumstances. After\n\nlistening to the testimony of the airline employees and reviewing the evidence, a jury should\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fdetermine whether it believes that the airline acted out of legitimate safety concerns in denying\n\nrebooking, or if the actions were based on race discrimination.\n\n       Alternatively, even if the Section 44902(b) standard applies to the SOC manager's decision,\n\na reasonable jury could conclude that the airline's failure to inquire into Cerqueira's status before\n\nissuing its denial was arbitrary and capricious.2 While we do not impose a burden on the Captain\n\nto conduct an investigation, the SOC manager can be held to greater scrutiny without compromising\n\nsafety. Cerqueira was released by the police with no charges; those facts were within the knowledge\n\nof the airline when the decision not to rebook was made, and, in any event, available sufficiently\n\nprior to the afternoon flight, to allow American Airlines time to rationally consider its rebooking\n\ndetermination. The failure of American Airlines to do so and its refusal to give any reason for acting\n\nin such an apparently arbitrary manner, when placed against the background of the earlier evidence,\n\npresents sufficient facts to have the rebooking issue go before a properly instructed jury. A\n\nreasonable jury \"might have concluded that the [airline] acted unreasonably in excluding [the\n\npassenger] without even the most cursory inquiry into the complaint against him.\" Cordero, 681\n\nF.2d at 672.\n\n\n\n\n2\n    Although the panel opinion emphasizes the \"short proximity\" (i.e. \"within minutes\") between\nthe Captain's decision not to allow Cerqueira to fly and the SOC manager's decision to deny\nrebooking, that assertion is unsupported by the record. See Slip Op. at 36. Prior to the flight's\noriginal estimated departure time of 6:35 A.M., Cerqueira was removed from the flight and taken\nby the police for questioning. He was released by the police around 9:00 A.M. Although the\nCaptain had contacted the SOC to provide a \"full report on the security issues and to notify them that\nthe flight would not be departing on time\" it was not until 9:01 A.M. that the customer service\nmanager, \"per SOC [manager],\" made an entry stating that Cerqueira was to have his ticket refunded.\nSeveral minutes later, another entry stated: \"Do not rebook on AA.\" Slip Op. at 11, 17.\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                III.\n\n       I am deeply troubled by the legal implications of the opinion and, therefore, dissent from the\n\ndenial of en banc review.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f        LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.

As such, the plaintiff would be entitled to rely on a Cariglia\n\ntheory that corporate liability could attach because the SOC manager relied on information that was\n\ninaccurate, misleading, or incomplete because of a flight attendant's discriminatory animus.\n\n        As the panel decision notes, we have not previously applied this theory of corporate liability\n\nto a discrimination claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981. However, we have noted that the standards of\n\nliability under § 1981, Title VII, and the Massachusetts state employment discrimination statute\n\n(under which Cariglia arose) are substantially identical.

I respectfully submit that this conclusion is flawed.\n\nThe SOC manager made a separate decision as to whether the passenger could be rebooked on a\n\nflight that was scheduled to depart hours later. In doing so, he may have relied – perhaps unwittingly\n\n– on information tainted by a flight attendant's racial animus. While the law affords the Captain\n\ngreat latitude because his decision must be made quickly, the SOC manager – and American Airlines\n\nas a whole – is not entitled to piggyback on that first decision and thereby multiply any\n\ndiscriminatory animus underlying it.
