This is a governmental appeal\n                                 \n\nfrom a  sentence in  which the  district court  departed downward\n\nfrom  the  Sentencing  Guidelines.   The  court  determined  that\n\ndefendant's family situation revealed an aggravating circumstance\n\nmaking this an \"unusual case\" not contemplated by the Guidelines.\n\nApplying the  modified standard of review for such cases recently\n\nannounced in United States v. Rivera,  Nos. 92-1749, -2167, slip.\n                                    \n\nop. (1st Cir. June 4, 1993), we affirm.\n\n     Defendant Joseph Sclamo, Jr.  was arrested for attempting to\n\ndeliver  nine  and  one-half  ounces  of  cocaine  to  undercover\n\nagents.1  He  pled guilty to  a single  count of possession  with\n\nintent  to distribute,  in  violation of  21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1).\n\nUnder  the Guidelines,  Sclamo's offense  level was  17,  and his\n\ncriminal history category was II.   The district court,  however,\n\ntreated  Sclamo's  criminal  history  category as  I  because  it\n\nconsidered the  higher category to overrepresent  the severity of\n\ndefendant's criminal  history.  The government  recommended a 28-\n\nmonth  sentence, with  36 months  of supervised  release, and  an\n\nassessment of $50.\n\n     Sclamo requested a downward  departure based on his domestic\n\nsituation.  For some three years, he had been living with a woman\n\nand  her two children and  had developed a  special and crucially\n\n                    \n\n     1  Sclamo's  arrest stemmed  from his involvement  in a  DEA\noperation  targeting his father.  The father was charged with two\ncounts  of  drug  offenses, to  which  he  pled  guilty, and  was\nsentenced with defendant.   The father received a sentence  of 54\nmonths of imprisonment,  36 months of supervised release,  and an\nassessment of $100.\n\n                               -2-\n\nimportant  relationship  with  the  twelve-year-old  son,  James.\n\nSclamo urged that his  presence at home was  vital to James,  who\n\nwas  in need of his  continuing companionship and  guidance.  Two\n\nletters  from James's psychologist  were submitted  with Sclamo's\n\nmotion. \n\n     According to the first letter, written in April, 1992, since\n\nage  5,  James  continually had  been  abused  physically by  his\n\nalcoholic biological father.2   James began to display aggressive\n\nand disruptive behavior at home and in school and was placed in a\n\nbehavior  disorder  class.    Eventually,  he  was  diagnosed  as\n\npossessing \"attention  deficit  hyperactivity disorder\"  and  was\n\nreferred to  the psychologist  for individual psychotherapy  on a\n\nweekly outreach basis  to help him develop \"more effective coping\n\nskills.\"\n\n     James's mother divorced  his father  in 1989.   In the  same\n\nyear  Sclamo began to live with James's family.  The psychologist\n\nsaw Sclamo weekly,  giving him and James's mother  instruction in\n\nparenting  skills  and  behavior  modification  techniques.   The\n\npsychologist praised  Sclamo as \"very  supportive, concerned, and\n\nmature in  his judgement and  follow through.\"   The psychologist\n\nstated that James now  views Sclamo as his stepfather,  with whom\n\nhe  has developed  a  \"warm  and  trusting  relationship  .  .  .\n\nresulting in a dramatic reduction  in aggressive acting out,\"  an\n\nabsence of school suspensions, and improved grades.\n\n                    \n\n     2   James's father eventually was subjected to a restraining\norder and then given a two-year suspended sentence for abuse.  \n\n                               -3-\n\n     The  psychologist  concluded  that  Sclamo  played  a  major\n\npositive role in James's therapy  and that his continued presence\n\nwas   \"necessary   for  James's   increasing   progress.\"     The\n\npsychologist warned that Sclamo's  \"removal from the family would\n\nrob  all members of a  critical source of  affection and positive\n\ncare and clinically could  trigger a major regression in  James's\n\nstability and emotional development.\" \n\n     Six months later, a month before the sentencing hearing, the\n\npsychologist reported  in a  second letter that  James's progress\n\nboth at home  and at school was  continuing.  James was now  in a\n\n\"main stream class.\"  The psychologist credited Sclamo's \"ongoing\n\nand persistent  efforts . . .  to set clear and  firm limits with\n\nJames.\"   Noting  that Sclamo  \"has played  a tremendous  role in\n\nJames's progress and continues to be the  only available resource\n\nfor  positive male  bonding,\" the  psychologist recommended  that\n\ndefendant be allowed to continue to  live at home, where he could\n\nserve as  a \"positive father  surrogate for this 12  year old boy\n\nwho   is  most   needy  for   continued  positive   guidance  and\n\ncompanionship to insure appropriate maturational development.\"\n\n     Based  on  this  information,  the court  concluded  that  a\n\ndownward  departure  was  appropriate.     It  recognized   \"that\n\nordinarily  family circumstances  do not  constitute a  basis for\n\ndownward departure\" but felt that precedents in which courts have\n\ndeparted downward \"are very  much like this one in which there is\n\nevidence  of   an  exceptional   kind  of  relationship   and  an\n\nexceptional  risk  of harm  to a  child  if that  relationship is\n\n                               -4-\n\nbroken.\"   Tr.  at 22-23.    The court  further credited  the two\n\nreports from the psychologist as constituting \n\n     a  very compelling  set  of evidence  about a  personal\n     relationship that  I don't think there's  any reason to\n     believe arose  with  any purpose  of escaping  criminal\n     responsibility but has  occurred independently of that,\n     and it is, I think, a circumstance beyond in degree and\n     nature  those  that  were  taken into  account  in  the\n     guidelines.\n\nId.  at  22.   It accordingly  sentenced  Sclamo to  three years'\n   \n\nprobation,  with confinement at  home for six  months, subject to\n\npermission from  the Chief  Probation Officer  to leave  home for\n\nwork, shopping, and medical attention.\n\n     On appeal, the government contends that family relationships\n\nare  not a  basis  for departure.    It notes  that  imprisonment\n\nnecessarily disrupts such  relationships and that  the sentencing\n\nguidelines provide that \"[f]amily ties and responsibilities . . .\n\nare not ordinarily relevant\"  in determining whether departure is\n\nappropriate.  See  USSG   5H1.6.  The government  further cites a\n                 \n\nnumber of cases in which this court has refused to allow downward\n\ndepartures  based on  family  circumstances.   See, e.g.,  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Carr, 932 F.2d 67, 72 (1st Cir. 1991).\n              \n\n     The  government  also alleges  that,  even  if departure  is\n\npermitted  based  on  family  ties,  Sclamo's  situation  is  not\n\nsufficiently  compelling to  warrant  leniency.   The  government\n\npoints  out that Sclamo is not James's biological father and that\n\ntheir relationship  has not been longstanding.   Additionally, it\n\nurges that defendant's involvement in distributing cocaine in the\n\n                               -5-\n\nfall  of 1989  justified the recommended  sentence of  28 months'\n\nincarceration.\n\n     The  resolution of  this  appeal is  governed by  our recent\n\npronouncements  in  United States  v.  Rivera.   As  Rivera makes\n                                                           \n\nclear, the Guidelines say only  that family circumstances do  not\n\nordinarily  warrant departure.    See  slip  op.  at  12  (citing\n                                     \n\nU.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt.  H).  Thus, while discouraging  departures on\n\nthis ground,  the Guidelines recognize that  \"special, unusual or\n\nother-than-ordinary circumstances,\" id. at  16, may be considered\n                                       \n\nas a basis for departure.  Indeed, our earlier cases  do not hold\n\nthat  district courts lack authority to depart on this ground but\n\nmerely illustrate circumstances not sufficiently extraordinary to\n\nwarrant  departure.  See, e.g., United States v. Rushby, 936 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n41, 43 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n     We briefly recapitulate the  approach Rivera suggests when a\n                                                 \n\ndeparture from the Guidelines  is requested.  The  district court\n\nfirst  should ask: \"What features of this case, potentially, take\n\nit  outside the Guidelines' `heartland' and make of it a special,\n\nor unusual,  case?\"  Rivera, slip op. at 15.  In cases like this,\n                           \n\nwhere the special features are  discouraged, the court should \"go\n\non  to decide  whether  the case  is nonetheless  not `ordinary,'\n\ni.e.,  whether the case differs  from the ordinary  case in which\n    \n\nthose features are present.\"   Id.  If the case is  not ordinary,\n                                  \n\nthe court then may consider departure, deriving whatever guidance\n\nit  can  from  the  Guidelines, but,  ultimately,  \"drawing  upon\n\nexperience  and  informed judgment,\"  id. at  17.   If  the court\n                                         \n\n                               -6-\n\ndecides to depart,  \"it must  explain how the  case (compared  to\n\nother cases where the reason  is present) is special. . .  .\" Id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 21 (emphasis omitted).\n\n     As  for  our role  in  reviewing  such departure  decisions,\n\nRivera  modified  our prescriptions  in  United  States v.  Diaz-\n                                                                 \n\nVillafane,  874 F.2d 43 (1st  Cir. 1989).   In Diaz-Villafane, we\n                                                             \n\nsaid  that  review of  the  district  judge's determination  that\n\ncircumstances   were  \"of  a   kind  or  degree   that  they  may\n\nappropriately   be  relied   upon  to   justify  departure\"   was\n\n\"essentially plenary,\" id. at 49.  Following Rivera, however,  we\n                                                   \n\nnow \"review  the  district court's  determination of  unusualness\n\nwith full  awareness of, and  respect for,  the trier's  superior\n\nfeel  for the case, . . .  not with the understanding that review\n\nis plenary.\"  Rivera, slip op. at  23-24 (quoting Diaz-Villafane,\n                                                                \n\n874 F.2d at 50) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     With  this background  and without  repeating the  essential\n\nfacts in the two reports credited by the district court, we see a\n\nnumber of special factors  that transform Sclamo's situation into\n\nan extraordinary one meriting the downward departure.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited  States v.  Johnson,  964 F.2d  124,  129 (2d  Cir.  1992)\n                          \n\n(affirming  departure  for defendant  who  \"faced  more than  the\n\nresponsibilities  of an ordinary parent,  more even than those of\n\nan  ordinary single  parent\" as  sole caregiver  of 4  very young\n\nchildren);  United States v. Pena, 930 F.2d 1486, 1495 (10th Cir.\n                                 \n\n1991) (affirming  departure to  avoid placing infant  children at\n\nrisk).\n\n                               -7-\n\n     As an  initial matter, we cannot fault  the district court's\n\nconclusion that  the psychological treatment and  observations of\n\nJames were not contrived or fabricated to assist Sclamo.  James's\n\nreferral for individual psychotherapy, made by a case worker with\n\nno  connection to  defendant,  predated the  circumstances giving\n\nrise to  this case.   Moreover,  the  psychologist's reports  are\n\nbased on a long history of personal observation, interaction, and\n\ntreatment  not only  of  James but  of defendant  as  well.   The\n\ndistrict   court,  therefore,   was   entitled   to  credit   the\n\npsychologist's professional judgment  of the critical and  unique\n\nrole played by defendant in James's treatment. \n\n     Turning  to the family ties at issue, we think that Sclamo's\n\nsituation is readily distinguished from ordinary cases, where one\n\ncan  only speculate about  the stresses  that incarceration  of a\n\nfamily member might cause.   In this case, there  is evidence not\n\nonly that James  already suffers  from a  clinical disorder,  but\n\nthat his condition will deteriorate if defendant is incarcerated.\n\nSclamo has a  track record  of steady and  effective support  and\n\nguidance of James over  a lengthy period during which  Sclamo was\n\nboth   instructed  and   monitored  by   a  psychologist.     The\n\npsychologist's  prognosis that  James would  risk  regression and\n\nharm if  defendant were incarcerated amply  supports the district\n\ncourt's  determination that  Sclamo's  relationship  to James  is\n\nsufficiently extraordinary to sustain a downward departure.  \n\n     We therefore  think that, under our  present more restricted\n\nstandard  of review, the decision made by the district court must\n\n                               -8-\n\nbe  affirmed.    We acknowledge  that  our  own  analysis of  the\n\ncircumstances setting this  case apart from the  ordinary case is\n\nmore  lengthy and detailed  than that of the  district court.  In\n\nfuture cases we would expect, in line with our general discussion\n\nin Rivera, a very deliberate discussion of the factors making the\n         \n\ncase unusual.  But we see no purpose served in this case, decided\n\nbelow without the benefit of our recent guidance, in remanding to\n\nmake explicit what was implicit.\n\n     Affirmed.  \n             \n\n                               -9-\n",

The district court,  however,\n\ntreated  Sclamo's  criminal  history  category as  I  because  it\n\nconsidered the  higher category to overrepresent  the severity of\n\ndefendant's criminal  history.  The government  recommended a 28-\n\nmonth  sentence, with  36 months  of supervised  release, and  an\n\nassessment of $50.\n\n     Sclamo requested a downward  departure based on his domestic\n\nsituation.  For some three years, he had been living with a woman\n\nand  her two children and  had developed a  special and crucially\n\n                    \n\n     1  Sclamo's  arrest stemmed  from his involvement  in a  DEA\noperation  targeting his father.  The father was charged with two\ncounts  of  drug  offenses, to  which  he  pled  guilty, and  was\nsentenced with defendant.   The father received a sentence  of 54\nmonths of imprisonment,  36 months of supervised release,  and an\nassessment of $100.\n\n                               -2-\n\nimportant  relationship  with  the  twelve-year-old  son,  James.\n\nSclamo urged that his  presence at home was  vital to James,  who\n\nwas  in need of his  continuing companionship and  guidance.  Two\n\nletters  from James's psychologist  were submitted  with Sclamo's\n\nmotion. \n\n     According to the first letter, written in April, 1992, since\n\nage  5,  James  continually had  been  abused  physically by  his\n\nalcoholic biological father.2   James began to display aggressive\n\nand disruptive behavior at home and in school and was placed in a\n\nbehavior  disorder  class.    Eventually,  he  was  diagnosed  as\n\npossessing \"attention  deficit  hyperactivity disorder\"  and  was\n\nreferred to  the psychologist  for individual psychotherapy  on a\n\nweekly outreach basis  to help him develop \"more effective coping\n\nskills.\"\n\n     James's mother divorced  his father  in 1989.   In the  same\n\nyear  Sclamo began to live with James's family.  The psychologist\n\nsaw Sclamo weekly,  giving him and James's mother  instruction in\n\nparenting  skills  and  behavior  modification  techniques.   The\n\npsychologist praised  Sclamo as \"very  supportive, concerned, and\n\nmature in  his judgement and  follow through.\"   The psychologist\n\nstated that James now  views Sclamo as his stepfather,  with whom\n\nhe  has developed  a  \"warm  and  trusting  relationship  .  .  .\n\nresulting in a dramatic reduction  in aggressive acting out,\"  an\n\nabsence of school suspensions, and improved grades.\n\n                    \n\n     2   James's father eventually was subjected to a restraining\norder and then given a two-year suspended sentence for abuse.  \n\n                               -3-\n\n     The  psychologist  concluded  that  Sclamo  played  a  major\n\npositive role in James's therapy  and that his continued presence\n\nwas   \"necessary   for  James's   increasing   progress.\"     The\n\npsychologist warned that Sclamo's  \"removal from the family would\n\nrob  all members of a  critical source of  affection and positive\n\ncare and clinically could  trigger a major regression in  James's\n\nstability and emotional development.\" \n\n     Six months later, a month before the sentencing hearing, the\n\npsychologist reported  in a  second letter that  James's progress\n\nboth at home  and at school was  continuing.  James was now  in a\n\n\"main stream class.\"  The psychologist credited Sclamo's \"ongoing\n\nand persistent  efforts . . .  to set clear and  firm limits with\n\nJames.\"   Noting  that Sclamo  \"has played  a tremendous  role in\n\nJames's progress and continues to be the  only available resource\n\nfor  positive male  bonding,\" the  psychologist recommended  that\n\ndefendant be allowed to continue to  live at home, where he could\n\nserve as  a \"positive father  surrogate for this 12  year old boy\n\nwho   is  most   needy  for   continued  positive   guidance  and\n\ncompanionship to insure appropriate maturational development.\"\n\n     Based  on  this  information,  the court  concluded  that  a\n\ndownward  departure  was  appropriate.     It  recognized   \"that\n\nordinarily  family circumstances  do not  constitute a  basis for\n\ndownward departure\" but felt that precedents in which courts have\n\ndeparted downward \"are very  much like this one in which there is\n\nevidence  of   an  exceptional   kind  of  relationship   and  an\n\nexceptional  risk  of harm  to a  child  if that  relationship is\n\n                               -4-\n\nbroken.\"   Tr.  at 22-23.    The court  further credited  the two\n\nreports from the psychologist as constituting \n\n     a  very compelling  set  of evidence  about a  personal\n     relationship that  I don't think there's  any reason to\n     believe arose  with  any purpose  of escaping  criminal\n     responsibility but has  occurred independently of that,\n     and it is, I think, a circumstance beyond in degree and\n     nature  those  that  were  taken into  account  in  the\n     guidelines.\n\nId.  at  22.   It accordingly  sentenced  Sclamo to  three years'\n   \n\nprobation,  with confinement at  home for six  months, subject to\n\npermission from  the Chief  Probation Officer  to leave  home for\n\nwork, shopping, and medical attention.\n\n     On appeal, the government contends that family relationships\n\nare  not a  basis  for departure.    It notes  that  imprisonment\n\nnecessarily disrupts such  relationships and that  the sentencing\n\nguidelines provide that \"[f]amily ties and responsibilities . . .\n\nare not ordinarily relevant\"  in determining whether departure is\n\nappropriate.  See  USSG   5H1.6.  The government  further cites a\n                 \n\nnumber of cases in which this court has refused to allow downward\n\ndepartures  based on  family  circumstances.   See, e.g.,  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Carr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560457\"><a href=\"/opinion/560457/united-states-v-terry-c-carr-and-mark-todd-carr/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72 (1st Cir. 1991).\n              \n\n     The  government  also alleges  that,  even  if departure  is\n\npermitted  based  on  family  ties,  Sclamo's  situation  is  not\n\nsufficiently  compelling to  warrant  leniency.   The  government\n\npoints  out that Sclamo is not James's biological father and that\n\ntheir relationship  has not been longstanding.   Additionally, it\n\nurges that defendant's involvement in distributing cocaine in the\n\n                               -5-\n\nfall  of 1989  justified the recommended  sentence of  28 months'\n\nincarceration.\n\n     The  resolution of  this  appeal is  governed by  our recent\n\npronouncements  in  United States  v.  Rivera.   As  Rivera makes\n                                                           \n\nclear, the Guidelines say only  that family circumstances do  not\n\nordinarily  warrant departure.    See  slip  op.  at  12  (citing\n                                     \n\nU.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt.  H).  Thus, while discouraging  departures on\n\nthis ground,  the Guidelines recognize that  \"special, unusual or\n\nother-than-ordinary circumstances,\" id. at  16, may be considered\n                                       \n\nas a basis for departure.  Indeed, our earlier cases  do not hold\n\nthat  district courts lack authority to depart on this ground but\n\nmerely illustrate circumstances not sufficiently extraordinary to\n\nwarrant  departure.

Rushby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563223\"><a href=\"/opinion/563223/united-states-v-john-rushby/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n                                                       \n\n<span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n     We briefly recapitulate the  approach Rivera suggests when a\n                                                 \n\ndeparture from the Guidelines  is requested.  The  district court\n\nfirst  should ask: \"What features of this case, potentially, take\n\nit  outside the Guidelines' `heartland' and make of it a special,\n\nor unusual,  case?\"  Rivera, slip op. at 15.  In cases like this,\n                           \n\nwhere the special features are  discouraged, the court should \"go\n\non  to decide  whether  the case  is nonetheless  not `ordinary,'\n\ni.e.,  whether the case differs  from the ordinary  case in which\n    \n\nthose features are present.\"   Id.  If the case is  not ordinary,\n                                  \n\nthe court then may consider departure, deriving whatever guidance\n\nit  can  from  the  Guidelines, but,  ultimately,  \"drawing  upon\n\nexperience  and  informed judgment,\"  id. at  17.   If  the court\n                                         \n\n                               -6-\n\ndecides to depart,  \"it must  explain how the  case (compared  to\n\nother cases where the reason  is present) is special. . .  .\" Id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 21 (emphasis omitted).\n\n     As  for  our role  in  reviewing  such departure  decisions,\n\nRivera  modified  our prescriptions  in  United  States v.  Diaz-\n                                                                 \n\nVillafane,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st  Cir. 1989).

Following Rivera, however,  we\n                                                   \n\nnow \"review  the  district court's  determination of  unusualness\n\nwith full  awareness of, and  respect for,  the trier's  superior\n\nfeel  for the case, . . .  not with the understanding that review\n\nis plenary.\"  Rivera, slip op. at  23-24 (quoting Diaz-Villafane,\n                                                                \n\n874 F.2d at 50) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     With  this background  and without  repeating the  essential\n\nfacts in the two reports credited by the district court, we see a\n\nnumber of special factors  that transform Sclamo's situation into\n\nan extraordinary one meriting the downward departure.  See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited  States v.

James's\n\nreferral for individual psychotherapy, made by a case worker with\n\nno  connection to  defendant,  predated the  circumstances giving\n\nrise to  this case.   Moreover,  the  psychologist's reports  are\n\nbased on a long history of personal observation, interaction, and\n\ntreatment  not only  of  James but  of defendant  as  well.   The\n\ndistrict   court,  therefore,   was   entitled   to  credit   the\n\npsychologist's professional judgment  of the critical and  unique\n\nrole played by defendant in James's treatment. \n\n     Turning  to the family ties at issue, we think that Sclamo's\n\nsituation is readily distinguished from ordinary cases, where one\n\ncan  only speculate about  the stresses  that incarceration  of a\n\nfamily member might cause.   In this case, there  is evidence not\n\nonly that James  already suffers  from a  clinical disorder,  but\n\nthat his condition will deteriorate if defendant is incarcerated.\n\nSclamo has a  track record  of steady and  effective support  and\n\nguidance of James over  a lengthy period during which  Sclamo was\n\nboth   instructed  and   monitored  by   a  psychologist.     The\n\npsychologist's  prognosis that  James would  risk  regression and\n\nharm if  defendant were incarcerated amply  supports the district\n\ncourt's  determination that  Sclamo's  relationship  to James  is\n\nsufficiently extraordinary to sustain a downward departure.  \n\n     We therefore  think that, under our  present more restricted\n\nstandard  of review, the decision made by the district court must\n\n                               -8-\n\nbe  affirmed.    We acknowledge  that  our  own  analysis of  the\n\ncircumstances setting this  case apart from the  ordinary case is\n\nmore  lengthy and detailed  than that of the  district court.  In\n\nfuture cases we would expect, in line with our general discussion\n\nin Rivera, a very deliberate discussion of the factors making the\n         \n\ncase unusual.  But we see no purpose served in this case, decided\n\nbelow without the benefit of our recent guidance, in remanding to\n\nmake explicit what was implicit.\n\n     Affirmed.  \n             \n\n                               -9-\n</pre>",
