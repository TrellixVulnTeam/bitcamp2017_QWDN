Timothy  K. Alabi pled  guilty to two\n                     \n\ncounts of  distributing heroin  in violation  of 18  U.S.C.  \n\n841(a)(1), and was sentenced to  serve 24 months in prison, a\n\nsentence which was at the low end of the applicable guideline\n\nrange.  At sentencing, Alabi argued for a  downward departure\n\nfrom  that guideline range, but  the court declined to depart\n\ndownward.   Alabi  has  appealed,  claiming  that  the  court\n\nbelieved that it had no  legal authority to depart in Alabi's\n\ncase and  that departure was  justified.  Since we  find that\n\nthe court was aware that it had authority to depart downward,\n\nbut did not do so because it did not think that departure was\n\njustified  under the circumstances, we dismiss the appeal for\n\nlack of jurisdiction.  See  United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n20, 22 (1st Cir. 1991)  (a district court's refusal to depart\n\nis  not appealable unless based  on the court's mistaken view\n\nthat it lacked the legal authority to consider a departure). \n\n          At sentencing,  Alabi  claimed that  he deserved  a\n\ndownward departure for  various reasons:   he had worked  his\n\nwhole  life to  support his  wife and  four children;  he had\n\nattended school and  received a college degree  while working\n\nin order to  improve his ability to support his family; if he\n\nwere incarcerated, his  wife's income would not  be enough to\n\npay  the family's  expenses;  he  had  no  previous  criminal\n\nrecord;  and  he had  agreed  to  distribute  heroin  on  two\n\noccasions only at  the insistence of a friend  who needed his\n\nhelp.   The government argued against any downward departure,\n\nstating that  Alabi's case was  \"utterly . . .  ordinary\" and\n\nwithin the \"heartland\" of guideline cases.  See United States\n                                                             \n\nv.  Rivera, 994  F.2d 942,  947  (1st Cir.  1993) (under  the\n          \n\nSentencing  Guidelines, \"unusual\" cases that fall outside the\n\n\"heartland\"  are  candidates for  departure;  the \"heartland\"\n\nconsists of typical  cases that embody the  conduct described\n\nin the guidelines).   \n\n          Our review of the sentencing  transcript shows that\n\nthe court believed  that it had authority to  depart downward\n\nin  unusual  cases  falling  outside  the  heartland  of  the\n\nsentencing guidelines,  but that  the court  did not  believe\n\nthat Alabi's case was an unusual one.  In doing so, the court\n\nevaluated  the  degree  to  which  factors  such  as  Alabi's\n\neducation,   employment   record,   and   family   ties   and\n\nresponsibilities deviated from the ordinary, and its analysis\n\ntracked the  discussion and analysis  in Rivera, supra.   See\n                                                             \n\nid. at 948 (factors such as education, employment record, and\n   \n\nfamily ties and  responsibilities can remove a case  from the\n\nheartland  and justify downward  departure, but only  if they\n\nare present \"in  a manner that is unusual  or special, rather\n\nthan 'ordinary.'\").  \n\n          Against this backdrop, it is clear that the court's\n\ncomment regarding \"forbidden\"  grounds for departure  applied\n\nonly  to  the  \"personal  financial  difficulties\"  in  which\n\n                             -3-\n\nAlabi's  family would find itself if Alabi were incarcerated.\n\nThe court was correct in concluding that that factor would be\n\na  forbidden ground  for departure.   See U.S.S.G.    5K2.12,\n                                         \n\np.s.  (1992) (\"The  Commission  considered the  relevance  of\n\neconomic hardship  and  determined  that  personal  financial\n\ndifficulties . . . do  not warrant a decrease in sentence.\");\n\nRivera, 994  F.2d at 949 (the sentencing court is not free to\n      \n\nconsider departing  on the basis of forbidden factors such as\n\npersonal  financial difficulties even if the factor makes the\n\ncase \"unusual\").  Likewise, in context, the court's complaint\n\nabout its lack of discretion appears to have been directed to\n\nsentencing  under  the  guidelines in  general,  and  did not\n\nreflect the court's belief that  it could not depart downward\n\non the basis of factors such as education, employment record,\n\nand family ties and responsibilities. \n\n          Appeal dismissed.\n                          \n\n                             -4-\n",
