Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n               Cyr and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Philip P. Mancini, with whom Paul M. Koziell and Drummond &\nDrummond, LLP were on brief, for appellant.\n     Louis B. Butterfield, with whom Olafsen & Butterfield was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         January 17, 2003\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.              This case requires us to\n\ndecide whether a party to an arbitration agreement that is subject\n\nto conditions precedent can, without satisfying those conditions,\n\ncompel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act. (\"FAA\"). HIM\n\nPortland    (\"HIM\")     moved    the     district    court,     pursuant      to    an\n\narbitration agreement, to compel DeVito Builders (\"DeVito\") to\n\narbitrate a contract dispute between them.                  DeVito contends that\n\ntheir agreement       provided    that    a     request   for   mediation     was    a\n\ncondition    precedent      to    arbitration.            Because     the    parties\n\nintentionally conditioned arbitration upon either party's request\n\nfor mediation, we conclude that HIM Portland's failure to request\n\nmediation precludes it from compelling arbitration under the FAA.\n\nTherefore we affirm the district court's Order denying HIM's motion\n\nto compel arbitration and stay matters pending the completion of\n\narbitration.\n\n                                 I.    Background\n\n            HIM contracted with DeVito for the renovation of a Suisse\n\nChalet motel in Portland, Maine.                On April 3, 2002, HIM filed a\n\ncomplaint against DeVito in the District Court for the District of\n\nMaine seeking      to   recover       damages    under    claims    for    breach   of\n\ncontract, slander of title and fraudulent misrepresentation. After\n\nDeVito filed its answer to HIM's complaint, HIM moved to compel\n\narbitration and stay the proceedings in the district court until\n\nthe   completion      of   arbitration,         asserting    that    the    contract\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcontained an arbitration clause that required the parties to\n\narbitrate the dispute.   The contract provides, in pertinent part:\n\n\n\n                 9.10.1 Claims, disputes and other\n          matters in question arising out of or relating\n          to this Contract, including those alleging an\n          error or omission by the Architect but\n          excluding those arising under Paragraph 15.2\n          [Hazardous Materials], shall be referred\n          initially to the Architect for decision. Such\n          matters, except those relating to aesthetic\n          effect and except those waived as provided for\n          in Paragraph 9.11 [Consequential Damages] and\n          Subparagraphs 14.5.3 and 14.5.4 [making or\n          acceptance   of   final   payment   constitutes\n          waiver], shall, after initial decision by the\n          Architect, or 30 days after submission of the\n          matter to the Architect, be subject to\n          mediation   as   a   condition   precedent   to\n          arbitration or the institution of legal or\n          equitable proceedings by either party.\n\n                 9.10.3 The parties shall endeavor to\n          resolve their disputes by mediation which,\n          unless the parties mutually agree otherwise,\n          shall be in accordance with the Construction\n          Industry Mediation Rules of the American\n          Arbitration Association currently in effect .\n          . . . The request may be made concurrently\n          with the filing of a demand for arbitration,\n          but, in such event, mediation shall proceed in\n          advance of arbitration or legal or equitable\n          proceedings, which shall be stayed pending\n          mediation for a period of 60 days from the\n          date of filing, unless stayed for a longer\n          period by agreement of the parties or court\n          order.\n\n                 9.10.4    Claims, disputes and other\n          matters in question arising out of or relating\n          to the Contract that are not resolved by\n          mediation,   except   matters    relating   to\n          aesthetic effect and except those waived as\n          provided   for    in   Paragraph    9.11   and\n          Subparagraphs 14.5.3 and 14.5.4, shall be\n\n                                -3-\n\f          decided by arbitration which, unless the\n          parties mutually agree otherwise, shall be in\n          accordance with the Construction Industry\n          Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration\n          Association currently in effect . . . . The\n          award   rendered   by   the   arbitrator    or\n          arbitrators shall be final, and judgment may\n          be entered upon it in accordance with\n          applicable   law   in    any   court    having\n          jurisdiction thereof. (Emphasis added).\n\n          On July 26, 2002, the district court issued a Memorandum\n\nand Order denying HIM's motion to compel arbitration and to stay\n\nproceedings   until   the   completion   of   arbitration.     The   court\n\nreasoned that the plain language of the contract manifested the\n\nparties' clear intent to require mediation as a condition precedent\n\nto arbitration. Accordingly, the court found that HIM's failure to\n\nrequest   mediation    precluded    enforcement    of   the    contract's\n\narbitration clause.    This timely appeal followed.\n\n                            II.    Discussion\n\n          Congress enacted the FAA in 1925 to place arbitration\n\nagreements \"upon the same footing as other contracts\" and to render\n\nthem \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds\n\nas exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\"\n\nEEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 288-89 (2002).               To\n\nfacilitate arbitration agreements, the FAA provides that when a\n\nfederal court reviews an issue that is subject to an arbitration\n\nagreement the court shall, on the motion of one of the parties,\n\nstay its proceedings until \"arbitration has been had in accordance\n\nwith the terms of the agreement.\"        9 U.S.C.A. ยง 3.      The Supreme\n\n                                   -4-\n\fCourt has held that \"questions of arbitrability must be addressed\n\nwith   a    healthy     regard    for     the       federal   policy   favoring\n\narbitrations.\"     Moses H. Cone Mem'l. Hosp. v. Mercury Constr.\n\nCorp., 460 U.S. 1, 24 (1983).\n\n            Nevertheless, arbitration is a matter of contract law and\n\nconsequently \"a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration\n\nany dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\"                AT&T Techs.,\n\nInc. v. Communications Workers of America., 475 U.S. 643, 648\n\n(1986).    The Court specified that \"the FAA's proarbitration policy\n\ndoes not operate without regard to the wishes of the contracting\n\nparties.\"    Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 514 U.S. 52, 57\n\n(1995).     Indeed, were a court to employ the FAA to frustrate the\n\nclear intentions of parties that had contracted to arbitrate under\n\nprivately negotiated rules and procedures, the \"result would be\n\nquite inimical to the FAA's primary purpose of ensuring that\n\nprivate agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their\n\nterms.\"    Id.\n\n            When      presented    with         a    question    of    contract\n\ninterpretation, our \"task is to ascertain the intentions of the\n\nparties, consistent with state law principles and with due regard\n\nfor the federal policy favoring arbitration.\"                   De Mercurio v.\n\nSphere Drake Ins. PLC, 202 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 2000).                    The\n\ndistrict court's legal conclusion -- that the duty to arbitrate was\n\nconditioned by the plain language of the agreement -- is subject to\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fde novo review.    Campos-Orrego v. Rivera, 175 F.3d 89, 96 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n           The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court\n\nerred in denying HIM's motion to compel arbitration and to stay\n\nproceedings until the completion of arbitration.           HIM claims that\n\nbecause the contract requires arbitration but not mediation, the\n\ncourt should have compelled arbitration in order to resolve the\n\nparties' contractual dispute in favor of the \"liberal federal\n\npolicy favoring arbitration provisions.\" Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at\n\n24.\n\n           To reach this conclusion, HIM selectively concentrates on\n\nlanguage in the contract that, taken out of context, might \"merely\n\nmake[] mediation a suggested, [but] not a required precursor to\n\narbitration.\"     For instance, the contract states that the parties\n\n\"shall endeavor\" to resolve their disputes by mediation.             Whether\n\nor not this language is, as HIM contends, merely \"precatory\" and\n\nwas inserted merely to urge the parties to make an \"earnest\n\nattempt\"   to   resolve     their   differences    through   mediation    is\n\nirrelevant; other provisions of the contract state in the plainest\n\npossible language that mediation is a condition precedent to\n\narbitration.      Section    9.10.1    bears   repeating   because   of   its\n\nremarkable clarity: \"Claims, disputes and other matters in question\n\narising out of or relating to this Contract . . . shall . . . be\n\nsubject to mediation as a condition precedent to arbitration or the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\finstitution of legal or equitable proceedings by either party.\" It\n\nis difficult to imagine language which more plainly states that the\n\nparties intended to establish mediation as a condition precedent to\n\narbitration proceedings.1\n\n            Under the plain language of the contract, the arbitration\n\nprovision of the agreement is not triggered until one of the\n\nparties requests mediation.        See Kemiron Atl., Inc. v. Aguakem\n\nInt'l Inc., 290 F.3d 1287, 1291 (11th Cir. 2002).        In Kemiron, the\n\nEleventh Circuit faced a similar issue and held: \"the parties\n\nagreed to conditions precedent before arbitration can take place\n\nand, by placing those conditions in the contract, the parties\n\nclearly intended to make arbitration a dispute resolution mechanism\n\nof last resort.\"    Id. at 1291.    Further, \"[b]ecause neither party\n\nrequested   mediation,   the   arbitration   provision    has   not   been\n\nactivated and the FAA does not apply.\" Id.      Congress did not enact\n\nthe FAA to \"operate without regard to the wishes of the contracting\n\nparties\" Mastrobuono, 514 U.S. at 57.        Where contracting parties\n\ncondition an arbitration agreement upon the satisfaction of some\n\ncondition precedent, the failure to satisfy the specified condition\n\nwill preclude the parties from compelling arbitration and staying\n\n\n1\n    The district court noted that Section 9.10.1 appears to\ncontemplate mediation as a condition precedent to both arbitration\nand litigation. As the parties have only asked us to determine\nwhether this Section establishes mediation as a condition precedent\nto arbitration, we do not reach the broader, more difficult\nquestion of whether the Section also establishes a valid condition\nprecedent to the bringing of suit.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fproceedings under the FAA.     Because neither HIM nor DeVito ever\n\nattempted to mediate this dispute, neither party can be compelled\n\nto submit to arbitration.\n\n                        III.    Conclusion\n\n          Here, there is no doubt that the parties intended that\n\nthe duty to arbitrate would not ripen until after the condition\n\nprecedent of mediation had been satisfied.    The district court's\n\njudgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

(\"FAA\"). HIM Portland (\"HIM\") moved the district court, pursuant to an arbitration agreement, to compel DeVito Builders (\"DeVito\") to arbitrate a contract dispute between them. DeVito contends that their agreement provided that a request for mediation was a condition precedent to arbitration. Because the parties intentionally conditioned arbitration upon either party's request for mediation, we conclude that HIM Portland's failure to request mediation precludes it from compelling arbitration under the FAA. Therefore we affirm the district court's Order denying HIM's motion to compel arbitration and stay matters pending the completion of arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HIM contracted with DeVito for the renovation of a Suisse Chalet motel in Portland, Maine. On April 3, 2002, HIM filed a complaint against DeVito in the District Court for the District of Maine seeking to recover damages under claims for breach of contract, slander of title and fraudulent misrepresentation. After DeVito filed its answer to HIM's complaint, HIM moved to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings in the district court until the completion of arbitration, asserting that the contract contained an arbitration clause that required the parties to arbitrate the dispute. The contract provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9.10.1 <i>Claims, disputes and other matters in question arising out of or relating to this Contract,</i> including those alleging an error or omission by the Architect but excluding those arising under Paragraph 15.2 [Hazardous Materials], shall be referred initially to the Architect for decision. Such matters, except those relating to aesthetic effect and except those waived as provided for in Paragraph 9.11 [Consequential Damages] and Subparagraphs 14.5.3 and 14.5.4 [making or acceptance of final payment constitutes waiver], <i>shall,</i> after initial decision by the Architect, or 30 days after submission of the matter to the Architect, <i>be subject to mediation as a condition precedent to arbitration or the institution of legal or equitable proceedings by either party.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9.10.3 <i>The parties shall endeavor to resolve their disputes by mediation</i> which, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, shall be in accordance with the Construction Industry Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association currently in effect.... <i>The request may be made concurrently with the filing of a demand for arbitration, but, in such event, mediation shall proceed in advance of arbitration or legal or equitable proceedings,</i> which shall be stayed pending mediation for a period of 60 days from the date of filing, unless stayed for a longer period by agreement of the parties or court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9.10.4 <i>Claims, disputes and other matters in question arising out of or relating to the Contract that are not resolved by mediation,</i> except matters relating to aesthetic effect and except those waived as provided for in Paragraph 9.11 and Subparagraphs 14.5.3 and 14.5.4, <i>shall be decided by arbitration</i> which, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, shall be in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association currently in effect....

The court reasoned that the plain language of the contract manifested the parties' clear intent to require mediation as a condition precedent to arbitration. Accordingly, the court found that HIM's failure to request mediation precluded enforcement of the contract's arbitration clause. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the FAA in 1925 to place arbitration agreements \"upon the same footing as other contracts\" and to render them \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\" <i>EEOC v.

To facilitate arbitration agreements, the FAA provides that when a federal court reviews an issue that is subject to an arbitration agreement the court shall, on the motion of one of the parties, stay its proceedings until \"arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\" 9 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3.

The district court's legal conclusion &#8212; that the duty to arbitrate was conditioned by the plain language of the agreement &#8212; is subject to de novo review. <i>Campos-Orrego v.

HIM claims that because the contract requires arbitration but not mediation, the court should have compelled arbitration in order to resolve the parties' contractual dispute in favor of the \"liberal federal policy favoring arbitration provisions.\" <i>Moses H. Cone,</i> 460 U.S. at 24, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110873\"><a href=\"/opinion/110873/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-v-mercury-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Whether or not this language is, as HIM contends, merely \"precatory\" and was inserted merely to urge the parties to make an \"earnest attempt\" to resolve their differences through mediation is irrelevant; other provisions of the contract state in the plainest possible language that mediation is a condition precedent to arbitration. Section 9.10.1 bears repeating because of its remarkable clarity: \"Claims, disputes and other matters in question arising out of or relating to this Contract ... shall ... be subject to mediation as a condition precedent to arbitration or the institution of legal or equitable proceedings by either party.\" It is difficult to imagine language which more plainly states that the parties intended to establish mediation as a condition precedent to arbitration proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the plain language of the contract, the arbitration provision of the agreement is not triggered until one of the parties requests mediation. <i>See Kemiron Atl., Inc. v.

Where contracting parties condition an arbitration agreement upon the satisfaction of some condition precedent, the failure to satisfy the specified condition will preclude the parties from compelling arbitration and staying proceedings under the FAA.
