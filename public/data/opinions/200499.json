Schmitz appeals the\n\ndistrict court's award of summary judgment to defendant Intel\n\nCorporation on his state law claim of unlawful age discrimination.\n\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B.            Schmitz contends that the court\n\nerred   in    concluding   that    his    claim   was   both   untimely    and\n\ninadequately supported to withstand summary judgment.             We bypass\n\nthe court's statute of limitations ruling and proceed directly to\n\nthe merits, summarizing the facts relevant to our decisional basis\n\nin accordance with the dictates of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\n\n             In May 1998, Intel acquired from Digital Semiconductor a\n\ncomputer chip manufacturing facility known as \"Fab 17\" located in\n\nHudson,      Massachusetts.       Following       the   transaction,      Intel\n\ntransferred Schmitz (who had been with Digital since 1990 and had\n\nbeen performing equipment maintenance in a Digital laboratory) to\n\na position as a manufacturing technician in Fab 17's manufacturing\n\ndepartment.     On June 23, 1998, Schmitz turned 48 years old.\n\n             The manufacturing department, one of several departments\n\nwithin Fab 17, was responsible for manufacturing computer chips and\n\nmaintaining Fab 17's equipment. Intel assigned four shifts to work\n\nwithin the manufacturing department and organized the employees on\n\neach shift into eight functional areas.           Intel further divided the\n\nemployees within each functional area into \"module teams.\"                Intel\n\nassigned Schmitz, who worked \"Shift 7,\" to the \"Front End\" module\n\nteam within the manufacturing department's \"Etch\" functional area.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            During the summer of 1998, Fab 17 was operating at only\n\n25 percent of its manufacturing capacity.                In order to keep its\n\npricing competitive, Intel decided to lay off approximately 450\n\nemployees, including approximately 110 of its 320 manufacturing\n\ntechnicians.    Intel's senior management established a hierarchy of\n\ncriteria that would be used in selecting which manufacturing\n\ntechnicians would be retained.            The management team charged with\n\nimplementing       the   layoffs   (the   \"Selection      Committee\")     was   to\n\nprioritize the retention of workers with skills critical to keeping\n\nthe manufacturing department fully operational despite a reduced\n\nworkforce.     In determining which workers possessed these critical\n\nskills, the Selection Committee was to look at the number and\n\nquality (there were three skill levels) of operational proficiency\n\n\"certifications\"         that   each   employee    had   earned.       Next,    the\n\nCommittee    was    to    prefer   employees      with   high   job   performance\n\nratings.     Finally, as a tie-breaker, the Committee was to prefer\n\nemployees with seniority.\n\n             As it happened, the Selection Committee deemed the first\n\ncriterion a sufficient predicate upon which to base its decisions\n\nand never consulted information other than that relevant to this\n\ncriterion.     Thus, in making its selections, the Committee had no\n\ninformation about the job performance ratings, length of service,\n\nor ages of the manufacturing department employees subject to\n\nlayoff.    Nonetheless, at a September 21, 1998, meeting convened to\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fnotify   employees   about    the   impending   workforce   reduction,   a\n\nmanagement    representative    suggested   that   job   performance   and\n\nseniority had played a role in the layoff decisions.\n\n           In building Fab 17's new manufacturing department, the\n\nSelection Committee first attempted to identify the minimum number\n\nof employees within each module team necessary to perform all of\n\nthe team's work, and then added employees from different module\n\nteams (but from within the same functional area) if necessary to\n\nfill any skills gaps.        The Committee did not move manufacturing\n\ntechnicians between or among shifts and functional units; instead,\n\nit treated each functional area within each shift as a distinct\n\nunit for decisional purposes.\n\n             The Selection Committee retained only eleven of the\n\ntwenty-seven manufacturing technicians who had previously been\n\nworking in the Shift 7 Etch functional area.       The persons chosen to\n\nstaff the new Shift 7 Etch had earned the most, and the highest\n\nlevels of, certifications as of the last week in August 1998 -- the\n\ncut-off date used by the Committee. In the Committee's estimation,\n\nthese employees would be able to run Shift 7 Etch by themselves.\n\nThe Committee also transferred into Shift 7 Etch a thirty-eight\n\nyear old engineering technician (who had been laid off pursuant to\n\na distinct and unrelated selection process) named David O'Connor.\n\nIntel regarded engineering technicians as having much higher skill\n\nsets than manufacturing technicians, and the Committee decided that\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fO'Connor's skills would complement those of the eleven remaining\n\nShift 7 Etch manufacturing technicians.\n\n              Schmitz was the only manufacturing technician who had\n\nzero current certifications (Intel only considered a certification\n\n\"current\" if the employee had performed the process for which he or\n\nshe was certified within Fab 17 in the previous year) at the time\n\nthe Committee made its selections.               Consequently, the Committee\n\ndecided    to    lay   Schmitz   off.         Schmitz   was    notified     of     the\n\nCommittee's decision in a letter dated September 22, 1998.                          In\n\nDecember 1998, Schmitz received a final performance review in which\n\nIntel mistakenly identified him as an employee with more technical\n\nand leadership responsibilities than his personnel grade would\n\nwarrant.      As a result, the review unfairly cited Schmitz's lack of\n\nleadership skills and technical proficiency as causes for concern.\n\nOn January 16, 1999, Intel terminated Schmitz's employment.\n\n              Because Schmitz believed that Intel carried out its\n\nworkforce reduction with an eye towards purging Fab 17 of some of\n\nits   older     workers   (including    himself),       he   filed   a    charge    of\n\ndiscrimination         with   the   Massachusetts            Commission     Against\n\nDiscrimination and subsequently sued Intel under Massachusetts'\n\nanti-discrimination statute -- Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B -- in state\n\nsuperior court.        Intel removed the case to the district court on\n\nthe basis of diversity jurisdiction and in due course moved for\n\nsummary judgment.         The court granted the motion on a number of\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fgrounds, only one of which is relevant to our analysis.         The court\n\ndetermined that, to the extent that Schmitz had adequately pleaded\n\na disparate treatment claim at all, the claim foundered on the\n\ncomplete absence of evidence of discriminatory animus towards him.\n\nSchmitz contests this determination, arguing that a factfinder\n\nreasonably could conclude from the record that Intel had not\n\ntruthfully explained the reason for his termination and that\n\n(contrary   to   the   court's   \"animus   is   necessary\"   ruling)   such\n\nevidence is all that is needed to forestall summary judgment under\n\nMassachusetts law.      We reject on factual grounds the premise of\n\nSchmitz's argument and thus do not address Schmitz's assertion of\n\nlegal error.\n\n            Schmitz asserts that, alone or in combination, four\n\npieces of evidence in the summary judgment record permit a finding\n\nthat Intel was being less than fully truthful in explaining that\n\nSchmitz had been discharged because of a lack of certifications.\n\nSchmitz first contends that evidence of certifications Schmitz had\n\nearned with Digital between 1995 and 1997 and with Intel in\n\nSeptember 1998 calls into question whether the Selection Committee\n\ngenuinely believed that he had zero certifications.           But Schmitz\n\nhas no answer to Intel's supported rejoinder that Schmitz's Digital\n\ncertifications were not current and that his Intel certifications\n\nwere earned after layoff decisions already had been made.\n\n     So too with the second and third portions of the record cited\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fby   Schmitz:       that    Intel    \"replaced\"      Schmitz   with   the   younger\n\nO'Connor and misstated (at the September 21, 1998 meeting) the\n\ncriteria that actually guided the layoff decisions. Schmitz has no\n\nresponse to Intel's evidence that O'Connor was retained instead of\n\nSchmitz because he possessed skills that Schmitz lacked, and that\n\nthe management representative who presented at the September 21\n\nmeeting    simply    erred     in    referencing     the   originally   developed\n\ncriteria instead of the ground on which decisions actually were\n\nmade.      Finally,        Schmitz    has   not    explained    how   the    fourth\n\nevidentiary     item   to     which    he   points    --   evidence   that    Intel\n\nmistakenly assumed he was in a higher personnel grade during his\n\nDecember 1998 performance review -- casts doubt on the veracity of\n\nthe reason given for a termination decision that was made months\n\nearlier.    And we are unable to make the connection on our own.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f",
