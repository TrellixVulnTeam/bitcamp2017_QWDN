Background\n\n           In June 2003, the New Hampshire legislature passed \"AN\n\nACT   requiring    parental    notification   before    abortions    may    be\n\nperformed on unemancipated minors,\" which states that:\n\n           No abortion shall be performed upon an\n           unemancipated minor or upon a female for whom\n           a guardian or conservator has been appointed\n           pursuant to RSA 464-A because of a finding of\n           incompetency, until at least 48 hours after\n           written notice of the pending abortion has\n           been delivered in the manner specified in\n           paragraphs II and III.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fRSA 132:25, I.1    Paragraph II specifies that \"written notice shall\n\nbe addressed to the parent at the usual place of abode of the\n\nparent and delivered personally to the parent by the physician or\n\nan agent.\"    RSA 132:25, II.   Paragraph III allows for notification\n\nby certified mail with return receipt requested and with restricted\n\ndelivery to the addressee.      RSA 132:25, III.\n\n             The notice requirement is waived if\n\n             (a) The attending abortion provider certifies\n             in the pregnant minor's medical record that\n             the abortion is necessary to prevent the\n             minor's death and there is insufficient time\n             to provide required notice; or\n             (b) The person or persons who are entitled to\n             notice certify in writing that they have been\n             notified.\n\nRSA 132:26, I.\n\n             If a minor does not want her parent or guardian notified,\n\nshe may request a state judge, after a hearing, to \"authorize an\n\nabortion provider to perform the abortion if said judge determines\n\nthat the pregnant minor is mature and capable of giving informed\n\n\n\n1\n    The Act defines an abortion as:\n\n             the use or prescription of any instrument,\n             medicine, drug, or any other substance or\n             device   intentionally   to   terminate   the\n             pregnancy of a female known to be pregnant\n             with an intention other than to increase the\n             probability of a live birth, to preserve the\n             life or health of the child after live birth,\n             or to remove an ectopic pregnancy or the\n             products from a spontaneous miscarriage.\n\nRSA 132:24, I.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fconsent to the proposed abortion,\" or if the judge determines that\n\n\"the performance of an abortion upon her without notification of\n\nher    parent,   guardian,      or    conservator       would    be     in    her   best\n\ninterests.\"      RSA 132:26, II.

The Act was to take effect on December 31, 2003.             2003\n\nN.H. Laws 173.\n\n            On    November       17,   2003,   plaintiffs-appellees     Planned\n\nParenthood of Northern New England, Concord Feminist Health Center\n\nof Portsmouth, Feminist Health Center of Portsmouth, and Wayne\n\nGoldner, M.D. (\"plaintiffs\") filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C.\n\nยง   1983,   seeking     a    declaratory       judgment   that    the   Act     is\n\nunconstitutional      and    a    preliminary   injunction   to   prevent      its\n\nenforcement once it became effective.2            The district court merged\n\n\n2\n   Citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992),\namici New Hampshire Legislators argue that appellee abortion\nproviders lack standing to challenge the Act because the injury\ngiving rise to standing is speculative. The injury in question,\naccording to amici, is the one suffered by pregnant minors who\nrequire an abortion for health reasons. Amici argue that it is\n\"not sufficient to merely show that some unknown medical conditions\nexist that may at some unknown future date be suffered by some\nunknown minors.\" Brief of Amici New Hampshire Legislators at 8.\nIn fact, Dr. Wayne Goldner listed in his unopposed declaration five\nspecific conditions that could require abortion to protect a\nminor's health: preeclampsia, eclampsia, premature rupture of the\nmembranes surrounding the fetus, spontaneous chorioamnionitis, and\nheavy bleeding during pregnancy.     Declaration of Wayne Goldner,\n\n                                        -5-\n\fthe   preliminary   and   permanent   injunction   proceedings   and,   on\n\nDecember 29, 2003, issued an order holding the Act unconstitutional\n\nand permanently enjoining its enforcement.\n\n           The district court found unconstitutional both (1) the\n\nlack of an explicit exception to protect the health of the pregnant\n\nminor, and (2) the narrowness of the Act's exception for abortions\n\nnecessary to prevent the minor's death.            Having found the Act\n\nfatally flawed in these respects, the district court declined to\n\nrule on the constitutionality of the Act's failure to provide\n\nspecific protections for the confidentiality of a minor seeking a\n\njudicial waiver.\n\n           The Attorney General, acting in his official capacity,\n\nappeals.\n\n\nM.D., ยถยถ 8-15. Moreover, appellee abortion providers themselves\nface an imminent injury -- civil or criminal prosecution for\nperforming an abortion in violation of the Act -- sufficient to\nconfer on them Article III standing. See Planned Parenthood of\nCent. Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 62 (1976) (holding that\nphysician abortion providers asserting their own rights and those\nof their patients had standing to challenge abortion regulation and\n\"should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution\nas the sole means of seeking relief\").      Because of their close\nrelationship to the abortion decision, and the rights involved,\nproviders routinely have jus tertii standing to assert the rights\nof women whose access to abortion is restricted. See Singleton v.\nWulff, 428 U.S. 106, 117 (1976) (\"[I]t generally is appropriate to\nallow a physician to assert the rights of women patients as against\ngovernmental interference with the abortion decisions . . . .\").\nIndeed, as the Ninth Circuit has noted, \"physicians and clinics\nperforming abortions are routinely recognized as having standing to\nbring broad facial challenges to abortion statutes.\"        Planned\nParenthood of Idaho, Inc. v. Wasden, 376 F.3d 908, 916-18 (9th Cir.\n2004) (discussing abortion providers' third-party standing and\nciting cases).\n\n                                  -6-\n\f                             II.       Analysis\n\n           We review the district court's decision regarding the\n\nconstitutionality of a statute de novo.            United States v. Lewko,\n\n269 F.3d 64, 67 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           The Attorney General argues that in deciding whether the\n\nAct   is   facially   invalid    we     should    apply   the   \"no   set    of\n\ncircumstances\" standard set forth in United States v. Salerno, 481\n\nU.S. 739 (1987).3     This standard requires plaintiffs challenging a\n\nstate law as facially invalid to show that \"no set of circumstances\n\nexists under which the Act would be valid.\"               Id. at 745.       The\n\nAttorney General's argument rests on the premise that the Salerno\n\nstandard is applicable to the Act despite the agreement of a\n\nplurality of Justices in Planned Parenthood of S.E. Pa. v. Casey,\n\n505 U.S. 833, 876-77 (1992), that a law which \"has the purpose or\n\neffect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman\n\nseeking    an   abortion    of     a     nonviable    fetus\"     places      an\n\nunconstitutional \"undue burden\" on the exercise of her right to\n\nchoose abortion.       A majority of the Casey Court applied that\n\nstandard to determine that an abortion regulation is facially\n\ninvalid if \"in a large fraction of cases in which [the regulation]\n\n\n3\n   In Salerno, the Court considered a facial challenge to the Bail\nReform Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3142(e), which permits pretrial detention\non the ground of dangerousness. The Court held that the provision\nin question, which was accompanied by strict procedural safeguards,\ndid not constitute a facial violation of the Due Process or\nExcessive Bail clauses of the Constitution. Salerno, 481 U.S. at\n755.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fis relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's\n\nchoice to undergo an abortion,\" thus imposing an \"undue burden.\"\n\nId. at 895 (per Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, joined by\n\nJustices Stevens and Blackmun). The Court has since confirmed that\n\n\"'a law designed to further the State's interest in fetal life\n\nwhich imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision before fetal\n\nviability' is unconstitutional.\"               Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S.\n\n914, 921 (2000) (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 877); see also id. at\n\n945-46    (declaring     Nebraska      ban     on    so-called    \"partial      birth\n\nabortion\" unconstitutional under undue burden standard).\n\n              Despite the Supreme Court's clear application of the\n\nundue    burden    standard     in    Casey    and    Stenberg,    it    has    never\n\nexplicitly addressed the standard's tension with Salerno.                      In the\n\ninstant case, while recognizing that this court has yet to address\n\nthe issue, the district court followed the majority of circuits\n\nthat    apply     the   Casey   and    Stenberg       standard    to    legislation\n\nregulating abortion.       The Attorney General notes that the Supreme\n\nCourt applied the Salerno standard in the abortion context prior to\n\nCasey, see, e.g., Ohio v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health, 497 U.S.\n\n502, 514 (1990), and urges us to follow the Fifth Circuit's\n\ndecision in Barnes v. Moore, 970 F.2d 12, 14 n.2 (5th Cir. 1992),\n\nthat Casey does not displace Salerno's \"no set of circumstances\"\n\ntest    for   facial    challenges     to     abortion   regulation.      See    also\n\nCauseway Med. Suite v. Ieyoub, 109 F.3d 1096, 1102-03 (5th Cir.\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f1997) (declining to reverse Barnes).             The overwhelming majority of\n\ncircuits to address this issue, however, have disagreed with the\n\nFifth Circuit.4        See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Cent. N.J. v.\n\nFarmer, 220 F.3d 127, 142-43 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding undue burden\n\nstandard, instead of Salerno standard, applies in abortion context\n\nafter Casey); Planned Parenthood of S. Ariz. v. Lawall, 180 F.3d\n\n1022, 1025-26 (9th Cir. 1999) (noting inconsistency between Casey\n\nand Salerno, and following \"great weight of circuit authority\n\nholding that Casey has overruled Salerno in the context of facial\n\nchallenges to abortion statutes\"), amended on denial of reh'g, 193\n\nF.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 1999); Women's Med. Prof. Corp. v. Voinovich,\n\n130    F.3d    187,   193-96    (6th    Cir.    1997)    (holding     that   Casey\n\neffectively overruled Salerno), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1036 (1998);\n\nJane   L.     v.

Jane L., 520 U.S.\n\n\n4\n   Only the Fourth Circuit has been sympathetic to the Barnes\napproach, indicating that it might continue to apply Salerno. See\nManning v. Hunt, 119 F.3d 254, 268 n.4 (4th Cir. 1997) (\"not[ing]\nin passing\" that a court is bound to apply Salerno in abortion\ncontext unless the Supreme Court explicitly overrules it);\nGreenville Women's Clinic v. Bryant, 222 F.3d 157, 164-65 (4th\nCir. 2000) (noting that observation in Manning was not dicta and\nthat Salerno must be applied to show deference to legislatures).\nBut see, Greenville Women's Clinic v. Comm'r, S.C. Dept. of Health,\n317 F.3d 357, 359 (4th Cir. 2002) (on subsequent appeal,\ncharacterizing Bryant as holding, in part, that regulation in\nquestion \"did not place an undue burden on a woman's decision\nwhether to seek an abortion\") (emphasis added).\n\n                                        -9-\n\f1274 (1997); Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic v. Miller, 63\n\nF.3d 1452, 1456-58 (8th Cir. 1995) (opting to \"follow what the\n\nSupreme Court actually did -- rather than what it failed to say --\n\nand apply the undue-burden test.\"), cert. denied sub nom., Janklow\n\nv. Planned Parenthood, 517 U.S. 1174 (1996); cf. A Woman's Choice -\n\nE. Side Women's Clinic v.

We agree with these\n\nsix circuit courts that the undue burden standard -- proposed as a\n\nstandard \"of general application\" by the Casey plurality, Casey,\n\n505 U.S. at 876, and twice applied to abortion regulations by a\n\nmajority of the Court, id. at 895; Stenberg, 530 U.S. at 920 --\n\nsupersedes Salerno in the context of abortion regulation.\n\n          Complementing the general undue burden standard, the\n\nSupreme Court has also identified a specific and independent\n\nconstitutional requirement that an abortion regulation must contain\n\nan exception for the preservation of a pregnant woman's health.\n\nSee Stenberg, 530 U.S. at 929-30 (identifying \"two independent\n\nreasons\" for striking down a Nebraska regulation:            first, that it\n\nlacks a health exception, and second, that it imposes an undue\n\nburden on a woman's ability to choose abortion).           The origin of the\n\nhealth requirement can be traced to Roe, which held that \"the\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fState, in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life,\n\nmay . . . regulate . . . abortion [after fetal viability] except\n\nwhere     necessary,   in    appropriate    medical   judgment,       for    the\n\npreservation of the life or health of the mother.\"                Roe v. Wade,\n\n410 U.S. 113, 164-65 (1973)(emphasis added), reaff'd Casey, 505\n\nU.S. at 879 (plurality opinion).           Later, the majority in Casey\n\nobserved      that,    had   the    medical     emergency        exception    to\n\nPennsylvania's abortion restrictions -- among them a parental\n\nconsent requirement -- precluded \"immediate abortion despite some\n\nsignificant health risks,\" it would have been unconstitutional\n\nsince \"the essential holding of Roe forbids a State to interfere\n\nwith a woman's choice to undergo an abortion . . . if continuing\n\nher pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health.\" Casey, 505\n\nU.S. at 880.     Finally, in Stenberg, 530 U.S. at 930, the Supreme\n\nCourt clarified that \"the law requires a health exception in order\n\nto validate even a postviability abortion regulation, [and] it at\n\na   minimum     requires     the   same    in   respect     to    previability\n\nregulations,\" 530 U.S. at 930. Thus, a statute regulating abortion\n\nmust contain a health exception in order to survive constitutional\n\nchallenge.      Similarly, Roe requires that abortion regulations\n\ncontain an adequate death exception to permit abortion when it is\n\nnecessary to save the life of a pregnant woman.             Roe, 410 U.S. at\n\n164-65.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f            The instant case thus presents three questions:            whether\n\nNew Hampshire's Act contains an adequate health exception, whether\n\nit contains an adequate death exception, and whether it places an\n\nundue   burden   on     unemancipated   minors    who    wish   to   obtain   an\n\nabortion.   A state's decision to require parental notification for\n\nminors seeking an abortion is not constitutionally infirm per se.\n\nSee Lambert v. Wicklund, 520 U.S. 292 (1997) (upholding parental\n\nnotification statute against constitutional challenge to judicial\n\nbypass procedure).       The district court determined, however, that\n\nthe New Hampshire Act's lack of a health exception and overly\n\nnarrow death exception render it unconstitutional. Appellees argue\n\nthat the Act also creates an undue burden by failing to adequately\n\nensure the confidentiality of judicial bypass procedures.\n\n            A.   Health exception\n\n            The Attorney General and amici suggest that parental\n\nnotification     laws     are   shielded   from    the     health    exception\n\nrequirement reiterated in Stenberg on account of the interests they\n\naim to protect.5      Parental notification laws are enacted not only\n\n\n5\n    Amicus Bishop of Manchester argues that Stenberg should be\nlimited to cases in which a particular method of abortion is banned\noutright. This argument misreads the Court's discussion of the\nregulation at issue in that case. The majority did emphasize its\nprior caselaw \"invalidat[ing] statutes that in the process of\nregulating the methods of abortion, impose[] significant health\nrisks,\" 530 U.S. at 931 (emphasis in original), but this language\nwas meant to rebut Justice Thomas's dissent that a health exception\nwas only applicable \"where the pregnancy itself creates a threat to\nhealth.\" Id. (emphasis in original). To the contrary, the Court\nheld, \"a risk to a woman's health is the same whether it happens to\n\n                                    -12-\n\fin furtherance of the state's \"interest in the potentiality of\n\nhuman life,\" Roe, 410 U.S. at 164, but also in the interest of\n\nprotecting minors from undertaking the risks of abortion without\n\nthe advice and support of a parent.    In considering an abortion\n\nregulation based on interests other than the one identified in Roe,\n\nhowever, the Supreme Court has determined that it \"cannot see how\n\nthe interest-related differences could make any difference to the\n\n. . . application of the 'health' requirement.\" Stenberg, 530 U.S.\n\nat 931; see also Casey, 505 U.S. at 877 (\"[A] statute which, while\n\nfurthering the interest in potential life or some other valid state\n\ninterest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the\n\npath of a woman's choice cannot be considered a permissible means\n\nof serving its legitimate ends.\" (emphasis added)) (plurality\n\nopinion).   The Constitution requires a health exception even when\n\nthe State's interest in regulation is \"compelling.\"   See Roe, 410\n\nU.S. at 163; see also Stenberg, 530 U.S. at 931 (\"[A] State may\n\npromote but not endanger a woman's health when it regulates the\n\nmethods of abortion.\").   Thus, regardless of the interests served\n\nby New Hampshire's parental notice statute, it does not escape the\n\nConstitution's requirement of a health exception.\n\n\n\n\narise from regulating a particular method of abortion, or from\nbarring abortion entirely.\" Id. The risk is also the same when it\narises from a minor's inability or unwillingness to notify her\nparents. The need for a health exception arises from the potential\nfor risk to a woman's health, not from the source of that risk.\n\n                               -13-\n\f          The Attorney General and amici also argue that our\n\ndecision should be controlled by Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417\n\n(1990), in which the Supreme Court upheld a parental notification\n\nstatute that contained no health exception.   However, as noted by\n\nthe district court, the Hodgson Court did not consider a challenge\n\nto that statute's lack of a health exception,6 and even if it had,\n\nthe subsequent decisions in Casey and Stenberg would nevertheless\n\nrequire a health exception in the instant case.     The additional\n\ncases cited by the Attorney General and amici as examples of\n\nparental notification or consent statutes upheld without a health\n\n\n\n6\n   A review of the Hodgson briefs indicates only one instance in\nwhich the impact of the parental notification statute on minors in\nneed of an abortion for health reasons is discussed. In response\nto Minnesota's cross-petition to appeal the Eighth Circuit's\ndetermination   that   a   two-parent   notice   requirement   was\nunconstitutional in the absence of a judicial bypass, Cross-\nRespondents discussed the lengths to which some minors would go to\navoid having to notify a parent. This might include delaying or\nforegoing abortion even when \"serious health problems . . .\nnecessitate an immediate abortion.\" Brief for Cross-Respondents at\n15, Minnesota v. Hodgson, 497 U.S. 417 (No. 88-1309). Such health\nproblems, Cross-Respondents explained, were not covered by the\nstatute's death exception. Id. at 15 n.29. There was no argument\nthat the notice requirement was unconstitutional because it lacked\na health exception for such circumstances; rather, Cross-\nRespondents argued that a judicial bypass provision was\nconstitutionally required, in part so that a minor would not feel\ncompelled to forego an abortion needed for health reasons in order\nto avoid notifying her parents. Cross-Petitioners responded that\nno evidence had been provided of circumstances in which health\nproblems short of a threat to a minor's life would necessitate\nabortion. Reply Brief of Cross-Petitioners at 17-18, Minnesota v.\nHodgson, 497 U.S. 417 (No. 88-1309). The Supreme Court addressed\nneither argument, although a majority did find the two-parent\nnotice requirement unconstitutional in the absence of judicial\nbypass. Hodgson, 497 U.S. at 455.\n\n                               -14-\n\fexception are all similarly distinguishable.              Only three times\n\nsince Roe has the Supreme Court addressed a clear challenge to an\n\nabortion regulation's lack of a health exception.            In all three,\n\nthe Court has indicated that an exception must be provided when the\n\nrestriction would place a woman's health at risk.            See Stenberg,\n\n530 U.S. at 930-38 (requiring health exception for \"partial-birth\n\nabortion\"   ban);   Casey,   505   U.S.    at   879-80    (reading    medical\n\nemergency exception to include threat to health); Thornburgh v. Am.\n\nColl. of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 768-71\n\n(1986) (finding statute requiring presence of second physician for\n\npost-viability   abortion    facially     invalid   for   lack   of   medical\n\nemergency exception), overruled on other grounds, Casey, 505 U.S.\n\nat 882.\n\n            Since Stenberg, at least two circuit courts have applied\n\nthe health exception requirement to parental notice or consent\n\nlaws. In Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains Services, Corp.\n\nv. Owens, 287 F.3d 910, 915-16 (10th Cir. 2002), the Tenth Circuit\n\nheld that, because circumstances existed in which a pregnancy\n\ncomplication could seriously threaten a pregnant minor's health, a\n\nColorado parental notification law similar to the New Hampshire Act\n\nwas facially invalid for lack of a health exception.             Similarly,\n\nthe Ninth Circuit recently struck down an Idaho parental consent\n\nstatute, finding that \"[a] health exception is as requisite in\n\nstatutory or regulatory provisions affecting only minors' access to\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fabortion as it is in regulations concerning adult women.\"            Planned\n\nParenthood of Idaho, Inc. v. Wasden, 376 F.3d 908, 922-24 (9th Cir.\n\n2004) (finding Idaho statute's health exception overly narrow). We\n\nagree, and therefore affirm the district court's holding that the\n\nNew Hampshire Act is constitutionally invalid in the absence of a\n\nhealth exception.\n\n            Acknowledging that the Act contains no explicit health\n\nexception, the Attorney General argues that other provisions of New\n\nHampshire    law    provide   a   functional   equivalent.    None      of   the\n\nproffered statutes, however, is adequate.            RSA 153-A:18 precludes\n\ncivil liability for health professionals who render emergency\n\nmedical care without consent, but it does not preclude criminal\n\nliability.         RSA   676:6,   VII(b)   permits   physicians   and    their\n\nassistants to use force in providing emergency medical care when no\n\none competent to consent to such care is available.               While RSA\n\n676:6, VII(b) may preclude criminal liability for assault, it would\n\nnot insulate a physician from criminal liability for violating the\n\nAct's notification provisions.             See RSA 132:27 (providing that\n\nviolation of the Act's notice requirement is a misdemeanor).\n\nMoreover, the proffered statutes insulate medical personnel from\n\ncivil liability or assault charges that arise from giving treatment\n\nwithout consent; they do not provide such protection when the legal\n\naction arises from giving treatment to a consenting minor without\n\nfirst providing forty-eight hours' notice to her parent.\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f              For the first time, in this appeal, the Attorney General\n\nalso cites RSA 627:3, I, which codifies the \"competing harms\"\n\ndefense to criminal liability for those who violate the law in\n\norder to avoid harm that \"outweigh[s], according to ordinary\n\nstandards of reasonableness, the harm sought to be prevented\" by\n\nthe criminal provision.        Although this provision has the potential\n\nto protect against criminal liability under the Act, it cannot\n\npreclude civil liability.          Moreover, the provision would leave\n\nproviders uncertain whether, in any given circumstance, providing\n\nan abortion in violation of the Act would meet the \"ordinary\n\nstandards of reasonableness.\"\n\n              Even if these statutes could be cobbled together to\n\npreclude all civil and criminal liability for medical personnel who\n\nviolate the Act's notice requirements in order to preserve a\n\nminor's health, we would not view them as equivalent to the\n\nconstitutionally required health exception.            The basic canons of\n\nstatutory construction in New Hampshire require us to look first to\n\na statute's plain meaning, and when it is clear and unambiguous, to\n\napply   the    statute    as   written.     See,   e.g.,   Appeal   of   Astro\n\nSpectacular, Inc., 639 A.2d 249, 250 (N.H. 1996).           The Act clearly\n\nstates that \"[n]o abortion shall be performed upon an unemancipated\n\nminor . . . until at least 48 hours after written notice\" to a\n\nparent.     RSA 132:25.    Three explicit exceptions to this rule are\n\nprovided:      (1) when abortion is necessary to prevent the minor's\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fdeath; (2) when a parent certifies in writing that he or she has\n\nbeen notified; and (3) when a court grants a judicial bypass.        RSA\n\n132:26, I,   II.   The   New   Hampshire   legislature's   intent   that\n\nabortions not in compliance with the Act's notification provisions\n\nbe prohibited in all but these three circumstances is clear.         See\n\nSt. Joseph Hosp. of Nashua v. Rizzo, 676 A.2d 98, 100 (N.H. 1996)\n\n(espousing expressio unius standard of statutory construction).\n\nThe earlier-enacted statutory provisions cited by the Attorney\n\nGeneral cannot be read to supercede this intent.      See Petition of\n\nDunlap, 604 A.2d 945, 955 (N.H. 1992) (\"'When a conflict exists\n\nbetween two statutes, the later statute will control, especially\n\nwhen the later statute deals with a subject in a specific way and\n\nthe earlier enactment treats the subject in a general fashion.'\"\n\n(quoting Bd. of Selectmen v. Planning Bd., 383 A.2d 1122, 1124\n\n(N.H. 1978)).\n\n          Finally, the Attorney General argues that the Act's\n\njudicial bypass mechanism allows prompt authorization of a health-\n\nrelated abortion without notice.        The Act provides that such\n\nproceedings \"shall be given such precedence over other pending\n\nmatters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without\n\ndelay,\" provides minors 24-hour, 7-day access to the courts, and\n\nprovides for expedited appeal.     RSA 132:26, II(b)-(c).     However,\n\nthe Act allows courts seven calendar days in which to rule on\n\nminors' petitions, and another seven calendar days on appeal.\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fDelays of up to two weeks can therefore occur, during which time a\n\nminor's health may be adversely affected. Even when the courts act\n\nas expeditiously as possible, those minors who need an immediate\n\nabortion to protect their health are at risk.            Due to this delay,\n\nthe   Act's    bypass    provision     does    not     stand   in   for   the\n\nconstitutionally required health exception.            See Thornburgh, 476\n\nU.S. at 768-71 (finding statute facially invalid for failing to\n\nprovide health exception to delay caused by awaiting presence of\n\nsecond physician).\n\n          The   New     Hampshire    Act    contains   no   explicit   health\n\nexception, and no health exception is implied by other provisions\n\nof New Hampshire law or by the Act's judicial bypass procedure.\n\nThus, the Act is facially unconstitutional.\n\n          B.    Death exception\n\n          Just as it requires a health exception, the Constitution\n\nalso requires an exception to abortion restrictions when the life\n\nof a pregnant woman is in danger.             Stenberg, 530 U.S. at 931\n\n(\"[T]he governing standard requires an exception 'where it is\n\nnecessary, in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of\n\nthe life or health of the mother.'\" (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at\n\n879)).   Accordingly, the New Hampshire Act waives its parental\n\nnotice requirement when a physician can certify that abortion is\n\n\"necessary to prevent the minor's death and there is insufficient\n\ntime to provide the required notice.\" RSA 132:26, I(a). Appellees\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fargue   that     this   death       exception   is   unconstitutionally      narrow\n\nbecause (1) it is not possible for a physician to determine with\n\nany certainty whether death will occur before the notice provisions\n\ncould be complied with; (2) it does not allow for circumstances in\n\nwhich abortion is the best, but not the only, option for saving a\n\nminor's life;7 and (3) it does not permit abortion providers to\n\nrely on their own good faith judgment about whether an abortion is\n\nnecessary. The Attorney General does not refute these charges, but\n\nresponds that the Act is sufficiently specific to give notice of\n\nprohibited conduct, and that a scienter requirement can be read\n\ninto the Act from New Hampshire law.\n\n            A    minimum       of    forty-eight     hours     is   necessary   for\n\ncompliance with the Act's notification requirement. RSA 132:25, I.\n\nDr. Wayne       Goldner,   a    named    plaintiff    in     this   case,   provided\n\nunopposed testimony that physicians cannot predict with adequate\n\nprecision what course medical complications will take, and thus\n\ncannot always determine whether death will occur within this time\n\n\n\n7\n   The plaintiffs correctly identify that the Act, as currently\nformulated, would require a physician to use procedures that pose\nmore risk to her patient's health in order to comply with the\nnecessity provision of the death exception.        See Colautti v.\nFranklin, 439 U.S. 379, 400 (1979) (\"[T]he word 'necessary'\nsuggests that a particular technique must be indispensable to the\nwoman's life or health -- not merely desirable -- before it may be\nadopted.\").   Because we have already found unconstitutional the\nAct's failure to provide a health exception -- which would remedy\nthis problem by permitting abortion even in cases where a minor's\ndeath could be avoided by other, riskier means -- we do not address\nthis flaw as a separate ground for constitutional challenge.\n\n                                         -20-\n\fwindow.      Consequently, the time component of the Act's death\n\nexception forces physicians either to gamble with their patients'\n\nlives in hopes of complying with the notice requirement before a\n\nminor's death becomes inevitable, or to risk criminal and civil\n\nliability by providing an abortion without parental notice.     See\n\nDeclaration of Wayne Goldner, M.D., at ยถ 17 (\"[T]he Act will force\n\nme to choose between following the law and letting my patient's\n\ncondition deteriorate, possibly past the point of being able to\n\nsave her life at all, and alternatively providing appropriate\n\nmedical care to my patient and risking criminal prosecution and\n\nbeing sued by her parents.\").    The threat of such sanctions will\n\nhave a \"profound chilling effect on the willingness of physicians\n\nto perform abortions\" when a minor's life is at risk.    Colautti,\n\n439 U.S. at 396.     Thus, the Act's death exception is drawn too\n\nnarrowly to protect minors in need of a life-saving abortion.\n\n          The Attorney General apparently concedes that an abortion\n\nprovider must be able to rely on his or her good faith medical\n\njudgment in determining whether her patient's life is in danger.\n\nSee Colautti, 439 U.S. at 395 (\"We need not now decide whether,\n\nunder a properly drafted statute, a finding of bad faith or some\n\nother type of scienter would be required before a physician could\n\nbe held criminally responsible for an erroneous determination of\n\nviability.     We reaffirm, however, that 'the determination of\n\nwhether a particular fetus is viable is, and must be, a matter for\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fthe judgment of the responsible attending physician.'\").                         The\n\nAttorney General argues that RSA 626:2, I, which states that \"[a]\n\nperson is guilty of a . . . misdemeanor only if he acts purposely,\n\nknowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with\n\nrespect to each element of the offense,\" can be read together with\n\nthe Act to provide the necessary scienter requirement.                    According\n\nto the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, \"[w]here a specific mental\n\nstate is not provided for the offense,\" RSA 626:2, I(a) requires\n\n\"proof of a culpable mental state which is appropriate in light of\n\nthe nature      of    the    offense    and   the    policy    considerations    for\n\npunishing the conduct in question.\" State v. Bergen, 677 A.2d 145,\n\n146 (N.H. 1996) (determining requisite mental state for indecent\n\nexposure).      It is not clear, however, which of the four scienter\n\nrequirements would be imposed in this circumstance. The definition\n\nof negligence imposes an objective reasonableness standard, see RSA\n\n626:2, II (d), thus, a physician who acts on a good faith belief\n\nthat    abortion      is    necessary    to   save    a   patient's   life   could\n\nnonetheless face criminal or civil liability if a judge or jury\n\nlater found that the physician's assessment was unreasonable.                    See\n\nVoinovich, 130 F.3d at 205 (\"In this area [of medical necessity]\n\nwhere   there    is    such    disagreement,        it    is   unlikely   that   the\n\nprosecution could not find a physician willing to testify that the\n\nphysician did not act reasonably.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\f           As the district court held, we cannot construe the Act to\n\npreclude   liability   for   good   faith     judgments   \"unless   such   a\n\nconstruction is reasonable and readily apparent.\"               Heed, 296\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 66-67 (quoting Stenberg, 530 U.S. at 944).           The Act\n\ngives no indication that the negligence standard set out in RSA\n\n626:2, I should not be applied.            Thus, a physician cannot know\n\nwhether his or her determination that a minor's life is at risk\n\nwill be judged according to a standard (e.g., knowingly) that\n\nrespects her good-faith medical assessment, or by an objective\n\nstandard (negligently) that would leave the physician's judgment\n\nopen to post hoc second guessing. The resulting uncertainty would,\n\nagain, impermissibly chill physicians' willingness and ability to\n\nprovide lifesaving abortions.         See Voinovich, 130 F.3d at 205\n\n(finding   medical   emergency   exception      unconstitutionally   vague\n\n\"because physicians cannot know the standard under which their\n\nconduct will ultimately be judged\").           As Dr. Goldner explained,\n\n\"the Act forces doctors to think about criminal prosecution at a\n\ntime when we need to be concentrating on doing what is best for our\n\npatients, thus creating unnecessary risk to patients' health and\n\nlives.\"    Declaration of Wayne Goldner, M.D., at ยถ 19.         That risk\n\nconstitutes an undue burden for minors in need of life-saving\n\nabortions.\n\n           Because its time requirement is drawn too narrowly, and\n\nbecause it fails to safeguard a physician's good-faith medical\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fjudgment that a minor's life is at risk against criminal and civil\n\nliability, the Act's death exception is unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n                              -24-\n\f            C.     Confidentiality\n\n            The Act provides for judicial bypass of its notice\n\nprovisions if, after a hearing, a judge \"determines that the\n\npregnant minor is mature and capable of giving informed consent to\n\nthe proposed abortion,\" or, if she is not capable of giving\n\ninformed consent, that \"the performance of an abortion upon her\n\nwithout notification of her parent, guardian, or conservator would\n\nbe in her best interests.\"             RSA 132:26, II; cf. Bellotti v. Baird,\n\n443 U.S. 622, 643-44 (1979) (requiring parental consent laws to\n\nprovide for judicial bypass on same grounds). Appellees argue that\n\nthe Act does not adequately provide for the confidentiality of\n\nthese     judicial       bypass    procedures.       The    Act    indicates     that\n\n\"[p]roceedings in the court . . . shall be confidential,\" and \"[a]n\n\nexpedited confidential appeal shall be available.\"                    RSA 132:26,\n\nII(b)-(c).\n\n             Inadequate confidentiality provisions \"raise the specter\n\nof public exposure and harassment of women who choose to exercise\n\ntheir personal, intensely private, right, with their physician, to\n\nend a pregnancy.\"          Thornburgh, 476 U.S. at 767; see also Bellotti\n\nv. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 644 (1979) (finding that judicial bypass\n\nproceeding \"must assure that a resolution of the issue, and any\n\nappeals that follow, will be completed with anonymity\").                    In the\n\ninstant    case,     a   lack     of   confidentiality     would   also   create   a\n\nsignificant      risk     that    a    minor's   parents   could    learn   of   her\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\fpregnancy and desire for an abortion, resulting in the very harms\n\nsought to be avoided by the bypass procedure.                    Alternatively, a\n\nminor might be compelled to delay or decline to seek an abortion\n\nout of fear that her parents would find out.                 Thus, for a large\n\nfraction     of   minors    eligible     for   judicial     bypass,      inadequate\n\nconfidentiality would impose an undue burden.\n\n             Confidentiality provisions must \"take reasonable steps to\n\nprevent the public from learning of the minor's identity,\" but the\n\nSupreme Court has \"refuse[d] to base a decision on the facial\n\nvalidity of a statute on the mere possibility of unauthorized,\n\nillegal disclosure by state employees.\"              Akron Ctr., 497 U.S. at\n\n513.   Considerable grey area is left between these two standards.\n\nBecause      we   have     already     found   the   Act     in    its    entirety\n\nunconstitutional on other grounds, however, we find it unnecessary\n\nto   delve    further    into   an     evaluation    of    its    confidentiality\n\nprovisions.\n\n                                III.

United States v. Lewko,</i> 269 F.3d 64, 67 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General argues that in deciding whether the Act is facially invalid we should apply the \"no set of circumstances\" standard set forth in <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This standard requires plaintiffs challenging a state law as facially invalid to show that \"no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\" <i>Id.</i> at 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095. The Attorney General's argument rests on the premise that the <i>Salerno</i> standard is applicable to the Act despite the agreement of a plurality of Justices in <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 876-77, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), that a law which \"has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus\" places an unconstitutional \"undue burden\" on the exercise of her right to choose abortion. A majority of the <i>Casey</i> Court applied that standard to determine that an abortion regulation is facially invalid if \"in a large fraction of cases in which [the regulation] is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion,\" thus imposing an \"undue burden.\" <i>Id.</i> at 895, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (per Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, joined by Justices Stevens and Blackmun). The Court has since confirmed that \"`a law designed to further the State's interest in fetal life which imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision before fetal viability' is unconstitutional.\" <i>Stenberg v. Carhart,</i> 530 U.S. 914, 921, 120 S.Ct. 2597, 147 L.Ed.2d 743 (2000) (quoting <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 877, 112 S.Ct. 2791); <i>see also id.</i> at 945-46, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (declaring Nebraska ban on so-called \"partial birth abortion\" unconstitutional under undue burden standard).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the Supreme Court's clear application of the undue burden standard in <i>Casey</i> and <i>Stenberg,</i> it has never explicitly addressed the standard's tension with <i>Salerno.</i> In the instant case, while recognizing that this court has yet to address the issue, the district court followed the majority of circuits that apply the <i>Casey</i> and <i>Stenberg</i> standard to legislation regulating abortion. The Attorney General notes that the Supreme Court applied the <i>Salerno</i> standard in the abortion context prior to <i>Casey, see, e.g., Ohio v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health,</i> 497 U.S. 502, 514, 110 S.Ct. 2972, 111 L.Ed.2d 405 (1990), and urges us to follow the Fifth Circuit's decision in <i>Barnes v. Moore,</i> 970 F.2d 12, 14 n. 2 (5th Cir.1992), that <i>Casey</i> does not displace <i>Salerno's</i>\"no set of circumstances\" test for facial challenges to abortion regulation. <i>See also Causeway Med. Suite v. Ieyoub,</i> 109 F.3d 1096, 1102-03 (5th Cir.1997) (declining to reverse <i>Barnes</i>). The overwhelming majority of circuits to address this issue, however, have disagreed with the Fifth Circuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Cent. N.J. v. Farmer,</i> 220 F.3d 127, 142-43 (3d Cir.2000) (holding undue burden standard, instead of <i>Salerno</i> standard, applies in abortion context after <i>Casey</i>); <i>Planned Parenthood of S. Ariz. v. Lawall,</i> 180 F.3d 1022, 1025-26 (9th Cir.1999) (noting inconsistency between <i>Casey</i> and <i>Salerno,</i> and following \"great weight of circuit authority holding that <i>Casey</i> has overruled <i>Salerno</i> in the context of facial challenges to abortion statutes\"), <i>amended on denial of reh'g,</i> 193 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir.1999); <i>Women's Med.

Miller,</i> 63 F.3d 1452, 1456-58 (8th Cir.1995) (opting to \"follow what the Supreme Court actually did &#8212; rather than what it failed to say &#8212; and apply the undue-burden test.\"), <i>cert. denied sub nom., Janklow v. Planned Parenthood,</i> 517 U.S. 1174, 116 S.Ct. 1582, 134 L.Ed.2d 679 (1996); <i>cf. A Woman's Choice-E. Side Women's Clinic v. Newman,</i> 305 F.3d 684, 687 (7th Cir.2002) (reconciling conflict between <i>Salerno,</i> and <i>Stenberg/Casey,</i> by construing \"no set of circumstances\" language as a \"suggestion\" that gives way to <i>Stenberg's</i> holding that undue burden test applies), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 1192, 123 S.Ct. 1273, 154 L.Ed.2d 1026 (2003). We agree with these six circuit courts that the undue burden standard &#8212; proposed as a standard \"of general application\" by the <i>Casey</i> plurality, <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 876, 112 S.Ct. 2791, and twice applied to abortion regulations by a majority of the Court, <i>id.</i> at 895, 112 S.Ct. 2791; <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S. at 920, 120 S.Ct. 2597 &#8212; supersedes <i>Salerno</i> in the context of abortion regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Complementing the general undue burden standard, the Supreme Court has also identified a specific and independent constitutional requirement that an abortion regulation must contain an exception for the preservation of a pregnant woman's health. <i>See Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S. at 929-30, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (identifying \"two independent reasons\" for striking down a Nebraska regulation: first, that it lacks a health exception, and second, that it imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability to choose abortion). The origin of the health requirement can be traced to <i>Roe,</i> which held that \"the State, in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life, may ... regulate ... abortion [after fetal viability] <i>except</i> where necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life <i>or health</i> of the mother.\" <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 164-65, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973)(emphasis added), <i>reaff'd Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). Later, the majority in <i>Casey</i> observed that, had the medical emergency exception to Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions &#8212; among them a parental consent requirement &#8212; precluded \"immediate abortion despite some significant health risks,\" it would have been unconstitutional since \"the essential holding of <i>Roe</i> forbids a State to interfere with a woman's choice to undergo an abortion ... if continuing her pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health.\" <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 880, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Finally, in <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S. at 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597, the Supreme Court clarified that \"the law requires a health exception in order to validate even a postviability abortion regulation, [and] it at a minimum requires the same in respect to previability regulations,\" 530 U.S. at 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597. Thus, a statute regulating abortion must contain a health exception in order to survive constitutional challenge. Similarly, <i>Roe</i> requires that abortion regulations contain an adequate death exception to permit abortion when it is necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman. <i>Roe,</i> 410 U.S. at 164-65, 93 S.Ct. 705.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case thus presents three questions: whether New Hampshire's Act contains an adequate health exception, whether it contains an adequate death exception, and whether it places an undue burden on unemancipated minors who wish to obtain an abortion. A state's decision to require parental notification for minors seeking an abortion is not constitutionally infirm <i>per se. See Lambert v. Wicklund,</i> 520 U.S. 292, 117 S.Ct. 1169, 137 L.Ed.2d 464 (1997) (upholding parental notification statute against constitutional challenge to judicial bypass procedure). The district court determined, however, that the New Hampshire Act's lack of a health exception and overly narrow death exception render it unconstitutional. Appellees argue that the Act also creates an undue burden by failing to adequately ensure the confidentiality of judicial bypass procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Health exception</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General and amici suggest that parental notification laws are shielded from the health exception requirement reiterated in <i>Stenberg</i> on account of the interests they aim to protect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Parental notification laws are enacted not only in furtherance of the state's \"interest in the potentiality of human life,\" <i>Roe,</i> 410 U.S. at 164, 93 S.Ct. 705, but also in the interest of protecting minors from undertaking the risks of abortion without the advice and support of a parent. In considering an abortion regulation based on interests other than the one identified in <i>Roe,</i> however, the Supreme Court has determined that it \"cannot see how the interest-related differences could make any difference to the ... application of the `health' requirement.\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S. at 931, 120 S.Ct. 2597; <i>see also Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 877, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (\"[A] statute which, while furthering the interest in potential life <i>or some other valid state interest,</i> has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman's choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends.\" (emphasis added)) (plurality opinion). The Constitution requires a health exception even when the State's interest in regulation is \"compelling.\" <i>See Roe,</i> 410 U.S. at 163, 93 S.Ct. 705; <i>see also Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S. at 931, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (\"[A] State may promote but not endanger a woman's health when it regulates the methods of abortion.\"). Thus, regardless of the interests served by New Hampshire's parental notice statute, it does not escape the Constitution's requirement of a health exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General and amici also argue that our decision should be controlled by <i>Hodgson v. Minnesota,</i> 497 U.S. 417, 110 S.Ct. 2926, 111 L.Ed.2d 344 (1990), in which the Supreme Court upheld a parental notification statute that contained no health exception. However, as noted by the district court, the <i>Hodgson</i> Court did not consider a challenge to that statute's lack of a health exception,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and even if it had, the subsequent decisions in <i>Casey</i> and <i>Stenberg</i> would nevertheless require a health exception in the instant case. The additional cases cited by the Attorney General and amici as examples of parental notification or consent statutes upheld without a health exception are all similarly distinguishable. Only three times since <i>Roe</i> has the Supreme Court addressed a clear challenge to an abortion regulation's lack of a health exception. In all three, the Court has indicated that an exception must be provided when the restriction would place a woman's health at risk. <i>See Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S. at 930-38, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (requiring health exception for \"partial-birth abortion\" ban); <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 879-80, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (reading medical emergency exception to include threat to health); <i>Thornburgh v. Am. Coll. of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U.S. 747, 768-71, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986) (finding statute requiring presence of second physician for post-viability abortion facially invalid for lack of medical emergency exception), <i>overruled</i> on other grounds, <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 882, 112 S.Ct. 2791.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Stenberg,</i> at least two circuit courts have applied the health exception requirement to parental notice or consent laws. In <i>Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains Services, Corp. v. Owens,</i> 287 F.3d 910, 915-16 (10th Cir.2002), the Tenth Circuit held that, because circumstances existed in which a pregnancy complication could seriously threaten a pregnant minor's health, a Colorado parental notification law similar to the New Hampshire Act was facially invalid for lack of a health exception. Similarly, the Ninth Circuit recently struck down an Idaho parental consent statute, finding that \"[a] health exception is as requisite in statutory or regulatory provisions affecting only minors' access to abortion as it is in regulations concerning adult women.\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Idaho, Inc. v. Wasden,</i> 376 F.3d 908, 922-24 (9th Cir.2004) (finding Idaho statute's health exception overly narrow). We agree, and therefore affirm the district court's holding that the New Hampshire Act is constitutionally invalid in the absence of a health exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acknowledging that the Act contains no explicit health exception, the Attorney General argues that other provisions of New Hampshire law provide a functional equivalent. None of the proffered statutes, however, is adequate. RSA 153-A:18 precludes civil liability for health professionals who render emergency medical care without consent, but it does not preclude criminal liability. RSA 676:6, VII(b) permits physicians and their assistants to use force in providing emergency medical care when no one competent to consent to such care is available. While RSA 676:6, VII(b) may preclude criminal liability for assault, it would not insulate a physician from criminal liability for violating the Act's notification provisions. <i>See</i> RSA 132:27 (providing that violation of the Act's notice requirement is a misdemeanor). Moreover, the proffered statutes insulate medical personnel from civil liability or assault charges that arise from giving treatment without <i>consent;</i> they do not provide such protection when the legal action arises from giving treatment to a consenting minor without first providing forty-eight hours' notice to her parent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time, in this appeal, the Attorney General also cites RSA 627:3, I, which codifies the \"competing harms\" defense to criminal liability for those who violate the law in order to avoid harm that \"outweigh [s], according to ordinary standards of reasonableness, the harm sought to be prevented\" by the criminal provision. Although this provision has the potential to protect against criminal liability under the Act, it cannot preclude civil liability. Moreover, the provision would leave providers uncertain whether, in any given circumstance, providing an abortion in violation of the Act would meet the \"ordinary standards of reasonableness.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if these statutes could be cobbled together to preclude all civil and criminal liability for medical personnel who violate the Act's notice requirements in order to preserve a minor's health, we would not view them as equivalent to the constitutionally required health exception. The basic canons of statutory construction in New Hampshire require us to look first to a statute's plain meaning, and when it is clear and unambiguous, to apply the statute as written. <i>See, e.g., Appeal of Astro Spectacular, Inc.,</i> 138 N.H. 298, 639 A.2d 249, 250 (N.H.1996). The Act clearly states that \"[n]o abortion shall be performed upon an unemancipated minor ... until at least 48 hours after written notice\" to a parent. RSA 132:25. Three explicit exceptions to this rule are provided: (1) when abortion is necessary to prevent the minor's death; (2) when a parent certifies in writing that he or she has been notified; and (3) when a court grants a judicial bypass. RSA 132:26, I, II. The New Hampshire legislature's intent that abortions not in compliance with the Act's notification provisions be prohibited in all but these three circumstances is clear. <i>See St. Joseph Hosp. of Nashua v. Rizzo,</i> 141 N.H. 9, 676 A.2d 98, 100 (1996) (espousing <i>expressio unius</i> standard of statutory construction). The earlier-enacted statutory provisions cited by the Attorney General cannot be read to supercede this intent. <i>See Petition of Dunlap,</i> 134 N.H. 533, 604 A.2d 945, 955 (1992) (\"`When a conflict exists between two statutes, the later statute will control, especially when the later statute deals with a subject in a specific way and the earlier enactment treats the subject in a general fashion.'\") (quoting <i>Bd. of Selectmen v. Planning Bd.,</i> 118 N.H. 150, 383 A.2d 1122, 1124 (1978)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Attorney General argues that the Act's judicial bypass mechanism allows prompt authorization of a health-related abortion without notice. The Act provides that such proceedings \"shall be given such precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay,\" provides minors 24-hour, 7-day access to the courts, and provides for expedited appeal. RSA 132:26, II(b)-(c). However, the Act allows courts seven calendar days in which to rule on minors' petitions, and another seven calendar days on appeal. Delays of up to two weeks can therefore occur, during which time a minor's health may be adversely affected. Even when the courts act as expeditiously as possible, those minors who need an immediate abortion to protect their health are at risk. Due to this delay, the Act's bypass provision does not stand in for the constitutionally required health exception. <i>See Thornburgh,</i> 476 U.S. at 768-71, 106 S.Ct. 2169 (finding statute facially invalid for failing to provide health exception to delay caused by awaiting presence of second physician).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire Act contains no explicit health exception, and no health exception is implied by other provisions of New Hampshire law or by the Act's judicial bypass procedure. Thus, the Act is facially unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Death exception</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as it requires a health exception, the Constitution also requires an exception to abortion restrictions when the life of a pregnant woman is in danger. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S. at 931, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (\"[T]he governing standard requires an exception `where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.'\" (quoting <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S. at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791)). Accordingly, the New Hampshire Act waives its parental notice requirement when a physician can certify that abortion is \"necessary to prevent the minor's death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice.\" RSA 132:26, I(a). Appellees argue that this death exception is unconstitutionally narrow because (1) it is not possible for a physician to determine with any certainty whether death will occur before the notice provisions could be complied with; (2) it does not allow for circumstances in which abortion is the best, but not the only, option for saving a minor's life;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and (3) it does not permit abortion providers to rely on their own good faith judgment about whether an abortion is necessary. The Attorney General does not refute these charges, but responds that the Act is sufficiently specific to give notice of prohibited conduct, and that a scienter requirement can be read into the Act from New Hampshire law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A minimum of forty-eight hours is necessary for compliance with the Act's notification requirement. RSA 132:25, I. Dr. Wayne Goldner, a named plaintiff in this case, provided unopposed testimony that physicians cannot predict with adequate precision what course medical complications will take, and thus cannot always determine whether death will occur within this time window. Consequently, the time component of the Act's death exception forces physicians either to gamble with their patients' lives in hopes of complying with the notice requirement before a minor's death becomes inevitable, or to risk criminal and civil liability by providing an abortion without parental notice. <i>See</i> Declaration of Wayne Goldner, M.D., at &#182; 17 (\"[T]he Act will force me to choose between following the law and letting my patient's condition deteriorate, possibly past the point of being able to save her life at all, and alternatively providing appropriate medical care to my patient and risking criminal prosecution and being sued by her parents.\"). The threat of such sanctions will have a \"profound chilling effect on the willingness of physicians to perform abortions\" when a minor's life is at risk. <i>Colautti,</i> 439 U.S. at 396, 99 S.Ct. 675. Thus, the Act's death exception is drawn too narrowly to protect minors in need of a life-saving abortion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General apparently concedes that an abortion provider must be able to rely on his or her good faith medical judgment in determining whether her patient's life is in danger. <i>See Colautti,</i> 439 U.S. at 395, 99 S.Ct. 675 (\"We need not now decide whether, under a properly drafted statute, a finding of bad faith or some other type of scienter would be required before a physician could be held criminally responsible for an erroneous determination of viability. We reaffirm, however, that `the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician.'\"). The Attorney General argues that RSA 626:2, I, which states that \"[a] person is guilty of a ... misdemeanor only if he acts purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with respect to each element of the offense,\" can be read together with the Act to provide the necessary scienter requirement. According to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, \"[w]here a specific mental state is not provided for the offense,\" RSA 626:2, I(a) requires \"proof of a culpable mental state which is appropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the policy considerations for punishing the conduct in question.\" <i>State v. Bergen,</i> 141 N.H. 61, 677 A.2d 145, 146 (1996) (determining requisite mental state for indecent exposure). It is not clear, however, which of the four scienter requirements would be imposed in this circumstance. The definition of negligence imposes an objective reasonableness standard, <i>see</i> RSA 626:2, II(d), thus, a physician who acts on a good faith belief that abortion is necessary to save a patient's life could nonetheless face criminal or civil liability if a judge or jury later found that the physician's assessment was unreasonable. <i>See Voinovich,</i> 130 F.3d at 205 (\"In this area [of medical necessity] where there is such disagreement, it is unlikely that the prosecution could not find a physician willing to testify that the physician did not act reasonably.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court held, we cannot construe the Act to preclude liability for good faith judgments \"unless such a construction is reasonable and readily apparent.\" <i>Heed,</i> 296 F.Supp.2d at 66-67 (quoting <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S. at 944, 120 S.Ct. 2597). The Act gives no indication that the negligence standard set out in RSA 626:2, I should not be applied. Thus, a physician cannot know whether his or her determination that a minor's life is at risk will be judged according to a standard (e.g., knowingly) that respects her good-faith medical assessment, or by an objective standard (negligently) that would leave the physician's judgment open to <i>post hoc</i> second guessing. The resulting uncertainty would, again, impermissibly chill physicians' willingness and ability to provide lifesaving abortions. <i>See Voinovich,</i> 130 F.3d at 205 (finding medical emergency exception unconstitutionally vague \"because physicians cannot know the standard under which their conduct will ultimately be judged\"). As Dr. Goldner explained, \"the Act forces doctors to think about criminal prosecution at a time when we need to be concentrating on doing what is best for our patients, thus creating unnecessary risk to patients' health and lives.\" Declaration of Wayne Goldner, M.D., at &#182; 19. That risk constitutes an undue burden for minors in need of life-saving abortions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because its time requirement is drawn too narrowly, and because it fails to safeguard a physician's good-faith medical judgment that a minor's life is at risk against criminal and civil liability, the Act's death exception is unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Confidentiality</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act provides for judicial bypass of its notice provisions if, after a hearing, a judge \"determines that the pregnant minor is mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion,\" or, if she is not capable of giving informed consent, that \"the performance of an abortion upon her without notification of her parent, guardian, or conservator would be in her best interests.\" RSA 132:26, II; <i>cf. Bellotti v. Baird,</i> 443 U.S. 622, 643-44, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979) (requiring parental consent laws to provide for judicial bypass on same grounds). Appellees argue that the Act does not adequately provide for the confidentiality of these judicial bypass procedures. The Act indicates that \"[p]roceedings in the court ... shall be confidential,\" and \"[a]n expedited confidential appeal shall be available.\" RSA 132:26, II(b)-(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inadequate confidentiality provisions \"raise the specter of public exposure and harassment of women who choose to exercise their personal, intensely private, right, with their physician, to end a pregnancy.\" <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U.S. at 767, 106 S.Ct. 2169; <i>see also Bellotti v. Baird,</i> 443 U.S. 622, 644, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979) (finding that judicial bypass proceeding \"must assure that a resolution of the issue, and any appeals that follow, will be completed with anonymity\"). In the instant case, a lack of confidentiality would also create a significant risk that a minor's parents could learn of her pregnancy and desire for an abortion, resulting in the very harms sought to be avoided by the bypass procedure. Alternatively, a minor might be compelled to delay or decline to seek an abortion out of fear that her parents would find out. Thus, for a large fraction of minors eligible for judicial bypass, inadequate confidentiality would impose an undue burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confidentiality provisions must \"take reasonable steps to prevent the public from learning of the minor's identity,\" but the Supreme Court has \"refuse[d] to base a decision on the facial validity of a statute on the mere possibility of unauthorized, illegal disclosure by state employees.\" <i>Akron Ctr.,</i> 497 U.S. at 513, 110 S.Ct. 2972. Considerable grey area is left between these two standards.

The injury in question, according to amici, is the one suffered by pregnant minors who require an abortion for health reasons. Amici argue that it is \"not sufficient to merely show that some unknown medical conditions exist that may at some unknown future date be suffered by some unknown minors.\" Brief of Amici New Hampshire Legislators at 8. In fact, Dr. Wayne Goldner listed in his unopposed declaration five specific conditions that could require abortion to protect a minor's health: preeclampsia, eclampsia, premature rupture of the membranes surrounding the fetus, spontaneous chorioamnionitis, and heavy bleeding during pregnancy. Declaration of Wayne Goldner, M.D., &#182;&#182; 8-15. Moreover, appellee abortion providers themselves face an imminent injury &#8212; civil or criminal prosecution for performing an abortion in violation of the Act &#8212; sufficient to confer on them Article III standing. <i>See Planned Parenthood of Cent. Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U.S. 52, 62, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976) (holding that physician abortion providers asserting their own rights and those of their patients had standing to challenge abortion regulation and \"should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief\"). Because of their close relationship to the abortion decision, and the rights involved, providers routinely have <i>jus tertii</i> standing to assert the rights of women whose access to abortion is restricted. <i>See Singleton v. Wulff,</i> 428 U.S. 106, 117, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (\"[I]t generally is appropriate to allow a physician to assert the rights of women patients as against governmental interference with the abortion decisions....\").

There was no argument that the notice requirement was unconstitutional because it lacked a health exception for such circumstances; rather, Cross-Respondents argued that a judicial bypass provision was constitutionally required, in part so that a minor would not feel compelled to forego an abortion needed for health reasons in order to avoid notifying her parents. Cross-Petitioners responded that no evidence had been provided of circumstances in which health problems short of a threat to a minor's life would necessitate abortion.

None of the proffered statutes, however, is adequate. RSA 153-A:18 precludes civil liability for health professionals who render emergency medical care without consent, but it does not preclude criminal liability. RSA 676:6, VII(b) permits physicians and their assistants to use force in providing emergency medical care when no one competent to consent to such care is available. While RSA 676:6, VII(b) may preclude criminal liability for assault, it would not insulate a physician from criminal liability for violating the Act's notification provisions. <i>See</i> RSA 132:27 (providing that violation of the Act's notice requirement is a misdemeanor). Moreover, the proffered statutes insulate medical personnel from civil liability or assault charges that arise from giving treatment without <i>consent;</i> they do not provide such protection when the legal action arises from giving treatment to a consenting minor without first providing forty-eight hours' notice to her parent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time, in this appeal, the Attorney General also cites RSA 627:3, I, which codifies the \"competing harms\" defense to criminal liability for those who violate the law in order to avoid harm that \"outweigh [s], according to ordinary standards of reasonableness, the harm sought to be prevented\" by the criminal provision. Although this provision has the potential to protect against criminal liability under the Act, it cannot preclude civil liability. Moreover, the provision would leave providers uncertain whether, in any given circumstance, providing an abortion in violation of the Act would meet the \"ordinary standards of reasonableness.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if these statutes could be cobbled together to preclude all civil and criminal liability for medical personnel who violate the Act's notice requirements in order to preserve a minor's health, we would not view them as equivalent to the constitutionally required health exception. The basic canons of statutory construction in New Hampshire require us to look first to a statute's plain meaning, and when it is clear and unambiguous, to apply the statute as written. <i>See, e.g., Appeal of Astro Spectacular, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></span>, 250 (N.H.1996). The Act clearly states that \"[n]o abortion shall be performed upon an unemancipated minor ... until at least 48 hours after written notice\" to a parent. RSA 132:25. Three explicit exceptions to this rule are provided: (1) when abortion is necessary to prevent the minor's death; (2) when a parent certifies in writing that he or she has been notified; and (3) when a court grants a judicial bypass. RSA 132:26, I, II. The New Hampshire legislature's intent that abortions not in compliance with the Act's notification provisions be prohibited in all but these three circumstances is clear. <i>See St. Joseph Hosp. of Nashua v. Rizzo,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></span>, 100 (1996) (espousing <i>expressio unius</i> standard of statutory construction). The earlier-enacted statutory provisions cited by the Attorney General cannot be read to supercede this intent. <i>See Petition of Dunlap,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></span>, 955 (1992) (\"`When a conflict exists between two statutes, the later statute will control, especially when the later statute deals with a subject in a specific way and the earlier enactment treats the subject in a general fashion.'\") (quoting <i>Bd. of Selectmen v.

The Act provides that such proceedings \"shall be given such precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay,\" provides minors 24-hour, 7-day access to the courts, and provides for expedited appeal. RSA 132:26, II(b)-(c). However, the Act allows courts seven calendar days in which to rule on minors' petitions, and another seven calendar days on appeal. Delays of up to two weeks can therefore occur, during which time a minor's health may be adversely affected. Even when the courts act as expeditiously as possible, those minors who need an immediate abortion to protect their health are at risk. Due to this delay, the Act's bypass provision does not stand in for the constitutionally required health exception. <i>See Thornburgh,</i> 476 U.S. at 768-71, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111690\"><a href=\"/opinion/111690/thornburgh-v-american-college-of-obstetricians-and-gynecologists/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Accordingly, the New Hampshire Act waives its parental notice requirement when a physician can certify that abortion is \"necessary to prevent the minor's death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice.\" RSA 132:26, I(a). Appellees argue that this death exception is unconstitutionally narrow because (1) it is not possible for a physician to determine with any certainty whether death will occur before the notice provisions could be complied with; (2) it does not allow for circumstances in which abortion is the best, but not the only, option for saving a minor's life;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and (3) it does not permit abortion providers to rely on their own good faith judgment about whether an abortion is necessary. The Attorney General does not refute these charges, but responds that the Act is sufficiently specific to give notice of prohibited conduct, and that a scienter requirement can be read into the Act from New Hampshire law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A minimum of forty-eight hours is necessary for compliance with the Act's notification requirement. RSA 132:25, I. Dr. Wayne Goldner, a named plaintiff in this case, provided unopposed testimony that physicians cannot predict with adequate precision what course medical complications will take, and thus cannot always determine whether death will occur within this time window. Consequently, the time component of the Act's death exception forces physicians either to gamble with their patients' lives in hopes of complying with the notice requirement before a minor's death becomes inevitable, or to risk criminal and civil liability by providing an abortion without parental notice. <i>See</i> Declaration of Wayne Goldner, M.D., at &#182; 17 (\"[T]he Act will force me to choose between following the law and letting my patient's condition deteriorate, possibly past the point of being able to save her life at all, and alternatively providing appropriate medical care to my patient and risking criminal prosecution and being sued by her parents.\"). The threat of such sanctions will have a \"profound chilling effect on the willingness of physicians to perform abortions\" when a minor's life is at risk. <i>Colautti,</i> 439 U.S. at 396, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109966\"><a href=\"/opinion/109966/colautti-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Attorney General argues that RSA 626:2, I, which states that \"[a] person is guilty of a ... misdemeanor only if he acts purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently, as the law may require, with respect to each element of the offense,\" can be read together with the Act to provide the necessary scienter requirement. According to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, \"[w]here a specific mental state is not provided for the offense,\" RSA 626:2, I(a) requires \"proof of a culpable mental state which is appropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the policy considerations for punishing the conduct in question.\" <i>State v.

It is not clear, however, which of the four scienter requirements would be imposed in this circumstance. The definition of negligence imposes an objective reasonableness standard, <i>see</i> RSA 626:2, II(d), thus, a physician who acts on a good faith belief that abortion is necessary to save a patient's life could nonetheless face criminal or civil liability if a judge or jury later found that the physician's assessment was unreasonable. <i>See Voinovich,</i> 130 F.3d at 205 (\"In this area [of medical necessity] where there is such disagreement, it is unlikely that the prosecution could not find a physician willing to testify that the physician did not act reasonably.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court held, we cannot construe the Act to preclude liability for good faith judgments \"unless such a construction is reasonable and readily apparent.\" <i>Heed,</i> 296 F.Supp.2d at 66-67 (quoting <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S. at 944, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118387\"><a href=\"/opinion/118387/stenberg-v-carhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, a physician cannot know whether his or her determination that a minor's life is at risk will be judged according to a standard (e.g., knowingly) that respects her good-faith medical assessment, or by an objective standard (negligently) that would leave the physician's judgment open to <i>post hoc</i> second guessing.

Amici argue that it is \"not sufficient to merely show that some unknown medical conditions exist that may at some unknown future date be suffered by some unknown minors.\" Brief of Amici New Hampshire Legislators at 8. In fact, Dr. Wayne Goldner listed in his unopposed declaration five specific conditions that could require abortion to protect a minor's health: preeclampsia, eclampsia, premature rupture of the membranes surrounding the fetus, spontaneous chorioamnionitis, and heavy bleeding during pregnancy.

There was no argument that the notice requirement was unconstitutional because it lacked a health exception for such circumstances; rather, Cross-Respondents argued that a judicial bypass provision was constitutionally required, in part so that a minor would not feel compelled to forego an abortion needed for health reasons in order to avoid notifying her parents.
