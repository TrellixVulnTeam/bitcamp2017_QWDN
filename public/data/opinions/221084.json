Camille L. Vélez-Rivé, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                   Torruella, Siler,* and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Manuel Fernández-Bared, with whom Toro, Colón, Mullet, Rivera\n& Sifre, P.S.C., was on brief for appellant.\n     Antonio Juan Bennazar-Zequeira, with whom Bennazar, García,\nRobles & Milián, CSP, was on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                          July 15, 2011\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.      This case, involving the saga\n\nof an extremely frustrated boat owner, provides further support for\n\nthe occasionally expressed view that the two happiest days of a\n\nboat owner's life are the day he buys his boat and the day he sells\n\nit. Appellees will have to remain satisfied with this allotment of\n\njoy, as we now reverse the district court and hold that there was\n\ninsufficient proof of causation to support finding the appellant\n\nliable.\n\n              I.   Background and prior proceedings\n\n          Appellant   Marine   World    Distributors,   Inc.   (\"Marine\n\nWorld\") does business in the sale, service and repair of marine\n\nvessels, with its principal offices in San Juan, Puerto Rico.       In\n\n2004, Marine World offered for sale a previously owned twenty-six\n\nfoot 2001 Bayliner Ciera 2655 motorboat (the \"boat\"). On March 29,\n\n2004, Mr. Carlos Suárez, a certified marine surveyor, inspected and\n\nappraised the boat, noting that the engine could not be tested\n\nbecause no cooling water was available.          Nevertheless, Suárez\n\nconcluded that the boat was good for intended cruising around\n\nPuerto Rico and coastal waters.         On August 13, 2004, Appellee\n\nRichard S. Fairest-Knight (\"Fairest-Knight\") purchased the boat\n\nfrom Marine World for $38,000.1        Fairest-Knight had no previous\n\nboating experience, and this was his first boat purchase. The boat\n\n\n1\n  Fairest-Knight's complaint lists the purchase price as $39,075,\nwhereas the bill of sale lists $38,000. The correct figure is not\nmaterial to this dispute.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fwas purchased \"as is,\" as expressly provided in the Sales Order,\n\nand Fairest-Knight was aware that no express or implied warranty\n\nresulted from Marine World's sale of the boat.           Fairest-Knight\n\ninsured the boat and contracted with a company that provides\n\nemergency towing assistance.\n\n          While   operating     the     boat   on   January   22,   2005,\n\napproximately five months after he purchased it, Fairest-Knight\n\nobserved that the boat's oil alarm was triggered and that oil had\n\ndrained from the engine into the motor compartment. On January 27,\n\n2005, Marine World inspected the engine, and on February 8, 2005,\n\nit performed the work necessary to correct the oil leakage, as\n\nauthorized by Fairest-Knight.    This incident would become one in a\n\nseries of periodic breakdowns and other problems with the boat over\n\nthe next several years.   On each occasion, Fairest-Knight would\n\nbring the boat back to Marine World to be repaired, at which point\n\nMarine World would inspect the problem, tender a diagnosis and\n\nperform the indicated repairs.        Marine World frequently performed\n\nsea trials to confirm that the problem had been corrected.            No\n\nother person or entity serviced the boat during this time.           Over\n\nthe years, the repairs performed by Marine World included the\n\nfollowing:\n\n          a) cleaning the engine room and replacing the\n          oil sender thread, oil sensor and various\n          other corroded fittings (February 8, 2005);\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fb) performing a tune up, replacing the\nimpeller, and sanding and painting pulleys\n(June 6, 2005);\n\nc) replacing the sea water pump and serpentine\nbelt (August 23, 2005);\n\nd) removing the engine, disassembling the\nmanifolds and elbows, starter, engine points,\npower steering pump, and pulleys, as well as\ncleaning and painting those parts and the oil\npan, followed by a sea trial (October 26,\n2005);\n\ne) installing a missing power steering pump\nbracket (November 19, 2005);\n\nf) reconnecting GPS terminals, performing a\ntune up, and conducting a sea trial (May 17,\n2006);\n\ng) replacing the electric fuel pump, cleaning\nthe carburetor, and conducting a sea trial\n(May 27, 2006);\n\nh) conducting a sea trial (June 5, 2006);\n\ni) removing and      charging    the    batteries\n(August 10, 2006);\n\nj) replacing the fuel tank vent (August 12,\n2006);\n\nk) conducting a sea trial (August 15, 2006);\n\nl) replacing the      fuel    pick-up    assembly\n(August 30, 2006);\n\nm) overhauling the engine, replacing the\nmanifolds and elbows, and conducting a sea\ntrial (November 6, 2006);\n\nn)    replacing    the       exhaust     flappers\n(December 13, 2006);\n\no)    replacing    the       engine     longblock\n(February 15, 2007);\n\n\n                     -4-\n\f           p) replacing the impeller kit and flappers\n           (May 14, 2007).\n\nDespite   these    repairs,    Fairest-Knight      experienced   repeated\n\nmalfunctions while using the boat, often involving complete engine\n\nfailures that required towing the boat back to port.\n\n           The culmination of these incidents occurred on April 14,\n\n2007 when Fairest-Knight, together with his wife and two sons, also\n\nappellees, embarked on a trip to Costa Bonita, located on the\n\nisland of Culebra, approximately twenty miles east of Puerto Rico.\n\nAfter several engine failures, large amounts of smoke began to\n\nemanate from the engine compartment.        Fearing that the boat might\n\nignite, sink and/or explode, the family donned life jackets and\n\nprepared to abandon the vessel.       Fairest-Knight opened the engine\n\ncompartment and the smoke began to dissipate.          The boat was then\n\ntowed back to Puerto del Rey in Fajardo, where the boat has since\n\nremained, unused.      Between May 14 and May 22, 2007, Marine World\n\nperformed repairs to the boat without charge to Fairest-Knight, who\n\nwas   unaware   that   this   work   had   been   completed   until   after\n\nproceedings in this case had begun.\n\n           Between August 2004, when the boat was first delivered to\n\nFairest-Knight, until he last used it in April 2007, Fairest-Knight\n\nincurred expenses totaling $16,139.34 for repairs, $3,195.20 for\n\ntowage and $2,990.00 for wharfage and insurance. During this time,\n\na period of 32 months, the boat was undergoing service or was\n\notherwise unuseable for 276 days, or approximately 9 months.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f          On August 8, 2007, Fairest-Knight filed a complaint\n\nagainst Marine World in the District Court of Puerto Rico, raising\n\nclaims under admiralty law and Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico\n\nCivil Code. After a four-day bench trial, the district court found\n\nthat Marine World \"breached its duty to a workmanlike performance\n\nupon which plaintiffs had a right to rely.\"         The district court\n\nfound that the \"repeated repairs which had to be done to the boat\n\nover an extended period of time\" was evidence of Marine World's\n\nbreach, noting that \"there was a repeated failure to identify the\n\nsource   of    the   engine's   failure   despite   representations   to\n\nplaintiffs that the boat was in a seaworthy condition,\" and that\n\n\"Marine World was the only entity which serviced the boat during\n\nthe period of time at issue.\"      The district court rejected Marine\n\nWorld's theory that Fairest-Knight failed to properly maintain the\n\nboat as not credible, given that the evidence at trial showed that\n\nFairest-Knight \"followed the recommendations made by Marine World\n\nas to replacement of parts and the boat's maintenance,\" and that,\n\ngiven how much time the boat spent in its shop, the onus was on\n\nMarine World to notice and inform Fairest-Knight of any need for\n\nmaintenance.    The district court awarded Fairest-Knight $15,739.96\n\nfor the faulty repairs; $3,195.20 for towage expenses; $2,990 for\n\nstorage and insurance expenses up to June 20, 2007, and $13 per day\n\nthereafter until the entry of judgment; $55,000 to Fairest-Knight\n\nand his family for the negligent infliction of emotional distress\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fand pain and suffering; and costs and attorneys' fees.               Marine\n\nWorld appealed on March 5, 2010.\n\n                               II.    Discussion\n\n              A.   Standard of review\n\n              \"'Where, as here, the district court conducts a bench\n\ntrial   and     serves   as   the    factfinder,   its   determinations   of\n\nnegligence, proximate cause, and similar issues are entitled to\n\nconsiderable deference.'        Specifically, such review is for clear\n\nerror.\"   N. Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Point Judith Marina, LLC, 579 F.3d\n\n61, 67 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting Jackson v. United States, 156 F.3d\n\n230, 232 (1st Cir. 1998)).             A finding qualifies as \"clearly\n\nerroneous\" when our review of the record leaves us \"with the\n\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n\nUnited States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395\n\n(1948).\n\n              B.   Was Marine World liable?\n\n              Marine World contends that the district court erred in\n\nfinding it liable to appellees for having breached its duty to\n\ncarry out the agreed-upon repairs in a workmanlike fashion. Marine\n\nWorld insists that there was insufficient evidence that their\n\nrepairs were the cause of the repeated problems experienced by\n\nappellees' boat.      Fairest-Knight argues that a party does not need\n\nto act negligently to be in breach of the implied warranty, and\n\nthat Marine World's inability to finally resolve the various\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fproblems plaguing his boat shows that it was in breach of its\n\nimplied warranty of workmanlike performance.\n\n           \"[C]ontracts for repairs to a vessel . . . come under the\n\nscope of admiralty jurisdiction.\"          La Esperanza de P.R., Inc. v.\n\nPérez y Cía. de P.R., 124 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1997).          This brings\n\nsuch a case under federal jurisdiction.         See U.S. Const. art. III,\n\n§ 2.   \"Admiralty jurisdiction brings with it a body of federal\n\njurisprudence, largely uncodified, known as maritime law.\" Ballard\n\nShipping Co. v. Beach Shellfish, 32 F.3d 623, 625 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n\"In the absence of a relevant statute, the judicially-developed\n\nnorms of the general maritime law, 'an amalgam of traditional\n\ncommon-law rules, modifications of those rules, and newly created\n\nrules,' governs actions in admiralty.\"          La Esperanza, 124 F.3d at\n\n16 (quoting East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc.,\n\n476 U.S. 858, 865 (1986)).           Although state law may supplement\n\nfederal maritime law when the latter is silent or where a local\n\nmatter is at issue, it \"may not be applied where it would conflict\n\nwith [a federal] maritime law.\"       Floyd v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co., 844\n\nF.2d 1044, 1047 (3d Cir. 1988).\n\n           The   First     Circuit   has   acknowledged   three   potential\n\nsources   of   liability    under    federal   maritime   law   for   a   ship\n\nrepairer's infelicitous work.         These are liability via expressly\n\nassumed contractual obligations, the maritime tort of negligence,\n\nand the \"implied warranty of workmanlike performance that attaches\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fto admiralty contracts under the rule of Ryan Stevedoring Co. v.\n\nPan-Atlantic S.S. Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S. Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133\n\n(1956).\"   La Esperanza, 124 F.3d at 16-17.   The theory of liability\n\nrelevant to this appeal is the latter, the implied warranty of\n\nworkmanlike performance.\n\n           Although   originating     in   disputes   involving     the\n\nindemnification of shipowners, we recognized in La Esperanza that\n\nliability under the implied warranty of workmanlike performance\n\nextends to disputes between shipowners and shipyards.             In La\n\nEsperanza, a shipowner sued a shipyard for negligently damaging the\n\nboat it had been hired to repair.   We affirmed the district court's\n\nfinding that the shipyard was liable for the negligence of its\n\nrepairs, noting that the shipyard's failure to properly complete\n\nthe requisite repairs \"constituted a breach of an express and\n\nimplied contractual obligation, particularly in view of the fact\n\nthat evidence in the record substantiates that similarly situated\n\nship repairers could have\" completed the repairs correctly. Id. at\n\n19.2\n\n           We additionally noted that although the implied warranty\n\nof workmanlike performance does not impose a strict liability\n\nregime on ship repairers, and instead \"parallels\" a negligence\n\n\n2\n   The contract between the shipowner and the shipyard included a\nprovision stating that the shipyard committed \"to use materials and\nexecute work to standard ship repair practice,\" a clause that we\nfound made express \"the otherwise implied warranty of workmanlike\nperformance in marine contracts.\" La Esperanza, 124 F.3d at 18-19.\n\n                                -9-\n\fstandard, nevertheless, a shipowner could recover for a breach of\n\nthe    implied    warranty       of    workmanlike           service      even    when    \"such\n\nperformance was done without negligence.\"                          Id. at 17 (quoting SS\n\nAmazonia v. N.J. Export Marine Carpenters, Inc., 564 F.2d 5, 8 (2d\n\nCir.    1977));     see    also       Feliciano        v.     Compañía         Transatlántica\n\nEspañola, S.A., 411 F.2d 976, 978 (1st Cir. 1969) (noting that the\n\nimplied warranty cause of action acknowledged in Ryan was based\n\nneither    on     negligence      or        unseaworthiness,             but   \"is   strictly\n\ncontractual in nature, existing independently of tort.\"). However,\n\nLa Esperanza did not reduce or eliminate a plaintiff's burden of\n\nproving that the defendant's conduct caused his injury.                                  See SS\n\nAmazonia, 564 F.2d at 8 (stating that recovery under a breach of an\n\nimplied warranty of workmanlike performance claim requires showing\n\nthat the sub-standard work performed \"caused the damage claimed\").\n\n            For starters, although recovery for breach of implied\n\nwarranty does not invariably require proof of negligence, the\n\nimplied   warranty        does    not       go    so   far    as    to    \"impos[e]      strict\n\nliability.\"      La Esperanza, 124 F.3d at 17.                     But in this regard, it\n\nis surely notable that even claims of unseaworthiness, which do\n\n\"impose a strict liability regime upon shipowners,\" Napier v. F/V\n\nDEESIE,   Inc.,     454    F.3d       61,    68    (1st      Cir.    2006),      require    the\n\nplaintiff to show that the defendant's conduct was the proximate\n\ncause of his injury.         In other words, even the \"absolute duty [of]\n\nshipowners to furnish a 'seaworthy' ship\" is limited to those\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\finjuries \"caused by any defect in a vessel or its appurtenant\n\nappliances or equipment.\"    Id. at 67-68 (emphasis added); see also\n\nPoulis-Minott v. Smith, 388 F.3d 354, 366 (1st Cir. 2004); Ferrara\n\nv. A. & V. Fishing, Inc., 99 F.3d 449, 453 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nBecause La Esperanza acknowledged liability under a theory of a\n\nbreach of an implied warranty to be more limited than strict\n\nliability, and because strict liability claims (in the form of\n\nclaims of unseaworthiness) themselves require proof of causation,\n\nit stands to reason that La Esperanza did not absolve parties\n\nclaiming breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike service from\n\nproving that the alleged breach caused their injury.              Causation\n\nmust be established by a preponderance of the evidence.                  See\n\nMarquette Trans. Co., Inc. v. La. Mach. Co., Inc., 367 F.3d 398,\n\n402 (5th Cir. 2004).3\n\n          Moreover,     although   in     La   Esperanza   we   stated   that\n\n\"[h]ere, one witnesses a ship that came in for repairs under her\n\nown power . . . but somewhere, somehow, something went wrong,\" 124\n\nF.3d at 18, a substantial portion of the opinion in La Esperanza\n\n\n3\n    The appellees contended at oral argument that Marquette is\ninapplicable in light of our opinion in La Esperanza.            We\nacknowledge that Marquette is in tension with La Esperanza insofar\nas it suggests that plaintiffs pursuing a breach of an implied\nwarranty claim must show negligence, see Marquette, 367 F.3d at 402\n(\"[T]he evidence available must be sufficient to find both\nnegligence and causation.\" (emphasis modified)). However, whatever\nmay be the case with proof of negligence in implied warranty cases,\nproof of causation remains indispensable, and on that score we\nagree with Marquette's description of the applicable burden of\nproof.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fwas in fact devoted to explaining how the shipyard's performance --\n\nits unsuited method of removing the existing hull plates, its\n\nequally unsuited method of patching the holes it thereby created,\n\nand the careless way in which the boat was subsequently stored --\n\nhad caused significant damage to the ship's hull, electrical\n\nsystem, upper deck and carpeting.          See La Esperanza, 124 F.3d at\n\n14-15,   17-19.    The   shipyard    also      never   fully    completed    the\n\ncontracted-for repairs and, \"seeking to extricate itself from a\n\npredicament   of   its   own   making      .   .   .   told    the   shipowner,\n\nessentially, that it . . . had a problem on its hands, and maybe it\n\nshould consider hiring a special welding consultant.\"                Id.   at 18.\n\nRather than mere speculation, in other words, there was quite\n\nsubstantial evidence that the shipyard's conduct had caused the\n\ndamage to the plaintiff's vessel.\n\n           By the same token, our observation that where a shipyard\n\nrepresents itself as being \"a competent shipyard skilled in doing\n\nthe type of work requested by the shipowner,\" then the latter has\n\n\"a right to rely on the [shipyard's] expertise\" and may \"expect a\n\nstable seaworthy vessel upon completion of the repairs, regardless\n\nof the condition of the boat[] prior to repairs,\"               La Esperanza,\n\n124 F.3d at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted), should not be\n\nread -- as appellees appear to suggest -- to hold that once a\n\nshipyard has undertaken to repair a boat, any subsequent breakdowns\n\nor problems may, without more, be presumed to have been caused by\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fthe shipyard.      The facts in La Esperanza clearly indicated that it\n\nwas the shipyard's inability and/or unwillingness to properly\n\ncomplete the work it had specifically contracted to do that had\n\ncaused the damage to the ship, which bolstered the finding of\n\nliability.\n\n            In light of these observations, the fact that neither the\n\nappellees    nor    the   district   court   were   able   to   provide   an\n\nexplanation as to how the chronic problems with the boat were the\n\nresult of Marine World's acts or omissions takes on dispositive\n\nsalience.4 In supporting its liability determination, the district\n\ncourt stated that\n\n            [e]vidence of the breach of Marine World are\n            the repeated repairs which had to be done to\n            the boat over an extended period of time . . .\n            there was a repeated failure to identify the\n            source of the engine's failure . . . Marine\n            World was the only entity which serviced the\n            boat during the period of time at issue. . . .\n            The best evidence that the repairs to the boat\n            by Marine World were faulty are the invoices\n            which show the boat could not be used for its\n\n\n4\n  Appellees emphasize that the inspection of the boat commissioned\nby Marine World did not include any test of the engine.         The\ninspection report clearly stated that the engine had not been\ntested, Fairest was apparently aware of the certification at the\ntime of purchase, and the purchase agreement explicitly specifies\nthat the boat was being sold \"as is\" -- meaning, as Fairest\nconceded at trial, that \"there was not an expressed or implied\nwarranty for [the] boat.\" We see no reason, on these facts, to\nconstrue the incomplete inspection as a breach of the implied\nwarranty of workmanlike performance. See N. Ins. Co. of N.Y., 579\nF.3d at 67-68. In any case, the basis for this lawsuit is whether\nMarine World breached their duty of providing workmanlike\nperformance in repairing the boat, not whether they improperly sold\nappellee a boat that had not been fully tested.\n\n                                     -13-\n\f          intended use over extended periods of time\n          because the boat was being repaired for\n          multiple malfunctions.\n\n          We cannot agree.     The fact that multiple repairs were\n\nrequired, without more, cannot be taken to establish that it was\n\nMarine World's unworkmanlike conduct that brought about the need\n\nfor the repairs.   In other words, if the hypothesis is that Marine\n\nWorld's unworkmanlike performance caused the need for the repeated\n\nrepairs, then the fact that the repairs were required cannot itself\n\nbe adduced as evidence supporting that hypothesis -- it is what\n\nneeds explaining, and so cannot, on pain of circularity, be what\n\ndoes the explaining.5    From what we are able to ascertain in the\n\nrecord, Marine World was generally able to diagnose and repair each\n\nproblem as it arose.6   Fairest-Knight conceded at trial that he had\n\nno evidence of sub-standard performance by Marine World.         No\n\nevidence was introduced that Marine World employed improper repair\n\nprocedures or used sub-standard parts, nor is there any evidence\n\nthat Marine World at any point mis-diagnosed the specific problem\n\nreported by Fairest-Knight.   There is no evidence that it was poor\n\nwork by Marine World rather than poor design, poor manufacture,\n\n\n\n5\n    Why does opium make men drowsy?      Because it possesses a\ndormitive power. (With apologies to Molière, Le Malade Imaginaire\n(1673), Act III, scene iii.)\n6\n    Appellees note that Marine World incorrectly diagnosed the\nsource of an oil leak in January, 2005. It is undisputed, however,\nthat Marine World made the correct repair after discovering the\nactual cause of the leak.\n\n                                -14-\n\fpoor   maintenance     or    abuse   by    the   boat's   previous     owner,   or\n\nsomething else -- including the appellee's admitted inexperience\n\nwith boat ownership -- that caused the boat's various problems. We\n\nhave no basis on which to even speculate as to whether the same\n\nseries of problems would have arisen had Fairest-Knight brought the\n\nboat to a different shipyard for repairs.                See La Esperanza, 124\n\nF.3d at 19.\n\n           Although circumstantial evidence may in some cases be\n\nused to establish causation, the circumstances must nevertheless\n\nallow for a \"strong inference[]\" of causation.                 See Marquette, 367\n\nF.3d at 402, 404.           Exclusivity of control or possession is an\n\nimportant factor in supporting this inference. Id. at 404; N. Ins.\n\nCo. of N.Y., 579 F.3d at 69-70 (where defendant marina did not have\n\nexclusive possession of the boat, no presumption of fault would\n\napply.)        In this case, we note that possession of the boat\n\nalternated between Fairest-Knight and Marine World during the\n\nrelevant time period, and that Fairest-Knight made use of the boat,\n\neven if not always successfully, on multiple occasions.                 Fairest-\n\nKnight claims that between the time the boat was delivered and the\n\nfinal April 14, 2007 incident, the boat spent 276 days \"in repairs,\n\nundergoing service, or simply not working.\"                Assuming this to be\n\naccurate, we can infer that during this time the boat spent nearly\n\n700    days,    or   approximately        23   months,    in    Fairest-Knight's\n\npossession.      This makes it difficult to say that it is more likely\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fthan not that the problems with Fairest-Knight's boat were caused\n\nby Marine World, which did not even have possession of the boat for\n\nthe majority of the time in question.         See id. at 70 (describing\n\nowner's presence on the boat several days before its sinking, his\n\nhiring of an independent mechanic, and his implied permission to\n\nhis friends to access the boat without prior approval as \"the kind\n\nof   activity   which,   through   its    interference   with   [defendant\n\nmarina's] control over the boat, would cast doubt on the fairness\n\nof presuming that [defendant marina] was responsible [for the\n\nboat's sinking]\").\n\n           The appellees insist that their inability to identify the\n\ncause of the boat's problems should not defeat their claim.          They\n\ncite Ryan for the proposition that a \"contractor, as the warrantor\n\nof its own services, cannot use the shipowner's failure to discover\n\nand correct the contractor's own breach of warranty as a defense.\"\n\nRyan, 350 U.S. at 134-35.    The appellees' reliance on Ryan might be\n\nmore convincing if it had already been established that Marine\n\nWorld's conduct was the cause of their injury.       After all, in Ryan\n\nthe Supreme Court acknowledged liability premised on breach of an\n\nimplied warranty of workmanlike service provided that said breach\n\nhad caused the complained-of injury.         See Ryan, 350 U.S. at 132\n\n(\"The other question is whether . . . a stevedoring contractor is\n\nobligated to reimburse a shipowner for damages caused it by the\n\ncontractor's improper stowage of cargo.\" (emphasis added)). It was\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fin this context that the Supreme Court rejected the stevedoring\n\ncontractor's argument that \"because the shipowner had an obligation\n\nto supervise the stowage and had a right to reject unsafe stowage\n\nof   the    cargo,\"      its    failure   to    object    prior   to    the   accident\n\nextinguished its right to indemnification from the shipowner.                       Id.\n\nat 134.     There was, in this context, no question as to whether the\n\ncontractor's acts or omissions had caused the injury.                         But that\n\nquestion lies at the heart of this case, and nothing in Ryan\n\nsuggests that the appellees may avoid having to answer it.\n\n                 In short, absent sufficient proof of causation, the\n\ntroubles experienced by Fairest-Knight with his boat -- while\n\nundeniably frustrating -- do not make out a viable breach of\n\nwarranty claim.         We therefore hold that the district court clearly\n\nerred in finding otherwise, and reverse its finding that appellants\n\nbreached the implied warranty of workmanlike service.\n\n                 C.   Damages\n\n                 The appellees claimed damages both under admiralty law\n\nand Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, 31 L.P.R.A. § 5141.\n\nThe district court, exercising pendent jurisdiction over the state\n\nlaw claim, cited Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code as the\n\nbasis      for    its   award    of   damages    for     negligent     infliction   of\n\nemotional distress and pain and suffering.7                 This statute provides\n\n\n7\n   It is possible that federal maritime law would preclude the\nappellees' state law cause of action for the negligent infliction\nof emotional distress. State law may supplement maritime law when\n\n                                          -17-\n\fthat \"[a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to another\n\nthrough fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage\n\nso done.\"   31 L.P.R.A. § 5141 (emphasis added).   Causation is thus\n\nclearly an element under Article 1802. See Santini Rivera v. Serv.\n\nAir, Inc., 137 D.P.R. 1, 1994 JTS 121, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,527, slip\n\nop. at 10 (P.R. 1994); Marital Cmty. k/a Luz M. Hernández and\n\nEdgardo López Flores v. González Padín Co., Inc., 117 D.P.R. 94, 17\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 111, slip op. at 125 (P.R. 1986).         Because\n\nappellees failed to establish that Marine World was the cause of\n\nthe boat's chronic problems, there was no basis for an award of\n\ndamages under either the admiralty or Article 1802 claims.\n\n                          III.   Conclusion\n\n            We take it as clearly settled that shipowners may only\n\nrecover from ship repairers under an implied warranty theory if the\n\nalleged breach is shown to have caused the plaintiff's injury.\n\n\nmaritime law is silent or where a local matter is at issue. See\nFloyd v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co., 844 F.2d 1044, 1047 (3d Cir. 1988).\nHowever, \"state law may not be applied where it would conflict with\n[a federal] maritime law.\"    Id. at 1047; see also Askew v. Am.\nWaterways Operators, Inc., 411 U.S. 325, 341 (1973). A maritime\ntort of negligent infliction of emotional distress has been\nrecognized in the Ninth Circuit; see Chan v. Society Expeditions,\nInc., 39 F.3d 1398 (9th Cir. 1994). The First Circuit has not yet\ndefinitively addressed this question. See, e.g. Peemoller Sultan\nv. Pleasure Craft Contender 25, 139 F. Supp. 2d 230, 234 (D.P.R.\n2001); Ellenwood v. Exxon Shipping Co., 984 F.2d 1270, 1282-83\n(1st Cir. 1993) (declining to decide whether \"a seaman may recover\nemotional distress damages without showing a physical injury.\").\nWe decline to decide this question, as it is apparent that\nappellees' failure to show causation dooms their claim, regardless\nof whether it is brought under the auspices of federal maritime or\nstate law.\n\n                                 -18-\n\fAppellees failed to prove that appellant's conduct caused their\n\ninjury.   Accordingly, the district court's finding of liability is\n\nreversed, and its award of damages and attorneys' fees in favor of\n\nappellees is vacated.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f",

Background and prior proceedings</h2>\n<p>Appellant Marine World Distributors, Inc. (\"Marine World\") does business in the sale, service and repair of marine vessels, with its principal offices in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 2004, Marine World offered for sale a previously owned twenty-six foot 2001 Bayliner Ciera 2655 motorboat (the \"boat\"). On March 29, 2004, Mr. Carlos Suárez, a certified marine surveyor, inspected and appraised the boat, noting that the engine could not be tested because no cooling water was available. Nevertheless, Suárez concluded that the boat was good for intended cruising around Puerto Rico and coastal waters. On August 13, 2004, Appellee Richard S. Fairest-Knight (\"Fairest-Knight\") purchased the boat from Marine World for $38,000.<sup>[1]</sup> Fairest-Knight had no previous boating experience, and this was his first boat purchase. The boat was purchased \"as is,\" as expressly provided in the Sales Order, and Fairest-Knight was aware that no express or implied warranty resulted from Marine World's sale of the boat. Fairest-Knight insured the boat and contracted with a company that provides emergency towing assistance.</p>\n<p>While operating the boat on January 22, 2005, approximately five months after he purchased it, Fairest-Knight observed that the boat's oil alarm was triggered and that oil had drained from the engine into the motor compartment. On January 27, 2005, Marine World inspected the engine, and on February 8, 2005, it performed the work necessary to correct the oil leakage, as authorized by Fairest-Knight. This incident would become one in a series of periodic breakdowns and other problems with the boat over the next several years. On each occasion, Fairest-Knight would bring the boat back to Marine World to be repaired, at which point Marine World would inspect the problem, tender a diagnosis and perform the indicated repairs. Marine World frequently performed sea trials to confirm that the problem had been corrected. No other person or entity serviced the boat during this time. Over the years, the repairs performed by Marine World included the following:</p>\n<blockquote>a) cleaning the engine room and replacing the oil sender thread, oil sensor and various other corroded fittings (February 8, 2005);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b) performing a tune up, replacing the impeller, and sanding and painting pulleys (June 6, 2005);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>c) replacing the sea water pump and serpentine belt (August 23, 2005);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>d) removing the engine, disassembling the manifolds and elbows, starter, engine points, power steering pump, and pulleys, as well as cleaning and painting those parts and the oil pan, followed by a sea trial (October 26, 2005);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>e) installing a missing power steering pump bracket (November 19, 2005);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>f) reconnecting GPS terminals, performing a tune up, and conducting a sea trial (May 17, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> g) replacing the electric fuel pump, cleaning the carburetor, and conducting a sea trial (May 27, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>h) conducting a sea trial (June 5, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>i) removing and charging the batteries (August 10, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>j) replacing the fuel tank vent (August 12, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>k) conducting a sea trial (August 15, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>l) replacing the fuel pick-up assembly (August 30, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>m) overhauling the engine, replacing the manifolds and elbows, and conducting a sea trial (November 6, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>n) replacing the exhaust flappers (December 13, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>o) replacing the engine longblock (February 15, 2007);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>p) replacing the impeller kit and flappers (May 14, 2007).</blockquote>\n<p>Despite these repairs, Fairest-Knight experienced repeated malfunctions while using the boat, often involving complete engine failures that required towing the boat back to port.</p>\n<p>The culmination of these incidents occurred on April 14, 2007 when Fairest-Knight, together with his wife and two sons, also appellees, embarked on a trip to Costa Bonita, located on the island of Culebra, approximately twenty miles east of Puerto Rico. After several engine failures, large amounts of smoke began to emanate from the engine compartment. Fearing that the boat might ignite, sink and/or explode, the family donned life jackets and prepared to abandon the vessel. Fairest-Knight opened the engine compartment and the smoke began to dissipate. The boat was then towed back to Puerto del Rey in Fajardo, where the boat has since remained, unused. Between May 14 and May 22, 2007, Marine World performed repairs to the boat without charge to Fairest-Knight, who was unaware that this work had been completed until after proceedings in this case had begun.</p>\n<p>Between August 2004, when the boat was first delivered to Fairest-Knight, until he last used it in April 2007, Fairest-Knight incurred expenses totaling $16,139.34 for repairs, $3,195.20 for towage and $2,990.00 for wharfage and insurance. During this time, a period of 32 months, the boat was undergoing service or was otherwise unuseable for 276 days, or approximately 9 months.</p>\n<p>On August 8, 2007, Fairest-Knight filed a complaint against Marine World in the District Court of Puerto Rico, raising claims under admiralty law and Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code. After a four-day bench trial, the district court found that Marine World \"breached its duty to a workmanlike performance upon which plaintiffs had a right to rely.\" The district court found that the \"repeated repairs which had to be done to the boat over an extended period of time\" was evidence of Marine World's breach, noting that \"there was a repeated failure to identify the source of the engine's failure despite representations to plaintiffs that the boat was in a seaworthy condition,\" and that \"Marine World was the only entity which serviced the boat during the period of time at issue.\" The district court rejected Marine World's theory that Fairest-Knight failed to properly maintain the boat as not credible, given that the evidence at trial showed that Fairest-Knight \"followed the recommendations made by Marine World as to replacement of parts and the boat's maintenance,\" and that, given how much time the boat spent in its shop, the onus was on Marine World to notice and inform Fairest-Knight of any need for maintenance. The district court awarded Fairest-Knight $15,739.96 for the faulty repairs; $3,195.20 for towage expenses; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> $2,990 for storage and insurance expenses up to June 20, 2007, and $13 per day thereafter until the entry of judgment; $55,000 to Fairest-Knight and his family for the negligent infliction of emotional distress and pain and suffering; and costs and attorneys' fees. Marine World appealed on March 5, 2010.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of review</h2>\n<p>\"`Where, as here, the district court conducts a bench trial and serves as the factfinder, its determinations of negligence, proximate cause, and similar issues are entitled to considerable deference.' Specifically, such review is for clear error.\" <i>N. Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Point Judith Marina, LLC,</i> 579 F.3d 61, 67 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>Jackson v. United States,</i> 156 F.3d 230, 232 (1st Cir.1998)). A finding qualifies as \"clearly erroneous\" when our review of the record leaves us \"with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" <i>United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,</i> 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Was Marine World liable?</h2>\n<p>Marine World contends that the district court erred in finding it liable to appellees for having breached its duty to carry out the agreed-upon repairs in a workmanlike fashion. Marine World insists that there was insufficient evidence that their repairs were the cause of the repeated problems experienced by appellees' boat. Fairest-Knight argues that a party does not need to act negligently to be in breach of the implied warranty, and that Marine World's inability to finally resolve the various problems plaguing his boat shows that it was in breach of its implied warranty of workmanlike performance.</p>\n<p>\"[C]ontracts for repairs to a vessel... come under the scope of admiralty jurisdiction.\" <i>La Esperanza de P.R., Inc. v. Pérez y Cía. de P.R.,</i> 124 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1997). This brings such a case under federal jurisdiction. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. art. III, § 2. \"Admiralty jurisdiction brings with it a body of federal jurisprudence, largely uncodified, known as maritime law.\" <i>Ballard Shipping Co. v. Beach Shellfish,</i> 32 F.3d 623, 625 (1st Cir.1994). \"In the absence of a relevant statute, the judicially-developed norms of the general maritime law, `an amalgam of traditional common-law rules, modifications of those rules, and newly created rules,' governs actions in admiralty.\" <i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 16 (quoting <i>East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc.,</i> 476 U.S. 858, 865, 106 S.Ct. 2295, 90 L.Ed.2d 865 (1986)). Although state law may supplement federal maritime law when the latter is silent or where a local matter is at issue, it \"may not be applied where it would conflict with [a federal] maritime law.\" <i>Floyd v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co.,</i> 844 F.2d 1044, 1047 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p>The First Circuit has acknowledged three potential sources of liability under federal maritime law for a ship repairer's infelicitous work. These are liability via expressly assumed contractual obligations, the maritime tort of negligence, and the \"implied warranty of workmanlike performance that attaches to admiralty contracts under the rule of <i>Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S.S. Corp.,</i> 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956).\" <i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 16-17. The theory of liability relevant to this appeal is the latter, the implied warranty of workmanlike performance.</p>\n<p>Although originating in disputes involving the indemnification of shipowners, we recognized in <i>La Esperanza</i> that liability under the implied warranty of workman-like <span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> performance extends to disputes between shipowners and shipyards. In <i>La Esperanza,</i> a shipowner sued a shipyard for negligently damaging the boat it had been hired to repair. We affirmed the district court's finding that the shipyard was liable for the negligence of its repairs, noting that the shipyard's failure to properly complete the requisite repairs \"constituted a breach of an express and implied contractual obligation, particularly in view of the fact that evidence in the record substantiates that similarly situated ship repairers could have\" completed the repairs correctly. <i>Id.</i> at 19.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>We additionally noted that although the implied warranty of workmanlike performance does not impose a strict liability regime on ship repairers, and instead \"parallels\" a negligence standard, nevertheless, a shipowner could recover for a breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service even when \"such performance was done without negligence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 17 (quoting <i>SS Amazonia v. N.J. Export Marine Carpenters, Inc.,</i> 564 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir.1977)); <i>see also </i><i>Feliciano v. Compañía Transatlántica Española, S.A.,</i> 411 F.2d 976, 978 (1st Cir.1969) (noting that the implied warranty cause of action acknowledged in <i>Ryan</i> was based neither on negligence or unseaworthiness, but \"is strictly contractual in nature, existing independently of tort.\"). However, <i>La Esperanza</i> did not reduce or eliminate a plaintiff's burden of proving that the defendant's conduct caused his injury. <i>See </i><i>SS Amazonia,</i> 564 F.2d at 8 (stating that recovery under a breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike performance claim requires showing that the sub-standard work performed \"caused the damage claimed\").</p>\n<p>For starters, although recovery for breach of implied warranty does not invariably require proof of negligence, the implied warranty does not go so far as to \"impos[e] strict liability.\" <i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 17. But in this regard, it is surely notable that even claims of unseaworthiness, which <i>do</i> \"impose a strict liability regime upon shipowners,\" <i>Napier v. F/V DEESIE, Inc.,</i> 454 F.3d 61, 68 (1st Cir.2006), require the plaintiff to show that the defendant's conduct was the proximate cause of his injury. In other words, even the \"absolute duty [of] shipowners to furnish a `seaworthy' ship\" is limited to those injuries <i>\"caused by</i> any defect in a vessel or its appurtenant appliances or equipment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 67-68 (emphasis added); <i>see also </i><i>Poulis-Minott v. Smith,</i> 388 F.3d 354, 366 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Ferrara v. A. &amp; V. Fishing, Inc.,</i> 99 F.3d 449, 453 (1st Cir.1996). Because <i>La Esperanza</i> acknowledged liability under a theory of a breach of an implied warranty to be more limited than strict liability, and because strict liability claims (in the form of claims of unseaworthiness) themselves require proof of causation, it stands to reason that <i>La Esperanza</i> did not absolve parties claiming breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike service from proving that the alleged breach caused their injury. Causation must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See </i><i>Marquette Trans. Co., Inc. v. La. Mach. Co., Inc.,</i> 367 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.2004).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> Moreover, although in <i>La Esperanza</i> we stated that \"[h]ere, one witnesses a ship that came in for repairs under her own power ... but somewhere, somehow, something went wrong,\" 124 F.3d at 18, a substantial portion of the opinion in <i>La Esperanza</i> was in fact devoted to explaining how the shipyard's performance  its unsuited method of removing the existing hull plates, its equally unsuited method of patching the holes it thereby created, and the careless way in which the boat was subsequently stored  had caused significant damage to the ship's hull, electrical system, upper deck and carpeting. <i>See </i><i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 14-15, 17-19. The shipyard also never fully completed the contracted-for repairs and, \"seeking to extricate itself from a predicament of its own making ... told the shipowner, essentially, that it ... had a problem on its hands, and maybe it should consider hiring a special welding consultant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 18. Rather than mere speculation, in other words, there was quite substantial evidence that the shipyard's conduct had caused the damage to the plaintiff's vessel.</p>\n<p>By the same token, our observation that where a shipyard represents itself as being \"a competent shipyard skilled in doing the type of work requested by the shipowner,\" then the latter has \"a right to rely on the [shipyard's] expertise\" and may \"expect a stable seaworthy vessel upon completion of the repairs, regardless of the condition of the boat[] prior to repairs,\" <i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted), should not be read  as appellees appear to suggest  to hold that once a shipyard has undertaken to repair a boat, any subsequent breakdowns or problems may, without more, be presumed to have been caused by the shipyard. The facts in <i>La Esperanza</i> clearly indicated that it was the shipyard's inability and/or unwillingness to properly complete the work it had specifically contracted to do that had caused the damage to the ship, which bolstered the finding of liability.</p>\n<p>In light of these observations, the fact that neither the appellees nor the district court were able to provide an explanation as to how the chronic problems with the boat were the result of Marine World's acts or omissions takes on dispositive salience.<sup>[4]</sup> In supporting its liability determination, the district court stated that</p>\n<blockquote>[e]vidence of the breach of Marine World are the repeated repairs which had to be done to the boat over an extended period of time ... there was a repeated failure to identify the source of the engine's failure ... Marine World <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> was the only entity which serviced the boat during the period of time at issue.... The best evidence that the repairs to the boat by Marine World were faulty are the invoices which show the boat could not be used for its intended use over extended periods of time because the boat was being repaired for multiple malfunctions.</blockquote>\n<p>We cannot agree. The fact that multiple repairs were required, without more, cannot be taken to establish that it was Marine World's unworkmanlike conduct that brought about the need for the repairs. In other words, if the hypothesis is that Marine World's unworkmanlike performance caused the need for the repeated repairs, then the fact that the repairs were required cannot itself be adduced as evidence supporting that hypothesis  it is what <i>needs</i> explaining, and so cannot, on pain of circularity, be what <i>does</i> the explaining.<sup>[5]</sup> From what we are able to ascertain in the record, Marine World was generally able to diagnose and repair each problem as it arose.<sup>[6]</sup> Fairest-Knight conceded at trial that he had no evidence of sub-standard performance by Marine World. No evidence was introduced that Marine World employed improper repair procedures or used sub-standard parts, nor is there any evidence that Marine World at any point mis-diagnosed the specific problem reported by Fairest-Knight. There is no evidence that it was poor work by Marine World rather than poor design, poor manufacture, poor maintenance or abuse by the boat's previous owner, or something else  including the appellee's admitted inexperience with boat ownership  that caused the boat's various problems. We have no basis on which to even speculate as to whether the same series of problems would have arisen had Fairest-Knight brought the boat to a different shipyard for repairs. <i>See </i><i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 19.</p>\n<p>Although circumstantial evidence may in some cases be used to establish causation, the circumstances must nevertheless allow for a \"strong inference[]\" of causation. <i>See </i><i>Marquette,</i> 367 F.3d at 402, 404. Exclusivity of control or possession is an important factor in supporting this inference. <i>Id.</i> at 404; <i>N. Ins. Co. of N.Y.,</i> 579 F.3d at 69-70 (where defendant marina did not have exclusive possession of the boat, no presumption of fault would apply.) In this case, we note that possession of the boat alternated between Fairest-Knight and Marine World during the relevant time period, and that Fairest-Knight made use of the boat, even if not always successfully, on multiple occasions. Fairest-Knight claims that between the time the boat was delivered and the final April 14, 2007 incident, the boat spent 276 days \"in repairs, undergoing service, or simply not working.\" Assuming this to be accurate, we can infer that during this time the boat spent nearly 700 days, or approximately 23 months, in Fairest-Knight's possession. This makes it difficult to say that it is more likely than not that the problems with Fairest-Knight's boat were caused by Marine World, which did not even have possession of the boat for the majority of the time in question. <i>See id.</i> at 70 (describing owner's presence on the boat several days before its sinking, his hiring of an independent mechanic, and his implied permission to his friends to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> access the boat without prior approval as \"the kind of activity which, through its interference with [defendant marina's] control over the boat, would cast doubt on the fairness of presuming that [defendant marina] was responsible [for the boat's sinking]\").</p>\n<p>The appellees insist that their inability to identify the cause of the boat's problems should not defeat their claim. They cite <i>Ryan</i> for the proposition that a \"contractor, as the warrantor of its own services, cannot use the shipowner's failure to discover and correct the contractor's own breach of warranty as a defense.\" <i>Ryan,</i> 350 U.S. at 134-35, 76 S.Ct. 232. The appellees' reliance on <i>Ryan</i> might be more convincing if it had already been established that Marine World's conduct was the cause of their injury. After all, in <i>Ryan</i> the Supreme Court acknowledged liability premised on breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike service <i>provided</i> that said breach had caused the complained-of injury. <i>See </i><i>Ryan,</i> 350 U.S. at 132, 76 S.Ct. 232 (\"The other question is whether ... a stevedoring contractor is obligated to reimburse a shipowner for damages <i>caused it</i> by the contractor's improper stowage of cargo.\" (emphasis added)). It was in this context that the Supreme Court rejected the stevedoring contractor's argument that \"because the shipowner had an obligation to supervise the stowage and had a right to reject unsafe stowage of the cargo,\" its failure to object prior to the accident extinguished its right to indemnification from the shipowner. <i>Id.</i> at 134, 76 S.Ct. 232. There was, in this context, no question as to whether the contractor's acts or omissions had caused the injury. But that question lies at the heart of this case, and nothing in <i>Ryan</i> suggests that the appellees may avoid having to answer it.</p>\n<p>In short, absent sufficient proof of causation, the troubles experienced by Fairest-Knight with his boat  while undeniably frustrating  do not make out a viable breach of warranty claim. We therefore hold that the district court clearly erred in finding otherwise, and reverse its finding that appellants breached the implied warranty of workmanlike service.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Damages</h2>\n<p>The appellees claimed damages both under admiralty law and Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, 31 L.P.R.A. § 5141. The district court, exercising pendent jurisdiction over the state law claim, cited Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code as the basis for its award of damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress and pain and suffering.<sup>[7]</sup> This statute provides that \"[a] person who by an act or omission <i>causes</i> damage to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" 31 L.P.R.A. § 5141 (emphasis added). Causation is thus clearly an element under Article 1802. <i>See </i><i>Santini Rivera v. Serv. Air, Inc.,</i> 137 D.P.R. 1, 1994 JTS 121, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,527, slip op. at 10, 1994 WL 909527 (P.R.1994); <i>Marital Cmty. k/a Luz M. Hernández and Edgardo López Flores v. González Padín Co., Inc.,</i> 117 D.P.R. 94, 17 P.R. Offic. Trans. 111, slip op. at 125, 1986 WL 376809 (P.R.1986). Because appellees failed to establish that Marine World was the cause of the boat's chronic problems, there was no basis for an award of damages under either the admiralty or Article 1802 claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We take it as clearly settled that shipowners may only recover from ship repairers under an implied warranty theory if the alleged breach is shown to have caused the plaintiff's injury. Appellees failed to prove that appellant's conduct caused their injury. Accordingly, the district court's finding of liability is reversed, and its award of damages and attorneys' fees in favor of appellees is vacated.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Fairest-Knight's complaint lists the purchase price as $39,075, whereas the bill of sale lists $38,000. The correct figure is not material to this dispute.</p>\n<p>[2]  The contract between the shipowner and the shipyard included a provision stating that the shipyard committed \"to use materials and execute work to standard ship repair practice,\" a clause that we found made express \"the otherwise implied warranty of workman-like performance in marine contracts.\" <i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 18-19.</p>\n<p>[3]  The appellees contended at oral argument that <i>Marquette</i> is inapplicable in light of our opinion in <i>La Esperanza.</i> We acknowledge that <i>Marquette</i> is in tension with <i>La Esperanza</i> insofar as it suggests that plaintiffs pursuing a breach of an implied warranty claim <i>must</i> show negligence, <i>see </i><i>Marquette,</i> 367 F.3d at 402 (\"[T]he evidence available must be sufficient to find <i>both</i> negligence <i>and</i> causation.\" (emphasis modified)). However, whatever may be the case with proof of negligence in implied warranty cases, proof of causation remains indispensable, and on that score we agree with <i>Marquette</i>'s description of the applicable burden of proof.</p>\n<p>[4]  Appellees emphasize that the inspection of the boat commissioned by Marine World did not include any test of the engine. The inspection report clearly stated that the engine had not been tested, Fairest was apparently aware of the certification at the time of purchase, and the purchase agreement explicitly specifies that the boat was being sold \"as is\"  meaning, as Fairest conceded at trial, that \"there was not an expressed or implied warranty for [the] boat.\" We see no reason, on these facts, to construe the incomplete inspection as a breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike performance. <i>See </i><i>N. Ins. Co. of N.Y.,</i> 579 F.3d at 67-68. In any case, the basis for this lawsuit is whether Marine World breached their duty of providing workmanlike performance in repairing the boat, not whether they improperly sold appellee a boat that had not been fully tested.</p>\n<p>[5]  Why does opium make men drowsy? Because it possesses a dormitive power. (With apologies to Molière, <i>Le Malade Imaginaire</i> (1673), Act III, scene iii.)</p>\n<p>[6]  Appellees note that Marine World incorrectly diagnosed the source of an oil leak in January, 2005. It is undisputed, however, that Marine World made the correct repair after discovering the actual cause of the leak.</p>\n<p>[7]  It is possible that federal maritime law would preclude the appellees' state law cause of action for the negligent infliction of emotional distress. State law may supplement maritime law when maritime law is silent or where a local matter is at issue. <i>See </i><i>Floyd v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co.,</i> 844 F.2d 1044, 1047 (3d Cir.1988). However, \"state law may not be applied where it would conflict with [a federal] maritime law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1047; <i>see also </i><i>Askew v. Am. Waterways Operators, Inc.,</i> 411 U.S. 325, 341, 93 S.Ct. 1590, 36 L.Ed.2d 280 (1973). A maritime tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress has been recognized in the Ninth Circuit; <i>see </i><i>Chan v. Society Expeditions, Inc.,</i> 39 F.3d 1398 (9th Cir.1994). The First Circuit has not yet definitively addressed this question. <i>See, e.g. </i><i>Peemoller Sultan v. Pleasure Craft Contender 25,</i> 139 F.Supp.2d 230, 234 (D.P.R.2001); <i>Ellenwood v. Exxon Shipping Co.,</i> 984 F.2d 1270, 1282-83 (1st Cir.1993) (declining to decide whether \"a seaman may recover emotional distress damages without showing a physical injury.\"). We decline to decide this question, as it is apparent that appellees' failure to show causation dooms their claim, regardless of whether it is brought under the auspices of federal maritime or state law.</p>\n\n</div>",

Background and prior proceedings</h2>\n<p>Appellant Marine World Distributors, Inc. (\"Marine World\") does business in the sale, service and repair of marine vessels, with its principal offices in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 2004, Marine World offered for sale a previously owned twenty-six foot 2001 Bayliner Ciera 2655 motorboat (the \"boat\"). On March 29, 2004, Mr. Carlos Suárez, a certified marine surveyor, inspected and appraised the boat, noting that the engine could not be tested because no cooling water was available. Nevertheless, Suárez concluded that the boat was good for intended cruising around Puerto Rico and coastal waters. On August 13, 2004, Appellee Richard S. Fairest-Knight (\"Fairest-Knight\") purchased the boat from Marine World for $38,000.<sup>[1]</sup> Fairest-Knight had no previous boating experience, and this was his first boat purchase. The boat was purchased \"as is,\" as expressly provided in the Sales Order, and Fairest-Knight was aware that no express or implied warranty resulted from Marine World's sale of the boat. Fairest-Knight insured the boat and contracted with a company that provides emergency towing assistance.</p>\n<p>While operating the boat on January 22, 2005, approximately five months after he purchased it, Fairest-Knight observed that the boat's oil alarm was triggered and that oil had drained from the engine into the motor compartment. On January 27, 2005, Marine World inspected the engine, and on February 8, 2005, it performed the work necessary to correct the oil leakage, as authorized by Fairest-Knight. This incident would become one in a series of periodic breakdowns and other problems with the boat over the next several years. On each occasion, Fairest-Knight would bring the boat back to Marine World to be repaired, at which point Marine World would inspect the problem, tender a diagnosis and perform the indicated repairs. Marine World frequently performed sea trials to confirm that the problem had been corrected. No other person or entity serviced the boat during this time. Over the years, the repairs performed by Marine World included the following:</p>\n<blockquote>a) cleaning the engine room and replacing the oil sender thread, oil sensor and various other corroded fittings (February 8, 2005);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b) performing a tune up, replacing the impeller, and sanding and painting pulleys (June 6, 2005);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>c) replacing the sea water pump and serpentine belt (August 23, 2005);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>d) removing the engine, disassembling the manifolds and elbows, starter, engine points, power steering pump, and pulleys, as well as cleaning and painting those parts and the oil pan, followed by a sea trial (October 26, 2005);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>e) installing a missing power steering pump bracket (November 19, 2005);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>f) reconnecting GPS terminals, performing a tune up, and conducting a sea trial (May 17, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> g) replacing the electric fuel pump, cleaning the carburetor, and conducting a sea trial (May 27, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>h) conducting a sea trial (June 5, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>i) removing and charging the batteries (August 10, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>j) replacing the fuel tank vent (August 12, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>k) conducting a sea trial (August 15, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>l) replacing the fuel pick-up assembly (August 30, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>m) overhauling the engine, replacing the manifolds and elbows, and conducting a sea trial (November 6, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>n) replacing the exhaust flappers (December 13, 2006);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>o) replacing the engine longblock (February 15, 2007);</blockquote>\n<blockquote>p) replacing the impeller kit and flappers (May 14, 2007).</blockquote>\n<p>Despite these repairs, Fairest-Knight experienced repeated malfunctions while using the boat, often involving complete engine failures that required towing the boat back to port.</p>\n<p>The culmination of these incidents occurred on April 14, 2007 when Fairest-Knight, together with his wife and two sons, also appellees, embarked on a trip to Costa Bonita, located on the island of Culebra, approximately twenty miles east of Puerto Rico. After several engine failures, large amounts of smoke began to emanate from the engine compartment. Fearing that the boat might ignite, sink and/or explode, the family donned life jackets and prepared to abandon the vessel. Fairest-Knight opened the engine compartment and the smoke began to dissipate. The boat was then towed back to Puerto del Rey in Fajardo, where the boat has since remained, unused. Between May 14 and May 22, 2007, Marine World performed repairs to the boat without charge to Fairest-Knight, who was unaware that this work had been completed until after proceedings in this case had begun.</p>\n<p>Between August 2004, when the boat was first delivered to Fairest-Knight, until he last used it in April 2007, Fairest-Knight incurred expenses totaling $16,139.34 for repairs, $3,195.20 for towage and $2,990.00 for wharfage and insurance. During this time, a period of 32 months, the boat was undergoing service or was otherwise unuseable for 276 days, or approximately 9 months.</p>\n<p>On August 8, 2007, Fairest-Knight filed a complaint against Marine World in the District Court of Puerto Rico, raising claims under admiralty law and Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code. After a four-day bench trial, the district court found that Marine World \"breached its duty to a workmanlike performance upon which plaintiffs had a right to rely.\" The district court found that the \"repeated repairs which had to be done to the boat over an extended period of time\" was evidence of Marine World's breach, noting that \"there was a repeated failure to identify the source of the engine's failure despite representations to plaintiffs that the boat was in a seaworthy condition,\" and that \"Marine World was the only entity which serviced the boat during the period of time at issue.\" The district court rejected Marine World's theory that Fairest-Knight failed to properly maintain the boat as not credible, given that the evidence at trial showed that Fairest-Knight \"followed the recommendations made by Marine World as to replacement of parts and the boat's maintenance,\" and that, given how much time the boat spent in its shop, the onus was on Marine World to notice and inform Fairest-Knight of any need for maintenance. The district court awarded Fairest-Knight $15,739.96 for the faulty repairs; $3,195.20 for towage expenses; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> $2,990 for storage and insurance expenses up to June 20, 2007, and $13 per day thereafter until the entry of judgment; $55,000 to Fairest-Knight and his family for the negligent infliction of emotional distress and pain and suffering; and costs and attorneys' fees. Marine World appealed on March 5, 2010.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.

Marine World insists that there was insufficient evidence that their repairs were the cause of the repeated problems experienced by appellees' boat. Fairest-Knight argues that a party does not need to act negligently to be in breach of the implied warranty, and that Marine World's inability to finally resolve the various problems plaguing his boat shows that it was in breach of its implied warranty of workmanlike performance.</p>\n<p>\"[C]ontracts for repairs to a vessel... come under the scope of admiralty jurisdiction.\" <i>La Esperanza de P.R., Inc. v.

The theory of liability relevant to this appeal is the latter, the implied warranty of workmanlike performance.</p>\n<p>Although originating in disputes involving the indemnification of shipowners, we recognized in <i>La Esperanza</i> that liability under the implied warranty of workman-like <span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> performance extends to disputes between shipowners and shipyards. In <i>La Esperanza,</i> a shipowner sued a shipyard for negligently damaging the boat it had been hired to repair. We affirmed the district court's finding that the shipyard was liable for the negligence of its repairs, noting that the shipyard's failure to properly complete the requisite repairs \"constituted a breach of an express and implied contractual obligation, particularly in view of the fact that evidence in the record substantiates that similarly situated ship repairers could have\" completed the repairs correctly. <i>Id.</i> at 19.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>We additionally noted that although the implied warranty of workmanlike performance does not impose a strict liability regime on ship repairers, and instead \"parallels\" a negligence standard, nevertheless, a shipowner could recover for a breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service even when \"such performance was done without negligence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 17 (quoting <i>SS Amazonia v. N.J. Export Marine Carpenters, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349671\"><a href=\"/opinion/349671/ss-amazonia-her-engines-etc-companhia-de-navegacao-maritima-netumar-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 (2d Cir.1977)); <i>see also </i><i>Feliciano v.

However, <i>La Esperanza</i> did not reduce or eliminate a plaintiff's burden of proving that the defendant's conduct caused his injury. <i>See </i><i>SS Amazonia,</i> 564 F.2d at 8 (stating that recovery under a breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike performance claim requires showing that the sub-standard work performed \"caused the damage claimed\").</p>\n<p>For starters, although recovery for breach of implied warranty does not invariably require proof of negligence, the implied warranty does not go so far as to \"impos[e] strict liability.\" <i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 17. But in this regard, it is surely notable that even claims of unseaworthiness, which <i>do</i> \"impose a strict liability regime upon shipowners,\" <i>Napier v. F/V DEESIE, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202359\"><a href=\"/opinion/202359/napier-v-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.2006), require the plaintiff to show that the defendant's conduct was the proximate cause of his injury. In other words, even the \"absolute duty [of] shipowners to furnish a `seaworthy' ship\" is limited to those injuries <i>\"caused by</i> any defect in a vessel or its appurtenant appliances or equipment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 67-68 (emphasis added); <i>see also </i><i>Poulis-Minott v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201308\"><a href=\"/opinion/201308/poulis-minott-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span>, 366 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Ferrara v.

Because <i>La Esperanza</i> acknowledged liability under a theory of a breach of an implied warranty to be more limited than strict liability, and because strict liability claims (in the form of claims of unseaworthiness) themselves require proof of causation, it stands to reason that <i>La Esperanza</i> did not absolve parties claiming breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike service from proving that the alleged breach caused their injury. Causation must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See </i><i>Marquette Trans. Co., Inc. v. La. Mach. Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786084\"><a href=\"/opinion/786084/marquette-transportation-company-inc-plaintiff-counter/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 402 (5th Cir.2004).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> Moreover, although in <i>La Esperanza</i> we stated that \"[h]ere, one witnesses a ship that came in for repairs under her own power ... but somewhere, somehow, something went wrong,\" 124 F.3d at 18, a substantial portion of the opinion in <i>La Esperanza</i> was in fact devoted to explaining how the shipyard's performance  its unsuited method of removing the existing hull plates, its equally unsuited method of patching the holes it thereby created, and the careless way in which the boat was subsequently stored  had caused significant damage to the ship's hull, electrical system, upper deck and carpeting. <i>See </i><i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 14-15, 17-19. The shipyard also never fully completed the contracted-for repairs and, \"seeking to extricate itself from a predicament of its own making ... told the shipowner, essentially, that it ... had a problem on its hands, and maybe it should consider hiring a special welding consultant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 18. Rather than mere speculation, in other words, there was quite substantial evidence that the shipyard's conduct had caused the damage to the plaintiff's vessel.</p>\n<p>By the same token, our observation that where a shipyard represents itself as being \"a competent shipyard skilled in doing the type of work requested by the shipowner,\" then the latter has \"a right to rely on the [shipyard's] expertise\" and may \"expect a stable seaworthy vessel upon completion of the repairs, regardless of the condition of the boat[] prior to repairs,\" <i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted), should not be read  as appellees appear to suggest  to hold that once a shipyard has undertaken to repair a boat, any subsequent breakdowns or problems may, without more, be presumed to have been caused by the shipyard. The facts in <i>La Esperanza</i> clearly indicated that it was the shipyard's inability and/or unwillingness to properly complete the work it had specifically contracted to do that had caused the damage to the ship, which bolstered the finding of liability.</p>\n<p>In light of these observations, the fact that neither the appellees nor the district court were able to provide an explanation as to how the chronic problems with the boat were the result of Marine World's acts or omissions takes on dispositive salience.<sup>[4]</sup> In supporting its liability determination, the district court stated that</p>\n<blockquote>[e]vidence of the breach of Marine World are the repeated repairs which had to be done to the boat over an extended period of time ... there was a repeated failure to identify the source of the engine's failure ... Marine World <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> was the only entity which serviced the boat during the period of time at issue.... The best evidence that the repairs to the boat by Marine World were faulty are the invoices which show the boat could not be used for its intended use over extended periods of time because the boat was being repaired for multiple malfunctions.</blockquote>\n<p>We cannot agree. The fact that multiple repairs were required, without more, cannot be taken to establish that it was Marine World's unworkmanlike conduct that brought about the need for the repairs. In other words, if the hypothesis is that Marine World's unworkmanlike performance caused the need for the repeated repairs, then the fact that the repairs were required cannot itself be adduced as evidence supporting that hypothesis  it is what <i>needs</i> explaining, and so cannot, on pain of circularity, be what <i>does</i> the explaining.<sup>[5]</sup> From what we are able to ascertain in the record, Marine World was generally able to diagnose and repair each problem as it arose.<sup>[6]</sup> Fairest-Knight conceded at trial that he had no evidence of sub-standard performance by Marine World. No evidence was introduced that Marine World employed improper repair procedures or used sub-standard parts, nor is there any evidence that Marine World at any point mis-diagnosed the specific problem reported by Fairest-Knight. There is no evidence that it was poor work by Marine World rather than poor design, poor manufacture, poor maintenance or abuse by the boat's previous owner, or something else  including the appellee's admitted inexperience with boat ownership  that caused the boat's various problems. We have no basis on which to even speculate as to whether the same series of problems would have arisen had Fairest-Knight brought the boat to a different shipyard for repairs. <i>See </i><i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 19.</p>\n<p>Although circumstantial evidence may in some cases be used to establish causation, the circumstances must nevertheless allow for a \"strong inference[]\" of causation. <i>See </i><i>Marquette,</i> 367 F.3d at 402, 404. Exclusivity of control or possession is an important factor in supporting this inference. <i>Id.</i> at 404; <i>N. Ins. Co. of N.Y.,</i> 579 F.3d at 69-70 (where defendant marina did not have exclusive possession of the boat, no presumption of fault would apply.) In this case, we note that possession of the boat alternated between Fairest-Knight and Marine World during the relevant time period, and that Fairest-Knight made use of the boat, even if not always successfully, on multiple occasions. Fairest-Knight claims that between the time the boat was delivered and the final April 14, 2007 incident, the boat spent 276 days \"in repairs, undergoing service, or simply not working.\" Assuming this to be accurate, we can infer that during this time the boat spent nearly 700 days, or approximately 23 months, in Fairest-Knight's possession. This makes it difficult to say that it is more likely than not that the problems with Fairest-Knight's boat were caused by Marine World, which did not even have possession of the boat for the majority of the time in question. <i>See id.</i> at 70 (describing owner's presence on the boat several days before its sinking, his hiring of an independent mechanic, and his implied permission to his friends to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> access the boat without prior approval as \"the kind of activity which, through its interference with [defendant marina's] control over the boat, would cast doubt on the fairness of presuming that [defendant marina] was responsible [for the boat's sinking]\").</p>\n<p>The appellees insist that their inability to identify the cause of the boat's problems should not defeat their claim. They cite <i>Ryan</i> for the proposition that a \"contractor, as the warrantor of its own services, cannot use the shipowner's failure to discover and correct the contractor's own breach of warranty as a defense.\" <i>Ryan,</i> 350 U.S. at 134-35, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105337\"><a href=\"/opinion/105337/ryan-stevedoring-co-v-pan-atlantic-ss-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>. The appellees' reliance on <i>Ryan</i> might be more convincing if it had already been established that Marine World's conduct was the cause of their injury. After all, in <i>Ryan</i> the Supreme Court acknowledged liability premised on breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike service <i>provided</i> that said breach had caused the complained-of injury. <i>See </i><i>Ryan,</i> 350 U.S. at 132, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105337\"><a href=\"/opinion/105337/ryan-stevedoring-co-v-pan-atlantic-ss-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span> (\"The other question is whether ... a stevedoring contractor is obligated to reimburse a shipowner for damages <i>caused it</i> by the contractor's improper stowage of cargo.\" (emphasis added)). It was in this context that the Supreme Court rejected the stevedoring contractor's argument that \"because the shipowner had an obligation to supervise the stowage and had a right to reject unsafe stowage of the cargo,\" its failure to object prior to the accident extinguished its right to indemnification from the shipowner. <i>Id.</i> at 134, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105337\"><a href=\"/opinion/105337/ryan-stevedoring-co-v-pan-atlantic-ss-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>. There was, in this context, no question as to whether the contractor's acts or omissions had caused the injury. But that question lies at the heart of this case, and nothing in <i>Ryan</i> suggests that the appellees may avoid having to answer it.</p>\n<p>In short, absent sufficient proof of causation, the troubles experienced by Fairest-Knight with his boat  while undeniably frustrating  do not make out a viable breach of warranty claim. We therefore hold that the district court clearly erred in finding otherwise, and reverse its finding that appellants breached the implied warranty of workmanlike service.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Damages</h2>\n<p>The appellees claimed damages both under admiralty law and Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, 31 L.P.R.A. § 5141. The district court, exercising pendent jurisdiction over the state law claim, cited Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code as the basis for its award of damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress and pain and suffering.<sup>[7]</sup> This statute provides that \"[a] person who by an act or omission <i>causes</i> damage to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" 31 L.P.R.A. § 5141 (emphasis added). Causation is thus clearly an element under Article 1802. <i>See </i><i>Santini Rivera v. Serv. Air, Inc.,</i> 137 D.P.R. 1, 1994 JTS 121, 1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,527, slip op. at 10, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">909527</span></span> (P.R.1994); <i>Marital Cmty. k/a Luz M. Hernández and Edgardo López Flores v. González Padín Co., Inc.,</i> 117 D.P.R. 94, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></span>, slip op. at 125, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">376809</span></span> (P.R.1986). Because appellees failed to establish that Marine World was the cause of the boat's chronic problems, there was no basis for an award of damages under either the admiralty or Article 1802 claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We take it as clearly settled that shipowners may only recover from ship repairers under an implied warranty theory if the alleged breach is shown to have caused the plaintiff's injury. Appellees failed to prove that appellant's conduct caused their injury. Accordingly, the district court's finding of liability is reversed, and its award of damages and attorneys' fees in favor of appellees is vacated.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Fairest-Knight's complaint lists the purchase price as $39,075, whereas the bill of sale lists $38,000. The correct figure is not material to this dispute.</p>\n<p>[2]  The contract between the shipowner and the shipyard included a provision stating that the shipyard committed \"to use materials and execute work to standard ship repair practice,\" a clause that we found made express \"the otherwise implied warranty of workman-like performance in marine contracts.\" <i>La Esperanza,</i> 124 F.3d at 18-19.</p>\n<p>[3]  The appellees contended at oral argument that <i>Marquette</i> is inapplicable in light of our opinion in <i>La Esperanza.</i> We acknowledge that <i>Marquette</i> is in tension with <i>La Esperanza</i> insofar as it suggests that plaintiffs pursuing a breach of an implied warranty claim <i>must</i> show negligence, <i>see </i><i>Marquette,</i> 367 F.3d at 402 (\"[T]he evidence available must be sufficient to find <i>both</i> negligence <i>and</i> causation.\" (emphasis modified)). However, whatever may be the case with proof of negligence in implied warranty cases, proof of causation remains indispensable, and on that score we agree with <i>Marquette</i>'s description of the applicable burden of proof.</p>\n<p>[4]  Appellees emphasize that the inspection of the boat commissioned by Marine World did not include any test of the engine. The inspection report clearly stated that the engine had not been tested, Fairest was apparently aware of the certification at the time of purchase, and the purchase agreement explicitly specifies that the boat was being sold \"as is\"  meaning, as Fairest conceded at trial, that \"there was not an expressed or implied warranty for [the] boat.\" We see no reason, on these facts, to construe the incomplete inspection as a breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike performance. <i>See </i><i>N. Ins. Co. of N.Y.,</i> 579 F.3d at 67-68. In any case, the basis for this lawsuit is whether Marine World breached their duty of providing workmanlike performance in repairing the boat, not whether they improperly sold appellee a boat that had not been fully tested.</p>\n<p>[5]  Why does opium make men drowsy? Because it possesses a dormitive power. (With apologies to Molière, <i>Le Malade Imaginaire</i> (1673), Act III, scene iii.)</p>\n<p>[6]  Appellees note that Marine World incorrectly diagnosed the source of an oil leak in January, 2005. It is undisputed, however, that Marine World made the correct repair after discovering the actual cause of the leak.</p>\n<p>[7]  It is possible that federal maritime law would preclude the appellees' state law cause of action for the negligent infliction of emotional distress. State law may supplement maritime law when maritime law is silent or where a local matter is at issue. <i>See </i><i>Floyd v. Lykes Bros. S.S. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504652\"><a href=\"/opinion/504652/floyd-maria-e-individually-and-as-personal-representative-of-the-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1044</span></a></span>, 1047 (3d Cir.1988). However, \"state law may not be applied where it would conflict with [a federal] maritime law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1047; <i>see also </i><i>Askew v. Am.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span> (1973). A maritime tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress has been recognized in the Ninth Circuit; <i>see </i><i>Chan v.

The First Circuit has not yet definitively addressed this question. <i>See, e.g. </i><i>Peemoller Sultan v. Pleasure Craft Contender 25,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2409929\"><a href=\"/opinion/2409929/peemoller-sultan-v-pleasure-craft-contender-25/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We decline to decide this question, as it is apparent that appellees' failure to show causation dooms their claim, regardless of whether it is brought under the auspices of federal maritime or state law.</p>\n\n</div>",
