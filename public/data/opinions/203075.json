Gustavo A. Gelpí, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                  Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n               Baldock, * Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Mauricio Hernández Arroyo for appellant.\n     Isabel Muñoz-Acosta, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith   whom  Rosa  Emilia  Rodríguez-Vélez,   United States\nAttorney,   Nelson  Pérez-Sosa,   Assistant  United  States\nAttorney, and Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States\nAttorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                       December 18, 2007\n\n\n\n\n    *\n        Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f       BALDOCK,      Senior     Circuit     Judge.          Appellant    Sidney\n\nMariani-Colón (Mariani) is a black, Puerto Rican male who\n\nwas provisionally hired as a federal air marshal, subject to\n\nhis    successful     completion      of    a   training     program    at   the\n\nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Artesia,\n\nNew Mexico.        Appellant failed to graduate from the FLETC\n\nprogram.    The Transportation Security Administration (TSA),\n\na   division    of    appellee    Department      of   Homeland       Security,\n\nultimately terminated his employment.\n\n       Appellant brought suit in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico alleging two distinct\n\nviolations of Title VII.              First, appellant alleged he was\n\ndiscriminated        against,    in   the   course     of    his    employment,\n\nbased on his race, sex, color, and national origin.                     Second,\n\nappellant asserted he was discharged in retaliation for his\n\nadministrative complaints of discrimination.                       The district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment to TSA on both claims.\n\n       Appellant raises two issues on appeal.                First, appellant\n\nchallenges the district court’s decision to deem appellee’s\n\nstatement of uncontested facts admitted because, according\n\nto the district court, appellant’s response failed to comply\n\nwith    Local     Rule   56(c).       Second,     appellant        appeals   the\n\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of TSA\n\non his Title VII claims for discrimination and retaliation.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      At the outset, appellant challenges the district court’s\n\ndetermination that his response to TSA’s motion for summary\n\njudgment     failed       to        comply      with      Local      Rule     56(c).\n\nSpecifically,       he    challenges           the   district       court’s    order\n\ndeeming appellee’s statement of uncontested facts thereby\n\nadmitted.     See     D.P.R.R.        56(c).         We   review     the    district\n\ncourt’s    application         of    a    local      rule    for     an    abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.      See Crowely v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 361 F.3d 22, 25\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).          A district court may forgive a party’s\n\nviolation of a local rule, but we will “review deferentially\n\nits refusal to do so.”              Id.\n\n      Local Rule 56(c) requires “a party opposing a motion for\n\nsummary judgment to accept, deny, or qualify each entry in\n\nthe   movant’s      statement        of     material       facts    paragraph      by\n\nparagraph and to support any denials, qualifications, or new\n\nassertions    by    particularized              citations     to     the    record.”\n\nCabán Hernández v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 486 F.3d 1, 6-7\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).          If the party opposing summary judgment\n\nfails to comply with Local Rule 56(c), “the rule permits the\n\ndistrict    court    to   treat       the      moving     party’s    statement     of\n\nfacts as uncontested.”              Alsina-Ortiz v. Laboy, 400 F.3d 77,\n\n80 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f       The purpose of this “anti-ferret rule” is to require the\n\nparties to focus the district court’s attention on what is,\n\nand    what    is   not,    genuinely          controverted.            Id.;     see     also\n\nCabán Hernández, 486 F.3d at 7. Otherwise, the parties would\n\nimproperly      shift       the    burden          of    organizing        the     evidence\n\npresented in a given case to the district court.                                 See Cabán\n\nHernández,      486       F.3d    at    8;    Alsina-Ortiz,          400    F.3d    at    80.\n\nGiven Local Rule 56(c)’s important purpose, this Court has\n\nrepeatedly upheld its enforcement, stating that litigants\n\nignore it “at their peril.”                   Cabán Hernández, 486 F.3d at 7;\n\nsee also Torres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 4 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n       In this case, appellant attempts to “confess and avoid”\n\nby    admitting     that     his       pleading         fails   to   admit,      deny,     or\n\nqualify each of appellee’s assertions of fact, while arguing\n\nthat his alternative statement of facts fulfills the spirit\n\nof the local rule.               Cabán Hernández, 486 F.3d at 7.                         This\n\nCourt    has    previously         held       that      submitting      an     “alternate\n\nstatement      of    facts,”       rather       than      admitting,         denying,      or\n\nqualifying a defendant’s assertions of fact “paragraph by\n\nparagraph as required by Local Rule 56(c),” justifies the\n\nissuance       of     a    “‘deeming’          order,”          which      characterizes\n\ndefendant’s         assertions          of     fact       as    uncontested.              Id.\n\nConsequently,         we    uphold      the    district         court’s      decision      to\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\ftreat      appellee’s     statement   of   facts   as     uncontested. 1\n\nNonetheless, we conclude that, even absent a deeming order,\n\nthe   district    court    properly   granted   summary    judgment    in\n\nthis case.\n\n                                   II.\n\n          We proceed to summarize the sequence of events related\n\nto appellant’s claims in the light most favorable to him.\n\nSee Suarez v. Pueblo Intern, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (“[W]e must view the entire record in the light most\n\nhospitable to the party opposing summary judgment . . . .”).\n\nAppellant       worked    as   a   correctional    officer     at     the\n\nMetropolitan Detention Center, a federal prison facility in\n\nGuaynabo, Puerto Rico.         In May 2002 he applied for, and was\n\ngranted, a provisional appointment as a federal air marshal.\n\nThis appointment was conditioned on appellant’s successful\n\ncompletion of a training program at FLETC.           Upon successful\n\ncompletion of the program, candidates serve an additional\n\ntwelve month probationary period before becoming permanent\n\nemployees of the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS).                FAMS\n\nis under the purview of TSA.\n\n      During the hiring process, appellant filled out a duty\n\n\n      1\n       “This, of course, does not mean the unopposed party\nwins on summary judgment; that party’s uncontested facts and\nother evidentiary facts of record must still show that the\nparty is entitled to summary judgment.” Torres-Rosado, 335\nF.3d at 4.\n\n                                   -7-\n\flocation          preference      form.      The    form     provided        a     list     of\n\navailable duty stations and appellant was able to rank his\n\ntop eight choices.             Out of the duty stations then available,\n\nappellant ranked New York, New York as his first choice.\n\nConsequently, TSA assigned appellant to its New York office.\n\nLater       candidates       were    provided       with    a    different         list     of\n\npossible          duty   stations.         Appellant       learned        that     some     of\n\nthese       candidates       had    been    able     to    list      Miami       on     their\n\npreference          forms.         Subsequently,          appellant         requested        a\n\ntransfer to this location.                  TSA denied his request. 2\n\n       One        hundred    and    thirty        nine     candidates,           including\n\nappellant,          started       service    with    FAMS       on    May    12,        2002. 3\n\nBased on a list of qualifying factors, TSA gave sixty-five\n\nof   these        candidates,       including       appellant,        a     base      annual\n\nsalary of $36,400.                Thus, TSA provided appellant with the\n\nsame       base    salary    as    approximately         forty-seven         percent        of\n\nfederal       air    marshal       candidates       entering         service       at     this\n\ntime.             TSA     assigned        seventy         four       candidates,            or\n\n\n\n       2\n       Appellant does not allege that TSA allowed other\nsimilarly situated candidates to transfer.   We, therefore,\ndecline to consider this matter further. See United States\nv. Soler, 275 F.3d 146, 155 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002)(noting that\narguments not developed on appeal are waived).\n       3\n        The record does not reflect the race of these\ncandidates. Therefore, the Court cannot construct a racial\ndistribution of basic pay offered to candidates who began\nservice at the same time as appellant.\n\n                                            -8-\n\fapproximately fifty-three percent of the candidates entering\n\nservice on May 12, 2002, an annual base salary greater than\n\n$36,400.\n\n      While at FLETC, appellant experienced difficulties with\n\nhis   weapons        training.        Several    incidents,       involving      the\n\nscoring of a target and an offhand comment appellant made\n\nrelating to another individual shooting appellant’s target\n\nfor him, led certain FLETC officials to question appellant’s\n\nintegrity.       Appellant did, however, achieve a passing score\n\non at least one firearms test.                   Nevertheless, appellant’s\n\nproblems        concentrating,        and      his    apparent    violation       of\n\nseveral safety regulations while on the shooting range, led\n\nFLETC   instructors       to     place   him     on    “safety   watch.”      This\n\nresulted        in    appellant       being      more     closely       monitored.\n\nAppellant, however, was unaware that he was on safety watch.\n\nAfter      incidents     in    which     instructors          alleged    appellant\n\nimproperly used deadly force and pointed his gun down range\n\nwhile another student was manually adjusting a target, FLETC\n\nofficials suspended him from further firearms training.\n\n      As    a   result   of    this    suspension,       appellant      failed    to\n\ngraduate from FLETC.           TSA placed him on administrative leave\n\nand appellant returned to Puerto Rico in June 2002.                        Shortly\n\nthereafter,          appellant     contacted          TSA’s    human    resources\n\ndepartment and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f(EEOC),        alleging       he      was      the     subject        of     illegal\n\ndiscrimination.          After appellant made these allegations of\n\ndiscrimination, TSA offered him an administrative position\n\nin New York.      No record evidence suggests appellant accepted\n\nthis administrative position. 4\n\n     Instead, appellant requested to be put on sick leave.\n\nTSA granted this request.              Appellant used up all of his sick\n\nleave    and    vacation      time.     Eventually,          appellant       went    on\n\nunpaid    leave.         In    August       2002,     TSA     sent    appellant       a\n\ntermination letter, explaining that he was being terminated\n\nduring    his    probationary         period     for       failure    to    meet    the\n\nrequirements of his conditional appointment as a federal air\n\nmarshal.          More     specifically,             the     letter        referenced\n\nappellant’s failure to graduate from the FLETC program due\n\nto   multiple      safety      violations,           appellant’s       failure       to\n\ncomprehend the proper use of deadly force, and the incident\n\nin which appellant allegedly asked another person to fire at\n\nhis target in order to increase his shooting score.\n\n                                        III.\n\n     Appellant raises two claims under Title VII.                              First,\n\nappellant alleges TSA discriminated against him by treating\n\nhim differently than other federal air marshal candidates.\n\n\n     4\n       Appellant merely alleges he requested that TSA send\nhim a description of the position and the salary he would\nreceive.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fAppellant argues this disparate treatment is evidenced by\n\nTSA giving him: 1) fewer placement options, 2) less pay, and\n\n3) harsher discipline, based on his race, sex, color, and\n\nnational origin.         Second, appellant claims TSA fired him in\n\nretaliation      for     his    administrative       complaints          concerning\n\nthis discrimination.\n\n       We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo “based on the record as it stood before the district\n\ncourt.”     Fontánez-Núñez v. Janssen Ortho LLC, 447 F.3d 50,\n\n54 (1st Cir. 2006).            In conducting our review, we “view the\n\nentire     record   in    the    light     most    hospitable      to    the   party\n\nopposing      summary          judgment,        indulging        all     reasonable\n\ninferences in that party’s favor.”                  Suarez, 229 F.3d at 53.\n\nWe   may   safely      ignore,     however,       “conclusory          allegations,\n\nimprobable inferences, and unsupported speculation.”                           Id.\n\n       Summary      judgment       is      proper     “if        the     pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\n\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there\n\nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).             Although employment discrimination\n\ncases deal with “elusive concepts such as motive or intent,”\n\nthis   standard     compels       summary       judgment    if    the   non-moving\n\nparty rests his case “merely upon conclusory allegations,\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fimprobable     inferences,        and         unsupported                speculation.”\n\nFeliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort, 218 F.3d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                       A.\n\n      We first address appellant’s Title VII discrimination\n\nclaim.    Disparate treatment cases “ordinarily proceed under\n\nthe    three-step,     burden-shifting              framework”            outlined           in\n\nMcDonnell    Douglas      Corp.   v.     Green,       411    U.S.          792    (1973).\n\nClifford v. Barnhart, 449 F.3d 276, 280 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nFirst, the plaintiff must establish, by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence, a prima facie case of discrimination.                                      See\n\nKosereis v. Rhode Island, 331 F.3d 207, 212 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nSecond, if the plaintiff makes out this prima facie case,\n\nthe      defendant        must         ar t i c u l a t e        a        legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory      explanation          for     its     actions.              See    id.\n\nThird, if the defendant carries this burden of production,\n\nthe   plaintiff    must    prove,      by    a    preponderance,                 that    the\n\ndefendant’s       explanation       is       a      pretext              for     unlawful\n\ndiscrimination.      See id.      The burden of persuasion remains\n\nat all times with the plaintiff.                 See Sher v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nVeterans Affairs, 488 F.3d 489, 507 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n      Generally, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case\n\nof    discrimination      by   showing:        1)    he     is       a    member        of    a\n\nprotected class, 2) he is qualified for the job, 3) the\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\femployer took an adverse employment action against him, and\n\n4) the position remained open, or was filled by a person\n\nwith similar qualifications.                See Kosereis, 331 F.3d at 212-\n\n13.    This burden is “not onerous,” as only a “small showing”\n\nis    required.        Id.     at    213;      see    also       id.       (noting      that\n\ncomparative      evidence       is    treated        as    part       of    the   pretext\n\nanalysis, not as part of the plaintiff’s prima facie case).\n\nIn this case, appellant is a black Puerto Rican male and\n\nthus is a member of a protected class.                            We assume he was\n\nqualified for a provisional appointment as a Federal Air\n\nMarshal.        Further,      appellant        has    shown      that      TSA    took    at\n\nleast    one    adverse       employment         against       him     (i.e.,      he    was\n\nterminated).         Finally, appellant’s position was undoubtedly\n\nfilled     by    someone       with       similar         qualifications.                We,\n\ntherefore,      assume       that    appellant       has       established        a   prima\n\nfacie case of discrimination.\n\n      Next,     we   consider       the   government’s            nondiscriminatory\n\nrationales for its treatment of appellant.                                 In regard to\n\nplacement options, the government argues that no candidate\n\nwho    filled    out     a    placement        form       at    the    same       time    as\n\nappellant was allowed to select Miami, Florida as a possible\n\nduty station.          Concerning pay, the government claims that\n\nunder    an    established      list      of   neutral         factors      appellant’s\n\nexperience did not entitle him to a higher rate of basic\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fpay.         As        to     discipline,                the     government         alleges    that\n\nappellant’s history of learning difficulties, serious safety\n\nviolations, and untrustworthy behavior justified not only\n\nheightened         monitoring              of      appellant          but   also    his    eventual\n\nsuspension from the FLETC program.                                     We conclude that the\n\ngovernment                  has        provided                ample        nondiscriminatory\n\njustifications for its actions.\n\n       Now       we     must       consider              the     evidence        appellant        has\n\npresented to show that the government’s stated reasons for\n\nits actions are pretextual.                              See Kosereis, 331 F.3d at 213\n\n(stating that, as compared to a court’s consideration of\n\nwhether      a     plaintiff           has         established         a    prima    facie    case,\n\n“pretext         analysis          .   .       .    is    more     demanding”).            Most    of\n\nappellant’s             proffered              evidence          of     disparate         treatment\n\nconsists          of        either      his         own        personal      observations,         or\n\nconversations he had with other trainees, which led him to\n\nbelieve he was the target of illegal discrimination.                                              We,\n\ntherefore, discuss generally the relevance of these personal\n\nobservations                and    conversations                 to     appellant’s         showing\n\nof pretext.\n\n       Our   review           of   appellant’s                 statements,       concerning       his\n\nexperiences at FLETC, assures us that they do not contain\n\n“adequate         specific           factual         information            based    on    personal\n\nknowledge,”            to     create       a       genuine       issue      of   material     fact.\n\n\n                                                    -14-\n\fQuinones v. Buick, 436 F.3d 284, 290 (1st Cir. 2006).                                     On\n\nthe contrary, these statements merely reflect appellant’s\n\n“subjective speculation and suspicion” that he was treated\n\nunfairly.          Id.    Proof of more than appellant’s subjective\n\nbelief that he was the target of discrimination, however, is\n\nrequired.          In    order       to   establish         a    disparate       treatment\n\nclaim, a plaintiff must show that others “similarly situated\n\nto him in all relevant respects were treated differently by\n\nthe employer.”           Kosereis, 331 F.3d at 214.\n\n       First, appellant offers no evidence whatsoever that TSA\n\nprovided other trainees going through the hiring process at\n\nthe    same   time       as    appellant      a     more    comprehensive         list    of\n\nplacement options.             Second, the only hard evidence appellant\n\npresents      in    regard      to     pay   demonstrates           that    TSA   granted\n\nnearly    half      of    the    candidates          who        entered    service    with\n\nappellant the same amount of basic pay appellant received.\n\nThis statistical evidence does not indicate that appellant\n\nwas the target of illegal discrimination.\n\n       Third, appellant alleges that a female candidate with\n\nconcentration problems, similar to his own, was disciplined\n\nless    harshly.          He    also      claims     that       other   candidates       who\n\ncommitted     safety          violations,         such     as    failing    to    properly\n\nstore a weapon, were not punished.                          In addition, appellant\n\nargues    that      another      trainee,         who    had     difficulties       during\n\n\n                                             -15-\n\fweapons training, was allowed to remain at FLETC until he\n\npassed the firearms course.\n\n       What appellant has wholly failed to show, however, is\n\nthat any of these candidates engaged in rule violations that\n\nwere of the same level of seriousness as the offenses with\n\nwhich       he    was   charged     (i.e.,           that    they       were       similarly\n\nsituated).            See   Kosereis,          331    F.3d       at    214.         Instead,\n\nappellant focuses on contesting his instructor’s assertions\n\nthat       his    performance      was     unacceptable.                 In    evaluating\n\nwhether          an   employer’s     stated           reasons          for    an    adverse\n\nemployment action are pretextual, however, our concern is\n\nnot        whether      appellant        was     actually             performing       below\n\nexpectations, but whether his employer “believed that [he]\n\nwas.”       Feliciano de la Cruz, 218 F.3d at 7.\n\n       Appellant        engages     in    much       speculation.             But    he   has\n\nfailed to present reliable comparative evidence suggesting\n\nthe government’s actions were based not on his perceived\n\nfailings, but on discriminatory animus.                          Cf. Ortiz García v.\n\nToledo       Fernández,      405     F.3d        21,        24    (1st       Cir.     2005).\n\nConsequently, appellant cannot establish pretext in regards\n\nto his unwarranted discipline claim. 5\n\n\n       5\n          Appellant  also  argues  that:  1)   one   of    his\nsupervisors, Jerry Alicea, was not aware of the complaints\nconcerning him, and 2) he never received a written warning.\nAppellant fails to explain, however, how these allegations\n                                                  (continued...)\n\n                                          -16-\n\f     To survive a defendant’s motion for summary judgment on\n\na discrimination claim, a plaintiff must produce sufficient\n\nevidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to two points:\n\n1)   the   employer’s    articulated           reasons     for     its   adverse\n\nactions    were   pretextual,      and    2)   the   real    reason      for   the\n\nemployer’s    actions    was   discriminatory          animus      based   on    a\n\nprotected    category.       See    Quinones,        436    F.3d    at   289-90;\n\nFeliciano de la Cruz, 218 F.3d at 6.                 Appellant has failed\n\nto make the first required showing that the government’s\n\nstated reasons for its actions were pretextual.                     Therefore,\n\nhis Title VII discrimination claim fails.\n\n                                     B.\n\n     We    next   consider     appellant’s        Title     VII    retaliation\n\nclaim.     Title VII retaliation claims also proceed under the\n\nburden-shifting framework laid down in McDonnell Douglas.\n\nSee Dixon v. Int’l Bhd. of Police Officers, 504 F.3d 74, 81\n\n& n.4 (1st Cir. 2007); supra Part III.A (describing this\n\nframework).       In order to establish a prima facie case of\n\n\n\n     5\n     (...continued)\nsupport his claim of disparate treatment.      For instance,\nappellant does not allege that all supervisors were\ngenerally aware of problems concerning all candidates, or\nthat it was customary for candidates to receive written\nwarnings.      Because appellant has failed to develop these\narguments, we consider them waived.     See United States v.\nJíminez, 498 F.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir. 2007) (“[I]ssues adverted\nto in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\ndeveloped argumentation are deemed waived.”).\n\n                                    -17-\n\fretaliation,            a    plaintiff       must       establish       three     elements.\n\nFirst,       the     plaintiff         must        show    that    he       engaged     in     a\n\nprotected activity.                  Id. at 81.         Second, the plaintiff must\n\ndemonstrate he suffered a materially adverse action, which\n\ncaused him harm, either inside or outside of the workplace.\n\nSee    id.        The       impact    of    this    harm    must       be   sufficient        to\n\ndissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a\n\ncharge of discrimination.                        See id.         Third, the plaintiff\n\nmust       show    that      the     adverse      action    taken       against     him      was\n\ncausally          linked      to     his    protected       activity.             See   id.\n\n       In     this      case,        appellant          undoubtedly         engaged     in     a\n\nprotected         activity         when     he    contacted      TSA    human     resources\n\ndepartment         and       the     EEOC    alleging       he    was       the   target      of\n\nillegal discrimination.                    Furthermore, appellee’s termination\n\nof appellant was a materially adverse action sufficient to\n\ndissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a\n\ncharge of discrimination. 6                      In dispute is whether appellant\n\nhas shown a causal connection between his allegations of\n\n\n       6\n        Appellant also argues that various happenings at\nFLETC support his claim for retaliation.      Because these\nevents  occurred   before   appellant engaged   in  activity\nprotected by Title VII (i.e., before appellant complained of\ndiscrimination), we do not address these claims.         See\nTorres-Negrón v. Merck & Co., 488 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir.\n2007) (explaining that an employee engages in protected\nactivity, for purposes of a Title VII retaliation claim, by\nopposing a practice made unlawful by Title VII, or by\nparticipating   in  any   manner   in an  investigation   or\nproceeding under Title VII).\n\n                                                 -18-\n\fdiscrimination and his subsequent termination.                            We conclude\n\nthat      the     “temporal       proximity”            between           appellant’s\n\nallegations       of   discrimination             in     June       2002      and     his\n\ntermination       in   August    2002      is     sufficient             to   meet    the\n\nrelatively light burden of establishing a prima facie case\n\nof retaliation.        Pomales v. Celulares Telefónica, Inc., 447\n\nF.3d 79, 85 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n       In support of appellant’s termination, the government\n\npoints out that appellant never accepted the administrative\n\nposition offered to him in New York, nor reported for duty,\n\ndespite having exhausted his leave.                    The government further\n\nargues    that    appellant      failed      to    meet      the     terms      of    his\n\nconditional        appointment        as     a     federal           air       marshal.\n\nAppellant’s failure to report for duty upon exhaustion of\n\nhis leave, and his failure to meet the conditions of his\n\noriginal    appointment     as    a   federal          air   marshal,         represent\n\nlegitimate,        non-retaliatory           reasons          for         appellant’s\n\ndischarge.        Consequently,       we   conclude          the    government        has\n\noffered    a     non-retaliatory       justification               for    appellant’s\n\ndismissal that is sufficient to overcome appellant’s prima\n\nfacie case of retaliation.\n\n       A more exacting examination of the sequence of events\n\nleading    to    appellant’s     discharge         shows      that        Mariani     was\n\nfired a few weeks after he went on unpaid leave.                                    Given\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fappellant’s       continued       failure       to   accept        an   alternative\n\nposition with TSA and return to work, the temporal proximity\n\nbetween    appellant’s          complaints      of   discrimination           and    his\n\ndischarge      fails       to   raise    an     “inference         of   retaliatory\n\nmotive.”      Colburn v. Parker Hannafin, 429 F.3d 325, 338 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).          Rather, appellant’s termination at this time\n\npresumably     reflects         TSA’s    judgment       that   a    more      reliable\n\nemployee could better fill the position offered to Mariani.\n\nSee Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp & Dohme Química P.R., Inc.,\n\n447    F.3d    105,    111      (1st    Cir.     2006)(concluding             that    an\n\nemployee’s “failure to return to work by a particular date”\n\nconstituted      a    valid     reason    for    her    termination).            Under\n\nthese    facts,      the    temporal      proximity       between       appellant’s\n\ncomplaints of discrimination and his termination does not\n\nshow    that     the       government’s         justifications          for     firing\n\nappellant are pretextual.\n\n       Appellant offers no additional evidence to show that the\n\nreasons    the    government        offered       for    his   termination           are\n\npretextual.       While appellant engages in much speculation and\n\nconjecture, a plaintiff cannot defeat summary judgment by\n\nrelying on “conclusory allegations, or rank speculation.”\n\nFontánez-Núñez, 447 F.3d at 55.                 To defeat summary judgment,\n\na plaintiff must make a colorable showing that an adverse\n\naction was taken “for the purpose of retaliating” against\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fhim.     Randlett   v.   Shalala,   118   F.3d   857,   862   (1st   Cir.\n\n1997).    Appellant has not made this showing.           Consequently,\n\nhis Title VII claim for retaliation also fails.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\f",

A district court may forgive a party's violation of a local rule, but we will \"review deferentially its refusal to do so.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Local Rule 56(c) requires \"a party opposing a motion for summary judgment to accept, deny, or qualify each entry in the movant's statement of material facts paragraph by paragraph and to support any denials, qualifications, or new assertions by particularized citations to the record.\" <i>Cabán Hernández v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,</i> 486 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.2007). If the party opposing summary judgment fails to comply with Local Rule 56(c), \"the rule permits the district court to treat the moving party's statement of facts as uncontested.\" <i>Alsina-Ortiz v. Laboy,</i> 400 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>The purpose of this \"anti-ferret rule\" is to require the parties to focus the district court's attention on what is, and what is not, genuinely controverted. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Cabán Hernández,</i> 486 F.3d at 7. Otherwise, the parties would improperly shift the burden of organizing the evidence presented in a given case to the district court. <i>See </i><i>Cabán Hernández,</i> 486 F.3d at 8; <i>Alsina-Ortiz,</i> 400 F.3d at 80. Given Local Rule 56(c)'s important purpose, this Court has repeatedly upheld its enforcement, stating that litigants ignore it \"at their peril.\" <i>Cabán Hernández,</i> 486 F.3d at 7; <i>see also </i><i>Torres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat,</i> 335 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>In this case, appellant attempts to \"confess and avoid\" by admitting that his pleading fails to admit, deny, or qualify each of appellee's assertions of fact, while arguing that his alternative statement of facts fulfills the spirit of the local rule. <i>Cabán Hernández,</i> 486 F.3d at 7. This Court has previously held that submitting an \"alternate statement of facts,\" rather than admitting, denying, or qualifying a defendant's assertions of fact \"paragraph by paragraph as required by Local Rule 56(c),\" justifies the issuance of a \"`deeming' order,\" which characterizes defendant's assertions of fact as uncontested. <i>Id.</i> Consequently, we uphold the district court's decision to treat appellee's statement of facts as uncontested.<sup>[1]</sup> Nonetheless, we conclude that, even absent a deeming order, the district court properly granted summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We proceed to summarize the sequence of events related to appellant's claims in the light most favorable to him. <i>See </i><i>Suarez v. Pueblo Intern., Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[W]e must view the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment. . . .\"). Appellant worked as a correctional officer at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal prison facility in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. In May 2002 he applied for, and was granted, a provisional appointment as a federal air marshal. This appointment was conditioned on appellant's successful completion of a training program at FLETC. Upon successful completion of the program, candidates serve an additional twelve month probationary period before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*220</span> becoming permanent employees of the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS). FAMS is under the purview of TSA.</p>\n<p>During the hiring process, appellant filled out a duty location preference form. The form provided a list of available duty stations and appellant was able to rank his top eight choices. Out of the duty stations then available, appellant ranked New York, New York as his first choice. Consequently, TSA assigned appellant to its New York office. Later candidates were provided with a different list of possible duty stations. Appellant learned that some of these candidates had been able to list Miami on their preference forms. Subsequently, appellant requested a transfer to this location. TSA denied his request.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>One hundred and thirty nine candidates, including appellant, started service with FAMS on May 12, 2002.<sup>[3]</sup> Based on a list of qualifying factors, TSA gave sixty-five of these candidates, including appellant, a base annual salary of $36,400. Thus, TSA provided appellant with the same base salary as approximately forty-seven percent of federal air marshal candidates entering service at this time. TSA assigned seventy four candidates, or approximately fifty-three percent of the candidates entering service on May 12, 2002, an annual base salary greater than $36,400.</p>\n<p>While at FLETC, appellant experienced difficulties with his weapons training. Several incidents, involving the scoring of a target and an offhand comment appellant made relating to another individual shooting appellant's target for him, led certain FLETC officials to question appellant's integrity. Appellant did, however, achieve a passing score on at least one firearms test. Nevertheless, appellant's problems concentrating, and his apparent violation of several safety regulations while on the shooting range, led FLETC instructors to place him on \"safety watch.\" This resulted in appellant being more closely monitored. Appellant, however, was unaware that he was on safety watch. After incidents in which instructors alleged appellant improperly used deadly force and pointed his gun down range while another student was manually adjusting a target, FLETC officials suspended him from further firearms training.</p>\n<p>As a result of this suspension, appellant failed to graduate from FLETC. TSA placed him on administrative leave and appellant returned to Puerto Rico in June 2002. Shortly thereafter, appellant contacted TSA's human resources department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging he was the subject of illegal discrimination. After appellant made these allegations of discrimination, TSA offered him an administrative position in New York. No record evidence suggests appellant accepted this administrative position.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Instead, appellant requested to be put on sick leave. TSA granted this request. Appellant used up all of his sick leave and vacation time. Eventually, appellant went on unpaid leave. In August 2002, TSA sent appellant a termination letter, explaining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*221</span> that he was being terminated during his probationary period for failure to meet the requirements of his conditional appointment as a federal air marshal. More specifically, the letter referenced appellant's failure to graduate from the FLETC program due to multiple safety violations, appellant's failure to comprehend the proper use of deadly force, and the incident in which appellant allegedly asked another person to fire at his target in order to increase his shooting score.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Appellant raises two claims under Title VII. First, appellant alleges TSA discriminated against him by treating him differently than other federal air marshal candidates. Appellant argues this disparate treatment is evidenced by TSA giving him: 1) fewer placement options, 2) less pay, and 3) harsher discipline, based on his race, sex, color, and national origin. Second, appellant claims TSA fired him in retaliation for his administrative complaints concerning this discrimination.</p>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo</i> \"based on the record as it stood before the district court.\" <i>Fontánez-Núñez v. Janssen Ortho LLC,</i> 447 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.2006). In conducting our review, we \"view the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\" <i>Suarez,</i> 229 F.3d at 53. We may safely ignore, however, \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). Although employment discrimination cases deal with \"elusive concepts such as motive or intent,\" this standard compels summary judgment if the non-moving party rests his case \"merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Feliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort,</i> 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>We first address appellant's Title VII discrimination claim. Disparate treatment cases \"ordinarily proceed under the three-step, burden-shifting framework\" outlined in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <i>Clifford v. Barnhart,</i> 449 F.3d 276, 280 (1st Cir.2006). First, the plaintiff must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, a prima facie case of discrimination. <i>See </i><i>Kosereis v. Rhode Island,</i> 331 F.3d 207, 212 (1st Cir.2003). Second, if the plaintiff makes out this prima facie case, the defendant must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for its actions. <i>See id.</i> Third, if the defendant carries this burden of production, the plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance, that the defendant's explanation is a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <i>See id.</i> The burden of persuasion remains at all times with the plaintiff. <i>See </i><i>Sher v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> 488 F.3d 489, 507 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Generally, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination by showing: 1) he is a member of a protected class, 2) he is qualified for the job, 3) the employer took an adverse employment action against him, and 4) the position remained open, or was filled by a person with similar qualifications. <i>See </i><i>Kosereis,</i> 331 F.3d at 212-13. This burden is \"not onerous,\" as only a \"small showing\" is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*222</span> required. <i>Id.</i> at 213; <i>see also id.</i> (noting that comparative evidence is treated as part of the pretext analysis, not as part of the plaintiff's prima facie case). In this case, appellant is a black Puerto Rican male and thus is a member of a protected class. We assume he was qualified for a provisional appointment as a Federal Air Marshal. Further, appellant has shown that TSA took at least one adverse employment against him (<i>i.e.,</i> he was terminated). Finally, appellant's position was undoubtedly filled by someone with similar qualifications. We, therefore, assume that appellant has established a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n<p>Next, we consider the government's nondiscriminatory rationales for its treatment of appellant. In regard to placement options, the government argues that no candidate who filled out a placement form at the same time as appellant was allowed to select Miami, Florida as a possible duty station. Concerning pay, the government claims that under an established list of neutral factors appellant's experience did not entitle him to a higher rate of basic pay. As to discipline, the government alleges that appellant's history of learning difficulties, serious safety violations, and untrustworthy behavior justified not only heightened monitoring of appellant but also his eventual suspension from the FLETC program. We conclude that the government has provided ample nondiscriminatory justifications for its actions.</p>\n<p>Now we must consider the evidence appellant has presented to show that the government's stated reasons for its actions are pretextual. <i>See </i><i>Kosereis,</i> 331 F.3d at 213 (stating that, as compared to a court's consideration of whether a plaintiff has established a prima facie case, \"pretext analysis . . . is more demanding\"). Most of appellant's proffered evidence of disparate treatment consists of either his own personal observations, or conversations he had with other trainees, which led him to believe he was the target of illegal discrimination. We, therefore, discuss generally the relevance of these personal observations and conversations to appellant's showing of pretext.</p>\n<p>Our review of appellant's statements, concerning his experiences at FLETC, assures us that they do not contain \"adequate specific factual information based on personal knowledge,\" to create a genuine issue of material fact. <i>Quinones v. Buick,</i> 436 F.3d 284, 290 (1st Cir.2006). On the contrary, these statements merely reflect appellant's \"subjective speculation and suspicion\" that he was treated unfairly. <i>Id.</i> Proof of more than appellant's subjective belief that he was the target of discrimination, however, is required. In order to establish a disparate treatment claim, a plaintiff must show that others \"similarly situated to him in all relevant respects were treated differently by the employer.\" <i>Kosereis,</i> 331 F.3d at 214.</p>\n<p>First, appellant offers no evidence whatsoever that TSA provided other trainees going through the hiring process at the same time as appellant a more comprehensive list of placement options. Second, the only hard evidence appellant presents in regard to pay demonstrates that TSA granted nearly half of the candidates who entered service with appellant the same amount of basic pay appellant received. This statistical evidence does not indicate that appellant was the target of illegal discrimination.</p>\n<p>Third, appellant alleges that a female candidate with concentration problems, similar to his own, was disciplined less harshly. He also claims that other candidates who committed safety violations, such as failing to properly store a weapon, were not punished. In addition, appellant argues that another trainee, who had difficulties <span class=\"star-pagination\">*223</span> during weapons training, was allowed to remain at FLETC until he passed the firearms course.</p>\n<p>What appellant has wholly failed to show, however, is that any of these candidates engaged in rule violations that were of the same level of seriousness as the offenses with which he was charged (<i>i.e.,</i> that they were similarly situated). <i>See </i><i>Kosereis,</i> 331 F.3d at 214. Instead, appellant focuses on contesting his instructor's assertions that his performance was unacceptable. In evaluating whether an employer's stated reasons for an adverse employment action are pretextual, however, our concern is not whether appellant was actually performing below expectations, but whether his employer \"believed that [he] was.\" <i>Feliciano de la Cruz,</i> 218 F.3d at 7.</p>\n<p>Appellant engages in much speculation. But he has failed to present reliable comparative evidence suggesting the government's actions were based not on his perceived failings, but on discriminatory animus. <i>Cf. </i><i>Ortiz García v. Toledo Fernández,</i> 405 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir.2005). Consequently, appellant cannot establish pretext in regards to his unwarranted discipline claim.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>To survive a defendant's motion for summary judgment on a discrimination claim, a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to two points: 1) the employer's articulated reasons for its adverse actions were pretextual, and 2) the real reason for the employer's actions was discriminatory animus based on a protected category. <i>See </i><i>Quinones,</i> 436 F.3d at 289-90; <i>Feliciano de la Cruz,</i> 218 F.3d at 6. Appellant has failed to make the first required showing that the government's stated reasons for its actions were pretextual. Therefore, his Title VII discrimination claim fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>We next consider appellant's Title VII retaliation claim. Title VII retaliation claims also proceed under the burden-shifting framework laid down in <i>McDonnell Douglas. See </i><i>Dixon v. Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers,</i> 504 F.3d 73, 81 &amp; n. 4 (1st Cir.2007); <i>supra</i> Part III.A (describing this framework). In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must establish three elements. First, the plaintiff must show that he engaged in a protected activity. <i>Id.</i> at 81. Second, the plaintiff must demonstrate he suffered a materially adverse action, which caused him harm, either inside or outside of the workplace. <i>See id.</i> The impact of this harm must be sufficient to dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. <i>See id.</i> Third, the plaintiff must show that the adverse action taken against him was causally linked to his protected activity. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>In this case, appellant undoubtedly engaged in a protected activity when he contacted TSA human resources department and the EEOC alleging he was the target of illegal discrimination. Furthermore, appellee's termination of appellant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*224</span> was a materially adverse action sufficient to dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.<sup>[6]</sup> In dispute is whether appellant has shown a causal connection between his allegations of discrimination and his subsequent termination. We conclude that the \"temporal proximity\" between appellant's allegations of discrimination in June 2002 and his termination in August 2002 is sufficient to meet the relatively light burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation. <i>Pomales v. Celulares Telefónica, Inc.,</i> 447 F.3d 79, 85 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>In support of appellant's termination, the government points out that appellant never accepted the administrative position offered to him in New York, nor reported for duty, despite having exhausted his leave. The government further argues that appellant failed to meet the terms of his conditional appointment as a federal air marshal. Appellant's failure to report for duty upon exhaustion of his leave, and his failure to meet the conditions of his original appointment as a federal air marshal, represent legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for appellant's discharge. Consequently, we conclude the government has offered a non-retaliatory justification for appellant's dismissal that is sufficient to overcome appellant's prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n<p>A more exacting examination of the sequence of events leading to appellant's discharge shows that Mariani was fired a few weeks after he went on unpaid leave. Given appellant's continued failure to accept an alternative position with TSA and return to work, the temporal proximity between appellant's complaints of discrimination and his discharge fails to raise an \"inference of retaliatory motive.\" <i>Colburn v. Parker Hannifin,</i> 429 F.3d 325, 338 (1st Cir.2005). Rather, appellant's termination at this time presumably reflects TSA's judgment that a more reliable employee could better fill the position offered to Mariani. <i>See </i><i>Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme Química P.R., Inc.,</i> 447 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.2006)(concluding that an employee's \"failure to return to work by a particular date\" constituted a valid reason for her termination). Under these facts, the temporal proximity between appellant's complaints of discrimination and his termination does not show that the government's justifications for firing appellant are pretextual.</p>\n<p>Appellant offers no additional evidence to show that the reasons the government offered for his termination are pretextual. While appellant engages in much speculation and conjecture, a plaintiff cannot defeat summary judgment by relying on \"conclusory allegations, or rank speculation.\" <i>Fontánez-Núñez,</i> 447 F.3d at 55. To defeat summary judgment, a plaintiff must make a colorable showing that an adverse action was taken \"for the purpose of retaliating\" against him. <i>Randlett v. Shalala,</i> 118 F.3d 857, 862 (1st Cir.1997). Appellant has not made this showing. Consequently, his Title VII claim for retaliation also fails.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  \"This, of course, does not mean the unopposed party wins on summary judgment; that party's uncontested facts and other evidentiary facts of record must still show that the party is entitled to summary judgment.\" <i>Torres-Rosado,</i> 335 F.3d at 4.</p>\n<p>[2]  Appellant does not allege that TSA allowed other similarly situated candidates to transfer. We, therefore, decline to consider this matter further. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Soler,</i> 275 F.3d 146, 155 n. 5 (1st Cir.2002)(noting that arguments not developed on appeal are waived).</p>\n<p>[3]  The record does not reflect the race of these candidates. Therefore, the Court cannot construct a racial distribution of basic pay offered to candidates who began service at the same time as appellant.</p>\n<p>[4]  Appellant merely alleges he requested that TSA send him a description of the position and the salary he would receive.</p>\n<p>[5]  Appellant also argues that: 1) one of his supervisors, Jerry Alicea, was not aware of the complaints concerning him, and 2) he never received a written warning. Appellant fails to explain, however, how these allegations support his claim of disparate treatment. For instance, appellant does not allege that all supervisors were generally aware of problems concerning all candidates, or that it was customary for candidates to receive written warnings. Because appellant has failed to develop these arguments, we consider them waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jíminez,</i> 498 F.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir.2007) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation are deemed waived.\").</p>\n<p>[6]  Appellant also argues that various happenings at FLETC support his claim for retaliation. Because these events occurred before appellant engaged in activity protected by Title VII (<i>i.e.,</i> before appellant complained of discrimination), we do not address these claims. <i>See </i><i>Torres-Negrón v. Merck &amp; Co.,</i> 488 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir.2007) (explaining that an employee engages in protected activity, for purposes of a Title VII retaliation claim, by opposing a practice made unlawful by Title VII, or by participating in any manner in an investigation or proceeding under Title VII).</p>\n\n</div>",

Appellant failed to graduate from the FLETC program. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), a division of appellee Department of Homeland Security, ultimately terminated his employment.</p>\n<p>Appellant brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico alleging two distinct violations of Title VII. First, appellant alleged he was discriminated against, in the course of his employment, based on his race, sex, color, and national origin. Second, appellant asserted he was discharged in retaliation for his administrative complaints of discrimination. The district court granted summary judgment to TSA on both claims.</p>\n<p>Appellant raises two issues on appeal. First, appellant challenges the district court's decision to deem appellee's statement of uncontested facts admitted because, according to the district court, appellant's response failed to comply with Local Rule 56(c).

Appellant worked as a correctional officer at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal prison facility in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. In May 2002 he applied for, and was granted, a provisional appointment as a federal air marshal. This appointment was conditioned on appellant's successful completion of a training program at FLETC. Upon successful completion of the program, candidates serve an additional twelve month probationary period before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*220</span> becoming permanent employees of the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS). FAMS is under the purview of TSA.</p>\n<p>During the hiring process, appellant filled out a duty location preference form. The form provided a list of available duty stations and appellant was able to rank his top eight choices. Out of the duty stations then available, appellant ranked New York, New York as his first choice. Consequently, TSA assigned appellant to its New York office. Later candidates were provided with a different list of possible duty stations. Appellant learned that some of these candidates had been able to list Miami on their preference forms. Subsequently, appellant requested a transfer to this location. TSA denied his request.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>One hundred and thirty nine candidates, including appellant, started service with FAMS on May 12, 2002.<sup>[3]</sup> Based on a list of qualifying factors, TSA gave sixty-five of these candidates, including appellant, a base annual salary of $36,400. Thus, TSA provided appellant with the same base salary as approximately forty-seven percent of federal air marshal candidates entering service at this time. TSA assigned seventy four candidates, or approximately fifty-three percent of the candidates entering service on May 12, 2002, an annual base salary greater than $36,400.</p>\n<p>While at FLETC, appellant experienced difficulties with his weapons training. Several incidents, involving the scoring of a target and an offhand comment appellant made relating to another individual shooting appellant's target for him, led certain FLETC officials to question appellant's integrity. Appellant did, however, achieve a passing score on at least one firearms test. Nevertheless, appellant's problems concentrating, and his apparent violation of several safety regulations while on the shooting range, led FLETC instructors to place him on \"safety watch.\" This resulted in appellant being more closely monitored. Appellant, however, was unaware that he was on safety watch. After incidents in which instructors alleged appellant improperly used deadly force and pointed his gun down range while another student was manually adjusting a target, FLETC officials suspended him from further firearms training.</p>\n<p>As a result of this suspension, appellant failed to graduate from FLETC. TSA placed him on administrative leave and appellant returned to Puerto Rico in June 2002. Shortly thereafter, appellant contacted TSA's human resources department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging he was the subject of illegal discrimination. After appellant made these allegations of discrimination, TSA offered him an administrative position in New York. No record evidence suggests appellant accepted this administrative position.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Instead, appellant requested to be put on sick leave. TSA granted this request. Appellant used up all of his sick leave and vacation time. Eventually, appellant went on unpaid leave. In August 2002, TSA sent appellant a termination letter, explaining <span class=\"star-pagination\">*221</span> that he was being terminated during his probationary period for failure to meet the requirements of his conditional appointment as a federal air marshal. More specifically, the letter referenced appellant's failure to graduate from the FLETC program due to multiple safety violations, appellant's failure to comprehend the proper use of deadly force, and the incident in which appellant allegedly asked another person to fire at his target in order to increase his shooting score.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Appellant raises two claims under Title VII. First, appellant alleges TSA discriminated against him by treating him differently than other federal air marshal candidates. Appellant argues this disparate treatment is evidenced by TSA giving him: 1) fewer placement options, 2) less pay, and 3) harsher discipline, based on his race, sex, color, and national origin. Second, appellant claims TSA fired him in retaliation for his administrative complaints concerning this discrimination.</p>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo</i> \"based on the record as it stood before the district court.\" <i>Fontánez-Núñez v. Janssen Ortho LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202200\"><a href=\"/opinion/202200/fontanez-nunez-v-janssen-ortho-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2006). In conducting our review, we \"view the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\" <i>Suarez,</i> 229 F.3d at 53. We may safely ignore, however, \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). Although employment discrimination cases deal with \"elusive concepts such as motive or intent,\" this standard compels summary judgment if the non-moving party rests his case \"merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Feliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199020\"><a href=\"/opinion/199020/feliciano-v-el-conquistador/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>We first address appellant's Title VII discrimination claim. Disparate treatment cases \"ordinarily proceed under the three-step, burden-shifting framework\" outlined in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1817</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1973). <i>Clifford v. Barnhart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202257\"><a href=\"/opinion/202257/clifford-v-barnhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span>, 280 (1st Cir.2006). First, the plaintiff must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, a prima facie case of discrimination. <i>See </i><i>Kosereis v. Rhode Island,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200505\"><a href=\"/opinion/200505/kosereis-v-department-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, 212 (1st Cir.2003). Second, if the plaintiff makes out this prima facie case, the defendant must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for its actions. <i>See id.</i> Third, if the defendant carries this burden of production, the plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance, that the defendant's explanation is a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <i>See id.</i> The burden of persuasion remains at all times with the plaintiff. <i>See </i><i>Sher v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202763\"><a href=\"/opinion/202763/sher-v-us-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 507 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Generally, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination by showing: 1) he is a member of a protected class, 2) he is qualified for the job, 3) the employer took an adverse employment action against him, and 4) the position remained open, or was filled by a person with similar qualifications. <i>See </i><i>Kosereis,</i> 331 F.3d at 212-13. This burden is \"not onerous,\" as only a \"small showing\" is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*222</span> required. <i>Id.</i> at 213; <i>see also id.</i> (noting that comparative evidence is treated as part of the pretext analysis, not as part of the plaintiff's prima facie case). In this case, appellant is a black Puerto Rican male and thus is a member of a protected class. We assume he was qualified for a provisional appointment as a Federal Air Marshal. Further, appellant has shown that TSA took at least one adverse employment against him (<i>i.e.,</i> he was terminated). Finally, appellant's position was undoubtedly filled by someone with similar qualifications. We, therefore, assume that appellant has established a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n<p>Next, we consider the government's nondiscriminatory rationales for its treatment of appellant. In regard to placement options, the government argues that no candidate who filled out a placement form at the same time as appellant was allowed to select Miami, Florida as a possible duty station. Concerning pay, the government claims that under an established list of neutral factors appellant's experience did not entitle him to a higher rate of basic pay. As to discipline, the government alleges that appellant's history of learning difficulties, serious safety violations, and untrustworthy behavior justified not only heightened monitoring of appellant but also his eventual suspension from the FLETC program. We conclude that the government has provided ample nondiscriminatory justifications for its actions.</p>\n<p>Now we must consider the evidence appellant has presented to show that the government's stated reasons for its actions are pretextual. <i>See </i><i>Kosereis,</i> 331 F.3d at 213 (stating that, as compared to a court's consideration of whether a plaintiff has established a prima facie case, \"pretext analysis . . . is more demanding\"). Most of appellant's proffered evidence of disparate treatment consists of either his own personal observations, or conversations he had with other trainees, which led him to believe he was the target of illegal discrimination. We, therefore, discuss generally the relevance of these personal observations and conversations to appellant's showing of pretext.</p>\n<p>Our review of appellant's statements, concerning his experiences at FLETC, assures us that they do not contain \"adequate specific factual information based on personal knowledge,\" to create a genuine issue of material fact. <i>Quinones v. Buick,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></span>, 290 (1st Cir.2006). On the contrary, these statements merely reflect appellant's \"subjective speculation and suspicion\" that he was treated unfairly. <i>Id.</i> Proof of more than appellant's subjective belief that he was the target of discrimination, however, is required. In order to establish a disparate treatment claim, a plaintiff must show that others \"similarly situated to him in all relevant respects were treated differently by the employer.\" <i>Kosereis,</i> 331 F.3d at 214.</p>\n<p>First, appellant offers no evidence whatsoever that TSA provided other trainees going through the hiring process at the same time as appellant a more comprehensive list of placement options. Second, the only hard evidence appellant presents in regard to pay demonstrates that TSA granted nearly half of the candidates who entered service with appellant the same amount of basic pay appellant received. This statistical evidence does not indicate that appellant was the target of illegal discrimination.</p>\n<p>Third, appellant alleges that a female candidate with concentration problems, similar to his own, was disciplined less harshly. He also claims that other candidates who committed safety violations, such as failing to properly store a weapon, were not punished. In addition, appellant argues that another trainee, who had difficulties <span class=\"star-pagination\">*223</span> during weapons training, was allowed to remain at FLETC until he passed the firearms course.</p>\n<p>What appellant has wholly failed to show, however, is that any of these candidates engaged in rule violations that were of the same level of seriousness as the offenses with which he was charged (<i>i.e.,</i> that they were similarly situated). <i>See </i><i>Kosereis,</i> 331 F.3d at 214. Instead, appellant focuses on contesting his instructor's assertions that his performance was unacceptable. In evaluating whether an employer's stated reasons for an adverse employment action are pretextual, however, our concern is not whether appellant was actually performing below expectations, but whether his employer \"believed that [he] was.\" <i>Feliciano de la Cruz,</i> 218 F.3d at 7.</p>\n<p>Appellant engages in much speculation. But he has failed to present reliable comparative evidence suggesting the government's actions were based not on his perceived failings, but on discriminatory animus. <i>Cf. </i><i>Ortiz García v. Toledo Fernández,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201543\"><a href=\"/opinion/201543/ortiz-garcia-v-aponte/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2005). Consequently, appellant cannot establish pretext in regards to his unwarranted discipline claim.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>To survive a defendant's motion for summary judgment on a discrimination claim, a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to two points: 1) the employer's articulated reasons for its adverse actions were pretextual, and 2) the real reason for the employer's actions was discriminatory animus based on a protected category. <i>See </i><i>Quinones,</i> 436 F.3d at 289-90; <i>Feliciano de la Cruz,</i> 218 F.3d at 6. Appellant has failed to make the first required showing that the government's stated reasons for its actions were pretextual. Therefore, his Title VII discrimination claim fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>We next consider appellant's Title VII retaliation claim. Title VII retaliation claims also proceed under the burden-shifting framework laid down in <i>McDonnell Douglas. See </i><i>Dixon v. Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></span>, 81 &amp; n. 4 (1st Cir.2007); <i>supra</i> Part III.A (describing this framework). In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must establish three elements. First, the plaintiff must show that he engaged in a protected activity. <i>Id.</i> at 81. Second, the plaintiff must demonstrate he suffered a materially adverse action, which caused him harm, either inside or outside of the workplace. <i>See id.</i> The impact of this harm must be sufficient to dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. <i>See id.</i> Third, the plaintiff must show that the adverse action taken against him was causally linked to his protected activity. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>In this case, appellant undoubtedly engaged in a protected activity when he contacted TSA human resources department and the EEOC alleging he was the target of illegal discrimination. Furthermore, appellee's termination of appellant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*224</span> was a materially adverse action sufficient to dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.<sup>[6]</sup> In dispute is whether appellant has shown a causal connection between his allegations of discrimination and his subsequent termination. We conclude that the \"temporal proximity\" between appellant's allegations of discrimination in June 2002 and his termination in August 2002 is sufficient to meet the relatively light burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation. <i>Pomales v. Celulares Telefónica, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202203\"><a href=\"/opinion/202203/pomales-v-celulares-telefonica/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>In support of appellant's termination, the government points out that appellant never accepted the administrative position offered to him in New York, nor reported for duty, despite having exhausted his leave. The government further argues that appellant failed to meet the terms of his conditional appointment as a federal air marshal. Appellant's failure to report for duty upon exhaustion of his leave, and his failure to meet the conditions of his original appointment as a federal air marshal, represent legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for appellant's discharge. Consequently, we conclude the government has offered a non-retaliatory justification for appellant's dismissal that is sufficient to overcome appellant's prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n<p>A more exacting examination of the sequence of events leading to appellant's discharge shows that Mariani was fired a few weeks after he went on unpaid leave. Given appellant's continued failure to accept an alternative position with TSA and return to work, the temporal proximity between appellant's complaints of discrimination and his discharge fails to raise an \"inference of retaliatory motive.\" <i>Colburn v. Parker Hannifin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201924\"><a href=\"/opinion/201924/colburn-v-parker-hannifin/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 338 (1st Cir.2005). Rather, appellant's termination at this time presumably reflects TSA's judgment that a more reliable employee could better fill the position offered to Mariani. <i>See </i><i>Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme Química P.R., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202204\"><a href=\"/opinion/202204/orta-castro-v-merck-sharp-dohme/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.2006)(concluding that an employee's \"failure to return to work by a particular date\" constituted a valid reason for her termination). Under these facts, the temporal proximity between appellant's complaints of discrimination and his termination does not show that the government's justifications for firing appellant are pretextual.</p>\n<p>Appellant offers no additional evidence to show that the reasons the government offered for his termination are pretextual. While appellant engages in much speculation and conjecture, a plaintiff cannot defeat summary judgment by relying on \"conclusory allegations, or rank speculation.\" <i>Fontánez-Núñez,</i> 447 F.3d at 55. To defeat summary judgment, a plaintiff must make a colorable showing that an adverse action was taken \"for the purpose of retaliating\" against him. <i>Randlett v. Shalala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743580\"><a href=\"/opinion/743580/79-fair-emplpraccas-bna-803-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45353-jean-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span>, 862 (1st Cir.1997). Appellant has not made this showing. Consequently, his Title VII claim for retaliation also fails.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  \"This, of course, does not mean the unopposed party wins on summary judgment; that party's uncontested facts and other evidentiary facts of record must still show that the party is entitled to summary judgment.\" <i>Torres-Rosado,</i> 335 F.3d at 4.</p>\n<p>[2]  Appellant does not allege that TSA allowed other similarly situated candidates to transfer. We, therefore, decline to consider this matter further. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Soler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199756\"><a href=\"/opinion/199756/united-states-v-soler/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 155 n. 5 (1st Cir.2002)(noting that arguments not developed on appeal are waived).</p>\n<p>[3]  The record does not reflect the race of these candidates. Therefore, the Court cannot construct a racial distribution of basic pay offered to candidates who began service at the same time as appellant.</p>\n<p>[4]  Appellant merely alleges he requested that TSA send him a description of the position and the salary he would receive.</p>\n<p>[5]  Appellant also argues that: 1) one of his supervisors, Jerry Alicea, was not aware of the complaints concerning him, and 2) he never received a written warning. Appellant fails to explain, however, how these allegations support his claim of disparate treatment. For instance, appellant does not allege that all supervisors were generally aware of problems concerning all candidates, or that it was customary for candidates to receive written warnings. Because appellant has failed to develop these arguments, we consider them waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jíminez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202892\"><a href=\"/opinion/202892/united-states-v-jiminez/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 88 (1st Cir.2007) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation are deemed waived.\").</p>\n<p>[6]  Appellant also argues that various happenings at FLETC support his claim for retaliation. Because these events occurred before appellant engaged in activity protected by Title VII (<i>i.e.,</i> before appellant complained of discrimination), we do not address these claims. <i>See </i><i>Torres-Negrón v. Merck &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202751\"><a href=\"/opinion/202751/torres-negron-v-merck-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2007) (explaining that an employee engages in protected activity, for purposes of a Title VII retaliation claim, by opposing a practice made unlawful by Title VII, or by participating in any manner in an investigation or proceeding under Title VII).</p>\n\n</div>",
