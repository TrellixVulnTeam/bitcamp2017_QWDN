In 2003, Ralph Cimon\n\n(\"Ralph\"), who had purchased a disability insurance policy from\n\nGuardian Life Insurance Company of America (\"Guardian\"), sued\n\nGuardian and Christopher Gaffney (\"Gaffney\"), the Guardian agent\n\nwho had sold him the policy, after Guardian terminated his policy\n\ndue to his failure to make a timely premium payment.      The suit was\n\nbrought in Maine.1    Guardian filed a motion for summary judgment\n\nand Gaffney filed a motion to dismiss.       In response to the motion\n\nto dismiss, Ralph filed a motion to transfer his claims against\n\nGaffney to the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts.   The district court granted both the motion for\n\nsummary judgment and the motion to dismiss, and it denied the\n\nmotion to transfer.   Ralph now seeks review of the grant of summary\n\njudgment and the denial of his request to transfer.      We affirm the\n\ngrant of the motion for summary judgment and vacate the denial of\n\nthe motion to transfer.\n\n                           I.   Background\n\n          We review the facts in the light most favorable to Ralph.\n\nSee, e.g., McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 391 F.3d 287, 290\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (recounting the facts \"in the light most favorable\n\nto the party opposing summary judgment\").\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The action was originally filed in state court, but it was\nremoved to the United States District Court for the District of\nMaine pursuant to that court's diversity jurisdiction.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f            In 1993, Guardian issued a disability insurance policy to\n\nRalph.2    The policy was \"Non-Cancellable and Guaranteed Renewable\n\nto Age 65\" and was \"issued in consideration of . . . the payment of\n\npremiums,\" which were to be paid on a quarterly basis.    The policy\n\nlisted \"only one condition for [its] renewal . . . :    the premiums\n\n[had to] be paid as [the policy] required.\"         And, the policy\n\nprovided that \"[t]he payment of any premium will not continue this\n\npolicy in force beyond the date when the next premium is due,\n\nexcept for [a thirty-one day] grace period . . . .\"\n\n             From 1993 to 2000, Ralph timely paid his premiums.\n\nHowever, he failed to pay his quarterly premium that was due in\n\nDecember 2000 and failed to make subsequent payments due in March\n\n2001, June 2001, and September 2001.\n\n             Late in the summer of 2000, Ralph and his wife, Jean\n\nCimon (\"Jean\"), moved from Massachusetts to Maine.          Prior to\n\nmoving, Jean mailed a change of address card to Guardian.     At the\n\ntime of the move, Jean also called Gaffney to inform him of the\n\nmove.     During the call, Jean gave Gaffney their new Maine address\n\nand telephone number, and she attempted to schedule an appointment\n\nfor Ralph so that he and Gaffney could discuss his insurance\n\ncoverage.     Gaffney, however, told Jean that he was busy and would\n\n\n\n     2\n      In 2001, Guardian merged with, and became the successor in\ninterest to, Berkshire Life Insurance Company, which actually\nissued the policy in question. For ease of reference, we refer to\nthe relevant insurance company as Guardian throughout.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fcall her back at a more convenient time.   Gaffney never called Jean\n\nback, and Jean did not make any further attempt to contact Gaffney.\n\n           On November 29, 2000, Guardian sent Ralph a letter\n\nstating that he had a premium payment due on December 28, 2000.\n\nThe premium due date came and went without Guardian receiving a\n\npayment.   On January 28, 2001, Guardian sent Ralph a second letter\n\nin which it offered to accept a late payment.     Then, on March 6,\n\n2001, having still not received the December 28, 2000 payment,\n\nGuardian sent Ralph a third letter informing him that his policy\n\nhad lapsed.3    Ralph did not receive any of the letters, which were\n\napparently sent to an incorrect address in Maine.\n\n           From 1993 to 2000, Ralph had received letters on a\n\nquarterly basis alerting him of his premium payment due dates.   By\n\n2000, Ralph had become accustomed to, and relied on, receiving such\n\nletters.     In fact, Ralph paid his premiums only after receiving\n\nnotice that payments were due.    Thus, because Ralph never received\n\na letter reminding him to pay his December 28, 2000 premium, he\n\nnever paid that premium (or the three premiums due thereafter).\n\n           In October of 2001, Ralph became disabled.   On November\n\n16, 2001, Jean called Guardian and learned that the policy had been\n\ncancelled.     On November 27, 2001, Ralph sent a letter to Guardian\n\n\n\n     3\n      It is not clear whether this final letter stated that the\npolicy had already lapsed or that the policy would lapse if Ralph\nfailed to pay the premium by a specified date. For purposes of\nthis appeal, we assume it said that the policy had already lapsed.\n\n                                 -4-\n\frequesting that the policy be reinstated and giving notice that he\n\nintended to file a claim pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 24\n\nif Guardian refused his request.5   Ralph also sent Guardian a check\n\nfor the unpaid premiums. Guardian refused to reinstate the policy.\n\n          As a result, in October 2003, Ralph sued Guardian and\n\nGaffney in Maine, claiming that he was entitled to damages because\n\nthe two \"breached numerous duties of care\" they owed to him under\n\nthe policy in connection with their failure to ensure that premium\n\nnotices were sent to his correct address.       In addition, Ralph\n\nalleged that he was entitled to recover under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n93A, § 2 for Guardian and Gaffney's refusal to settle his claim and\n\nreinstate the policy.6   Ralph also asserted that the two breached\n\nthe policy, and should be estopped from terminating the policy, due\n\nto their failure to send premium notices to his correct address.\n\n          In response, Guardian filed a motion for summary judgment\n\nand Gaffney filed a motion to dismiss. Guardian, citing Mass. Gen.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The statute states that \"[u]nfair methods of competition and\nunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade\nor commerce are . . . unlawful.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2(a).\n     5\n      It is not clear from the record whether Ralph sent a similar\nletter to Gaffney.\n     6\n      \"Unfair claim settlement practices\" constitute unfair methods\nof competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the\nbusiness of insurance under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2. Mass.\nGen. Laws ch. 176D, § 3(9).\n\n                                -5-\n\fLaws ch. 175, § 110B,7 insisted that it was entitled to summary\n\njudgment because the policy had lapsed as a matter of law.8      The\n\ndistrict court agreed and allowed Guardian's motion.9      Gaffney\n\nmoved for dismissal based on lack of personal jurisdiction.10 Ralph\n\n\n\n     7\n      Section 110B provides:\n     No policy of insurance . . . , except a policy which by\n     its terms is cancellable by the company or is renewable\n     or continuable with its consent, or except a policy the\n     premiums for which are payable monthly or at shorter\n     intervals, shall terminate or lapse for nonpayment of any\n     premium until the expiration of three months from the due\n     date of such premium, unless the company within not less\n     than ten nor more than forty-five days prior to said due\n     date, shall have mailed . . . a notice showing the amount\n     of such premium and its due date. Such notice shall also\n     contain a statement as to the lapse of the policy if no\n     payment is made as provided in the policy. If such a\n     notice is not so sent, the premium in default may be paid\n     at any time within said period of three months. . . . No\n     action shall be maintained on any policy to which this\n     section applies and which has lapsed for nonpayment of\n     any premium unless such action is commenced within two\n     years from the due date of such premium.\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 110B.\n     8\n      In moving for summary judgment, Guardian also argued that all\nof Ralph's claims were time-barred pursuant to the last sentence of\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 110B. See supra note 7. The district\ncourt did not address this argument and, without passing on its\nmerits, neither do we.\n     9\n      Because the district court found that \"the policy terminated\nby law [due to the fact that the December 2000 premium remained\nunpaid three months after it was due] without any requirement of\nnotice to [Ralph],\" and because all of Ralph's claims against\nGuardian were based on its refusal to accede to his demand that the\npolicy be reinstated and its failure to send premium notices to his\ncorrect address, the district court decided that Guardian was\nentitled to summary judgment.\n     10\n      Gaffney also moved for dismissal based on improper venue and\nRalph's failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.\n\n                                -6-\n\fresponded by filing a motion to transfer the action against Gaffney\n\nto Massachusetts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631.11       In granting\n\nGaffney's motion to dismiss, the district court ruled that it\n\nlacked personal jurisdiction and that transfer would not be in the\n\ninterest of justice.12   Ralph seeks review of the district court's\n\ngrant of Guardian's motion for summary judgment and refusal to\n\ntransfer the action against Gaffney.13\n\n                           II.   Discussion\n\n            We first consider whether the district court erred in\n\ngranting Guardian's motion for summary judgment and then decide\n\nwhether it erred in denying Ralph's motion to transfer.\n\nA.          The Grant of Guardian's Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n            We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de\n\nnovo.     GTE Wireless, Inc. v. Cellexis Int'l, Inc., 341 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).      Summary judgment is appropriate only if the\n\nrecord reveals \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\n\n     11\n      Ralph also responded by arguing that the court could exercise\njurisdiction over Gaffney. Section 1631 of Title 28 provides:\n     Whenever a civil action is filed in a court . . . and\n     that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction,\n     the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice,\n     transfer such action . . . to any other such court in\n     which the action . . . could have been brought at the\n     time it was filed . . . .\n     12\n      The district court determined that transfer would not be in\nthe interest of justice solely because it was granting Guardian's\nmotion for summary judgement.\n     13\n      Ralph does not challenge the district court's ruling that it\nlacked personal jurisdiction over Gaffney.\n\n                                 -7-\n\ffact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).       We may affirm a grant of\n\nsummary judgment on any ground supported by the record. See Geffon\n\nv. Micrion Corp., 249 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            The district court granted Guardian's motion for summary\n\njudgment based on its finding that, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175,\n\n§ 110B,14 Ralph's policy automatically terminated when he failed to\n\npay the December 2000 premium within three months of its due date.\n\nWe think that the district court was wrong to interpret section\n\n110B as providing for automatic termination of a policy after three\n\nmonths for nonpayment of a premium.              We read the statute as\n\nproviding a degree of protection for the insured by putting limits\n\non an insurance company's contractual ability to cancel a policy\n\nbased on nonpayment of a premium; we do not read it as providing\n\nfor termination as a matter of law.           Still, the statute does not\n\nprohibit    an   insurance   company   from    terminating   a   policy--in\n\naccordance with the policy's terms--for nonpayment of a premium.\n\nRather, it simply provides that a policy cannot be terminated for\n\nnonpayment of a premium until three months after the date on which\n\nthe premium was due (unless notice was sent in accordance with the\n\nstatute).    See supra note 7.\n\n\n\n\n     14\n      There is no dispute that Massachusetts law governs this\naction.\n\n                                   -8-\n\f           Here, the policy stated that it would terminate due to a\n\nmissed premium payment:        \"The payment of any premium will not\n\ncontinue this policy in force beyond the date when the next premium\n\nis due . . . .\"15   And, starting with the December 28, 2000 payment,\n\nRalph missed four consecutive premium payments and did not attempt\n\nto tender a late payment until November of 2001.         Thus, regardless\n\nof whether Guardian sent notice of the December 28, 2000 payment\n\ndeadline, the policy terminated pursuant to its terms on March 28,\n\n2001--three months after the due date of the first missed premium\n\nand well before Ralph attempted to tender a late payment in\n\nNovember of that year.16\n\n          Ralph     argues   that   Guardian   should   be   estopped   from\n\nterminating the policy pursuant to his nonpayment of the December\n\n28, 2000 premium because he relied on Guardian to send notices of\n\n\n\n     15\n      Although the policy stated that there would be a grace period\nfollowing a missed premium payment of only thirty-one days, we have\nnot been presented with sufficient evidence that Guardian complied\nwith section 110B's premium notice requirement.      Therefore, we\ncannot say that Guardian was entitled to terminate the policy at\nthe end of the thirty-one day grace period (that is, prior to the\nexpiration of section 110B's three-month period).\n     16\n      Although Guardian sent Ralph notice that the policy had\nlapsed on March 6, 2001, prior to the date on which the policy\ncould have been terminated according to section 110B, that does not\nalter our conclusion that the policy terminated for nonpayment\nbefore Ralph tendered payment for the missed premium. To be sure,\nhad Ralph tendered payment on, for example, March 21, 2001 (after\nthe date of the lapse notice but before the expiration of section\n110B's three-month period), we would be dealing with a different\ncase.   But, he did not tender payment until November 2001 and,\nthus, cannot take advantage of Guardian's premature lapse notice.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fpremium payment deadlines before making such payments17 and Guardian\n\nfailed to send proper notice of the December 28, 2000 deadline.18\n\nTo establish that Guardian should be estopped from terminating the\n\npolicy due to the missed premium, Ralph must convince us that,\n\namong other things, there is an equitable defense available to an\n\ninsured   who   violates   a   contractual   obligation   and   he   acted\n\nreasonably in relying on Guardian to remind him of the December 28,\n\n2000 payment deadline before making that payment.          See Turnpike\n\nMotors, Inc. v. Newbury Group, Inc., 596 N.E.2d 989, 993 (Mass.\n\n1992) (\"It is . . . necessary . . . that the reliance of the party\n\nseeking the benefit of estoppel must have been reasonable.\").\n\n           We think that even if there were an equitable defense\n\navailable, Ralph would not be entitled to invoke it because his\n\nreliance on Guardian to remind him of the December 28, 2000 payment\n\ndeadline was unreasonable. Ralph missed four consecutive quarterly\n\npayments (and, in so doing, failed to tender a premium payment for\n\nmore than a year) due to his claimed reliance on Guardian.       Ralph's\n\nreliance was patently unreasonable, and therefore, he would not be\n\n\n\n\n     17\n      Guardian had in fact sent Ralph notices of his premium\npayment deadlines for seven years.\n     18\n      Guardian maintains that because Ralph did not respond in the\ndistrict court to its argument that the policy terminated due to\nhis failure to pay premiums, he has forfeited his right to advance\nhis estoppel argument on appeal. We decline Guardian's invitation\nto rule on that ground.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fentitled to benefit from an equitable remedy even if one were\n\navailable.\n\n            Because the policy terminated according to its terms on\n\nMarch 28, 2001 due to a missed premium payment (regardless of\n\nwhether Guardian sent suitable notice of the payment deadline),\n\nRalph's claims, other than his estoppel claim, fail.    And, because\n\nRalph cannot show that his failure to pay the missed premium was\n\nreasonable, his estoppel claim likewise fails.         The grant of\n\nGuardian's motion for summary judgment is affirmed.\n\nB.          The Refusal to Transfer the Action Against Gaffney\n\n            We now address whether the district court erred in\n\ndenying Ralph's motion to transfer the action against Gaffney from\n\nMaine to Massachusetts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631.    We review a\n\nrefusal to transfer for abuse of discretion.   See Hill v. U.S. Air\n\nForce, 795 F.2d 1067, 1070 (D.C. Cir. 1986).\n\n            Section 1631 directs a district court to transfer a case\n\nin which there is \"a want of jurisdiction, . . . if [transfer] is\n\nin the interest of justice.\"    Here, the district court determined\n\nthat transfer would not be in the interest of justice because it\n\nwas granting Guardian's motion for summary judgement. The district\n\ncourt's determination would have been reasonable if Ralph's claims\n\nagainst Gaffney were entirely derivative of his claims against\n\nGuardian.    But, we do not understand that to be the case; rather,\n\nwe understand Ralph's claims against Gaffney to rest on independent\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fobligations that Gaffney owed to Ralph. For example, Ralph's claim\n\nthat Gaffney \"breached numerous duties of care\" is premised in part\n\non Gaffney's duty to inform Guardian of Ralph's new Maine address.\n\nAccordingly, we find that the district court erred in denying the\n\nmotion to transfer on the ground given.\n\n          Nevertheless, it may be that there are other grounds on\n\nwhich to deny transfer, as urged on us by Gaffney.   See Britell v.\n\nUnited States, 318 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"[I]f an action .\n\n. . is fanciful or frivolous, it is in the interest of justice to\n\ndismiss it rather than to keep it on life support (with the\n\ninevitable result that the transferee court will pull the plug).\").\n\nThe relevant claims were based on a conversation that Jean had with\n\nGaffney late in the summer of 2000, more than three years before\n\nRalph filed suit in the fall of 2003.     Consequently, it appears\n\nthat the common law claims against Gaffney are time-barred.    See\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A (\"Except as otherwise provided,\n\nactions of tort, actions of contract to recover for personal\n\ninjuries, and actions of replevin, shall be commenced only within\n\nthree years next after the cause of action accrues.\").\n\n          Although the remaining claim, based on Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 93A, is not time-barred, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 5A\n\n(\"Actions arising on account of violations of any law intended for\n\nthe protection of consumers, including . . . chapter ninety-three\n\nA[,] . . . shall be commenced only within four years next after the\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fcause of action accrues.\"), it nonetheless is barred if Ralph\n\nfailed to provide Gaffney with the pre-suit notice required by\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(3).19    See, e.g., Entrialgo v. Twin\n\nCity Dodge, Inc., 333 N.E.2d 202, 204 (Mass. 1975) (\"A demand\n\nletter listing the specific deceptive practices claimed is a\n\nprerequisite to suit and as a special element must be alleged and\n\nproved.\").   Although Ralph sent a letter that gave notice of his\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A claim to Guardian, it is not clear that he\n\nalso sent a copy of that letter to Gaffney.\n\n          In light of the above, we vacate the denial of Gaffney's\n\nmotion to transfer20 and remand the action against Gaffney for the\n\n\n\n\n     19\n      According to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(3), \"[a]t least\nthirty days prior to the filing of [a chapter 93A] action, a\nwritten demand for relief, identifying the claimant and reasonably\ndescribing the unfair or deceptive act or practice relied upon and\nthe injury suffered, shall be mailed or delivered to any\nprospective respondent.\"\n     20\n      Gaffney argues that transfer of the claims against him would\nbe improper under 28 U.S.C. § 1631 because that statute \"directs a\ncourt to transfer an 'action' over which it lacks jurisdiction,\nrather than an individual claim.\"     Hill, 795 F.2d at 1070.    We\ndecline the invitation to affirm the district court on this ground.\nBecause the district court granted Guardian's motion for summary\njudgment, the claims asserted against Gaffney were the only claims\nthat remained in the action. Thus, even if the transfer statute\nprohibits the transfer of some but not all claims in an action (and\nwe question whether it does), it would not prohibit transfer under\nthe circumstances of this case. Cf. United States v. County of\nCook, 170 F.3d 1084, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (finding that Congress\n\"inten[ded] . . . § 1631 to permit the transfer of less than all of\nthe claims in an action\").\n\n                               -13-\n\fdistrict court to reconsider whether transfer is in the interest of\n\njustice.21\n\n\n     21\n      We note that there is a debate over whether 28 U.S.C. § 1631\nprovides for transfers only where a federal court lacks subject\nmatter jurisdiction, or whether it also applies where other types\nof jurisdiction are lacking, including personal jurisdiction.\nCompare Roman v. Ashcroft, 340 F.3d 314, 328 (6th Cir. 2003)\n(concluding that \"§ 1631 . . . applies to federal courts\nidentifying any jurisdictional defect, regardless of whether it\ninvolves personal or subject matter jurisdiction.\"), and Renner v.\nLanard Toys Ltd., 33 F.3d 277, 284 (3d Cir. 1994) (indicating that\nwhere personal jurisdiction is lacking, a court may consider a\ntransfer pursuant to § 1631), and Ross v. Colo. Outward Bound Sch.,\nInc., 822 F.2d 1524, 1526-27 (10th Cir. 1987) (same), with\nSongbyrd, Inc. v. Estate of Grossman, 206 F.3d 172, 179 n.9 (2d\nCir. 2000) (noting that \"the legislative history of section 1631\nprovides some reason to believe that this section authorizes\ntransfers only to cure lack of subject matter jurisdiction\"), and\nPedzewick v. Foe, 963 F. Supp. 48, 50 (D. Mass. 1997) (\"agree[ing]\nwith the line of cases limiting section 1631 to transfer for lack\nof subject matter jurisdiction only\"), and 15 Charles Alan Wright\net al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 3842 (2d ed. 1986)\n(\"[Section   1631]   is   concerned   only  with   subject   matter\njurisdiction. It has nothing to do with personal jurisdiction or\nvenue.\"). Those that construe § 1631 narrowly do so in reliance on\nthe statute's legislative history, see, e.g., Pedzewick, 963 F.\nSupp. at 50 (noting that a Senate report issued when Congress\nenacted § 1631, S. Rep. No. 97-275, at 11 (1987), reprinted in 1982\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 11, 21, 40, states in part that the statute \"would\nauthorize the court in which a case is improperly filed to transfer\nit to a court where subject matter jurisdiction is proper\"), while\nthose that read the statute expansively generally rely on its\nlanguage and Congress' intent in passing it, see, e.g., Roman, 340\nF.3d at 328 (observing that \"[t]he language of § 1631 does not\nrefer to any specific type of jurisdiction, only referring broadly\nto jurisdiction\" and that \"a broad construction of the statute is\nconsistent with Congress's intent to protect a plaintiff against\neither additional expense or the expiration of a relevant statute\nof limitations in the event that the plaintiff makes an error in\ntrying to select the proper court within the complex federal court\nsystem\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).       Although we are\ninclined to read § 1631 as allowing for transfers where a federal\ncourt lacks any type of jurisdiction (including personal\njurisdiction), we need not definitely decide the issue today, as\nGaffney did not defend the district court's denial of Ralph's\n\n                               -14-\n\fThe grant of Guardian's motion for summary judgment is affirmed;\n\nthe denial of Gaffney's motion to transfer is vacated and the\n\naction against Gaffney is remanded for proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n\n\n\nmotion to transfer by arguing that § 1631 does not permit transfer\nto cure defects in personal jurisdiction.

The suit was brought in Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Guardian filed a motion for summary judgment and Gaffney filed a motion to dismiss. In response to the motion to dismiss, Ralph filed a motion to transfer his claims against Gaffney to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The district court granted both the motion for summary judgment and the motion to dismiss, and it denied the motion to transfer. Ralph now seeks review of the grant of summary judgment and the denial of his request to transfer. We affirm the grant of the motion for summary judgment and vacate the denial of the motion to transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the facts in the light most favorable to Ralph. <i>See, e.g., McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 391 F.3d 287, 290 (1st Cir.2004) (recounting the facts \"in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Guardian issued a disability insurance policy to Ralph.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The policy was \"Non-Cancellable and Guaranteed Renewable to Age 65\" and was \"issued in consideration of ... the payment of premiums,\" which were to be paid on a quarterly basis. The policy listed \"only one condition for [its] renewal...: the premiums [had to] be paid as [the policy] required.\" And, the policy provided that \"[t]he payment of any premium will not continue this policy in force beyond the date when the next premium is due, except for [a thirty-one day] grace period....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1993 to 2000, Ralph timely paid his premiums. However, he failed to pay his quarterly premium that was due in December 2000 and failed to make subsequent payments due in March 2001, June 2001, and September 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Late in the summer of 2000, Ralph and his wife, Jean Cimon (\"Jean\"), moved from Massachusetts to Maine. Prior to moving, Jean mailed a change of address card to Guardian. At the time of the move, Jean also called Gaffney to inform him of the move. During the call, Jean gave Gaffney their new Maine address and telephone number, and she attempted to schedule an appointment for Ralph so that he and Gaffney could discuss his insurance coverage. Gaffney, however, told Jean that he was busy and would call her back at a more convenient time. Gaffney never called Jean back, and Jean did not make any further attempt to contact Gaffney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 2000, Guardian sent Ralph a letter stating that he had a premium payment due on December 28, 2000. The premium due date came and went without Guardian receiving a payment. On January 28, 2001, Guardian sent Ralph a second letter in which it offered to accept a late payment. Then, on March 6, 2001, having still not received the December 28, 2000 payment, Guardian sent Ralph a third letter informing him that his policy had lapsed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Ralph did not receive any of the letters, which were apparently sent to an incorrect address in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1993 to 2000, Ralph had received letters on a quarterly basis alerting him of his premium payment due dates. By 2000, Ralph had become accustomed to, and relied on, receiving such letters. In fact, Ralph paid his premiums only after receiving notice that payments were due. Thus, because Ralph never received a letter reminding him to pay his December 28, 2000 premium, he never paid that premium (or the three premiums due thereafter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 2001, Ralph became disabled. On November 16, 2001, Jean called Guardian and learned that the policy had been cancelled. On November 27, 2001, Ralph sent a letter to Guardian requesting that the policy be reinstated and giving notice that he intended to file a claim pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 2<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> if Guardian refused his request.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Ralph also sent Guardian a check for the unpaid premiums. Guardian refused to reinstate the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, in October 2003, Ralph sued Guardian and Gaffney in Maine, claiming that he was entitled to damages because the two \"breached numerous duties of care\" they owed to him under the policy in connection with their failure to ensure that premium notices were sent to his correct address. In addition, Ralph alleged that he was entitled to recover under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 2 for Guardian and Gaffney's refusal to settle his claim and reinstate the policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Ralph also asserted that the two breached the policy, and should be estopped from terminating the policy, due to their failure to send premium notices to his correct address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Guardian filed a motion for summary judgment and Gaffney filed a motion to dismiss. Guardian, citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 110B,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> insisted that it was entitled to summary judgment because the policy had lapsed as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The district court agreed and allowed Guardian's motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Gaffney moved for dismissal based on lack of personal jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Ralph responded by filing a motion to transfer the action against Gaffney to Massachusetts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> In granting Gaffney's motion to dismiss, the district court ruled that it lacked personal jurisdiction and that transfer would not be in the interest of justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Ralph seeks review of the district court's grant of Guardian's motion for summary judgment and refusal to transfer the action against Gaffney.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider whether the district court erred in granting Guardian's motion for summary judgment and then decide whether it erred in denying Ralph's motion to transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Grant of Guardian's Motion for Summary Judgment</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment <i>de novo. GTE Wireless, Inc. v. Cellexis Int'l, Inc.,</i> 341 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate only if the record reveals \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record. <i>See Geffon v. Micrion Corp.,</i> 249 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted Guardian's motion for summary judgment based on its finding that, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 110B,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Ralph's policy <i>automatically</i> terminated when he failed to pay the December 2000 premium within three months of its due date. We think that the district court was wrong to interpret section 110B as providing for automatic termination of a policy after three months for nonpayment of a premium. We read the statute as providing a degree of protection for the insured by putting limits on an insurance company's contractual ability to cancel a policy based on nonpayment of a premium; we do not read it as providing for termination as a matter of law. Still, the statute does not prohibit an insurance company from terminating a policy &#8212; <i>in accordance with the policy's terms</i> &#8212; for nonpayment of a premium. Rather, it simply provides that a policy cannot be terminated for nonpayment of a premium until three months after the date on which the premium was due (unless notice was sent in accordance with the statute). <i>See supra</i> note 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the policy stated that it would terminate due to a missed premium payment: \"The payment of any premium will not continue this policy in force beyond the date when the next premium is due....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> And, starting with the December 28, 2000 payment, Ralph missed four consecutive premium payments and did not attempt to tender a late payment until November of 2001. Thus, regardless of whether Guardian sent notice of the December 28, 2000 payment deadline, the policy terminated <i>pursuant to its terms</i> on March 28, 2001 &#8212; three months after the due date of the first missed premium and well before Ralph attempted to tender a late payment in November of that year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ralph argues that Guardian should be estopped from terminating the policy pursuant to his nonpayment of the December 28, 2000 premium because he relied on Guardian to send notices of premium payment deadlines before making such payments<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> and Guardian failed to send proper notice of the December 28, 2000 deadline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> To establish that Guardian should be estopped from terminating the policy due to the missed premium, Ralph must convince us that, among other things, there is an equitable defense available to an insured who violates a contractual obligation and he acted reasonably in relying on Guardian to remind him of the December 28, 2000 payment deadline before making that payment. <i>See Turnpike Motors, Inc. v. Newbury Group, Inc.,</i> 413 Mass. 119, 596 N.E.2d 989, 993 (1992) (\"It is ... necessary ... that the reliance of the party seeking the benefit of estoppel must have been reasonable.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that even if there were an equitable defense available, Ralph would not be entitled to invoke it because his reliance on Guardian to remind him of the December 28, 2000 payment deadline was unreasonable. Ralph missed four consecutive quarterly payments (and, in so doing, failed to tender a premium payment for more than a year) due to his claimed reliance on Guardian. Ralph's reliance was patently unreasonable, and therefore, he would not be entitled to benefit from an equitable remedy even if one were available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the policy terminated according to its terms on March 28, 2001 due to a missed premium payment (regardless of whether Guardian sent suitable notice of the payment deadline), Ralph's claims, other than his estoppel claim, fail. And, because Ralph cannot show that his failure to pay the missed premium was reasonable, his estoppel claim likewise fails. The grant of Guardian's motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Refusal to Transfer the Action Against Gaffney</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now address whether the district court erred in denying Ralph's motion to transfer the action against Gaffney from Maine to Massachusetts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631. We review a refusal to transfer for abuse of discretion. <i>See Hill v. U.S. Air Force,</i> 795 F.2d 1067, 1070 (D.C.Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1631 directs a district court to transfer a case in which there is \"a want of jurisdiction, ... if [transfer] is in the interest of justice.\" Here, the district court determined that transfer would not be in the interest of justice because it was granting Guardian's motion for summary judgement. The district court's determination would have been reasonable if Ralph's claims against Gaffney were entirely derivative of his claims against Guardian. But, we do not understand that to be the case; rather, we understand Ralph's claims against Gaffney to rest on independent obligations that Gaffney owed to Ralph. For example, Ralph's claim that Gaffney \"breached numerous duties of care\" is premised in part on Gaffney's duty to inform Guardian of Ralph's new Maine address. Accordingly, we find that the district court erred in denying the motion to transfer on the ground given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, it may be that there are other grounds on which to deny transfer, as urged on us by Gaffney. <i>See Britell v. United States,</i> 318 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.2003) (\"[I]f an action ... is fanciful or frivolous, it is in the interest of justice to dismiss it rather than to keep it on life support (with the inevitable result that the transferee court will pull the plug).\"). The relevant claims were based on a conversation that Jean had with Gaffney late in the summer of 2000, more than three years before Ralph filed suit in the fall of 2003. Consequently, it appears that the common law claims against Gaffney are time-barred. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &#167; 2A (\"Except as otherwise provided, actions of tort, actions of contract to recover for personal injuries, and actions of replevin, shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the remaining claim, based on Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, is not time-barred, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &#167; 5A (\"Actions arising on account of violations of any law intended for the protection of consumers, including... chapter ninety-three A[,] ... shall be commenced only within four years next after the cause of action accrues.\"), it nonetheless is barred if Ralph failed to provide Gaffney with the pre-suit notice required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 9(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> <i>See, e.g., Entrialgo v.

Lanard Toys Ltd.,</i> 33 F.3d 277, 284 (3d Cir.1994) (indicating that where personal jurisdiction is lacking, a court may consider a transfer pursuant to &#167; 1631), <i>and Ross v. Colo. Outward Bound Sch., Inc.,</i> 822 F.2d 1524, 1526-27 (10th Cir.1987) (same), <i>with SongByrd, Inc. v.

Those that construe &#167; 1631 narrowly do so in reliance on the statute's legislative history, <i>see, e.g., Pedzewick,</i> 963 F.Supp. at 50 (noting that a Senate report issued when Congress enacted &#167; 1631, S.Rep.

Although we are inclined to read &#167; 1631 as allowing for transfers where a federal court lacks any type of jurisdiction (including personal jurisdiction), we need not definitely decide the issue today, as Gaffney did not defend the district court's denial of Ralph's motion to transfer by arguing that &#167; 1631 does not permit transfer to cure defects in personal jurisdiction. <i>See Smilow v.

The policy listed \"only one condition for [its] renewal...: the premiums [had to] be paid as [the policy] required.\" And, the policy provided that \"[t]he payment of any premium will not continue this policy in force beyond the date when the next premium is due, except for [a thirty-one day] grace period....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1993 to 2000, Ralph timely paid his premiums.

Prior to moving, Jean mailed a change of address card to Guardian. At the time of the move, Jean also called Gaffney to inform him of the move. During the call, Jean gave Gaffney their new Maine address and telephone number, and she attempted to schedule an appointment for Ralph so that he and Gaffney could discuss his insurance coverage. Gaffney, however, told Jean that he was busy and would call her back at a more convenient time. Gaffney never called Jean back, and Jean did not make any further attempt to contact Gaffney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 29, 2000, Guardian sent Ralph a letter stating that he had a premium payment due on December 28, 2000. The premium due date came and went without Guardian receiving a payment. On January 28, 2001, Guardian sent Ralph a second letter in which it offered to accept a late payment. Then, on March 6, 2001, having still not received the December 28, 2000 payment, Guardian sent Ralph a third letter informing him that his policy had lapsed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Ralph did not receive any of the letters, which were apparently sent to an incorrect address in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1993 to 2000, Ralph had received letters on a quarterly basis alerting him of his premium payment due dates. By 2000, Ralph had become accustomed to, and relied on, receiving such letters. In fact, Ralph paid his premiums only after receiving notice that payments were due. Thus, because Ralph never received a letter reminding him to pay his December 28, 2000 premium, he never paid that premium (or the three premiums due thereafter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 2001, Ralph became disabled. On November 16, 2001, Jean called Guardian and learned that the policy had been cancelled. On November 27, 2001, Ralph sent a letter to Guardian requesting that the policy be reinstated and giving notice that he intended to file a claim pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 2<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> if Guardian refused his request.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Ralph also sent Guardian a check for the unpaid premiums.

In addition, Ralph alleged that he was entitled to recover under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 2 for Guardian and Gaffney's refusal to settle his claim and reinstate the policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Ralph also asserted that the two breached the policy, and should be estopped from terminating the policy, due to their failure to send premium notices to his correct address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Guardian filed a motion for summary judgment and Gaffney filed a motion to dismiss.

Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 110B,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Ralph's policy <i>automatically</i> terminated when he failed to pay the December 2000 premium within three months of its due date. We think that the district court was wrong to interpret section 110B as providing for automatic termination of a policy after three months for nonpayment of a premium. We read the statute as providing a degree of protection for the insured by putting limits on an insurance company's contractual ability to cancel a policy based on nonpayment of a premium; we do not read it as providing for termination as a matter of law. Still, the statute does not prohibit an insurance company from terminating a policy &#8212; <i>in accordance with the policy's terms</i> &#8212; for nonpayment of a premium. Rather, it simply provides that a policy cannot be terminated for nonpayment of a premium until three months after the date on which the premium was due (unless notice was sent in accordance with the statute). <i>See supra</i> note 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the policy stated that it would terminate due to a missed premium payment: \"The payment of any premium will not continue this policy in force beyond the date when the next premium is due....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> And, starting with the December 28, 2000 payment, Ralph missed four consecutive premium payments and did not attempt to tender a late payment until November of 2001. Thus, regardless of whether Guardian sent notice of the December 28, 2000 payment deadline, the policy terminated <i>pursuant to its terms</i> on March 28, 2001 &#8212; three months after the due date of the first missed premium and well before Ralph attempted to tender a late payment in November of that year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ralph argues that Guardian should be estopped from terminating the policy pursuant to his nonpayment of the December 28, 2000 premium because he relied on Guardian to send notices of premium payment deadlines before making such payments<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> and Guardian failed to send proper notice of the December 28, 2000 deadline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> To establish that Guardian should be estopped from terminating the policy due to the missed premium, Ralph must convince us that, among other things, there is an equitable defense available to an insured who violates a contractual obligation and he acted reasonably in relying on Guardian to remind him of the December 28, 2000 payment deadline before making that payment. <i>See Turnpike Motors, Inc. v.

The district court's determination would have been reasonable if Ralph's claims against Gaffney were entirely derivative of his claims against Guardian. But, we do not understand that to be the case; rather, we understand Ralph's claims against Gaffney to rest on independent obligations that Gaffney owed to Ralph. For example, Ralph's claim that Gaffney \"breached numerous duties of care\" is premised in part on Gaffney's duty to inform Guardian of Ralph's new Maine address. Accordingly, we find that the district court erred in denying the motion to transfer on the ground given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, it may be that there are other grounds on which to deny transfer, as urged on us by Gaffney. <i>See Britell v.

The relevant claims were based on a conversation that Jean had with Gaffney late in the summer of 2000, more than three years before Ralph filed suit in the fall of 2003. Consequently, it appears that the common law claims against Gaffney are time-barred. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &#167; 2A (\"Except as otherwise provided, actions of tort, actions of contract to recover for personal injuries, and actions of replevin, shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the remaining claim, based on Mass.

Laws ch. 260, &#167; 5A (\"Actions arising on account of violations of any law intended for the protection of consumers, including... chapter ninety-three A[,] ... shall be commenced only within four years next after the cause of action accrues.\"), it nonetheless is barred if Ralph failed to provide Gaffney with the pre-suit notice required by Mass.

To be sure, had Ralph tendered payment on, for example, March 21, 2001 (after the date of the lapse notice but before the expiration of section 110B's three-month period), we would be dealing with a different case.

We decline the invitation to affirm the district court on this ground. Because the district court granted Guardian's motion for summary judgment, the claims asserted against Gaffney were the only claims that remained in the action. Thus, even if the transfer statute prohibits the transfer of some but not all claims in an action (and we question whether it does), it would not prohibit transfer under the circumstances of this case. <i>Cf.

It has nothing to do with personal jurisdiction or venue.\"). Those that construe &#167; 1631 narrowly do so in reliance on the statute's legislative history, <i>see, e.g., Pedzewick,</i> 963 F.Supp. at 50 (noting that a Senate report issued when Congress enacted &#167; 1631, S.Rep. No. 97-275, at 11 (1987), <i>reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 11, 21, 40, states in part that the statute \"would authorize the court in which a case is improperly filed to transfer it to a court where subject matter jurisdiction is proper\"), while those that read the statute expansively generally rely on its language and Congress' intent in passing it, <i>see, e.g., Roman,</i> 340 F.3d at 328 (observing that \"[t]he language of &#167; 1631 does not refer to any specific type of jurisdiction, only referring broadly to jurisdiction\" and that \"a broad construction of the statute is consistent with Congress's intent to protect a plaintiff against either additional expense or the expiration of a relevant statute of limitations in the event that the plaintiff makes an error in trying to select the proper court within the complex federal court system\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Although we are inclined to read &#167; 1631 as allowing for transfers where a federal court lacks any type of jurisdiction (including personal jurisdiction), we need not definitely decide the issue today, as Gaffney did not defend the district court's denial of Ralph's motion to transfer by arguing that &#167; 1631 does not permit transfer to cure defects in personal jurisdiction. <i>See Smilow v.
