For more than three decades, those\n\nwho advocate for a woman's right to choose and those who advocate\n\nfor the right to life (based on a belief that life begins at the\n\nmoment   of    conception)     have   struggled   for   advantage   in     the\n\nmarketplace of ideas.    A series of pitched battles, forming a part\n\nof this struggle, has been waged at free-standing abortion clinics,\n\nwhere protestors and anti-abortion counselors seek to dissuade\n\nprospective patients, shame clinic workers, and call attention to\n\nwhat they perceive as the evils of voluntary terminations of\n\npregnancies.       In   this     campaign   Massachusetts    has    been     a\n\nbattleground state.\n\n           This appeal arises out of yet another skirmish in this\n\nchronicle of discord.    In a very real sense, genesis of the appeal\n\ndates back to the dawning of the millennium.            At that time, the\n\nMassachusetts legislature enacted a statute that created a floating\n\nbuffer zone around the entrances, exits, and driveways of abortion\n\nclinics throughout the state.1\n\n           Given the benefit of hindsight, the legislature revised\n\nthe law seven years later.        The modified version of the statute\n\nreplaced the floating buffer zone with a 35-foot fixed buffer zone.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       The mechanics of the 2000 Act and the dimensions of the\nthen-current buffer zone are described in earlier opinions of this\ncourt. See McGuire v. Reilly, 386 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2004);\nMcGuire v. Reilly, 260 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fThis appeal involves a multi-pronged facial challenge to the\n\nconstitutionality of the modified statute.\n\n           In a thoughtful and comprehensive opinion, the district\n\ncourt rejected the facial challenge in all its iterations and\n\nrefused to enjoin enforcement of the new law. McCullen v. Coakley,\n\n573 F. Supp. 2d 382 (D. Mass. 2008).       After careful consideration\n\nof the record, the parties' briefs, some helpful friend-of-the-\n\ncourt briefs, and the arguments made orally, we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           In this case, as in so many cases, the past informs the\n\npresent.   We start there.\n\n           By the end of the twentieth century, Massachusetts had\n\nexperienced repeated incidents involving violence and other unduly\n\naggressive behaviors in the vicinity of reproductive health care\n\nfacilities (RHCFs).    Choosing among a host of possible preventive\n\nmeasures, the legislature took up a bill that proposed creating a\n\nfixed   25-foot   buffer   zone   around   the   entrances,   exits,   and\n\ndriveways of RHCFs.\n\n           The state senate held a hearing on the bill in April 1999\n\nand received evidence of widespread harassment and intimidation\n\noutside RHCFs.    Numerous witnesses addressed not only the peculiar\n\nvulnerability of women seeking abortion services but also the\n\ndeleterious effects of overly aggressive demonstrations on both\n\npatient and provider safety.       The senate concluded that existing\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\flaws    did   not    adequately   safeguard   clinic    staff,   prospective\n\npatients, or members of the public.\n\n              As part of its due diligence, the senate asked the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) for an advisory opinion\n\non the constitutionality of the proposed law. The SJC discerned no\n\nconstitutional impediment.        Opinion of the Justices to the Senate,\n\n723 N.E.2d 1, 6 (Mass. 2000).\n\n              The senate subsequently engrossed a bill intended to\n\nenhance public safety in and around RHCFs while maintaining the\n\nrelatively free flow of traffic.           See Mass. S. Jour., Feb. 29,\n\n2000.    That bill resembled the original senate bill.\n\n              Before the house of representatives could act on the\n\nsenate bill, the United States Supreme Court decided Hill v.\n\nColorado, in which the Justices upheld, as a content-neutral time,\n\nplace, and manner restriction, a Colorado statute designed to\n\nameliorate the same panoply of evils through the use of a floating\n\nbuffer zone.        530 U.S. 703, 707-08 (2000).       The Colorado statute\n\nsynthesized the fixed and floating buffer zone concepts, making it\n\nunlawful within a 100-foot fixed zone for any person, in the\n\nabsence of consent, to \"knowingly approach\" within eight feet of\n\nanother person \"for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill\n\nto, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education,\n\nor counseling with such other person.\" Id. at 707 (quoting Colo.\n\nRev. Stat. ยง 18-9-122(3)).\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           The Massachusetts legislature recognized that Hill had\n\nshed new light on the legal landscape.               Thus, the house tabled the\n\nsenate bill and repaired to the drawing board.                    The legislature\n\neventually enacted a law that was loosely patterned on the Colorado\n\nstatute.     See   An   Act    Relative        to    Reproductive    Health    Care\n\nFacilities (2000 Act), S.B. 148, 181st Gen. Ct. (Mass. Aug. 10,\n\n2000).   The key component of the 2000 Act was a prohibition against\n\nknowingly approaching within six feet of another without consent\n\nfor   certain   defined   protest-related             purposes.      Because   the\n\nprohibition only operated within an 18-foot fixed buffer zone\n\naround RHCF entrances, exits, and driveways, it mimicked the\n\nColorado law in combining floating and fixed buffer zone concepts.\n\n           A group of Massachusetts residents who wished to protest\n\nin front of RHCFs mounted both facial and as-applied challenges to\n\nthe   constitutionality       of   the    new       enactment.      In   successive\n\ndecisions, we rejected those challenges.                  See McGuire v. Reilly\n\n(McGuire I), 260 F.3d 36, 51 (1st Cir. 2001) (rejecting facial\n\nchallenges); McGuire v. Reilly (McGuire II), 386 F.3d 45, 65-66 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (rejecting renewed facial challenges as well as as-\n\napplied challenges).\n\n           Over time, legislators became concerned that the statute\n\nhad failed to achieve its desired goals.               In 2007, the legislature\n\nheld public hearings devoted to the need for rewriting the statute.\n\nTestimony (including statements from law enforcement officials and\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fclinic workers) revealed unanticipated difficulties in enforcing the\n\n2000 Act and called into question that Act's efficacy.             The upshot\n\nwas    a    decision   to   reshape   the   law   by,   among   other   things,\n\nrepudiating the floating buffer zone concept and relying instead on\n\na 35-foot fixed buffer zone.\n\n              On November 8, 2007, the legislature enacted the revised\n\nlaw.       See An Act Relative to Public Safety at Reproductive Health\n\nCare Facilities (2007 Act), S.B. 1353, 185th Gen. Ct. (Mass. Nov.\n\n13, 2007).      It declares that \"[n]o person shall knowingly enter or\n\nremain on a public way or sidewalk adjacent to [an RHCF]\" within a\n\ndesignated buffer zone.         Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, ยง 120E 1/2(b)\n\n(2007).      The Act describes the new buffer zone as comprising\n\n              a radius of 35 feet of any portion of an\n              entrance, exit or driveway of a reproductive\n              health care facility or within the area within\n              a rectangle created by extending the outside\n              boundaries of any entrance, exit or driveway of\n              a reproductive health care facility in straight\n              lines to the point where such lines intersect\n              the sidelines of the street in front of such\n              entrance, exit or driveway.\n\nId.    Moreover, the law prohibits all persons from entering or\n\nremaining within the buffer zone during ordinary business hours,\n\nsubject to exceptions for four classes of persons, namely:\n\n              (1) persons entering or leaving such facility;\n\n              (2) employees or agents of such facility acting\n              within the scope of their employment;\n\n              (3) law enforcement, ambulance, firefighting,\n              construction, utilities, public works and other\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            municipal agents acting within the scope of\n            their employment; and\n\n            (4) persons using the public sidewalk or street\n            right-of-way adjacent to such facility solely\n            for the purpose of reaching a destination other\n            than such facility.\n\nId.    Each of these exceptions derives from the 2000 Act.                And the\n\n2007 Act, like the 2000 Act, also requires that the buffer zone be\n\nclearly marked.      See id.\n\n            On January 25, 2008, the Attorney General sent a letter\n\nto an audience that included law enforcement and RHCF personnel.\n\nThe letter purports to summarize the provisions of the 2007 Act and\n\nto    furnish    \"guidance   to    assist    .   .   .   in   applying   the   four\n\nexemptions.\"      This guidance comprises four paragraphs, set forth\n\nverbatim in an appendix to this opinion.\n\nII.    TRAVEL OF THE CASE\n\n            On    January    16,    2008,    plaintiffs-appellants        Eleanor\n\nMcCullen, Jean Blackburn Zarrella, Gregory A. Smith, Carmel Farrell,\n\nand Eric Caden, all Massachusetts residents who regularly engage in\n\npro-life counseling outside RHCFs, sued the Attorney General of\n\nMassachusetts, in her representative capacity, in the federal\n\ndistrict court.      Their complaint invoked 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, limned\n\na constellation of constitutional claims, and prayed for declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief aimed at derailing the 2007 Act.                    Without\n\nobjection, the district court bifurcated the case into facial and\n\nas-applied challenges. As to the former, the court consolidated the\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fpreliminary injunction hearing with the hearing on the merits, see\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2), and began a bench trial on May 28, 2008.\n\n            In due season, the court issued a decision denying relief.\n\nMcCullen, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 425.          This interlocutory appeal\n\nfollowed.    We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(a)(1).\n\nIII. ANALYSIS\n\n            We begin our odyssey by outlining the legal standards that\n\napply generally to facial challenges and then proceed to the myriad\n\nprongs of the plaintiffs' facial challenge.       Because the issues\n\nraised on appeal implicate the First Amendment, they engender de\n\nnovo review.    See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union, 466 U.S. 485, 508\n\n(1984).\n\n                       A.    General Standards.\n\n            Around the edges, the standards that apply in evaluating\n\nfacial challenges to the constitutionality of statutes are not\n\nentirely clear.   See Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Commentary, As-applied\n\nand Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L. Rev.\n\n1321, 1322-23 (2000).       For present purposes, though, the path is\n\nreasonably well-lighted.\n\n            The Supreme Court recently has stated that a facial\n\nchallenge will fail if a statute \"has a plainly legitimate sweep.\"\n\nWash. State Grange v. Wash. State Repub. Party, 128 S. Ct. 1184,\n\n1190 (2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).      This\n\nis a refinement of its earlier statement that a party mounting a\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\ffacial challenge \"must establish that no set of circumstances exists\n\nunder which the Act would be valid.\"   United States v. Salerno, 481\n\nU.S. 739, 745 (1987).   Howsoever worded, this standard imposes a\n\nvery heavy burden on a party who mounts a facial challenge to a\n\nstate statute.\n\n          The statute at issue here implicates freedom of speech.\n\nJustice Cardozo long ago observed that freedom of speech is \"the\n\nindispensable condition . . . of nearly every other form of\n\nfreedom.\" Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 327 (1937). But even\n\nso precious a freedom must, in particular iterations, be balanced\n\nagainst the government's legitimate interests in protecting public\n\nhealth and safety.   See, e.g., Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S.\n\n47, 52 (1919) (\"The most stringent protection of free speech would\n\nnot protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre.\") (Holmes,\n\nJ.).\n\n          In striking this delicate balance, a court must calibrate\n\nthe scales differently depending on the nature of the governmental\n\naction.   McGuire I, 260 F.3d at 42.   That calibration takes place\n\nalong a continuum.   See Berner v. Delahanty, 129 F.3d 20, 28 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).   At one end of the continuum are laws in which the\n\ngovernment attempts to differentiate between divergent views on a\n\nsingular subject; that is, laws in which the government attempts to\n\n\"pick and choose among similarly situated speakers in order to\n\nadvance or suppress a particular ideology or outlook.\"    Id.   Such\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fviewpoint-based discrimination is highly offensive to the core\n\nvalues    of    the   First     Amendment,   and    courts     are   wary   of   such\n\nencroachments. See, e.g., Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ.\n\nof Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995).\n\n               Even when a law does not favor one particular viewpoint\n\nover another, governmental restrictions on the content of speech may\n\nbe impermissible.            See Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S.\n\n622, 641-42 (1994).           At this stage of the continuum, a reviewing\n\ncourt must start with a presumption that such a content-based\n\nregulation is constitutionally suspect. R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul,\n\n505 U.S. 377, 383 (1992); Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham,\n\n43 F.3d 731, 736 (1st Cir. 1995).            That presumption can be rebutted\n\nby   a   showing      that    the   regulation     is   both   necessary    to   the\n\nfurtherance of a compelling state interest and narrowly tailored to\n\nthe achievement of that interest.              See, e.g., Boos v. Barry, 485\n\nU.S. 312, 321 (1988).\n\n               Further along the continuum are laws that do not regulate\n\nspeech per se but, rather, regulate the time, place, and manner in\n\nwhich speech may occur. Because such time-place-manner restrictions\n\nare by definition content-neutral, they tend to burden speech only\n\nincidentally; that is, they burden speech for reasons unrelated to\n\neither the speaker's viewpoint or the speech's content.                 See Turner\n\nBroad., 512 U.S. at 642.            Regulations of this type will be upheld\n\nas long as \"they are justified without reference to the content of\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthe regulated speech, . . . are narrowly tailored to serve a\n\nsignificant governmental interest, and . . . leave open ample\n\nalternative channels for communication of the information.\"      Ward\n\nv. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989) (quoting Clark v.\n\nCmty. for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984)).      This\n\nmore relaxed standard, familiarly known as \"intermediate scrutiny,\"\n\nis justified because the fact that a regulation is both content-\n\nneutral and viewpoint-neutral helps to ensure that government is not\n\nusing the regulation as a sub rosa means of interfering in areas to\n\nwhich First Amendment protections pertain.   See Turner Broad., 512\n\nU.S. at 642.\n\n                      B.   Content Neutrality.\n\n          What we have said to this point leads naturally to the\n\nthreshold question in this case.   The district court found the 2007\n\nAct to be content-neutral.   McCullen, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 403.    The\n\nplaintiffs demur.   Because the resolution of this dispute will\n\ndetermine the contours of our subsequent analysis (including the\n\nappropriate level of scrutiny), we tackle this question first.\n\n          Our principal inquiry in this regard, both in speech cases\n\ngenerally and in time-place-manner cases specifically, \"is whether\n\nthe government has adopted a regulation of speech because of\n\ndisagreement with the message it conveys.\"   Ward, 491 U.S. at 781.\n\n\"Thus, a law designed to serve purposes unrelated to the content of\n\nprotected speech is deemed content-neutral even if, incidentally,\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fit has an adverse effect on certain messages while leaving others\n\nuntouched.\"       McGuire I, 260 F.3d at 43; accord McGuire II, 386 F.3d\n\nat 57.\n\n            The lower court, relying mainly on Hill, 530 U.S. at 719-\n\n20, determined that the 2007 Act was content-neutral because it did\n\nnot regulate speech โ merely the places in which speech might occur.\n\nMcCullen, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 403.               Moreover, the law was enacted in\n\nresponse to legitimate safety and law enforcement concerns, and was\n\njustified by those objectives without reference to the content of\n\nany speech.       Id.\n\n            The     plaintiffs       resist       this    characterization.        They\n\nacknowledge that the statute has a content-neutral patina, but they\n\ninsist that this patina masks a more sinister reality.                     They point\n\nto several \"facts\" which, in their estimation, collectively indicate\n\nthat the legislature's abiding motive was to curb anti-abortion\n\nspeech.    Specifically, the plaintiffs assert that the expanded size\n\nof   the   buffer       zone   is   suspicious;       that    the   zone   itself,   as\n\nreconfigured, contradicts its stated \"public safety\" goal in that\n\nit causes more safety hazards than it abates; that the legislature\n\ndeliberately drew its evidence from biased sources, in effect\n\nlistening    to    only    one      side   of   the      story;   that   this   court's\n\ncharacterizations of the 2000 Act, McGuire I, 260 F.3d at 49, belie\n\nthe legislators' professed concerns about enforcement of that law;\n\nand that the nonexistent \"emergency\" referenced in the preamble to\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fthe 2007 Act is a figment of the legislators' collective imagination\n\n(and thus, a cover-up for the legislature's real agenda).\n\n           Although a few of the factual components of this broadside\n\nare new and others have been refurbished or reworked, the broadside\n\nitself is on the order of one that was leveled against the 2000 Act\n\nand soundly rebuffed in McGuire I.          There, we wrote:\n\n           To be sure, the plaintiffs insist that the\n           state's professed concerns about public safety,\n           personal security, and access to medical\n           facilities are mere pretexts for its desire to\n           censor anti-abortion speech. This insistence\n           gets them nowhere.      For one thing, their\n           insinuations are unsupported by any record\n           evidence.       For   another   thing,    where\n           differential treatment is justified, on an\n           objective basis, by the government's content-\n           neutral effort to combat secondary effects, it\n           is insufficient that a regulation may have been\n           adopted in direct response to the negative\n           impact of a particular form of speech.\n\nId. at 45.   So it is here.\n\n           As in McGuire I, the plaintiffs' basic complaint is that\n\nalleged   deficiencies   in   the    factual    record    compiled   by   the\n\nlegislature โ gaps, distortions, mischaracterizations, and the like\n\nโ compel an inference of pretext.              But as in McGuire I, our\n\nindependent review of the record confirms that the legislative\n\nfactfinding adequately underpins what the legislature wrought.             We\n\nneed not cite book and verse.              Although the plaintiffs, ably\n\nrepresented,   have   done    a   thorough     job   of   fly-specking    the\n\nlegislative record, their claim of pretext is no more effective than\n\nwas the counterpart claim advanced in McGuire I.           Consequently, it\n\n                                    -13-\n\fis enough to note our wholehearted agreement with the district court\n\nthat the record is \"replete with factual references to specific\n\nincidents and patterns of problematic behavior around RHCFs.\"\n\nMcCullen, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 405.         In the final analysis, the claim\n\nof factual inadequacy amounts to little more than wishful thinking.\n\n             We nonetheless consider it wise to embellish two points.\n\nFirst, the fact that we spoke approvingly of the 2000 Act did not\n\nserve to freeze the statute in place.         The legislature had a right\n\n(some might say an obligation) to monitor the statute's operation\n\nand    to   revisit   the   matter   if   experience   revealed   unexpected\n\nproblems.     See Ward, 491 U.S. at 800; Nat'l Amusements, 43 F.3d at\n\n742.\n\n             Second, the test for content neutrality does not require\n\nproof that the legislature's response to a perceived problem be the\n\nonly solution or even the best solution; it simply requires that the\n\nevidence support a conclusion that the regulation is in service to\n\na legitimate governmental interest unrelated to expressive content.\n\nMcGuire II, 386 F.3d at 58; McGuire I, 260 F.3d at 44.            In grading\n\na regulation's efficacy under this test, a reviewing court must\n\ngrant a significant degree of respect to the legislature's judgment.\n\nSee Turner Broad., 520 U.S. at 195. Viewed through this deferential\n\nprism, the factfinding that undergirds the 2007 Act easily attains\n\na passing grade.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f           In a related vein, the plaintiffs maintain that several\n\nfeatures of the 2007 Act themselves constitute either content-based\n\nor viewpoint-based discrimination.       These features include the\n\nexception for clinic employees and agents, the statute's alleged\n\nunder-inclusiveness (i.e., the fact that the legislature did not\n\nextend it to other types of free-standing medical clinics), and the\n\nAttorney General's guidance letter.\n\n           This three-faceted structural argument is not original.\n\nWithout exception, claims analogous to those that comprise it were\n\naddressed in our earlier decisions anent the 2000 Act.   See McGuire\n\nII, 386 F.3d at 56-59; McGuire I, 260 F.3d at 44-47.           Those\n\ndecisions render superfluous any exegetic discussion of the current\n\nversion of the structural argument.      For now, it suffices to say\n\nthat the mere fact that a content-neutral law has a disparate impact\n\non particular kinds of speech is insufficient, without more, to\n\nground an inference that the disparity results from a content-based\n\npreference.   See McGuire II, 386 F.3d at 57; McGuire I, 260 F.3d at\n\n44.   Here, there is no \"more.\"\n\n           To be sure, the plaintiffs strive to distinguish our\n\nearlier decisions and add the missing integers to the equation.\n\nOnly two of these efforts deserve comment.\n\n           The argument that the law is content-based due to the\n\nexception permitting those persons associated with RHCFs (e.g.,\n\nclinic workers and patients) but not others to enter the buffer zone\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fwas squarely raised and squarely repulsed in McGuire I, 260 F.3d at\n\n45-47.       The present plaintiffs try to give that argument a new\n\ntwist.       They posit that the very size and nature of a 35-foot fixed\n\nbuffer zone somehow changes the constitutional calculus and makes\n\nthis       exception   less    defensible.       This   is    whistling   past     the\n\ngraveyard.\n\n               The decisive question in a facial challenge is not whether\n\na regulation is necessary to achieve the legislature's stated goal\n\nbut, rather, whether a court can glean legitimate reasons for its\n\nexistence.        See    id.   at   47.      This   principle       applies   to   the\n\nconfiguration of the buffer zone selected by the legislature.                      The\n\nsize of that zone need only be reasonably related to the attainment\n\nof the legislature's goal.           That some might think a 25-foot or 30-\n\nfoot buffer zone sufficient is not the issue.\n\n               Here,    moreover,     differences       in    the    buffer    zone's\n\ndimensions and other characteristics do not tip the constitutional\n\nbalance. Regardless of those differences, the exception for persons\n\nassociated       with    RHCFs      remains      reasonably     related       to   the\n\nlegislature's legitimate public safety objectives.                      No more is\n\nexigible to reject this aspect of the plaintiffs' facial challenge.2\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       This same reasoning also serves to defeat the plaintiffs'\nequal protection and viewpoint discrimination claims, each of which\nfocuses on the legislature's decision to limit the reach of the\nrelevant exception to persons associated with RHCFs.\n\n                                          -16-\n\f            Second,      the   plaintiffs       maintain    that    the   Attorney\n\nGeneral's       interpretive   guidance        (reprinted    in    the    appendix)\n\ndemonstrates      that   the   2007   Act      is   not   content-neutral.       In\n\nparticular, they highlight the passage in the guidance letter in\n\nwhich the Attorney General uses the phrase \"abortion and partisan\n\nspeech.\"    The force of this attack is dissipated by our decision in\n\nMcGuire II, 386 F.3d at 58, in which we explained that a state\n\nofficial's       interpretation    of    a     statute,     even   if     generally\n\nauthoritative, cannot render an otherwise constitutional statute\n\nvulnerable to a facial challenge.\n\n            In sum, we find nothing in either the text                      or   the\n\nlegislative history of the 2007 Act that deprives that statute of\n\ncontent-neutral status.         We proceed, therefore, with intermediate\n\nscrutiny, recognizing that the constitutionality of the 2007 Act\n\nturns on whether it is narrowly tailored and allows sufficient\n\nalternative means of communication.             See, e.g., Clark, 468 U.S. at\n\n293.\n\n           C.    Narrow Tailoring/Channels of Communication.\n\n            A regulation is narrowly tailored if it (i) facilitates\n\na substantial governmental interest that would be less effectively\n\nserved without the regulation and (ii) accomplishes this end without\n\nburdening substantially more speech than necessary.                Ward, 491 U.S.\n\nat 799.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f           The first element of this two-part definition is not\n\nseriously disputed here.    The interests ascribed by the legislature\n\nto the 2007 Act (enhancing public safety around RHCFs, improving\n\ntraffic flow, and the like) are the same as those that we deemed\n\nboth proper and substantial in McGuire I, 260 F.3d at 48 (describing\n\nthose interests as \"precisely the sort of interests that justify\n\nsome incidental burdening of First Amendment rights\").\n\n           It is the second part of the definition that draws the\n\nplaintiffs' fire: they argue that the 2007 Act regulates too much\n\nspeech.   But this argument rests on a misconception; it assumes\n\nthat, in order to survive intermediate scrutiny, a law (and within\n\na law, a buffer zone) must burden no more speech than is absolutely\n\nnecessary to accomplish the law's legitimate purpose.\n\n           Perscrutation of the plaintiffs' briefs makes it apparent\n\nthat this misconception arises out of a misreading of the Court's\n\ndecisions in Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network, Inc., 519 U.S. 357\n\n(1997), and Madsen v. Women's Health Center, 512 U.S. 753 (1994).\n\nIn each instance, the Court applied a \"no greater restriction than\n\nnecessary\" standard to determine the validity of an injunction. See\n\nSchenck, 519 U.S. at 374; Madsen, 512 U.S. at 765.       But injunctions\n\n(which bind only the parties in a particular case and those in\n\nprivity with them) are more targeted than statutes (which apply\n\nbroadly   to   all   concerned).    This   is   a   critically   important\n\ndistinction; the Court has made it pellucid that the absence of\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fgeneral applicability subjects injunctions to a stricter standard\n\nthan legislative enactments.          See Madsen, 512 U.S. at 764-65; cf.\n\nRy. Exp. Agency, Inc. v. New York, 336 U.S. 106, 112 (1949)\n\n(\"[T]here is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary\n\nand unreasonable government than to require that the principles of\n\nlaw which officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed\n\ngenerally.\")     (Jackson,    J.,     concurring).      A   law   of   general\n\napplication passes muster under narrow tailoring principles as long\n\nas it is not substantially broader than necessary to accomplish the\n\nlegislature's legitimate goal.         See Ward, 491 U.S. at 799; see also\n\nMadsen, 512 U.S. at 764.\n\n             Ward supplies the measuring stick that we must wield. The\n\n2007 Act is a law of general application.            Given that it promotes\n\na substantial public interest, McGuire I, 260 F.3d at 48, the\n\ndecisive question is whether it burdens substantially more speech\n\nthan necessary to serve that purpose.          If the answer to that query\n\nis in the negative, the law does not offend the First Amendment\n\n\"simply because a court concludes that the government's interest\n\ncould   be    adequately     served    by    some    less-speech-restrictive\n\nalternative.\"     Ward, 491 U.S. at 800.       This means, of course, that\n\n\"a judge's agreement with the responsible decisionmaker concerning\n\nthe most appropriate method for promoting significant government\n\ninterests or the degree to which those interests should be promoted\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fare not conditions precedent to upholding a time-place-manner\n\nrestriction.      Id.\n\n            That conclusion effectively        ends this aspect of the\n\nmatter.    Testimony from law enforcement officers and clinic workers\n\nattested to the ineffectiveness of the preexisting law.             Against\n\nthat backdrop, the legislature determined, after considerable study,\n\nthat the state's declared interests would be better served by\n\nreconfiguring the buffer zone around RHCFs. The legislature labored\n\nto balance First Amendment concerns with public safety concerns, see\n\nMcCullen, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 397-98 (recounting evidence), mulled\n\nthe advantages and disadvantages of variously configured buffer\n\nzones, and decided (reasonably, we think) that a 35-foot fixed\n\nbuffer zone made sense.         Given the deference that is owed to such\n\nlegislative judgments, see Turner Broad., 520 U.S. at 195, we cannot\n\nsay that the 2007 Act is substantially broader than necessary.\n\n            The   fact   that    the   legislature   reached   a   different\n\nconclusion seven years earlier (when it preferred a smaller buffer\n\nzone that had both floating and fixed components) does not undercut\n\nthis conclusion.         After all, legislative choice is a dynamic\n\nprocess.    Simply because a legislature previously has attempted to\n\naddress a particular problem in one way does not disable it from\n\ntaking a different approach at a later time.          See, e.g., Ward, 491\n\nU.S. at 800 (justifying increased regulation based on evidence of\n\ninadequacy of municipality's prior attempts to combat noise); Nat'l\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fAmusements, 43 F.3d at 742 n.9 (similar); cf. Rust v. Sullivan, 500\n\nU.S. 173, 187 (1991) (affirming agency's reversal of position while\n\nnoting that in exercising legislatively delegated authority agency\n\nis free to consider \"the wisdom of its policy on a continuing\n\nbasis\").   Experience is often the best teacher, and the incremental\n\nnature of the legislature's actions seems more a virtue than a vice.\n\nOn these facts, the legislature's judgment must be respected.         See\n\nTurner Broad., 520 U.S. at 195.\n\n           Relatedly, the plaintiffs suggest that the 2007 Act is\n\nconstitutionally infirm because it amounts to a ban on handbilling\n\nand interferes with the provision of an eight-to-fifteen-foot\n\n\"constitutional   conversational    distance.\"    That   suggestion   is\n\njejune.\n\n           Contrary to the plaintiffs' importunings, the Constitution\n\nneither recognizes nor gives special protection to any particular\n\nconversational distance.     See, e.g., Schenck, 519 U.S. at 380\n\n(upholding a fixed 15-foot buffer zone).          By the same token,\n\nhandbilling is not specially protected.    See Heffron v. Int'l Soc'y\n\nfor Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 654 (1981).        Time-\n\nplace-manner   regulations   routinely    make   particular   forms   of\n\nexpression impracticable without raising constitutional concerns.\n\nSee, e.g., Hill, 530 U.S. at 726-28. As we explained in Bl(a)ck Tea\n\nSociety v. City of Boston, 378 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 2004), there is\n\nno constitutional guarantee of any particular form or mode of\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fexpression.     The correct inquiry is whether, in light of the\n\ntotality   of   the   circumstances,   a   time-place-manner      regulation\n\nburdens substantially more speech than necessary and, concomitantly,\n\nwhether such a regulation leaves open adequate alternative channels\n\nof communication.     See Clark, 468 U.S. at 293.\n\n           This brings us to the question of whether the 2007 Act\n\nsatisfies the last half of this prescription โ the half that deals\n\nwith alternative channels of communication.        To begin, the 2007 Act\n\nplaces no burden at all on the plaintiffs' activities outside the\n\n35-foot buffer zone.      They can speak, gesticulate, wear screen-\n\nprinted T-shirts, display signs, use loudspeakers, and engage in the\n\nwhole gamut of lawful expressive activities.           Those messages may be\n\nseen and heard by individuals entering, departing, or within the\n\nbuffer zone.\n\n           Additionally, the plaintiffs may stand on the sidewalk and\n\noffer either literature or spoken advice to pedestrians, including\n\nthose headed into or out of the buffer zone.           Any willing listener\n\nis at liberty to leave the zone, approach those outside it, and\n\nrequest more information.\n\n           To   cinch    matters,   the    size   of     the   zone   is   not\n\nunreasonable.    It bears repeating at this point that we are dealing\n\nexclusively with a facial challenge to the 2007 Act.           Thus, as long\n\nas we can envision circumstances in which a 35-foot buffer zone\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fallows adequate alternative means of expression, the challenge must\n\nfail.   See Wash. State Grange, 128 S. Ct. at 1190.\n\n            It is easy to envision such a scenario.   Indeed, the zone\n\nat issue here is slightly smaller than that upheld in Madsen, 512\n\nU.S. at 768-70 (validating a 36-foot buffer zone under a standard\n\nstricter than that which is applicable here).      By like token, the\n\nzone at issue here is substantially smaller than the fixed portion\n\nof the buffer zone approved in Hill, 530 U.S. at 703 (upholding a\n\nfloating buffer zone within a 100-foot fixed buffer zone).       Also\n\ninstructive is Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191 (1992), in which the\n\nCourt, applying strict scrutiny to a content-based regulation,\n\napproved a 100-foot buffer zone for polling places.       Id. at 211.\n\nWhile there is no particular buffer zone radius that is per se\n\npermissible or impermissible โ everything depends on context โ the\n\nradius here is not, on its face, constitutionally deficient.\n\n            To say more on the binary question of narrow tailoring and\n\nalternative channels of communication would be supererogatory.     In\n\nthe circumstances revealed by the record, the 2007 Act, on its face,\n\nis a valid time-place-manner regulation that advances a significant\n\ngovernmental interest without burdening substantially more speech\n\nthan necessary and leaves open adequate alternative channels of\n\ncommunication.     Accordingly, the statute survives intermediate\n\nscrutiny.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f                          D.   Overbreadth.\n\n          First Amendment challenges based on a statute's alleged\n\noverbreadth are more readily accommodated than other types of facial\n\nchallenges.     The main difference is that courts will consider\n\noverbreadth challenges even though the challenger's own free speech\n\nrights are not implicated. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601,\n\n612 (1973).    This leniency results from a judicial \"assumption that\n\nthe statute's very existence may cause others not before the court\n\nto refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\"\n\nId.   The plaintiffs mount such a challenge.     They argue that the\n\n2007 Act cannot constitutionally be applied to the wide universe of\n\npeople who might want to linger in the buffer zone and express their\n\nviews.   They liken this case to Board of Airport Commissioners v.\n\nJews For Jesus, in which the Supreme Court struck down as overbroad\n\nan outright ban on all First Amendment activity within a major\n\ninternational airport.    482 U.S. 569, 577 (1987).\n\n          The matter at hand is readily distinguishable from Jews\n\nfor Jesus.     That case involved a direct ban on First Amendment\n\nactivity, whereas this case involves a time, place, and manner\n\nrestriction.     The Court has left no doubt but that time-place-\n\nmanner restrictions should not be analyzed in the same way as direct\n\nbans on speech.    See Hill, 530 U.S. at 731.\n\n          In all events, the plaintiffs' overbreadth argument is\n\neerily reminiscent of one considered and rejected in Hill.    There,\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fthe challengers asserted that the Colorado statute was overbroad\n\nbecause it applied to all medical clinics, not just to abortion\n\nproviders.     The Court debunked that assertion, stating that \"[t]he\n\nfact that the coverage of a statute is broader than the specific\n\nconcern   that    led   to   its   enactment    is        of   no   constitutional\n\nsignificance.\"     Id. at 730-31; see id. at 723 (approvingly noting\n\nthat the statute applies \"equally to used car salesmen, animal\n\nrights       activists,      fundraisers,        environmentalists,             and\n\nmissionaries\").\n\n            That logic is persuasive here. Although the Massachusetts\n\nlegislature was plainly moved to enact the statute by the secondary\n\neffects of anti-abortion protests, it opted to address the secondary\n\neffects of a broader         range of activities in the interest of\n\neffective    enforcement.      This   decision       to    widen    the   statute's\n\ncoverage is a matter of degree, not a matter of kind.                  Legislatures\n\nare not held to standards of mathematical precision where policy\n\njudgments are concerned.           See, e.g., Burson, 504 U.S. at 210\n\n(describing the question of whether a 100-foot buffer zone could be\n\nreduced by 25 feet as not of \"constitutional dimension\"). Here, the\n\nincreased degree of the expansion is reasonable, so the expansion\n\nis not a matter of constitutional significance.                See Hill, 530 U.S.\n\nat 730-31; Burson, 504 U.S. at 210; see also City Council of Los\n\nAngeles   v.   Taxpayers     for   Vincent,    466    U.S.      789,    802   (1984)\n\n(explaining that \"if the ordinance may be validly applied to [the\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fplaintiffs], it can be validly applied to [a broader range of\n\npersons]\").\n\n          There is, moreover, a paradox that taints the plaintiffs'\n\noverbreadth argument.       The plaintiffs say, in effect, that the 2007\n\nAct should have been limited to abortion-related speech.                Yet the\n\nabsence of any reference to any particular kind of speech (and,\n\nthus, to any particular content or viewpoint) is what makes the\n\nstatute content-neutral.        See Hill, 530 U.S. at 723; Burson, 504\n\nU.S. at 207.       If a failure to distinguish among speakers in itself\n\ngave rise to overbreadth problems, legislatures would be forced to\n\nchoose between passing laws that were not content-neutral or laws\n\nthat were overbroad.       Hill pretermits the contention that the First\n\nAmendment forces state legislatures to face this sort of Morton's\n\nFork.\n\n          We have yet another bridge to cross.          At oral argument in\n\nthis court, the plaintiffs essayed a new and different spin on\n\noverbreadth    โ    a   perspective   that   emerged   during     the   panel's\n\nquestioning.        Seizing   upon    this   perspective,   the    plaintiffs\n\nsuggested that the Attorney General's guidance letter might be read\n\nto criminalize the conduct of anyone who engages in any \"partisan\n\nspeech,\" whether or not abortion-related, while passing though the\n\nbuffer zone.        This interpretation raises the concern that an\n\nindividual could be prosecuted merely for passing through the buffer\n\nzone en route to a destination outside the zone while, say, wearing\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fa lapel pin advocating the election of a political candidate or a\n\nT-shirt exhorting a favorite baseball team.\n\n           Though interesting, this argument is untimely. It was not\n\nraised either in the district court or in the plaintiffs' briefs on\n\nappeal.3   It is, therefore, waived.   See United States v. Slade, 980\n\nF.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party\n\nhas not presented an argument to the district court, she may not\n\nunveil it in the court of appeals.\"); Anderson v. Beatrice Foods\n\nCo., 900 F.2d 388, 397 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that an appellant's\n\nbriefs fix the scope of the issues appealed and that, therefore, an\n\nappellant cannot breathe life into an omitted theory merely by\n\nreferring to it at oral argument).     That the court inquired about\n\nthe theory at oral argument does not lower this bar.\n\n           We add a coda.     Were we to reach the merits of this\n\nargument โ which we do not โ the proper resolution of it is not\n\nobvious.   The Supreme Court has cautioned that \"[t]he overbreadth\n\ndoctrine is strong medicine that is used sparingly and only as a\n\n\n\n     3\n       To be sure, the plaintiffs' general overbreadth argument\nimplicitly attacks the exceptions to the 2007 Act. But avoiding\nwaiver requires more than a hint that a particular theory may be\nlurking; it necessitates some developed argumentation addressed to\nthat particular theory. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n     The plaintiffs also argued below that the legislature's use of\nthe word \"solely\" in the statutory text rendered the statute\nunconstitutionally vague. See McCullen, 573 F. Supp. 2d at 421.\nAlthough their newly minted argument likewise involves, in part,\nthe statute's use of the word \"solely,\" it is a conceptually\ndifferent argument.\n\n                                -27-\n\flast resort.\"     N.Y. State Club Ass'n v. City of New York, 487 U.S.\n\n1, 15 (1988).     Thus, a court may overturn a law as overbroad only\n\nif \"a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional,\n\njudged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.\"\n\nWash. State Grange, 128 S. Ct. at 1191 n.6. Courts must \"vigorously\n\nenforce\"   this   substantiality       requirement.        United     States   v.\n\nWilliams, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 1838 (2008).             In this case, it seems\n\nlikely that the alleged overbreadth is not sufficiently sprawling\n\nto serve as the foundation for a constitutional challenge.\n\n                               E.   Vagueness.\n\n           The    plaintiffs    contend      that   the   Attorney     General's\n\nguidance letter renders the 2007 Act void for vagueness because it\n\nuses the term \"partisan speech\" โ a term that is allegedly so\n\namorphous \"that persons of average intelligence would have no choice\n\nbut to guess at its meaning and modes of application.\"                    United\n\nStates v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 2003).                We reject this\n\ncontention.\n\n           The    Due   Process     Clause   forbids      the    sovereign   from\n\ndepriving an individual of liberty pursuant to an excessively vague\n\nlaw.   See id.; United States v. Arcadipane, 41 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).   This doctrine prevents the enforcement of laws that fail to\n\ngive persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to\n\nknow what conduct is proscribed and what is not.                Hill, 530 U.S. at\n\n732; Hussein, 351 F.3d at 14.        The Due Process Clause also forbids\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\flaws   that   impermissibly   delegate   basic   policy   matters   to\n\nadjudicators for resolution on an ad hoc or largely subjective\n\nbasis, thus threatening arbitrary and discriminatory application.\n\nGrayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972).\n\n          In the district court, the plaintiffs alleged that the\n\n2007 Act was impermissibly vague because of the uncertainty inherent\n\nin the terms \"solely\" and \"destination.\" See McCullen, 573 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 421.    They also argued that the term \"partisan speech,\"\n\nprovided as a gloss in the Attorney General's guidance letter\n\n(reprinted in the appendix), rendered the statute vague.      Id.   In\n\nthis venue, the plaintiffs address only the term \"partisan speech,\"\n\na phrase found exclusively in the guidance letter.\n\n          When confronting a vagueness challenge to the face of a\n\nstate statute, we are obliged to accept any limiting construction\n\nthat a state agency has authoritatively proffered.   Hoffman Estates\n\nv. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 495 n.5 (1982).\n\nIt is difficult to understand, however, how or why a challenger can\n\nmount a facial attack on a statute that is itself not vague simply\n\nbecause an enforcement official has offered an interpretation of the\n\nstatute that may pose problems down the road.    See McGuire II, 386\n\nF.3d at 58; see also Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09.     As a matter of\n\nlogic, we do not believe that an official's interpretation can\n\nrender clear statutory language vague so as to make the statute\n\n\n\n\n                                -29-\n\fvulnerable to a facial (as opposed to an as-applied) attack.4   See\n\nMcGuire II, 386 F.3d at 58; see also United States v. Protex Indus.,\n\nInc., 874 F.2d 740, 743 (10th Cir. 1989) (noting that a statute can\n\nbe void for vagueness, as applied, as a result of a retroactive\n\nexpansion of precise statutory language through interpretation).\n\n           Even were we to assume arguendo that the plaintiffs'\n\nunderlying point is that the statute itself is vague and that this\n\nlack of precision is exacerbated by the Attorney General's guidance\n\nletter, another obstacle would loom.   Although the word \"partisan\"\n\nmay be vague at the margins, but see Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 608,\n\nthat uncertainty would have no relevance here.      After all, the\n\nplaintiffs, by their own admission, want to engage in anti-abortion\n\nprotests; and that conduct, as they must know, falls squarely within\n\nthe hard core of the proscriptions spelled out in the guidance\n\nletter.\n\n           We need go no further.   \"One to whose conduct a statute\n\nclearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\"\n\nParker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 756 (1974); see Broadrick, 413 U.S.\n\nat 608.   That is precisely the situation here.\n\n                       F.   Prior Restraint.\n\n           We need not linger long over the plaintiffs' claim that\n\nthe 2007 Act constitutes an impermissible prior restraint on speech.\n\n\n     4\n      The situation may well be different if the statute itself is\nvague or ambiguous โ but that is not the premise of the vagueness\nargument that the plaintiffs are making here.\n\n                                -30-\n\fThe case law makes manifest that time-place-manner restrictions are\n\nanalyzed under intermediate scrutiny and not under the more rigorous\n\nstandard that applies to prior restraints.          See, e.g., Bl(a)ck Tea\n\nSoc'y, 378 F.3d at 12.      Consequently, our determination that the\n\n2007   Act is a valid time-place-manner restriction effectively\n\nforecloses the plaintiffs' resort to case law involving prior\n\nrestraints.   See id. (\"If content-neutral prohibitions on speech at\n\ncertain places were deemed prior restraints, the intermediate\n\nstandard of review prescribed in the time-place-manner jurisprudence\n\nwould be eviscerated.\").\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n            To recapitulate, the 2007 Act represents a permissible\n\nresponse by the Massachusetts legislature to what it reasonably\n\nperceived as a significant threat to public safety.          It is content-\n\nneutral,    narrowly   tailored,    and   leaves   open   ample   alternative\n\nchannels of communication.         It is, therefore, a valid time-place-\n\nmanner regulation, and constitutional on its face.\n\n            We add a caveat.   This decision flows naturally from the\n\nvery heavy burden that plaintiffs must carry in mounting a facial\n\nchallenge to a state statute.       Nothing that we have said forecloses\n\nthe possibility that, on a better-developed record, this legislative\n\nsolution may prove problematic in particular applications.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\f Appendix I: The Attorney General's Guidance.\n\nThe first exemption โ for persons entering or\nleaving the clinic โ only allows people to cross\nthrough the buffer zone on their way to or from\nthe clinic. It does not permit companions of\nclinic patients, or other people not within the\nscope of the second or third exemptions, to\nstand or remain in the buffer zone, whether to\nsmoke, talk with others, or for any other\npurpose.\n\nThe second exemption โ for employees or agents\nof the clinic acting within the scope of their\nemployment โ allows clinic personnel to assist\nin protecting patients and ensuring their safe\naccess to clinics, but does not allow them to\nexpress their views about abortion or to engage\nin any other partisan speech within the buffer\nzone.\n\nSimilarly, the third exemption โ for municipal\nemployees or agents acting within the scope of\ntheir employment โ does not allow municipal\nagents to express their views about abortion or\nto engage in any other partisan speech within\nthe buffer zone.\n\nFinally, the fourth exemption โ for persons\nusing the sidewalk or street adjacent to the\nclinic to reach a destination other than the\nclinic โ applies to individuals who are crossing\nthrough the buffer zone, without stopping, to go\nsomewhere other than a location within the zone\nand other than the clinic, and who are not using\nthe buffer zone for some other purpose while\npassing through. For example, an individual may\ncross through the buffer zone to reach and speak\nwith someone outside the zone, to reach and\nstand in a location outside the zone (perhaps to\nengage in lawful protest, other speech, or\nprayer), or to travel on to another place\naltogether, provided that the individual does\nnot do anything else within the buffer zone\n(such as expressing their views about abortion\nor engaging in other partisan speech).\n\n\n\n                     -32-\n\f",

A series of pitched battles, forming a part of this struggle, has been waged at free-standing abortion clinics, where protestors and anti-abortion counselors seek to dissuade prospective patients, shame clinic <span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> workers, and call attention to what they perceive as the evils of voluntary terminations of pregnancies. In this campaign Massachusetts has been a battleground state.</p>\n<p>This appeal arises out of yet another skirmish in this chronicle of discord. In a very real sense, genesis of the appeal dates back to the dawning of the millennium. At that time, the Massachusetts legislature enacted a statute that created a floating buffer zone around the entrances, exits, and driveways of abortion clinics throughout the state.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Given the benefit of hindsight, the legislature revised the law seven years later. The modified version of the statute replaced the floating buffer zone with a 35-foot fixed buffer zone. This appeal involves a multi-pronged facial challenge to the constitutionality of the modified statute.</p>\n<p>In a thoughtful and comprehensive opinion, the district court rejected the facial challenge in all its iterations and refused to enjoin enforcement of the new law. <i>McCullen v. Coakley,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d 382 (D.Mass.2008). After careful consideration of the record, the parties' briefs, some helpful friend-of-the-court briefs, and the arguments made orally, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In this case, as in so many cases, the past informs the present. We start there.</p>\n<p>By the end of the twentieth century, Massachusetts had experienced repeated incidents involving violence and other unduly aggressive behaviors in the vicinity of reproductive health care facilities (RHCFs). Choosing among a host of possible preventive measures, the legislature took up a bill that proposed creating a fixed 25-foot buffer zone around the entrances, exits, and driveways of RHCFs.</p>\n<p>The state senate held a hearing on the bill in April 1999 and received evidence of widespread harassment and intimidation outside RHCFs. Numerous witnesses addressed not only the peculiar vulnerability of women seeking abortion services but also the deleterious effects of overly aggressive demonstrations on both patient and provider safety. The senate concluded that existing laws did not adequately safeguard clinic staff, prospective patients, or members of the public.</p>\n<p>As part of its due diligence, the senate asked the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) for an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of the proposed law. The SJC discerned no constitutional impediment. <i>Opinion of the Justices to the Senate,</i> 430 Mass. 1205, 723 N.E.2d 1, 6 (2000).</p>\n<p>The senate subsequently engrossed a bill intended to enhance public safety in and around RHCFs while maintaining the relatively free flow of traffic. <i>See</i> Mass. S. Jour., Feb. 29, 2000. That bill resembled the original senate bill.</p>\n<p>Before the house of representatives could act on the senate bill, the United States Supreme Court decided <i>Hill v. Colorado,</i> in which the Justices upheld, as a content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction, a Colorado statute designed to ameliorate the same panoply of evils through the use of a floating buffer zone. 530 U.S. 703, 707-08, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000). The Colorado statute synthesized the fixed and floating buffer zone concepts, making it unlawful within a 100-foot fixed zone for any person, in the absence of consent, to \"knowingly approach\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> within eight feet of another person \"for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling with such other person.\" <i>Id.</i> at 707, 120 S.Ct. 2480 (quoting Colo.Rev.Stat. ยง 18-9-122(3)).</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts legislature recognized that <i>Hill</i> had shed new light on the legal landscape. Thus, the house tabled the senate bill and repaired to the drawing board. The legislature eventually enacted a law that was loosely patterned on the Colorado statute. <i>See</i> An Act Relative to Reproductive Health Care Facilities (2000 Act), S.B. 148, 181st Gen. Ct. (Mass. Aug. 10, 2000). The key component of the 2000 Act was a prohibition against knowingly approaching within six feet of another without consent for certain defined protest-related purposes. Because the prohibition only operated within an 18-foot fixed buffer zone around RHCF entrances, exits, and driveways, it mimicked the Colorado law in combining floating and fixed buffer zone concepts.</p>\n<p>A group of Massachusetts residents who wished to protest in front of RHCFs mounted both facial and as-applied challenges to the constitutionality of the new enactment. In successive decisions, we rejected those challenges. <i>See </i><i>McGuire v. Reilly</i> (<i>McGuire I</i>), 260 F.3d 36, 51 (1st Cir.2001) (rejecting facial challenges); <i>McGuire v. Reilly</i> (<i>McGuire II</i>), 386 F.3d 45, 65-66 (1st Cir.2004) (rejecting renewed facial challenges as well as as-applied challenges).</p>\n<p>Over time, legislators became concerned that the statute had failed to achieve its desired goals. In 2007, the legislature held public hearings devoted to the need for rewriting the statute. Testimony (including statements from law enforcement officials and clinic workers) revealed unanticipated difficulties in enforcing the 2000 Act and called into question that Act's efficacy. The upshot was a decision to reshape the law by, among other things, repudiating the floating buffer zone concept and relying instead on a 35-foot fixed buffer zone.</p>\n<p>On November 8, 2007, the legislature enacted the revised law. <i>See</i> An Act Relative to Public Safety at Reproductive Health Care Facilities (2007 Act), S.B. 1353, 185th Gen. Ct. (Mass. Nov. 13, 2007). It declares that \"[n]o person shall knowingly enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk adjacent to [an RHCF]\" within a designated buffer zone. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, ยง 120E 1/2(b) (2007). The Act describes the new buffer zone as comprising</p>\n<blockquote>a radius of 35 feet of any portion of an entrance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health care facility or within the area within a rectangle created by extending the outside boundaries of any entrance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health care facility in straight lines to the point where such lines intersect the sidelines of the street in front of such entrance, exit or driveway.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> Moreover, the law prohibits all persons from entering or remaining within the buffer zone during ordinary business hours, subject to exceptions for four classes of persons, namely:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) persons entering or leaving such facility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) employees or agents of such facility acting within the scope of their employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) law enforcement, ambulance, firefighting, construction, utilities, public works and other municipal agents acting within the scope of their employment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) persons using the public sidewalk or street right-of-way adjacent to such facility <span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> solely for the purpose of reaching a destination other than such facility.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> Each of these exceptions derives from the 2000 Act. And the 2007 Act, like the 2000 Act, also requires that the buffer zone be clearly marked. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>On January 25, 2008, the Attorney General sent a letter to an audience that included law enforcement and RHCF personnel. The letter purports to summarize the provisions of the 2007 Act and to furnish \"guidance to assist ... in applying the four exemptions.\" This guidance comprises four paragraphs, set forth verbatim in an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</h2>\n<p>On January 16, 2008, plaintiffs-appellants Eleanor McCullen, Jean Blackburn Zarrella, Gregory A. Smith, Carmel Farrell, and Eric Caden, all Massachusetts residents who regularly engage in pro-life counseling outside RHCFs, sued the Attorney General of Massachusetts, in her representative capacity, in the federal district court. Their complaint invoked 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, limned a constellation of constitutional claims, and prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief aimed at derailing the 2007 Act. Without objection, the district court bifurcated the case into facial and as-applied challenges. As to the former, the court consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing with the hearing on the merits, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2), and began a bench trial on May 28, 2008.</p>\n<p>In due season, the court issued a decision denying relief. <i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 425. This interlocutory appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We begin our odyssey by outlining the legal standards that apply generally to facial challenges and then proceed to the myriad prongs of the plaintiffs' facial challenge. Because the issues raised on appeal implicate the First Amendment, they engender de novo review. <i>See </i><i>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union,</i> 466 U.S. 485, 508, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>General Standards.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Around the edges, the standards that apply in evaluating facial challenges to the constitutionality of statutes are not entirely clear. <i>See</i> Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Commentary, <i>As-applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing,</i> 113 Harv. L.Rev. 1321, 1322-23 (2000). For present purposes, though, the path is reasonably well-lighted.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court recently has stated that a facial challenge will fail if a statute \"has a plainly legitimate sweep.\" <i>Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Repub. Party,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1184, 1190, 170 L.Ed.2d 151 (2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This is a refinement of its earlier statement that a party mounting a facial challenge \"must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\" <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987). Howsoever worded, this standard imposes a very heavy burden on a party who mounts a facial challenge to a state statute.</p>\n<p>The statute at issue here implicates freedom of speech. Justice Cardozo long ago observed that freedom of speech is \"the indispensable condition ... of nearly every other form of freedom.\" <i>Palko v. Connecticut,</i> 302 U.S. 319, 327, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937). But even so precious a freedom must, in particular iterations, be balanced against the government's legitimate interests in protecting public health and safety. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*175</span> <i>Schenck v. United States,</i> 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919) (\"The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre.\") (Holmes, J.).</p>\n<p>In striking this delicate balance, a court must calibrate the scales differently depending on the nature of the governmental action. <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 42. That calibration takes place along a continuum. <i>See </i><i>Berner v. Delahanty,</i> 129 F.3d 20, 28 (1st Cir.1997). At one end of the continuum are laws in which the government attempts to differentiate between divergent views on a singular subject; that is, laws in which the government attempts to \"pick and choose among similarly situated speakers in order to advance or suppress a particular ideology or outlook.\" <i>Id.</i> Such viewpoint-based discrimination is highly offensive to the core values of the First Amendment, and courts are wary of such encroachments. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va.,</i> 515 U.S. 819, 829, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995).</p>\n<p>Even when a law does not favor one particular viewpoint over another, governmental restrictions on the content of speech may be impermissible. <i>See </i><i>Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC,</i> 512 U.S. 622, 641-42, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994). At this stage of the continuum, a reviewing court must start with a presumption that such a content-based regulation is constitutionally suspect. <i>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul,</i> 505 U.S. 377, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992); <i>Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham,</i> 43 F.3d 731, 736 (1st Cir.1995). That presumption can be rebutted by a showing that the regulation is both necessary to the furtherance of a compelling state interest and narrowly tailored to the achievement of that interest. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Boos v. Barry,</i> 485 U.S. 312, 321, 108 S.Ct. 1157, 99 L.Ed.2d 333 (1988).</p>\n<p>Further along the continuum are laws that do not regulate speech per se but, rather, regulate the time, place, and manner in which speech may occur. Because such time-place-manner restrictions are by definition content-neutral, they tend to burden speech only incidentally; that is, they burden speech for reasons unrelated to either the speaker's viewpoint or the speech's content. <i>See </i><i>Turner Broad.,</i> 512 U.S. at 642, 114 S.Ct. 2445. Regulations of this type will be upheld as long as \"they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, ... are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and ... leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\" <i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism,</i> 491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989) (quoting <i>Clark v. Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence,</i> 468 U.S. 288, 293, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984)). This more relaxed standard, familiarly known as \"intermediate scrutiny,\" is justified because the fact that a regulation is both content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral helps to ensure that government is not using the regulation as a sub rosa means of interfering in areas to which First Amendment protections pertain. <i>See </i><i>Turner Broad.,</i> 512 U.S. at 642, 114 S.Ct. 2445.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Content Neutrality.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>What we have said to this point leads naturally to the threshold question in this case. The district court found the 2007 Act to be content-neutral. <i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 403. The plaintiffs demur. Because the resolution of this dispute will determine the contours of our subsequent analysis (including the appropriate level of scrutiny), we tackle this question first.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*176</span> Our principal inquiry in this regard, both in speech cases generally and in time-place-manner cases specifically, \"is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\" <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 781, 109 S.Ct. 2746. \"Thus, a law designed to serve purposes unrelated to the content of protected speech is deemed content-neutral even if, incidentally, it has an adverse effect on certain messages while leaving others untouched.\" <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 43; <i>accord </i><i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 57.</p>\n<p>The lower court, relying mainly on <i>Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 719-20, 120 S.Ct. 2480, determined that the 2007 Act was content-neutral because it did not regulate speech ย merely the places in which speech might occur. <i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 403. Moreover, the law was enacted in response to legitimate safety and law enforcement concerns, and was justified by those objectives without reference to the content of any speech. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs resist this characterization. They acknowledge that the statute has a content-neutral patina, but they insist that this patina masks a more sinister reality. They point to several \"facts\" which, in their estimation, collectively indicate that the legislature's abiding motive was to curb anti-abortion speech. Specifically, the plaintiffs assert that the expanded size of the buffer zone is suspicious; that the zone itself, as reconfigured, contradicts its stated \"public safety\" goal in that it causes more safety hazards than it abates; that the legislature deliberately drew its evidence from biased sources, in effect listening to only one side of the story; that this court's characterizations of the 2000 Act, <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 49, belie the legislators' professed concerns about enforcement of that law; and that the nonexistent \"emergency\" referenced in the preamble to the 2007 Act is a figment of the legislators' collective imagination (and thus, a cover-up for the legislature's real agenda).</p>\n<p>Although a few of the factual components of this broadside are new and others have been refurbished or reworked, the broadside itself is on the order of one that was leveled against the 2000 Act and soundly rebuffed in <i>McGuire I.</i> There, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>To be sure, the plaintiffs insist that the state's professed concerns about public safety, personal security, and access to medical facilities are mere pretexts for its desire to censor anti-abortion speech. This insistence gets them nowhere. For one thing, their insinuations are unsupported by any record evidence. For another thing, where differential treatment is justified, on an objective basis, by the government's content-neutral effort to combat secondary effects, it is insufficient that a regulation may have been adopted in direct response to the negative impact of a particular form of speech.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 45. So it is here.</p>\n<p>As in <i>McGuire I,</i> the plaintiffs' basic complaint is that alleged deficiencies in the factual record compiled by the legislature ย gaps, distortions, mischaracterizations, and the like ย compel an inference of pretext. But as in <i>McGuire I,</i> our independent review of the record confirms that the legislative factfinding adequately underpins what the legislature wrought. We need not cite book and verse. Although the plaintiffs, ably represented, have done a thorough job of fly-specking the legislative record, their claim of pretext is no more effective than was the counterpart claim advanced in <i>McGuire I.</i> Consequently, it is enough to note our wholehearted agreement with the district court that the record is \"replete with factual references <span class=\"star-pagination\">*177</span> to specific incidents and patterns of problematic behavior around RHCFs.\" <i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 405. In the final analysis, the claim of factual inadequacy amounts to little more than wishful thinking.</p>\n<p>We nonetheless consider it wise to embellish two points. First, the fact that we spoke approvingly of the 2000 Act did not serve to freeze the statute in place. The legislature had a right (some might say an obligation) to monitor the statute's operation and to revisit the matter if experience revealed unexpected problems. <i>See </i><i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 800, 109 S.Ct. 2746; <i>Nat'l Amusements,</i> 43 F.3d at 742.</p>\n<p>Second, the test for content neutrality does not require proof that the legislature's response to a perceived problem be the only solution or even the best solution; it simply requires that the evidence support a conclusion that the regulation is in service to a legitimate governmental interest unrelated to expressive content. <i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 58; <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 44. In grading a regulation's efficacy under this test, a reviewing court must grant a significant degree of respect to the legislature's judgment. <i>See Turner Broad.,</i> 520 U.S. at 195, 117 S.Ct. 1174. Viewed through this deferential prism, the factfinding that undergirds the 2007 Act easily attains a passing grade.</p>\n<p>In a related vein, the plaintiffs maintain that several features of the 2007 Act themselves constitute either content-based or viewpoint-based discrimination. These features include the exception for clinic employees and agents, the statute's alleged under-inclusiveness (<i>i.e.,</i> the fact that the legislature did not extend it to other types of free-standing medical clinics), and the Attorney General's guidance letter.</p>\n<p>This three-faceted structural argument is not original. Without exception, claims analogous to those that comprise it were addressed in our earlier decisions anent the 2000 Act. <i>See </i><i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 56-59; <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 44-47. Those decisions render superfluous any exegetic discussion of the current version of the structural argument. For now, it suffices to say that the mere fact that a content-neutral law has a disparate impact on particular kinds of speech is insufficient, without more, to ground an inference that the disparity results from a content-based preference. <i>See </i><i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 57; <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 44. Here, there is no \"more.\"</p>\n<p>To be sure, the plaintiffs strive to distinguish our earlier decisions and add the missing integers to the equation. Only two of these efforts deserve comment.</p>\n<p>The argument that the law is content-based due to the exception permitting those persons associated with RHCFs (<i>e.g.,</i> clinic workers and patients) but not others to enter the buffer zone was squarely raised and squarely repulsed in <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 45-47. The present plaintiffs try to give that argument a new twist. They posit that the very size and nature of a 35-foot fixed buffer zone somehow changes the constitutional calculus and makes this exception less defensible. This is whistling past the graveyard.</p>\n<p>The decisive question in a facial challenge is not whether a regulation is necessary to achieve the legislature's stated goal but, rather, whether a court can glean legitimate reasons for its existence. <i>See id.</i> at 47. This principle applies to the configuration of the buffer zone selected by the legislature. The size of that zone need only be reasonably related to the attainment of the legislature's goal. That some might think a 25-foot or 30-foot buffer zone sufficient is not the issue.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*178</span> Here, moreover, differences in the buffer zone's dimensions and other characteristics do not tip the constitutional balance. Regardless of those differences, the exception for persons associated with RHCFs remains reasonably related to the legislature's legitimate public safety objectives. No more is exigible to reject this aspect of the plaintiffs' facial challenge.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, the plaintiffs maintain that the Attorney General's interpretive guidance (reprinted in the appendix) demonstrates that the 2007 Act is not content-neutral. In particular, they highlight the passage in the guidance letter in which the Attorney General uses the phrase \"abortion and partisan speech.\" The force of this attack is dissipated by our decision in <i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 58, in which we explained that a state official's interpretation of a statute, even if generally authoritative, cannot render an otherwise constitutional statute vulnerable to a facial challenge.</p>\n<p>In sum, we find nothing in either the text or the legislative history of the 2007 Act that deprives that statute of content-neutral status. We proceed, therefore, with intermediate scrutiny, recognizing that the constitutionality of the 2007 Act turns on whether it is narrowly tailored and allows sufficient alternative means of communication. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Clark,</i> 468 U.S. at 293, 104 S.Ct. 3065.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Narrow Tailoring/Channels of Communication.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A regulation is narrowly tailored if it (i) facilitates a substantial governmental interest that would be less effectively served without the regulation and (ii) accomplishes this end without burdening substantially more speech than necessary. <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 799, 109 S.Ct. 2746.</p>\n<p>The first element of this two-part definition is not seriously disputed here. The interests ascribed by the legislature to the 2007 Act (enhancing public safety around RHCFs, improving traffic flow, and the like) are the same as those that we deemed both proper and substantial in <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 48 (describing those interests as \"precisely the sort of interests that justify some incidental burdening of First Amendment rights\").</p>\n<p>It is the second part of the definition that draws the plaintiffs' fire: they argue that the 2007 Act regulates too much speech. But this argument rests on a misconception; it assumes that, in order to survive intermediate scrutiny, a law (and within a law, a buffer zone) must burden no more speech than is absolutely necessary to accomplish the law's legitimate purpose.</p>\n<p>Perscrutation of the plaintiffs' briefs makes it apparent that this misconception arises out of a misreading of the Court's decisions in <i>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network, Inc.,</i> 519 U.S. 357, 117 S.Ct. 855, 137 L.Ed.2d 1 (1997), and <i>Madsen v. Women's Health Center,</i> 512 U.S. 753, 114 S.Ct. 2516, 129 L.Ed.2d 593 (1994). In each instance, the Court applied a \"no greater restriction than necessary\" standard to determine the validity of an injunction. <i>See </i><i>Schenck,</i> 519 U.S. at 374, 117 S.Ct. 855; <i>Madsen,</i> 512 U.S. at 765, 114 S.Ct. 2516. But injunctions (which bind only the parties in a particular case and those in privity with them) are more targeted than statutes (which apply broadly to all concerned). This is a critically important distinction; the Court has made it pellucid that the absence of general applicability subjects injunctions to a stricter <span class=\"star-pagination\">*179</span> standard than legislative enactments. <i>See </i><i>Madsen,</i> 512 U.S. at 764-65, 114 S.Ct. 2516; <i>cf. </i><i>Ry. Exp. Agency, Inc. v. New York,</i> 336 U.S. 106, 112, 69 S.Ct. 463, 93 L.Ed. 533 (1949) (\"[T]here is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable government than to require that the principles of law which officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally.\") (Jackson, J., concurring). A law of general application passes muster under narrow tailoring principles as long as it is not substantially broader than necessary to accomplish the legislature's legitimate goal. <i>See </i><i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 799, 109 S.Ct. 2746; <i>see also </i><i>Madsen,</i> 512 U.S. at 764, 114 S.Ct. 2516.</p>\n<p><i>Ward</i> supplies the measuring stick that we must wield. The 2007 Act is a law of general application. Given that it promotes a substantial public interest, <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 48, the decisive question is whether it burdens <i>substantially</i> more speech than necessary to serve that purpose. If the answer to that query is in the negative, the law does not offend the First Amendment \"simply because a court concludes that the government's interest could be adequately served by some less-speech-restrictive alternative.\" <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 800, 109 S.Ct. 2746. This means, of course, that \"a judge's agreement with the responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant government interests or the degree to which those interests should be promoted\" are not conditions precedent to upholding a time-place-manner restriction. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>That conclusion effectively ends this aspect of the matter. Testimony from law enforcement officers and clinic workers attested to the ineffectiveness of the preexisting law. Against that backdrop, the legislature determined, after considerable study, that the state's declared interests would be better served by reconfiguring the buffer zone around RHCFs. The legislature labored to balance First Amendment concerns with public safety concerns, <i>see </i><i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 397-98 (recounting evidence), mulled the advantages and disadvantages of variously configured buffer zones, and decided (reasonably, we think) that a 35-foot fixed buffer zone made sense. Given the deference that is owed to such legislative judgments, <i>see Turner Broad.,</i> 520 U.S. at 195, 117 S.Ct. 1174, we cannot say that the 2007 Act is substantially broader than necessary.</p>\n<p>The fact that the legislature reached a different conclusion seven years earlier (when it preferred a smaller buffer zone that had both floating and fixed components) does not undercut this conclusion. After all, legislative choice is a dynamic process. Simply because a legislature previously has attempted to address a particular problem in one way does not disable it from taking a different approach at a later time. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 800, 109 S.Ct. 2746 (justifying increased regulation based on evidence of inadequacy of municipality's prior attempts to combat noise); <i>Nat'l Amusements,</i> 43 F.3d at 742 n. 9 (similar); <i>cf. </i><i>Rust v. Sullivan,</i> 500 U.S. 173, 187, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991) (affirming agency's reversal of position while noting that in exercising legislatively delegated authority agency is free to consider \"the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis\"). Experience is often the best teacher, and the incremental nature of the legislature's actions seems more a virtue than a vice. On these facts, the legislature's judgment must be respected. <i>See Turner Broad.,</i> 520 U.S. at 195, 117 S.Ct. 1174.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, the plaintiffs suggest that the 2007 Act is constitutionally infirm because it amounts to a ban on handbilling and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*180</span> interferes with the provision of an eight-to-fifteen-foot \"constitutional conversational distance.\" That suggestion is jejune.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the plaintiffs' importunings, the Constitution neither recognizes nor gives special protection to any particular conversational distance. <i>See,</i> <i>e.g., </i><i>Schenck,</i> 519 U.S. at 380, 117 S.Ct. 855 (upholding a fixed 15-foot buffer zone). By the same token, handbilling is not specially protected. <i>See </i><i>Heffron v. Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc.,</i> 452 U.S. 640, 654, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981). Time-place-manner regulations routinely make particular forms of expression impracticable without raising constitutional concerns. <i>See, e.g., Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 726-28, 120 S.Ct. 2480. As we explained in <i>Bl(a)ck Tea Society v. City of Boston,</i> 378 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir.2004), there is no constitutional guarantee of any particular form or mode of expression. The correct inquiry is whether, in light of the totality of the circumstances, a time-place-manner regulation burdens substantially more speech than necessary and, concomitantly, whether such a regulation leaves open adequate alternative channels of communication. <i>See </i><i>Clark,</i> 468 U.S. at 293, 104 S.Ct. 3065.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the question of whether the 2007 Act satisfies the last half of this prescription ย the half that deals with alternative channels of communication. To begin, the 2007 Act places no burden at all on the plaintiffs' activities outside the 35-foot buffer zone. They can speak, gesticulate, wear screen-printed T-shirts, display signs, use loudspeakers, and engage in the whole gamut of lawful expressive activities. Those messages may be seen and heard by individuals entering, departing, or within the buffer zone.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the plaintiffs may stand on the sidewalk and offer either literature or spoken advice to pedestrians, including those headed into or out of the buffer zone. Any willing listener is at liberty to leave the zone, approach those outside it, and request more information.</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the size of the zone is not unreasonable. It bears repeating at this point that we are dealing exclusively with a facial challenge to the 2007 Act. Thus, as long as we can envision circumstances in which a 35-foot buffer zone allows adequate alternative means of expression, the challenge must fail. <i>See </i><i>Wash. State Grange,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1190.</p>\n<p>It is easy to envision such a scenario. Indeed, the zone at issue here is slightly smaller than that upheld in <i>Madsen,</i> 512 U.S. at 768-70, 114 S.Ct. 2516 (validating a 36-foot buffer zone under a standard stricter than that which is applicable here). By like token, the zone at issue here is substantially smaller than the fixed portion of the buffer zone approved in <i>Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 703, 120 S.Ct. 2480 (upholding a floating buffer zone within a 100-foot fixed buffer zone). Also instructive is <i>Burson v. Freeman,</i> 504 U.S. 191, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992), in which the Court, applying strict scrutiny to a content-based regulation, approved a 100-foot buffer zone for polling places. <i>Id.</i> at 211, 112 S.Ct. 1846. While there is no particular buffer zone radius that is per se permissible or impermissible ย everything depends on context ย the radius here is not, on its face, constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p>To say more on the binary question of narrow tailoring and alternative channels of communication would be supererogatory. In the circumstances revealed by the record, the 2007 Act, on its face, is a valid time-place-manner regulation that advances a significant governmental interest without burdening substantially more speech than necessary and leaves open adequate alternative channels of communication. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*181</span> Accordingly, the statute survives intermediate scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Overbreadth.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>First Amendment challenges based on a statute's alleged overbreadth are more readily accommodated than other types of facial challenges. The main difference is that courts will consider overbreadth challenges even though the challenger's own free speech rights are not implicated. <i>See </i><i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> 413 U.S. 601, 612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). This leniency results from a judicial \"assumption that the statute's very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\" <i>Id.</i> The plaintiffs mount such a challenge. They argue that the 2007 Act cannot constitutionally be applied to the wide universe of people who might want to linger in the buffer zone and express their views. They liken this case to <i>Board of Airport Commissioners v. Jews For Jesus,</i> in which the Supreme Court struck down as overbroad an outright ban on all First Amendment activity within a major international airport. 482 U.S. 569, 577, 107 S.Ct. 2568, 96 L.Ed.2d 500 (1987).</p>\n<p>The matter at hand is readily distinguishable from <i>Jews for Jesus.</i> That case involved a direct ban on First Amendment activity, whereas this case involves a time, place, and manner restriction. The Court has left no doubt but that time-place-manner restrictions should not be analyzed in the same way as direct bans on speech. <i>See Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 731, 120 S.Ct. 2480.</p>\n<p>In all events, the plaintiffs' overbreadth argument is eerily reminiscent of one considered and rejected in <i>Hill.</i> There, the challengers asserted that the Colorado statute was overbroad because it applied to all medical clinics, not just to abortion providers. The Court debunked that assertion, stating that \"[t]he fact that the coverage of a statute is broader than the specific concern that led to its enactment is of no constitutional significance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 730-31, 120 S.Ct. 2480; <i>see id.</i> at 723, 120 S.Ct. 2480 (approvingly noting that the statute applies \"equally to used car salesmen, animal rights activists, fundraisers, environmentalists, and missionaries\").</p>\n<p>That logic is persuasive here. Although the Massachusetts legislature was plainly moved to enact the statute by the secondary effects of anti-abortion protests, it opted to address the secondary effects of a broader range of activities in the interest of effective enforcement. This decision to widen the statute's coverage is a matter of degree, not a matter of kind. Legislatures are not held to standards of mathematical precision where policy judgments are concerned. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Burson,</i> 504 U.S. at 210, 112 S.Ct. 1846 (describing the question of whether a 100-foot buffer zone could be reduced by 25 feet as not of \"constitutional dimension\"). Here, the increased degree of the expansion is reasonable, so the expansion is not a matter of constitutional significance. <i>See Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 730-31, 120 S.Ct. 2480; <i>Burson,</i> 504 U.S. at 210, 112 S.Ct. 1846; <i>see also </i><i>City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent,</i> 466 U.S. 789, 802, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984) (explaining that \"if the ordinance may be validly applied to [the plaintiffs], it can be validly applied to [a broader range of persons]\").</p>\n<p>There is, moreover, a paradox that taints the plaintiffs' overbreadth argument. The plaintiffs say, in effect, that the 2007 Act should have been limited to abortion-related speech. Yet the absence of any reference to any particular kind of speech (and, thus, to any particular content or viewpoint) is what makes the statute content-neutral. <i>See Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 723, 120 S.Ct. 2480; <i>Burson,</i> 504 U.S. at 207, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*182</span> 112 S.Ct. 1846. If a failure to distinguish among speakers in itself gave rise to overbreadth problems, legislatures would be forced to choose between passing laws that were not content-neutral or laws that were overbroad. <i>Hill</i> pretermits the contention that the First Amendment forces state legislatures to face this sort of Morton's Fork.</p>\n<p>We have yet another bridge to cross. At oral argument in this court, the plaintiffs essayed a new and different spin on overbreadth ย a perspective that emerged during the panel's questioning. Seizing upon this perspective, the plaintiffs suggested that the Attorney General's guidance letter might be read to criminalize the conduct of anyone who engages in any \"partisan speech,\" whether or not abortion-related, while passing though the buffer zone. This interpretation raises the concern that an individual could be prosecuted merely for passing through the buffer zone en route to a destination outside the zone while, say, wearing a lapel pin advocating the election of a political candidate or a T-shirt exhorting a favorite baseball team.</p>\n<p>Though interesting, this argument is untimely. It was not raised either in the district court or in the plaintiffs' briefs on appeal.<sup>[3]</sup> It is, therefore, waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Slade,</i> 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"); <i>Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co.,</i> 900 F.2d 388, 397 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that an appellant's briefs fix the scope of the issues appealed and that, therefore, an appellant cannot breathe life into an omitted theory merely by referring to it at oral argument). That the court inquired about the theory at oral argument does not lower this bar.</p>\n<p>We add a coda. Were we to reach the merits of this argument ย which we do not ย the proper resolution of it is not obvious. The Supreme Court has cautioned that \"[t]he overbreadth doctrine is strong medicine that is used sparingly and only as a last resort.\" <i>N.Y. State Club Ass'n v. City of New York,</i> 487 U.S. 1, 15, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988). Thus, a court may overturn a law as overbroad only if \"a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.\" <i>Wash. State Grange,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1191 n. 6. Courts must \"vigorously enforce\" this substantiality requirement. <i>United States v. Williams,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 1838, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008). In this case, it seems likely that the alleged overbreadth is not sufficiently sprawling to serve as the foundation for a constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>Vagueness.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs contend that the Attorney General's guidance letter renders the 2007 Act void for vagueness because it uses the term \"partisan speech\" ย a term that is allegedly so amorphous \"that persons of average intelligence would have no choice but to guess at its meaning and modes of application.\" <i>United States v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*183</span> <i>Hussein,</i> 351 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.2003). We reject this contention.</p>\n<p>The Due Process Clause forbids the sovereign from depriving an individual of liberty pursuant to an excessively vague law. <i>See id.</i>; <i>United States v. Arcadipane,</i> 41 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1994). This doctrine prevents the enforcement of laws that fail to give persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct is proscribed and what is not. <i>Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 732, 120 S.Ct. 2480; <i>Hussein,</i> 351 F.3d at 14. The Due Process Clause also forbids laws that impermissibly delegate basic policy matters to adjudicators for resolution on an ad hoc or largely subjective basis, thus threatening arbitrary and discriminatory application. <i>Grayned v. City of Rockford,</i> 408 U.S. 104, 108-09, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972).</p>\n<p>In the district court, the plaintiffs alleged that the 2007 Act was impermissibly vague because of the uncertainty inherent in the terms \"solely\" and \"destination.\" <i>See </i><i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 421. They also argued that the term \"partisan speech,\" provided as a gloss in the Attorney General's guidance letter (reprinted in the appendix), rendered the statute vague. <i>Id.</i> In this venue, the plaintiffs address only the term \"partisan speech,\" a phrase found exclusively in the guidance letter.</p>\n<p>When confronting a vagueness challenge to the face of a state statute, we are obliged to accept any limiting construction that a state agency has authoritatively proffered. <i>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 489, 495 n. 5, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). It is difficult to understand, however, how or why a challenger can mount a facial attack on a statute that is itself not vague simply because an enforcement official has offered an interpretation of the statute that may pose problems down the road. <i>See </i><i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 58; <i>see also </i><i>Grayned,</i> 408 U.S. at 108-09, 92 S.Ct. 2294. As a matter of logic, we do not believe that an official's interpretation can render clear statutory language vague so as to make the statute vulnerable to a facial (as opposed to an as-applied) attack.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 58; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Protex Indus., Inc.,</i> 874 F.2d 740, 743 (10th Cir.1989) (noting that a statute can be void for vagueness, as applied, as a result of a retroactive expansion of precise statutory language through interpretation).</p>\n<p>Even were we to assume arguendo that the plaintiffs' underlying point is that the statute itself is vague and that this lack of precision is exacerbated by the Attorney General's guidance letter, another obstacle would loom. Although the word \"partisan\" may be vague at the margins, <i>but see </i><i>Broadrick,</i> 413 U.S. at 608, 93 S.Ct. 2908, that uncertainty would have no relevance here. After all, the plaintiffs, by their own admission, want to engage in anti-abortion protests; and that conduct, as they must know, falls squarely within the hard core of the proscriptions spelled out in the guidance letter.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. \"One to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\" <i>Parker v. Levy,</i> 417 U.S. 733, 756, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974); <i>see </i><i>Broadrick,</i> 413 U.S. at 608, 93 S.Ct. 2908. That is precisely the situation here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>Prior Restraint.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We need not linger long over the plaintiffs' claim that the 2007 Act constitutes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*184</span> an impermissible prior restraint on speech. The case law makes manifest that time-place-manner restrictions are analyzed under intermediate scrutiny and not under the more rigorous standard that applies to prior restraints. <i>See, e.g., Bl(a)ck Tea Soc'y,</i> 378 F.3d at 12. Consequently, our determination that the 2007 Act is a valid time-place-manner restriction effectively forecloses the plaintiffs' resort to case law involving prior restraints. <i>See id.</i> (\"If content-neutral prohibitions on speech at certain places were deemed prior restraints, the intermediate standard of review prescribed in the time-place-manner jurisprudence would be eviscerated.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To recapitulate, the 2007 Act represents a permissible response by the Massachusetts legislature to what it reasonably perceived as a significant threat to public safety. It is content-neutral, narrowly tailored, and leaves open ample alternative channels of communication. It is, therefore, a valid time-place-manner regulation, and constitutional on its face.</p>\n<p>We add a caveat. This decision flows naturally from the very heavy burden that plaintiffs must carry in mounting a facial challenge to a state statute. Nothing that we have said forecloses the possibility that, on a better-developed record, this legislative solution may prove problematic in particular applications.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Appendix I: The Attorney General's Guidance.</i></h2>\n<blockquote>The first exemption ย for persons entering or leaving the clinic ย only allows people to cross through the buffer zone on their way to or from the clinic. It does not permit companions of clinic patients, or other people not within the scope of the second or third exemptions, to stand or remain in the buffer zone, whether to smoke, talk with others, or for any other purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The second exemption ย for employees or agents of the clinic acting within the scope of their employment ย allows clinic personnel to assist in protecting patients and ensuring their safe access to clinics, but does not allow them to express their views about abortion or to engage in any other partisan speech within the buffer zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Similarly, the third exemption ย for municipal employees or agents acting within the scope of their employment ย does not allow municipal agents to express their views about abortion or to engage in any other partisan speech within the buffer zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Finally, the fourth exemption ย for persons using the sidewalk or street adjacent to the clinic to reach a destination other than the clinic ย applies to individuals who are crossing through the buffer zone, without stopping, to go somewhere other than a location within the zone and other than the clinic, and who are not using the buffer zone for some other purpose while passing through. For example, an individual may cross through the buffer zone to reach and speak with someone outside the zone, to reach and stand in a location outside the zone (perhaps to engage in lawful protest, other speech, or prayer), or to travel on to another place altogether, provided that the individual does not do anything else within the buffer zone (such as expressing their views about abortion or engaging in other partisan speech).</blockquote>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The mechanics of the 2000 Act and the dimensions of the then-current buffer zone are described in earlier opinions of this court. <i>See </i><i>McGuire v. Reilly,</i> 386 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2004); <i>McGuire v. Reilly,</i> 260 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>[2]  This same reasoning also serves to defeat the plaintiffs' equal protection and viewpoint discrimination claims, each of which focuses on the legislature's decision to limit the reach of the relevant exception to persons associated with RHCFs.</p>\n<p>[3]  To be sure, the plaintiffs' general overbreadth argument implicitly attacks the exceptions to the 2007 Act. But avoiding waiver requires more than a hint that a particular theory may be lurking; it necessitates some developed argumentation addressed to that particular theory. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).\n</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also argued below that the legislature's use of the word \"solely\" in the statutory text rendered the statute unconstitutionally vague. <i>See </i><i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 421. Although their newly minted argument likewise involves, in part, the statute's use of the word \"solely,\" it is a conceptually different argument.</p>\n<p>[4]  The situation may well be different if the statute itself is vague or ambiguous ย but that is not the premise of the vagueness argument that the plaintiffs are making here.</p>\n\n</div>",

A series of pitched battles, forming a part of this struggle, has been waged at free-standing abortion clinics, where protestors and anti-abortion counselors seek to dissuade prospective patients, shame clinic <span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> workers, and call attention to what they perceive as the evils of voluntary terminations of pregnancies. In this campaign Massachusetts has been a battleground state.</p>\n<p>This appeal arises out of yet another skirmish in this chronicle of discord. In a very real sense, genesis of the appeal dates back to the dawning of the millennium. At that time, the Massachusetts legislature enacted a statute that created a floating buffer zone around the entrances, exits, and driveways of abortion clinics throughout the state.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Given the benefit of hindsight, the legislature revised the law seven years later. The modified version of the statute replaced the floating buffer zone with a 35-foot fixed buffer zone. This appeal involves a multi-pronged facial challenge to the constitutionality of the modified statute.</p>\n<p>In a thoughtful and comprehensive opinion, the district court rejected the facial challenge in all its iterations and refused to enjoin enforcement of the new law. <i>McCullen v. Coakley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2309545\"><a href=\"/opinion/2309545/mccullen-v-coakley/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2008). After careful consideration of the record, the parties' briefs, some helpful friend-of-the-court briefs, and the arguments made orally, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In this case, as in so many cases, the past informs the present. We start there.</p>\n<p>By the end of the twentieth century, Massachusetts had experienced repeated incidents involving violence and other unduly aggressive behaviors in the vicinity of reproductive health care facilities (RHCFs). Choosing among a host of possible preventive measures, the legislature took up a bill that proposed creating a fixed 25-foot buffer zone around the entrances, exits, and driveways of RHCFs.</p>\n<p>The state senate held a hearing on the bill in April 1999 and received evidence of widespread harassment and intimidation outside RHCFs. Numerous witnesses addressed not only the peculiar vulnerability of women seeking abortion services but also the deleterious effects of overly aggressive demonstrations on both patient and provider safety. The senate concluded that existing laws did not adequately safeguard clinic staff, prospective patients, or members of the public.</p>\n<p>As part of its due diligence, the senate asked the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) for an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of the proposed law. The SJC discerned no constitutional impediment. <i>Opinion of the Justices to the Senate,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 6 (2000).</p>\n<p>The senate subsequently engrossed a bill intended to enhance public safety in and around RHCFs while maintaining the relatively free flow of traffic. <i>See</i> Mass. S. Jour., Feb. 29, 2000. That bill resembled the original senate bill.</p>\n<p>Before the house of representatives could act on the senate bill, the United States Supreme Court decided <i>Hill v. Colorado,</i> in which the Justices upheld, as a content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction, a Colorado statute designed to ameliorate the same panoply of evils through the use of a floating buffer zone. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 707-08, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span> (2000). The Colorado statute synthesized the fixed and floating buffer zone concepts, making it unlawful within a 100-foot fixed zone for any person, in the absence of consent, to \"knowingly approach\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> within eight feet of another person \"for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling with such other person.\" <i>Id.</i> at 707, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2480</span></a></span> (quoting Colo.Rev.Stat. ยง 18-9-122(3)).</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts legislature recognized that <i>Hill</i> had shed new light on the legal landscape. Thus, the house tabled the senate bill and repaired to the drawing board. The legislature eventually enacted a law that was loosely patterned on the Colorado statute. <i>See</i> An Act Relative to Reproductive Health Care Facilities (2000 Act), S.B. 148, 181st Gen. Ct. (Mass. Aug. 10, 2000). The key component of the 2000 Act was a prohibition against knowingly approaching within six feet of another without consent for certain defined protest-related purposes. Because the prohibition only operated within an 18-foot fixed buffer zone around RHCF entrances, exits, and driveways, it mimicked the Colorado law in combining floating and fixed buffer zone concepts.</p>\n<p>A group of Massachusetts residents who wished to protest in front of RHCFs mounted both facial and as-applied challenges to the constitutionality of the new enactment. In successive decisions, we rejected those challenges. <i>See </i><i>McGuire v. Reilly</i> (<i>McGuire I</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199554\"><a href=\"/opinion/199554/mcguire-v-reilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2001) (rejecting facial challenges); <i>McGuire v. Reilly</i> (<i>McGuire II</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201281\"><a href=\"/opinion/201281/mcguire-v-reilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 65-66 (1st Cir.2004) (rejecting renewed facial challenges as well as as-applied challenges).</p>\n<p>Over time, legislators became concerned that the statute had failed to achieve its desired goals. In 2007, the legislature held public hearings devoted to the need for rewriting the statute. Testimony (including statements from law enforcement officials and clinic workers) revealed unanticipated difficulties in enforcing the 2000 Act and called into question that Act's efficacy. The upshot was a decision to reshape the law by, among other things, repudiating the floating buffer zone concept and relying instead on a 35-foot fixed buffer zone.</p>\n<p>On November 8, 2007, the legislature enacted the revised law. <i>See</i> An Act Relative to Public Safety at Reproductive Health Care Facilities (2007 Act), S.B. 1353, 185th Gen. Ct. (Mass. Nov. 13, 2007). It declares that \"[n]o person shall knowingly enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk adjacent to [an RHCF]\" within a designated buffer zone. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, ยง 120E 1/2(b) (2007). The Act describes the new buffer zone as comprising</p>\n<blockquote>a radius of 35 feet of any portion of an entrance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health care facility or within the area within a rectangle created by extending the outside boundaries of any entrance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health care facility in straight lines to the point where such lines intersect the sidelines of the street in front of such entrance, exit or driveway.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> Moreover, the law prohibits all persons from entering or remaining within the buffer zone during ordinary business hours, subject to exceptions for four classes of persons, namely:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) persons entering or leaving such facility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) employees or agents of such facility acting within the scope of their employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) law enforcement, ambulance, firefighting, construction, utilities, public works and other municipal agents acting within the scope of their employment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) persons using the public sidewalk or street right-of-way adjacent to such facility <span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> solely for the purpose of reaching a destination other than such facility.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> Each of these exceptions derives from the 2000 Act. And the 2007 Act, like the 2000 Act, also requires that the buffer zone be clearly marked. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>On January 25, 2008, the Attorney General sent a letter to an audience that included law enforcement and RHCF personnel. The letter purports to summarize the provisions of the 2007 Act and to furnish \"guidance to assist ... in applying the four exemptions.\" This guidance comprises four paragraphs, set forth verbatim in an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</h2>\n<p>On January 16, 2008, plaintiffs-appellants Eleanor McCullen, Jean Blackburn Zarrella, Gregory A. Smith, Carmel Farrell, and Eric Caden, all Massachusetts residents who regularly engage in pro-life counseling outside RHCFs, sued the Attorney General of Massachusetts, in her representative capacity, in the federal district court. Their complaint invoked 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, limned a constellation of constitutional claims, and prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief aimed at derailing the 2007 Act. Without objection, the district court bifurcated the case into facial and as-applied challenges. As to the former, the court consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing with the hearing on the merits, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2), and began a bench trial on May 28, 2008.</p>\n<p>In due season, the court issued a decision denying relief. <i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 425. This interlocutory appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We begin our odyssey by outlining the legal standards that apply generally to facial challenges and then proceed to the myriad prongs of the plaintiffs' facial challenge. Because the issues raised on appeal implicate the First Amendment, they engender de novo review. <i>See </i><i>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111164\"><a href=\"/opinion/111164/bose-corp-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span>, 508, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111164\"><a href=\"/opinion/111164/bose-corp-v-consumers-union-of-united-states-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span> (1984).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>General Standards.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Around the edges, the standards that apply in evaluating facial challenges to the constitutionality of statutes are not entirely clear. <i>See</i> Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Commentary, <i>As-applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing,</i> 113 Harv. L.Rev. 1321, 1322-23 (2000). For present purposes, though, the path is reasonably well-lighted.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court recently has stated that a facial challenge will fail if a statute \"has a plainly legitimate sweep.\" <i>Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Repub. Party,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145824\"><a href=\"/opinion/145824/wash-state-grange-v-wash-state-rep-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1190, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145824\"><a href=\"/opinion/145824/wash-state-grange-v-wash-state-rep-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span> (2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This is a refinement of its earlier statement that a party mounting a facial challenge \"must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\" <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 745, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span> (1987). Howsoever worded, this standard imposes a very heavy burden on a party who mounts a facial challenge to a state statute.</p>\n<p>The statute at issue here implicates freedom of speech. Justice Cardozo long ago observed that freedom of speech is \"the indispensable condition ... of nearly every other form of freedom.\" <i>Palko v. Connecticut,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102879\"><a href=\"/opinion/102879/palko-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 327, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></span> (1937). But even so precious a freedom must, in particular iterations, be balanced against the government's legitimate interests in protecting public health and safety. <i>See, e.g.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*175</span> <i>Schenck v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99296\"><a href=\"/opinion/99296/schenck-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 52, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></span> (1919) (\"The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre.\") (Holmes, J.).</p>\n<p>In striking this delicate balance, a court must calibrate the scales differently depending on the nature of the governmental action. <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 42. That calibration takes place along a continuum. <i>See </i><i>Berner v. Delahanty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197623\"><a href=\"/opinion/197623/berner-v-delahanty/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1997). At one end of the continuum are laws in which the government attempts to differentiate between divergent views on a singular subject; that is, laws in which the government attempts to \"pick and choose among similarly situated speakers in order to advance or suppress a particular ideology or outlook.\" <i>Id.</i> Such viewpoint-based discrimination is highly offensive to the core values of the First Amendment, and courts are wary of such encroachments. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117967\"><a href=\"/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span>, 829, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117967\"><a href=\"/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span> (1995).</p>\n<p>Even when a law does not favor one particular viewpoint over another, governmental restrictions on the content of speech may be impermissible. <i>See </i><i>Turner Broad.

This more relaxed standard, familiarly known as \"intermediate scrutiny,\" is justified because the fact that a regulation is both content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral helps to ensure that government is not using the regulation as a sub rosa means of interfering in areas to which First Amendment protections pertain. <i>See </i><i>Turner Broad.,</i> 512 U.S. at 642, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117869\"><a href=\"/opinion/117869/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court found the 2007 Act to be content-neutral. <i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 403. The plaintiffs demur. Because the resolution of this dispute will determine the contours of our subsequent analysis (including the appropriate level of scrutiny), we tackle this question first.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*176</span> Our principal inquiry in this regard, both in speech cases generally and in time-place-manner cases specifically, \"is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\" <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 781, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2480</span></a></span>, determined that the 2007 Act was content-neutral because it did not regulate speech ย merely the places in which speech might occur. <i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 403. Moreover, the law was enacted in response to legitimate safety and law enforcement concerns, and was justified by those objectives without reference to the content of any speech. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs resist this characterization. They acknowledge that the statute has a content-neutral patina, but they insist that this patina masks a more sinister reality. They point to several \"facts\" which, in their estimation, collectively indicate that the legislature's abiding motive was to curb anti-abortion speech. Specifically, the plaintiffs assert that the expanded size of the buffer zone is suspicious; that the zone itself, as reconfigured, contradicts its stated \"public safety\" goal in that it causes more safety hazards than it abates; that the legislature deliberately drew its evidence from biased sources, in effect listening to only one side of the story; that this court's characterizations of the 2000 Act, <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 49, belie the legislators' professed concerns about enforcement of that law; and that the nonexistent \"emergency\" referenced in the preamble to the 2007 Act is a figment of the legislators' collective imagination (and thus, a cover-up for the legislature's real agenda).</p>\n<p>Although a few of the factual components of this broadside are new and others have been refurbished or reworked, the broadside itself is on the order of one that was leveled against the 2000 Act and soundly rebuffed in <i>McGuire I.</i> There, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>To be sure, the plaintiffs insist that the state's professed concerns about public safety, personal security, and access to medical facilities are mere pretexts for its desire to censor anti-abortion speech. This insistence gets them nowhere. For one thing, their insinuations are unsupported by any record evidence. For another thing, where differential treatment is justified, on an objective basis, by the government's content-neutral effort to combat secondary effects, it is insufficient that a regulation may have been adopted in direct response to the negative impact of a particular form of speech.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 45. So it is here.</p>\n<p>As in <i>McGuire I,</i> the plaintiffs' basic complaint is that alleged deficiencies in the factual record compiled by the legislature ย gaps, distortions, mischaracterizations, and the like ย compel an inference of pretext. But as in <i>McGuire I,</i> our independent review of the record confirms that the legislative factfinding adequately underpins what the legislature wrought. We need not cite book and verse. Although the plaintiffs, ably represented, have done a thorough job of fly-specking the legislative record, their claim of pretext is no more effective than was the counterpart claim advanced in <i>McGuire I.</i> Consequently, it is enough to note our wholehearted agreement with the district court that the record is \"replete with factual references <span class=\"star-pagination\">*177</span> to specific incidents and patterns of problematic behavior around RHCFs.\" <i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 405. In the final analysis, the claim of factual inadequacy amounts to little more than wishful thinking.</p>\n<p>We nonetheless consider it wise to embellish two points. First, the fact that we spoke approvingly of the 2000 Act did not serve to freeze the statute in place. The legislature had a right (some might say an obligation) to monitor the statute's operation and to revisit the matter if experience revealed unexpected problems. <i>See </i><i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 800, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2746</span></a></span>; <i>Nat'l Amusements,</i> 43 F.3d at 742.</p>\n<p>Second, the test for content neutrality does not require proof that the legislature's response to a perceived problem be the only solution or even the best solution; it simply requires that the evidence support a conclusion that the regulation is in service to a legitimate governmental interest unrelated to expressive content. <i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 58; <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 44. In grading a regulation's efficacy under this test, a reviewing court must grant a significant degree of respect to the legislature's judgment. <i>See Turner Broad.,</i> 520 U.S. at 195, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118097\"><a href=\"/opinion/118097/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></a></span>. Viewed through this deferential prism, the factfinding that undergirds the 2007 Act easily attains a passing grade.</p>\n<p>In a related vein, the plaintiffs maintain that several features of the 2007 Act themselves constitute either content-based or viewpoint-based discrimination. These features include the exception for clinic employees and agents, the statute's alleged under-inclusiveness (<i>i.e.,</i> the fact that the legislature did not extend it to other types of free-standing medical clinics), and the Attorney General's guidance letter.</p>\n<p>This three-faceted structural argument is not original. Without exception, claims analogous to those that comprise it were addressed in our earlier decisions anent the 2000 Act. <i>See </i><i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 56-59; <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 44-47. Those decisions render superfluous any exegetic discussion of the current version of the structural argument. For now, it suffices to say that the mere fact that a content-neutral law has a disparate impact on particular kinds of speech is insufficient, without more, to ground an inference that the disparity results from a content-based preference. <i>See </i><i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 57; <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 44. Here, there is no \"more.\"</p>\n<p>To be sure, the plaintiffs strive to distinguish our earlier decisions and add the missing integers to the equation. Only two of these efforts deserve comment.</p>\n<p>The argument that the law is content-based due to the exception permitting those persons associated with RHCFs (<i>e.g.,</i> clinic workers and patients) but not others to enter the buffer zone was squarely raised and squarely repulsed in <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 45-47. The present plaintiffs try to give that argument a new twist. They posit that the very size and nature of a 35-foot fixed buffer zone somehow changes the constitutional calculus and makes this exception less defensible. This is whistling past the graveyard.</p>\n<p>The decisive question in a facial challenge is not whether a regulation is necessary to achieve the legislature's stated goal but, rather, whether a court can glean legitimate reasons for its existence. <i>See id.</i> at 47. This principle applies to the configuration of the buffer zone selected by the legislature. The size of that zone need only be reasonably related to the attainment of the legislature's goal. That some might think a 25-foot or 30-foot buffer zone sufficient is not the issue.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*178</span> Here, moreover, differences in the buffer zone's dimensions and other characteristics do not tip the constitutional balance. Regardless of those differences, the exception for persons associated with RHCFs remains reasonably related to the legislature's legitimate public safety objectives. No more is exigible to reject this aspect of the plaintiffs' facial challenge.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, the plaintiffs maintain that the Attorney General's interpretive guidance (reprinted in the appendix) demonstrates that the 2007 Act is not content-neutral. In particular, they highlight the passage in the guidance letter in which the Attorney General uses the phrase \"abortion and partisan speech.\" The force of this attack is dissipated by our decision in <i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 58, in which we explained that a state official's interpretation of a statute, even if generally authoritative, cannot render an otherwise constitutional statute vulnerable to a facial challenge.</p>\n<p>In sum, we find nothing in either the text or the legislative history of the 2007 Act that deprives that statute of content-neutral status. We proceed, therefore, with intermediate scrutiny, recognizing that the constitutionality of the 2007 Act turns on whether it is narrowly tailored and allows sufficient alternative means of communication. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Clark,</i> 468 U.S. at 293, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111245\"><a href=\"/opinion/111245/clark-v-community-for-creative-non-violence/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3065</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Narrow Tailoring/Channels of Communication.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A regulation is narrowly tailored if it (i) facilitates a substantial governmental interest that would be less effectively served without the regulation and (ii) accomplishes this end without burdening substantially more speech than necessary. <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 799, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2746</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The first element of this two-part definition is not seriously disputed here. The interests ascribed by the legislature to the 2007 Act (enhancing public safety around RHCFs, improving traffic flow, and the like) are the same as those that we deemed both proper and substantial in <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 48 (describing those interests as \"precisely the sort of interests that justify some incidental burdening of First Amendment rights\").</p>\n<p>It is the second part of the definition that draws the plaintiffs' fire: they argue that the 2007 Act regulates too much speech. But this argument rests on a misconception; it assumes that, in order to survive intermediate scrutiny, a law (and within a law, a buffer zone) must burden no more speech than is absolutely necessary to accomplish the law's legitimate purpose.</p>\n<p>Perscrutation of the plaintiffs' briefs makes it apparent that this misconception arises out of a misreading of the Court's decisions in <i>Schenck v.

Given that it promotes a substantial public interest, <i>McGuire I,</i> 260 F.3d at 48, the decisive question is whether it burdens <i>substantially</i> more speech than necessary to serve that purpose. If the answer to that query is in the negative, the law does not offend the First Amendment \"simply because a court concludes that the government's interest could be adequately served by some less-speech-restrictive alternative.\" <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 800, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2746</span></a></span>. This means, of course, that \"a judge's agreement with the responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant government interests or the degree to which those interests should be promoted\" are not conditions precedent to upholding a time-place-manner restriction. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>That conclusion effectively ends this aspect of the matter. Testimony from law enforcement officers and clinic workers attested to the ineffectiveness of the preexisting law. Against that backdrop, the legislature determined, after considerable study, that the state's declared interests would be better served by reconfiguring the buffer zone around RHCFs. The legislature labored to balance First Amendment concerns with public safety concerns, <i>see </i><i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 397-98 (recounting evidence), mulled the advantages and disadvantages of variously configured buffer zones, and decided (reasonably, we think) that a 35-foot fixed buffer zone made sense. Given the deference that is owed to such legislative judgments, <i>see Turner Broad.,</i> 520 U.S. at 195, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118097\"><a href=\"/opinion/118097/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></a></span>, we cannot say that the 2007 Act is substantially broader than necessary.</p>\n<p>The fact that the legislature reached a different conclusion seven years earlier (when it preferred a smaller buffer zone that had both floating and fixed components) does not undercut this conclusion. After all, legislative choice is a dynamic process. Simply because a legislature previously has attempted to address a particular problem in one way does not disable it from taking a different approach at a later time. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 800, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Time-place-manner regulations routinely make particular forms of expression impracticable without raising constitutional concerns. <i>See, e.g., Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 726-28, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The correct inquiry is whether, in light of the totality of the circumstances, a time-place-manner regulation burdens substantially more speech than necessary and, concomitantly, whether such a regulation leaves open adequate alternative channels of communication. <i>See </i><i>Clark,</i> 468 U.S. at 293, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111245\"><a href=\"/opinion/111245/clark-v-community-for-creative-non-violence/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3065</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the question of whether the 2007 Act satisfies the last half of this prescription ย the half that deals with alternative channels of communication. To begin, the 2007 Act places no burden at all on the plaintiffs' activities outside the 35-foot buffer zone. They can speak, gesticulate, wear screen-printed T-shirts, display signs, use loudspeakers, and engage in the whole gamut of lawful expressive activities. Those messages may be seen and heard by individuals entering, departing, or within the buffer zone.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the plaintiffs may stand on the sidewalk and offer either literature or spoken advice to pedestrians, including those headed into or out of the buffer zone. Any willing listener is at liberty to leave the zone, approach those outside it, and request more information.</p>\n<p>To cinch matters, the size of the zone is not unreasonable. It bears repeating at this point that we are dealing exclusively with a facial challenge to the 2007 Act. Thus, as long as we can envision circumstances in which a 35-foot buffer zone allows adequate alternative means of expression, the challenge must fail. <i>See </i><i>Wash. State Grange,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1190.</p>\n<p>It is easy to envision such a scenario. Indeed, the zone at issue here is slightly smaller than that upheld in <i>Madsen,</i> 512 U.S. at 768-70, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117871\"><a href=\"/opinion/117871/madsen-v-womens-health-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2516</span></a></span> (validating a 36-foot buffer zone under a standard stricter than that which is applicable here). By like token, the zone at issue here is substantially smaller than the fixed portion of the buffer zone approved in <i>Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 703, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While there is no particular buffer zone radius that is per se permissible or impermissible ย everything depends on context ย the radius here is not, on its face, constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p>To say more on the binary question of narrow tailoring and alternative channels of communication would be supererogatory. In the circumstances revealed by the record, the 2007 Act, on its face, is a valid time-place-manner regulation that advances a significant governmental interest without burdening substantially more speech than necessary and leaves open adequate alternative channels of communication. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*181</span> Accordingly, the statute survives intermediate scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Overbreadth.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>First Amendment challenges based on a statute's alleged overbreadth are more readily accommodated than other types of facial challenges. The main difference is that courts will consider overbreadth challenges even though the challenger's own free speech rights are not implicated. <i>See </i><i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108858\"><a href=\"/opinion/108858/broadrick-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 612, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108858\"><a href=\"/opinion/108858/broadrick-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This leniency results from a judicial \"assumption that the statute's very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\" <i>Id.</i> The plaintiffs mount such a challenge. They argue that the 2007 Act cannot constitutionally be applied to the wide universe of people who might want to linger in the buffer zone and express their views. They liken this case to <i>Board of Airport Commissioners v. Jews For Jesus,</i> in which the Supreme Court struck down as overbroad an outright ban on all First Amendment activity within a major international airport. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111923\"><a href=\"/opinion/111923/board-of-airport-commrs-of-los-angeles-v-jews-for-jesus-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span>, 577, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111923\"><a href=\"/opinion/111923/board-of-airport-commrs-of-los-angeles-v-jews-for-jesus-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span> (1987).</p>\n<p>The matter at hand is readily distinguishable from <i>Jews for Jesus.</i> That case involved a direct ban on First Amendment activity, whereas this case involves a time, place, and manner restriction. The Court has left no doubt but that time-place-manner restrictions should not be analyzed in the same way as direct bans on speech. <i>See Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 731, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2480</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In all events, the plaintiffs' overbreadth argument is eerily reminiscent of one considered and rejected in <i>Hill.</i> There, the challengers asserted that the Colorado statute was overbroad because it applied to all medical clinics, not just to abortion providers. The Court debunked that assertion, stating that \"[t]he fact that the coverage of a statute is broader than the specific concern that led to its enactment is of no constitutional significance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 730-31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2480</span></a></span> (approvingly noting that the statute applies \"equally to used car salesmen, animal rights activists, fundraisers, environmentalists, and missionaries\").</p>\n<p>That logic is persuasive here. Although the Massachusetts legislature was plainly moved to enact the statute by the secondary effects of anti-abortion protests, it opted to address the secondary effects of a broader range of activities in the interest of effective enforcement. This decision to widen the statute's coverage is a matter of degree, not a matter of kind. Legislatures are not held to standards of mathematical precision where policy judgments are concerned. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Burson,</i> 504 U.S. at 210, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112736\"><a href=\"/opinion/112736/burson-v-freeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The plaintiffs say, in effect, that the 2007 Act should have been limited to abortion-related speech. Yet the absence of any reference to any particular kind of speech (and, thus, to any particular content or viewpoint) is what makes the statute content-neutral. <i>See Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 723, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If a failure to distinguish among speakers in itself gave rise to overbreadth problems, legislatures would be forced to choose between passing laws that were not content-neutral or laws that were overbroad. <i>Hill</i> pretermits the contention that the First Amendment forces state legislatures to face this sort of Morton's Fork.</p>\n<p>We have yet another bridge to cross. At oral argument in this court, the plaintiffs essayed a new and different spin on overbreadth ย a perspective that emerged during the panel's questioning. Seizing upon this perspective, the plaintiffs suggested that the Attorney General's guidance letter might be read to criminalize the conduct of anyone who engages in any \"partisan speech,\" whether or not abortion-related, while passing though the buffer zone. This interpretation raises the concern that an individual could be prosecuted merely for passing through the buffer zone en route to a destination outside the zone while, say, wearing a lapel pin advocating the election of a political candidate or a T-shirt exhorting a favorite baseball team.</p>\n<p>Though interesting, this argument is untimely. It was not raised either in the district court or in the plaintiffs' briefs on appeal.<sup>[3]</sup> It is, therefore, waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Slade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"); <i>Anderson v.

That the court inquired about the theory at oral argument does not lower this bar.</p>\n<p>We add a coda. Were we to reach the merits of this argument ย which we do not ย the proper resolution of it is not obvious.

It is difficult to understand, however, how or why a challenger can mount a facial attack on a statute that is itself not vague simply because an enforcement official has offered an interpretation of the statute that may pose problems down the road. <i>See </i><i>McGuire II,</i> 386 F.3d at 58; <i>see also </i><i>Grayned,</i> 408 U.S. at 108-09, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108598\"><a href=\"/opinion/108598/grayned-v-city-of-rockford/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That is precisely the situation here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>Prior Restraint.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We need not linger long over the plaintiffs' claim that the 2007 Act constitutes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*184</span> an impermissible prior restraint on speech. The case law makes manifest that time-place-manner restrictions are analyzed under intermediate scrutiny and not under the more rigorous standard that applies to prior restraints. <i>See, e.g., Bl(a)ck Tea Soc'y,</i> 378 F.3d at 12. Consequently, our determination that the 2007 Act is a valid time-place-manner restriction effectively forecloses the plaintiffs' resort to case law involving prior restraints. <i>See id.</i> (\"If content-neutral prohibitions on speech at certain places were deemed prior restraints, the intermediate standard of review prescribed in the time-place-manner jurisprudence would be eviscerated.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To recapitulate, the 2007 Act represents a permissible response by the Massachusetts legislature to what it reasonably perceived as a significant threat to public safety. It is content-neutral, narrowly tailored, and leaves open ample alternative channels of communication. It is, therefore, a valid time-place-manner regulation, and constitutional on its face.</p>\n<p>We add a caveat. This decision flows naturally from the very heavy burden that plaintiffs must carry in mounting a facial challenge to a state statute. Nothing that we have said forecloses the possibility that, on a better-developed record, this legislative solution may prove problematic in particular applications.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Appendix I: The Attorney General's Guidance.</i></h2>\n<blockquote>The first exemption ย for persons entering or leaving the clinic ย only allows people to cross through the buffer zone on their way to or from the clinic. It does not permit companions of clinic patients, or other people not within the scope of the second or third exemptions, to stand or remain in the buffer zone, whether to smoke, talk with others, or for any other purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The second exemption ย for employees or agents of the clinic acting within the scope of their employment ย allows clinic personnel to assist in protecting patients and ensuring their safe access to clinics, but does not allow them to express their views about abortion or to engage in any other partisan speech within the buffer zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Similarly, the third exemption ย for municipal employees or agents acting within the scope of their employment ย does not allow municipal agents to express their views about abortion or to engage in any other partisan speech within the buffer zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Finally, the fourth exemption ย for persons using the sidewalk or street adjacent to the clinic to reach a destination other than the clinic ย applies to individuals who are crossing through the buffer zone, without stopping, to go somewhere other than a location within the zone and other than the clinic, and who are not using the buffer zone for some other purpose while passing through. For example, an individual may cross through the buffer zone to reach and speak with someone outside the zone, to reach and stand in a location outside the zone (perhaps to engage in lawful protest, other speech, or prayer), or to travel on to another place altogether, provided that the individual does not do anything else within the buffer zone (such as expressing their views about abortion or engaging in other partisan speech).</blockquote>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The mechanics of the 2000 Act and the dimensions of the then-current buffer zone are described in earlier opinions of this court. <i>See </i><i>McGuire v. Reilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201281\"><a href=\"/opinion/201281/mcguire-v-reilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2004); <i>McGuire v. Reilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199554\"><a href=\"/opinion/199554/mcguire-v-reilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>[2]  This same reasoning also serves to defeat the plaintiffs' equal protection and viewpoint discrimination claims, each of which focuses on the legislature's decision to limit the reach of the relevant exception to persons associated with RHCFs.</p>\n<p>[3]  To be sure, the plaintiffs' general overbreadth argument implicitly attacks the exceptions to the 2007 Act. But avoiding waiver requires more than a hint that a particular theory may be lurking; it necessitates some developed argumentation addressed to that particular theory. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990).\n</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also argued below that the legislature's use of the word \"solely\" in the statutory text rendered the statute unconstitutionally vague. <i>See </i><i>McCullen,</i> 573 F.Supp.2d at 421. Although their newly minted argument likewise involves, in part, the statute's use of the word \"solely,\" it is a conceptually different argument.</p>\n<p>[4]  The situation may well be different if the statute itself is vague or ambiguous ย but that is not the premise of the vagueness argument that the plaintiffs are making here.</p>\n\n</div>",
