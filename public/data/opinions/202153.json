Haack, Adsuar\nMuñiz Goyco & Besosa, P.S.C., Rafael Escalera-Rodríguez, Michelle\nTaveira-Tirado, and Reichard & Escalera were on brief, for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                         April 12, 2006\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Plaintiffs-Appellants Fernando\n\nAguiar-Carrasquillo (\"Aguiar\") and María Reyes-García (\"Reyes\")\n\nallege several different causes of action arising from political\n\ndiscrimination    against   their     employers,   defendants   Government\n\nDevelopment    Bank   (\"GDB\")   and    Juan   Agosto-Alicea     (\"Agosto\").\n\nPlaintiffs are members of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\") while\n\nAgosto is a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") that\n\ncame to power in Puerto Rico after its 2000 electoral victory.\n\n            On July 15, 2003, defendants filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment.     On July 21, 2003, plaintiffs requested a thirty-day\n\nextension to file their opposition to defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment because they claimed it was essential for their\n\nopposition to depose Alba Caballero (\"Caballero\").1           The district\n\ncourt granted plaintiffs' request for an extension until August 21,\n\n2003, but warned that \"ABSOLUTELY NO FURTHER EXTENSIONS OF TIME\n\nSHALL BE GRANTED.\" (emphasis in the original).                Nevertheless,\n\nplaintiffs did not timely file their opposition to defendants'\n\nsummary judgment motion.\n\n            Four months later, on November 25, 2003, defendants filed\n\na motion requesting that the court deem unopposed their statements\n\nof uncontested material facts and grant summary judgment in their\n\nfavor. On December 24, 2003, plaintiffs opposed defendants' motion\n\n\n1\n  Caballero was the external investigator hired by the GDB in 2001\nto review all appointments and personnel transactions undertaken\nbetween July and December 2000.\n\n                                      -2-\n\ffor the admission of their statement of facts as uncontroverted,\n\nand requested a thirty-day extension to file their opposition to\n\ndefendants' summary judgment motion.    On March 12, 2004, the court\n\nentered its Opinion and Order, accepting defendants' unopposed\n\nstatement of facts and granting defendants' unopposed motion for\n\nsummary judgment.      On March 23, plaintiffs filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration on grounds that defendants had failed to provide\n\ncertain \"essential documents.\" On March 25, plaintiffs filed their\n\nfirst motion requesting that the court order defendants to produce\n\nthose documents. Finally, on April 14, 2004, more than one month\n\nafter the entry of judgment, plaintiffs filed their opposition to\n\nsummary judgment.     On March 23, 2005, the district court denied\n\nplaintiffs' motion for reconsideration.     Plaintiffs now appeal.\n\n                        I.   Uncontested Facts\n\n          Agosto became GDB President on January 2, 2001, at which\n\ntime he extended all probationary periods then in effect and\n\nordered an investigation -- to be conducted by Caballero -- of all\n\nrecent appointments, including those of plaintiffs, to determine\n\nwhether any violated the applicable law and regulations.          Both\n\nplaintiffs   allege   discriminatory    adverse   employment   actions\n\nresulting from this investigation.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f              A.    Plaintiff Aguiar\n\n              On April 7, 2000, Aguiar was appointed Executive Director\n\nof the Tourism Development Fund, a trust position,2 with a salary\n\nof $77,200.        That salary was increased to $82,227 on July 12, 2000.\n\nIn   August     2000,    the    GDB   Human      Resources   Office    prepared    an\n\nannouncement for the position of Assistant Director of Private\n\nFinance.      The requirements for the position included:\n\n              (a) Bachelor's Degree in Accounting or Finance\n              from an accredited university or college; Six\n              years of experience in loan analysis and\n              administration,   two   of  those   years   in\n              personnel supervision functions; Bilingual\n              (Spanish and English); or in its place;\n\n              (b) Master's Degree in Accounting or Finance\n              from an accredited university or college; Five\n              years of experience in loan analysis and\n              administration,   two   of  those   years   in\n              personnel supervision; Bilingual (Spanish and\n              English).\n\nJaime López (\"López\"), Director of Private Finance at GDB, reviewed\n\nthese requirements before the announcement was published, met with\n\nAguiar     to      discuss     his    eligibility      for   the     position,    and\n\nsubsequently        eliminated       the   education    prerequisites      and    the\n\nrequirements for experience in loan analysis and administration.\n\nIn   their      stead,   he     established       a   much   lower    threshold    of\n\n\n2\n   Puerto Rico law distinguishes between \"career\" employees and\n\"trust\" employees. Career employees are permanent and \"'may only\nbe removed from their positions for just cause after due filing of\ncharges.'\" Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 3 n.1\n(1st Cir. 2000) (quoting 21 P.R. Laws Ann. § 4554(b)).           By\ncontrast, trust employees \"shall be of free selection and removal,\"\ni.e., removable with or without cause. 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1350.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fqualifications for the job -- namely, six years of experience in\n\nanalysis and administration of private sector financing, two of\n\nwhich must have entailed the planning and coordination of financing\n\nservices including personnel supervision.            Despite the fact that\n\nGDB had classified the position of Assistant Director of Private\n\nFinance as one that categorically required a degree in accounting\n\nor   finance,     the    announcement     was    published    with   no     such\n\nrequirements.         Aguiar does not have a degree in accounting or\n\nfinance and would not have been eligible for the position if López\n\nhad not changed the requirements.\n\n           Aguiar applied for the position of Assistant Director of\n\nPrivate Finance and was appointed, effective September 7, 2000,\n\nsubject to the standard six month probationary period.                   At that\n\ntime, Aguiar's qualifications for the position included four years\n\nand eleven months' experience in analysis and administration of\n\nprivate sector financing, two of which related to planning and\n\ncoordination of financing services.              When he was certified as\n\neligible for the position, one additional year of employment\n\nexperience -- during which time he served as an administrative\n\nofficer   --    was    counted   toward   the   requirement   of   six    years'\n\nexperience in the analysis and administration of private sector\n\nfinancing, despite the fact that his duties as an administrative\n\nofficer did not include those activities.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f              The position of Assistant Director of Private Finance was\n\na permanent career position, with an annual salary of $58,900.\n\nAguiar continued to occupy the position of Executive Director of\n\nthe Tourism Development Fund, for which he received a \"differential\n\ncompensation\" of $23,100 annually.           The sum of his salary and the\n\ndifferential was $82,230, which is the same salary that he had\n\nreceived as Executive Director of the Tourism Development Fund\n\nprior to his promotion.         According to GDB Personnel Regulations, a\n\ndifferential can only be authorized, with written justification,\n\nwhen \"the geographic location, the extraordinary job conditions or\n\nthe extraordinary difficulties regarding recruitment or retention\n\nof personnel in certain positions justify the use of additional\n\nincentives to the ordinary salary.\"           There is no evidence on the\n\nrecord of a valid justification for the differential.\n\n              On June 6, 2001, Agosto notified Aguiar that serious\n\nirregularities had been identified with regard to his appointment\n\nas Assistant Director of Private Finance.             These included a) the\n\nimpermissible elimination of the educational prerequisite from the\n\npublished requirements for the position; b) the fact that Aguiar\n\ndid not have the six years' required relevant experience; and c)\n\nthe fact that Aguiar simultaneously occupied two positions at GDB.\n\nAfter   an    administrative     hearing    during    which   Aguiar   had   the\n\nopportunity to present evidence, his appointment was declared null\n\nand   void,    and   he   was   reinstated   to   a   previous   position    --\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fAdministrative and Finance Officer at the Tourism Development Fund,\n\neffective July 17, 2001.\n\n              B.   Plaintiff Reyes\n\n              Reyes   applied      for   the        position         of    Senior    Account\n\nExecutive at GDB on August 25, 2000.                          The requirements of the\n\nposition      included      \"two   years           of    experience        in     financing,\n\ninvestment, or professional accounting functions,\" one of which\n\nmust   have    entailed     credit    analysis           or    the    administration        of\n\nfinancing accounts or investment portfolios.                          Reyes's resumé did\n\nnot initially list any duties related to financial analysis, and\n\nshe    was    asked    to    submit      a     new       certification.             Her    new\n\ncertification, listing financial analysis responsibilities, was\n\nsubmitted on September 5, 2000.               On that date she was certified as\n\neligible for the position and appointed to the position of Senior\n\nAccount Executive, effective September 7, 2000, subject to a six-\n\nmonth probationary period.\n\n              Reyes   was   appointed         after      ten    other      candidates      had\n\npreviously been certified as eligible, despite the fact that GDB\n\nPersonnel Regulations stipulate that \"[t]he eligibles included in\n\neach certification must be the first ten (10) that appear in the\n\nregister, willing to accept the appointment under the conditions\n\nstipulated.\"       Reyes's salary was set at $40,000, more than the\n\nminimum      salary   for   the    position,            despite      the   fact     that   GDB\n\nPersonnel Regulations provide that \"every person will receive as\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\fsalary for their services the minimum rate established for the\n\nclass to which their position is assigned.\"            Only where there is\n\n\"difficulty in recruitment, extraordinary qualifications of the\n\ncandidate, or needs of the service,\" may an employee be awarded a\n\nsalary higher than the minimum.        The Director of Human Resources\n\nstated that Reyes had \"vast experience\" in the field of financial\n\nanalysis, despite the fact that her credentials do not appear to\n\nsupport   such   an    assessment,   and     Reyes   claims    that   she   had\n\n\"extraordinary    qualifications\"          because   she      was   bilingual,\n\norganized, met her deadlines, and stayed at a previous post for\n\nseven years.\n\n           Reyes's probationary period was extended when Agosto took\n\noffice as GDB President, and Caballero found several irregularities\n\nupon review of her appointment.       Among them were a) the fact that,\n\nin violation of GDB regulations, Reyes was certified as eligible\n\nfor the position after ten other candidates had been certified; and\n\nb) the fact that a higher salary was recommended without a valid\n\njustification.        On June 6, 2001, Agosto notified Reyes of the\n\nirregularities, and after an informal hearing at which she had the\n\nopportunity to present evidence, Reyes was terminated, effective\n\nJuly 17, 2001.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f                             II.   Analysis\n\n           A.   Noncompliant Brief\n\n           As an initial matter, defendants claim that plaintiffs'\n\nbrief on appeal to this court fails to comply with the local rules\n\nadopted by this Circuit. Specifically, Local Rule 30(d) stipulates\n\nthat \"[t]he court will not receive documents not in the English\n\nlanguage unless translations are furnished.\"           1st Cir. R. 30(d).\n\nNevertheless, plaintiffs' Appendix contains 57 pages (pp. 335-392)\n\nin Spanish, with no accompanying English translation. In the past,\n\nwe have refused to consider materials submitted to the court in any\n\nlanguage other than English, and we continue to do so.             See, e.g.,\n\nRamos-Báez v. Bossolo-López, 240 F.3d 92, 94 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           However,   we    do   not    think   the   exclusion    of   these\n\nuntranslated materials will have any significant effect on the\n\nstrength of plaintiffs' case because most, if not all, of these\n\nappendix   pages   appear   to   constitute     exhibits   to     plaintiffs'\n\nopposition to summary judgment. Because the district court granted\n\ndefendants' summary judgment motion unopposed, we conclude that\n\nthese exhibits were not relevant to decisionmaking below.                  On\n\nappeal, \"[w]e review only the materials actually relied upon below\n\n. . .\"   United States v. Robinson, 137 F.3d 652, 653 n.1 (1st Cir.\n\n1998). Because these exhibits were not considered below, we cannot\n\nconsider them now.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f           B.    Summary Judgment\n\n           Plaintiffs        do     not   challenge          the   district     court's\n\ndetermination that defendants' motion for summary judgment was\n\nunopposed,      or    that        defendants'         factual      assertions      were\n\nuncontroverted,      and     thus    we    do       not    consider   those     issues.\n\nNevertheless, entry of a summary judgment motion as unopposed does\n\nnot   automatically    give       rise    to    a    grant    of   summary    judgment.\n\nInstead, \"the district court [is] still obliged to consider the\n\nmotion on its merits, in light of the record as constituted, in\n\norder to determine whether judgment would be legally appropriate.\"\n\nMullen v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 972 F.2d 446, 452 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).                          In\n\nthis appeal, plaintiffs contend that the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment was not legally appropriate.\n\n           We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing\n\nall   reasonable     inferences      in    favor      of     the   non-moving    party.\n\nZapata-Matos v. Reckitt & Colman, Inc., 277 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).    Summary judgment is properly granted if the movant can\n\ndemonstrate that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\n\nand that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).                It is well-settled that \"before\n\ngranting an unopposed summary judgment motion, the court must\n\ninquire whether the moving party has met its burden to demonstrate\n\nundisputed facts entitling it to summary judgment as a matter of\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\flaw.\"     López v. Corporación Azucarera de Puerto Rico, 938 F.2d\n\n1510, 1517 (1st Cir. 1991) (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            In a political discrimination claim under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983, plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendants deprived them\n\nof federally protected rights while acting under color of state\n\nlaw.    Cepero-Rivera v. Fagundo, 414 F.3d 124, 129 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThey     must   further   establish   that   they   have   engaged   in\n\nconstitutionally protected conduct and that this conduct was a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action.\n\nMt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274,\n\n287 (1977).     The burden then shifts to defendants to demonstrate\n\nthat (i) they would have taken the same action in any event; and\n\n(ii) they would have taken such action for reasons that are not\n\nunconstitutional.    Id. at 286-87.\n\n            In this inquiry, although we are constrained by the\n\nuncontested facts as accepted by the district court, we \"construe\n\nthe record in the light most favorable to\" the non-moving party.\n\nE.g., Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co, 433 F.3d 100, 104 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    There is no doubt that the adverse employment actions in\n\nboth cases took place immediately after the administration change\n\nfollowing the PDP victory in the 2000 elections, when defendant\n\nAgosto directed Caballero to conduct an \"audit\" of all recent\n\nemployment actions to evaluate their compliance with GDB Personnel\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fRegulations.       Plaintiffs        claim    that   Caballero's      audit    was\n\n\"selective\"    because    it    only    affected     NPP   members,    but     this\n\nallegation is entirely unsupported and it is, in any event, not\n\npersuasive.       Even   if    the   personnel   actions    taken     during   the\n\nrelevant period involved NPP members, official review of such\n\nemployment decisions does not support a claim of discrimination.\n\nAs we have observed,\n\n           [i]f uniformly applied personnel practices,\n           predicated on legitimate reasons, result in\n           terminations, those terminations are not\n           unconstitutional because those affiliated with\n           one political party are disproportionately\n           impacted. It is in the nature of a change in\n           administrations that job actions by the new\n           party in power will have a disparate impact on\n           members of the outgoing party.\n\nSánchez-López v. Fuentes-Pujols, 375 F.3d 121, 140 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nWe evaluate each plaintiff's allegations in turn.\n\n           Plantiff Aguiar claims that he was reinstated to his\n\nprevious position because of political discrimination.                  However,\n\nAguiar is not certain that defendant Agosto was even aware of his\n\npolitical affiliation. In fact, his only specific allegation as to\n\nthe   knowledge    of    any    government     official    of   his    political\n\naffiliation is that former GDB Vice President Zaida Marrero knew of\n\nhis political leanings when she hired him for a position with the\n\nMunicipal Collection Revenue Center (CRIM) several years earlier,\n\nbefore her retirement in 1997.          Thus, Aguiar has not demonstrated\n\nthat political discrimination was a substantial or motivating\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\ffactor in his reinstatement to his previous career position.                        Even\n\nif, arguendo, he had made such a showing, defendants have alleged\n\nfacts   in    support      of   their       Mt.    Healthy    claim    that   Aguiar's\n\nappointment violated GDB Personnel Regulations, and thus that they\n\nwould have removed him from the position of Assistant Director of\n\nPrivate Finance regardless of his political affiliation because,\n\namong   other   reasons,        he    was    not   qualified    for    the    position.\n\nAlthough Aguiar now claims that the administrative hearing that\n\ngave rise to his removal from his position was \"pro forma, a sham\n\nand a subterfuge,\" this allegation is conclusory and devoid of any\n\nsubstantiation. As we have repeatedly intoned, \"we do not consider\n\nconclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported\n\nspeculation.\" Emmanuel v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local Union No.\n\n25, 426 F.3d 416, 419 (1st Cir. 2005) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).             Aguiar offers nothing more.\n\n             Plaintiff Reyes claims that she was terminated because of\n\nher political affiliation. However, she admits that she never told\n\nanyone at GDB about her political affiliation, claiming only that\n\npeople \"must have known\" because of her \"relationship\" with Aguiar\n\nand   the    fact   that    she      had    been   employed    under    the    previous\n\nadministration.      Reyes does not elaborate as to the nature of this\n\nrelationship with her co-plaintiff and so we have no basis upon\n\nwhich   to    evaluate     that      argument.        Further,    we    do    not   find\n\npersuasive her claim that the simple fact of her employment prior\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fto the 2000 election would have been sufficient to put her co-\n\nworkers and employers on notice of her political inclinations.                         As\n\nplaintiffs point out, they \"need not produce direct evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory treatment (a so-called 'smoking gun') to establish\n\na prima facie case of politically discriminatory demotion [or\n\ntermination].\"       Acosta-Orozco v. Rodríguez-de-Rivera, 132 F.3d 97,\n\n101-02 (1st Cir. 1997).               Nevertheless, more is required than\n\nReyes's bare allegations in this case.                We find that she has not\n\ndischarged her burden to demonstrate that her political affiliation\n\nwas   a   substantial       or   motivating       factor    for   her    termination.\n\nHowever, even if she had made a prima facie case for political\n\ndiscrimination,       defendants       have   presented       a   legitimate,      non-\n\ndiscriminatory explanation for her termination -- namely, that her\n\nappointment violated GDB Personnel Regulations.\n\n             In   addition       to   their   First       Amendment     claims,    both\n\nplaintiffs allege violations of their Fourteenth Amendment right to\n\ndue process.        Specifically, Aguiar and Reyes claim deprivation of\n\ntheir     property    interests       in   employment       without     a    meaningful\n\nhearing.    Defendants respond, consistent with the district court's\n\nopinion,     that    because     plaintiffs'       appointments         were   made    in\n\nviolation of GDB Personnel Regulations, plaintiffs had no property\n\ninterests    in     their    positions      and    thus    were   not       entitled   to\n\nFourteenth Amendment protection.                  The district court correctly\n\ndisposed of these claims.\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\f               It is clear that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees an\n\ninformal pre-termination hearing to those with a property interest\n\nin their employment. See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470\n\nU.S.    532,    542    (1985).    Such    property   rights   are   created   by\n\n\"existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent\n\nsource such as state law.\"         Id. at 538.       We have long recognized\n\nthat \"public employees hired for career positions in violation of\n\nthe Puerto Rico Personnel Act, or agency regulations promulgated\n\nthereunder, may not claim property rights to continued expectations\n\nof employment because their career appointments are null and void\n\nab initio.\"         Kauffman v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 841 F.2d 1169, 1173\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).         Because we find that both plaintiffs' positions\n\nwere secured in violation of GDB Personnel Regulations, we affirm\n\nsummary judgment as to their Fourteenth Amendment claims without\n\nevaluating the adequacy of their pre-termination hearings.3\n\n               C.    Motion for Reconsideration\n\n               Plaintiffs claim that the district court erred by denying\n\ntheir    motion       for   reconsideration     of   its   judgment   granting\n\ndefendants' unopposed motion for summary judgment.                  Plaintiffs'\n\nargument is based on three subsections of Rule 60(b) of the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure.         Subsection (1) provides for relief from\n\n\n\n3\n     Defendant Agosto also raises qualified immunity as an\naffirmative defense, but we need not reach this issue because we\nfind that neither plaintiff has made a prima facie case under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983.\n\n                                         -15-\n\fjudgment in the case of \"mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or\n\nexcusable neglect.\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).         Subsection (3)\n\nprovides for relief from judgment where there is \"fraud (whether\n\nheretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation,\n\nor other misconduct of an adverse party.\"         Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)\n\n(3).   Subsection (6) provides for relief for \"any other reason\n\njustifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\"          Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b)(6).     We review a district court's disposition of a\n\n60(b) motion for abuse of discretion.          Lepore v. Vidockler, 792\n\nF.2d 272, 274 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n          It   is   fundamental   that    Rule    60(b)   \"provides   for\n\nextraordinary relief, [and] a motion thereunder may be granted only\n\nunder exceptional circumstances.\"        Id.     Plaintiffs allege that\n\nextraordinary relief is warranted in this case because defendants\n\nwillfully and intentionally misled plaintiffs to believe that the\n\ndeposition transcripts and other documents they requested would be\n\npromptly provided. They maintain that defendants' dilatory tactics\n\nin this regard prevented them from timely filing their opposition\n\nto summary judgment.\n\n          Plaintiffs first claim that the district court erred by\n\ndenying their motion for reconsideration on grounds of \"excusable\n\nneglect,\" within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(1).       Discussing similar\n\nlanguage found elsewhere in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\n\nthe Supreme Court has acknowledged that \"excusable neglect\" is a\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\ffairly flexible concept that encompasses \"inadvertence, mistake, or\n\ncarelessness, as well as by intervening circumstances beyond the\n\nparty's control.\" Pioneer Inv. Serv. Co. v. Brunswick Assoc. Ltd.,\n\n507 U.S. 380, 388 (1993).          Plaintiffs only address one of these\n\nfactors, contending that the delay was not within their control\n\nbecause neither Caballero nor defense counsel provided certain\n\n\"essential\" documents, despite repeated requests. By contrast, the\n\ndistrict court found that plaintiffs did have a significant measure\n\nof control over –- and ability to minimize -- the delay.                      In an\n\norder   dated    August   26,    2003,    the    district      judge    allowed    an\n\nadditional      fifteen   days    for    plaintiffs       to   take    Caballero's\n\ndeposition because they had been previously unable to do so.                      The\n\norder stipulated that \"[i]f an impasse occurs, parties shall\n\nrequest the intervention of the Court, and should there be any\n\nother conflict regarding her deposition, Plaintiffs are therefore\n\nallowed to present a petition for sanctions.\" In its order denying\n\nplaintiffs' Amended Motion for Reconsideration, the district court\n\nfound that plaintiffs \"were provided an exceptional amount of time\n\nto   either     file   their    opposition      or   to   request      the   Court's\n\nintervention.\"         Nevertheless,       despite         allegedly         ongoing\n\ndifficulties, plaintiffs filed no motion requesting the court's\n\nintervention until March 23, 2004, more than six months after the\n\ndistrict court instructed plaintiffs to invoke its assistance in\n\nthe event of difficulty or delay, and fully eight months after\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fdefendants' initial motion for summary judgment.           Having exercised\n\nno diligence to meet the filing deadlines established by the\n\ndistrict court, plaintiffs cannot now claim excusable neglect under\n\nRule 60(b)(1) on grounds that the delay was outside of their\n\ncontrol.\n\n           Plaintiffs next argue that the district court should have\n\ngranted their motion for reconsideration because \"[f]ailure to\n\ndisclose or produce materials requested in discovery can constitute\n\n'misconduct' within the purview of [Rule 60(b)(3)].\"             Anderson v.\n\nCryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 923 (1st Cir. 1988).          However, we have\n\nmade clear that \"not every instance of nondisclosure merits the\n\nsame judicial response.\"      Id. at 923.     In Anderson, we established\n\na clear standard, such that\n\n           in motions for a new trial under the\n           misconduct prong of Rule 60(b)(3), the movant\n           must show the opponent's misconduct by clear\n           and convincing evidence.    Next, the moving\n           party   must   show   that    the   misconduct\n           substantially interfered with its ability\n           fully and fairly to prepare for, and proceed\n           at, trial. . . . The burden can also be met\n           by presumption or inference, if the movant can\n           successfully demonstrate that the misconduct\n           was knowing or deliberate.\n\nId. at 926.    In this case, plaintiffs have clearly not met their\n\nAnderson burden. Even if we assume, arguendo, that they have shown\n\ndefendants'    misconduct    by    \"clear     and   convincing      evidence,\"\n\nplaintiffs    have   not   even   attempted    to   show   either    that   the\n\nmisconduct \"substantially interfered\" with their ability to respond\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fto the summary judgment motion or that such misconduct was \"knowing\n\nor deliberate.\"\n\n            Finally, plaintiffs maintain that they are entitled to\n\nrelief under Rule 60(b)(6).             In order for a party to qualify for\n\nsubsection    (6),      there    must    be     a   showing   of   \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances suggesting that the party is faultless in the delay.\"\n\nPioneer, 507 U.S. at 393 (internal quotation marks omitted).                      In\n\nessence,    the   district      court     found     that   plaintiffs     were   not\n\nfaultless because they had \"more than reasonable time\" to file\n\ntheir opposition to summary judgment, and because, despite the\n\ncourt's explicit instructions as to proper procedure in the event\n\nof stonewalling from defendants, plaintiffs failed to comply.                     In\n\nshort, the district court did not consider plaintiffs' situation to\n\nbe   a   unique   one   where,    as    is    required     under   Rule   60(b)(6),\n\n\"principles of equity mandate relief.\"                   Jinks v. AlliedSignal,\n\nInc., 250 F.3d 381, 387 (2001).              We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n                                III.     Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment against plaintiffs.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f",

Uncontested Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agosto became GDB President on January 2, 2001, at which time he extended all probationary periods then in effect and ordered an investigation &#8212; to be conducted by Caballero &#8212; of all recent appointments, including those of plaintiffs, to determine whether any violated the applicable law and regulations. Both plaintiffs allege discriminatory adverse employment actions resulting from this investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Plaintiff Aguiar</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 2000, Aguiar was appointed Executive Director of the Tourism Development Fund, a trust position,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> with a salary of $77,200. That salary was increased to $82,227 on July 12, 2000. In August 2000, the GDB Human Resources Office prepared an announcement for the position of Assistant Director of Private Finance. The requirements for the position included:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Bachelor's Degree in Accounting or Finance from an accredited university or college; Six years of experience in loan analysis and administration, two of those years in personnel supervision functions; Bilingual (Spanish and English); or in its place;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Master's Degree in Accounting or Finance from an accredited university or college; Five years of experience in loan analysis and administration, two of those years in personnel supervision; Bilingual (Spanish and English).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jaime L&#243;pez (\"L&#243;pez\"), Director of Private Finance at GDB, reviewed these requirements before the announcement was published, met with Aguiar to discuss his eligibility for the position, and subsequently eliminated the education prerequisites and the requirements for experience in loan analysis and administration. In their stead, he established a much lower threshold of qualifications for the job &#8212; namely, six years of experience in analysis and administration of private sector financing, two of which must have entailed the planning and coordination of financing services including personnel supervision. Despite the fact that GDB had classified the position of Assistant Director of Private Finance as one that categorically required a degree in accounting or finance, the announcement was published with no such requirements. Aguiar does not have a degree in accounting or finance and would not have been eligible for the position if L&#243;pez had not changed the requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aguiar applied for the position of Assistant Director of Private Finance and was appointed, effective September 7, 2000, subject to the standard six month probationary period. At that time, Aguiar's qualifications for the position included four years and eleven months' experience in analysis and administration of private sector financing, two of which related to planning and coordination of financing services. When he was certified as eligible for the position, one additional year of employment experience &#8212; during which time he served as an administrative officer &#8212; was counted toward the requirement of six years' experience in the analysis and administration of private sector financing, despite the fact that his duties as an administrative officer did not include those activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The position of Assistant Director of Private Finance was a permanent career position, with an annual salary of $58,900. Aguiar continued to occupy the position of Executive Director of the Tourism Development Fund, for which he received a \"differential compensation\" of $23,100 annually. The sum of his salary and the differential was $82,230, which is the same salary that he had received as Executive Director of the Tourism Development Fund prior to his promotion. According to GDB Personnel Regulations, a differential can only be authorized, with written justification, when \"the geographic location, the extraordinary job conditions or the extraordinary difficulties regarding recruitment or retention of personnel in certain positions justify the use of additional incentives to the ordinary salary.\" There is no evidence on the record of a valid justification for the differential.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 6, 2001, Agosto notified Aguiar that serious irregularities had been identified with regard to his appointment as Assistant Director of Private Finance. These included a) the impermissible elimination of the educational prerequisite from the published requirements for the position; b) the fact that Aguiar did not have the six years' required relevant experience; and c) the fact that Aguiar simultaneously occupied two positions at GDB. After an administrative hearing during which Aguiar had the opportunity to present evidence, his appointment was declared null and void, and he was reinstated to a previous position &#8212; Administrative and Finance Officer at the Tourism Development Fund, effective July 17, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Plaintiff Reyes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes applied for the position of Senior Account Executive at GDB on August 25, 2000. The requirements of the position included \"two years of experience in financing, investment, or professional accounting functions,\" one of which must have entailed credit analysis or the administration of financing accounts or investment portfolios. Reyes's resum&#233; did not initially list any duties related to financial analysis, and she was asked to submit a new certification. Her new certification, listing financial analysis responsibilities, was submitted on September 5, 2000. On that date she was certified as eligible for the position and appointed to the position of Senior Account Executive, effective September 7, 2000, subject to a six-month probationary period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes was appointed after ten other candidates had previously been certified as eligible, despite the fact that GDB Personnel Regulations stipulate that \"[t]he eligibles included in each certification must be the first ten (10) that appear in the register, willing to accept the appointment under the conditions stipulated.\" Reyes's salary was set at $40,000, more than the minimum salary for the position, despite the fact that GDB Personnel Regulations provide that \"every person will receive as salary for their services the minimum rate established for the class to which their position is assigned.\" Only where there is \"difficulty in recruitment, extraordinary qualifications of the candidate, or needs of the service,\" may an employee be awarded a salary higher than the minimum. The Director of Human Resources stated that Reyes had \"vast experience\" in the field of financial analysis, despite the fact that her credentials do not appear to support such an assessment, and Reyes claims that she had \"extraordinary qualifications\" because she was bilingual, organized, met her deadlines, and stayed at a previous post for seven years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes's probationary period was extended when Agosto took office as GDB President, and Caballero found several irregularities upon review of her appointment. Among them were a) the fact that, in violation of GDB regulations, Reyes was certified as eligible for the position after ten other candidates had been certified; and b) the fact that a higher salary was recommended without a valid justification. On June 6, 2001, Agosto notified Reyes of the irregularities, and after an informal hearing at which she had the opportunity to present evidence, Reyes was terminated, effective July 17, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Noncompliant Brief</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, defendants claim that plaintiffs' brief on appeal to this court fails to comply with the local rules adopted by this Circuit. Specifically, Local Rule 30(d) stipulates that \"[t]he court will not receive documents not in the English language unless translations are furnished.\" 1st Cir. R. 30(d). Nevertheless, plaintiffs' Appendix contains 57 pages (pp. 335-392) in Spanish, with no accompanying English translation. In the past, we have refused to consider materials submitted to the court in any language other than English, and we continue to do so. <i>See, e.g., Ramos-B&#225;ez v. Bossolo-L&#243;pez,</i> 240 F.3d 92, 94 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we do not think the exclusion of these untranslated materials will have any significant effect on the strength of plaintiffs' case because most, if not all, of these appendix pages appear to constitute exhibits to plaintiffs' opposition to summary judgment. Because the district court granted defendants' summary judgment motion unopposed, we conclude that these exhibits were not relevant to decisionmaking below. On appeal, \"[w]e review only the materials actually relied upon below ...\" <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 137 F.3d 652, 653 n. 1 (1st Cir.1998). Because these exhibits were not considered below, we cannot consider them now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs do not challenge the district court's determination that defendants' motion for summary judgment was unopposed, or that defendants' factual assertions were uncontroverted, and thus we do not consider those issues. Nevertheless, entry of a summary judgment motion as unopposed does not automatically give rise to a grant of summary judgment. Instead, \"the district court [is] still obliged to consider the motion on its merits, in light of the record as constituted, in order to determine whether judgment would be legally appropriate.\" <i>Mullen v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co.,</i> 972 F.2d 446, 452 (1st Cir.1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In this appeal, plaintiffs contend that the district court's grant of summary judgment was not legally appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a grant of summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <i>Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> 277 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir.2002). Summary judgment is properly granted if the movant can demonstrate that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). It is well-settled that \"before granting an unopposed summary judgment motion, the court must inquire whether the moving party has met its burden to demonstrate undisputed facts entitling it to summary judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>L&#243;pez v. Corporaci&#243;n Azucarera de Puerto Rico,</i> 938 F.2d 1510, 1517 (1st Cir.1991) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a political discrimination claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendants deprived them of federally protected rights while acting under color of state law. <i>Cepero-Rivera v. Fagundo,</i> 414 F.3d 124, 129 (1st Cir.2005). They must further establish that they have engaged in constitutionally protected conduct and that this conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action. <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). The burden then shifts to defendants to demonstrate that (i) they would have taken the same action in any event; and (ii) they would have taken such action for reasons that are not unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> at 286-87, 97 S.Ct. 568.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this inquiry, although we are constrained by the uncontested facts as accepted by the district court, we \"construe the record in the light most favorable to\" the non-moving party. <i>E.g., Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 433 F.3d 100, 104 (1st Cir.2005). There is no doubt that the adverse employment actions in both cases took place immediately after the administration change following the PDP victory in the 2000 elections, when defendant Agosto directed Caballero to conduct an \"audit\" of all recent employment actions to evaluate their compliance with GDB Personnel Regulations. Plaintiffs claim that Caballero's audit was \"selective\" because it only affected NPP members, but this allegation is entirely unsupported and it is, in any event, not persuasive. Even if the personnel actions taken during the relevant period involved NPP members, official review of such employment decisions does not support a claim of discrimination. As we have observed,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]f uniformly applied personnel practices, predicated on legitimate reasons, result in terminations, those terminations are not unconstitutional because those affiliated with one political party are disproportionately impacted. It is in the nature of a change in administrations that job actions by the new party in power will have a disparate impact on members of the outgoing party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>S&#225;nchez-L&#243;pez v. Fuentes-Pujols,</i> 375 F.3d 121, 140 (1st Cir.2004). We evaluate each plaintiff's allegations in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Aguiar claims that he was reinstated to his previous position because of political discrimination. However, Aguiar is not certain that defendant Agosto was even aware of his political affiliation. In fact, his only specific allegation as to the knowledge of any government official of his political affiliation is that former GDB Vice President Zaida Marrero knew of his political leanings when she hired him for a position with the Municipal Collection Revenue Center (CRIM) several years earlier, before her retirement in 1997. Thus, Aguiar has not demonstrated that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in his reinstatement to his previous career position. Even if, <i>arguendo,</i> he had made such a showing, defendants have alleged facts in support of their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> claim that Aguiar's appointment violated GDB Personnel Regulations, and thus that they would have removed him from the position of Assistant Director of Private Finance regardless of his political affiliation because, among other reasons, he was not qualified for the position. Although Aguiar now claims that the administrative hearing that gave rise to his removal from his position was \"pro forma, a sham and a subterfuge,\" this allegation is conclusory and devoid of any substantiation. As we have repeatedly intoned, \"we do not consider conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Emmanuel v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local Union No. 25,</i> 426 F.3d 416, 419 (1st Cir.2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Aguiar offers nothing more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Reyes claims that she was terminated because of her political affiliation. However, she admits that she never told anyone at GDB about her political affiliation, claiming only that people \"must have known\" because of her \"relationship\" with Aguiar and the fact that she had been employed under the previous administration. Reyes does not elaborate as to the nature of this relationship with her co-plaintiff and so we have no basis upon which to evaluate that argument. Further, we do not find persuasive her claim that the simple fact of her employment prior to the 2000 election would have been sufficient to put her co-workers and employers on notice of her political inclinations. As plaintiffs point out, they \"need not produce direct evidence of discriminatory treatment (a so-called `smoking gun') to establish a prima facie case of politically discriminatory demotion [or termination].\" <i>Acosta-Orozco v. Rodr&#237;guez-de-Rivera,</i> 132 F.3d 97, 101-02 (1st Cir.1997). Nevertheless, more is required than Reyes's bare allegations in this case. We find that she has not discharged her burden to demonstrate that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for her termination. However, even if she had made a prima facie case for political discrimination, defendants have presented a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for her termination &#8212; namely, that her appointment violated GDB Personnel Regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to their First Amendment claims, both plaintiffs allege violations of their Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. Specifically, Aguiar and Reyes claim deprivation of their property interests in employment without a meaningful hearing. Defendants respond, consistent with the district court's opinion, that because plaintiffs' appointments were made in violation of GDB Personnel Regulations, plaintiffs had no property interests in their positions and thus were not entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection. The district court correctly disposed of these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees an informal pre-termination hearing to those with a property interest in their employment. See <i>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). Such property rights are created by \"existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 538, 105 S.Ct. 1487. We have long recognized that \"public employees hired for career positions in violation of the Puerto Rico Personnel Act, or agency regulations promulgated thereunder, may not claim property rights to continued expectations of employment because their career appointments are null and void <i>ab initio.</i>\" <i>Kauffman v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co.,</i> 841 F.2d 1169, 1173 (1st Cir.1988). Because we find that both plaintiffs' positions were secured in violation of GDB Personnel Regulations, we affirm summary judgment as to their Fourteenth Amendment claims without evaluating the adequacy of their pre-termination hearings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs claim that the district court erred by denying their motion for reconsideration of its judgment granting defendants' unopposed motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs' argument is based on three subsections of Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Subsection (1) provides for relief from judgment in the case of \"mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1). Subsection (3) provides for relief from judgment where there is \"fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3). Subsection (6) provides for relief for \"any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). We review a district court's disposition of a 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <i>Lepore v. Vidockler,</i> 792 F.2d 272, 274 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is fundamental that Rule 60(b) \"provides for extraordinary relief, [and] a motion thereunder may be granted only under exceptional circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> Plaintiffs allege that extraordinary relief is warranted in this case because defendants willfully and intentionally misled plaintiffs to believe that the deposition transcripts and other documents they requested would be promptly provided. They maintain that defendants' dilatory tactics in this regard prevented them from timely filing their opposition to summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs first claim that the district court erred by denying their motion for reconsideration on grounds of \"excusable neglect,\" within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(1). Discussing similar language found elsewhere in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that \"excusable neglect\" is a fairly flexible concept that encompasses \"inadvertence, mistake, or carelessness, as well as by intervening circumstances beyond the party's control.\" <i>Pioneer Inv. Serv. Co. v. Brunswick Assoc. Ltd.,</i> 507 U.S. 380, 388, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993). Plaintiffs only address one of these factors, contending that the delay was not within their control because neither Caballero nor defense counsel provided certain \"essential\" documents, despite repeated requests. By contrast, the district court found that plaintiffs did have a significant measure of control over &#8212; and ability to minimize &#8212; the delay. In an order dated August 26, 2003, the district judge allowed an additional fifteen days for plaintiffs to take Caballero's deposition because they had been previously unable to do so. The order stipulated that \"[i]f an impasse occurs, parties shall request the intervention of the Court, and should there be any other conflict regarding her deposition, Plaintiffs are therefore allowed to present a petition for sanctions.\" In its order denying plaintiffs' Amended Motion for Reconsideration, the district court found that plaintiffs \"were provided an exceptional amount of time to either file their opposition or to request the Court's intervention.\" Nevertheless, despite allegedly ongoing difficulties, plaintiffs filed no motion requesting the court's intervention until March 23, 2004, more than six months after the district court instructed plaintiffs to invoke its assistance in the event of difficulty or delay, and fully eight months after defendants' initial motion for summary judgment. Having exercised no diligence to meet the filing deadlines established by the district court, plaintiffs cannot now claim excusable neglect under Rule 60(b)(1) on grounds that the delay was outside of their control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs next argue that the district court should have granted their motion for reconsideration because \"[f]ailure to disclose or produce materials requested in discovery can constitute `misconduct' within the purview of [Rule 60(b)(3)].\" <i>Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.,</i> 862 F.2d 910, 923 (1st Cir.1988). However, we have made clear that \"not every instance of nondisclosure merits the same judicial response.\" <i>Id.</i> at 923. In <i>Anderson,</i> we established a clear standard, such that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">in motions for a new trial under the misconduct prong of Rule 60(b)(3), the movant must show the opponent's misconduct by clear and convincing evidence. Next, the moving party must show that the misconduct substantially interfered with its ability fully and fairly to prepare for, and proceed at, trial.... The burden can also be met by presumption or inference, if the movant can successfully demonstrate that the misconduct was knowing or deliberate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 926. In this case, plaintiffs have clearly not met their <i>Anderson</i> burden. Even if we assume, <i>arguendo,</i> that they have shown defendants' misconduct by \"clear and convincing evidence,\" plaintiffs have not even attempted to show either that the misconduct \"substantially interfered\" with their ability to respond to the summary judgment motion or that such misconduct was \"knowing or deliberate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs maintain that they are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(6). In order for a party to qualify for subsection (6), there must be a showing of \"extraordinary circumstances suggesting that the party is faultless in the delay.\" <i>Pioneer,</i> 507 U.S. at 393, 113 S.Ct. 1489 (internal quotation marks omitted). In essence, the district court found that plaintiffs were not faultless because they had \"more than reasonable time\" to file their opposition to summary judgment, and because, despite the court's explicit instructions as to proper procedure in the event of stonewalling from defendants, plaintiffs failed to comply. In short, the district court did not consider plaintiffs' situation to be a unique one where, as is required under Rule 60(b)(6), \"principles of equity mandate relief.\" <i>Jinks v. AlliedSignal, Inc.,</i> 250 F.3d 381, 387 (2001). We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Both plaintiffs allege discriminatory adverse employment actions resulting from this investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Plaintiff Aguiar</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 2000, Aguiar was appointed Executive Director of the Tourism Development Fund, a trust position,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> with a salary of $77,200. That salary was increased to $82,227 on July 12, 2000. In August 2000, the GDB Human Resources Office prepared an announcement for the position of Assistant Director of Private Finance. The requirements for the position included:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Bachelor's Degree in Accounting or Finance from an accredited university or college; Six years of experience in loan analysis and administration, two of those years in personnel supervision functions; Bilingual (Spanish and English); or in its place;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Master's Degree in Accounting or Finance from an accredited university or college; Five years of experience in loan analysis and administration, two of those years in personnel supervision; Bilingual (Spanish and English).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jaime L&#243;pez (\"L&#243;pez\"), Director of Private Finance at GDB, reviewed these requirements before the announcement was published, met with Aguiar to discuss his eligibility for the position, and subsequently eliminated the education prerequisites and the requirements for experience in loan analysis and administration. In their stead, he established a much lower threshold of qualifications for the job &#8212; namely, six years of experience in analysis and administration of private sector financing, two of which must have entailed the planning and coordination of financing services including personnel supervision. Despite the fact that GDB had classified the position of Assistant Director of Private Finance as one that categorically required a degree in accounting or finance, the announcement was published with no such requirements. Aguiar does not have a degree in accounting or finance and would not have been eligible for the position if L&#243;pez had not changed the requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aguiar applied for the position of Assistant Director of Private Finance and was appointed, effective September 7, 2000, subject to the standard six month probationary period. At that time, Aguiar's qualifications for the position included four years and eleven months' experience in analysis and administration of private sector financing, two of which related to planning and coordination of financing services. When he was certified as eligible for the position, one additional year of employment experience &#8212; during which time he served as an administrative officer &#8212; was counted toward the requirement of six years' experience in the analysis and administration of private sector financing, despite the fact that his duties as an administrative officer did not include those activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The position of Assistant Director of Private Finance was a permanent career position, with an annual salary of $58,900. Aguiar continued to occupy the position of Executive Director of the Tourism Development Fund, for which he received a \"differential compensation\" of $23,100 annually. The sum of his salary and the differential was $82,230, which is the same salary that he had received as Executive Director of the Tourism Development Fund prior to his promotion. According to GDB Personnel Regulations, a differential can only be authorized, with written justification, when \"the geographic location, the extraordinary job conditions or the extraordinary difficulties regarding recruitment or retention of personnel in certain positions justify the use of additional incentives to the ordinary salary.\" There is no evidence on the record of a valid justification for the differential.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 6, 2001, Agosto notified Aguiar that serious irregularities had been identified with regard to his appointment as Assistant Director of Private Finance. These included a) the impermissible elimination of the educational prerequisite from the published requirements for the position; b) the fact that Aguiar did not have the six years' required relevant experience; and c) the fact that Aguiar simultaneously occupied two positions at GDB. After an administrative hearing during which Aguiar had the opportunity to present evidence, his appointment was declared null and void, and he was reinstated to a previous position &#8212; Administrative and Finance Officer at the Tourism Development Fund, effective July 17, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Plaintiff Reyes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes applied for the position of Senior Account Executive at GDB on August 25, 2000. The requirements of the position included \"two years of experience in financing, investment, or professional accounting functions,\" one of which must have entailed credit analysis or the administration of financing accounts or investment portfolios. Reyes's resum&#233; did not initially list any duties related to financial analysis, and she was asked to submit a new certification.

Specifically, Local Rule 30(d) stipulates that \"[t]he court will not receive documents not in the English language unless translations are furnished.\" 1st Cir. R. 30(d). Nevertheless, plaintiffs' Appendix contains 57 pages (pp. 335-392) in Spanish, with no accompanying English translation. In the past, we have refused to consider materials submitted to the court in any language other than English, and we continue to do so. <i>See, e.g., Ramos-B&#225;ez v.

Nevertheless, entry of a summary judgment motion as unopposed does not automatically give rise to a grant of summary judgment.

There is no doubt that the adverse employment actions in both cases took place immediately after the administration change following the PDP victory in the 2000 elections, when defendant Agosto directed Caballero to conduct an \"audit\" of all recent employment actions to evaluate their compliance with GDB Personnel Regulations. Plaintiffs claim that Caballero's audit was \"selective\" because it only affected NPP members, but this allegation is entirely unsupported and it is, in any event, not persuasive. Even if the personnel actions taken during the relevant period involved NPP members, official review of such employment decisions does not support a claim of discrimination.

However, Aguiar is not certain that defendant Agosto was even aware of his political affiliation. In fact, his only specific allegation as to the knowledge of any government official of his political affiliation is that former GDB Vice President Zaida Marrero knew of his political leanings when she hired him for a position with the Municipal Collection Revenue Center (CRIM) several years earlier, before her retirement in 1997. Thus, Aguiar has not demonstrated that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in his reinstatement to his previous career position. Even if, <i>arguendo,</i> he had made such a showing, defendants have alleged facts in support of their <i>Mt. Healthy</i> claim that Aguiar's appointment violated GDB Personnel Regulations, and thus that they would have removed him from the position of Assistant Director of Private Finance regardless of his political affiliation because, among other reasons, he was not qualified for the position. Although Aguiar now claims that the administrative hearing that gave rise to his removal from his position was \"pro forma, a sham and a subterfuge,\" this allegation is conclusory and devoid of any substantiation. As we have repeatedly intoned, \"we do not consider conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Emmanuel v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local Union No. 25,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201848\"><a href=\"/opinion/201848/emmanuel-v-international/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span>, 419 (1st Cir.2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Aguiar offers nothing more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Reyes claims that she was terminated because of her political affiliation. However, she admits that she never told anyone at GDB about her political affiliation, claiming only that people \"must have known\" because of her \"relationship\" with Aguiar and the fact that she had been employed under the previous administration. Reyes does not elaborate as to the nature of this relationship with her co-plaintiff and so we have no basis upon which to evaluate that argument. Further, we do not find persuasive her claim that the simple fact of her employment prior to the 2000 election would have been sufficient to put her co-workers and employers on notice of her political inclinations. As plaintiffs point out, they \"need not produce direct evidence of discriminatory treatment (a so-called `smoking gun') to establish a prima facie case of politically discriminatory demotion [or termination].\" <i>Acosta-Orozco v. Rodr&#237;guez-de-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197706\"><a href=\"/opinion/197706/acosta-orozco-v-rodriguez-de-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 101-02 (1st Cir.1997). Nevertheless, more is required than Reyes's bare allegations in this case. We find that she has not discharged her burden to demonstrate that her political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for her termination. However, even if she had made a prima facie case for political discrimination, defendants have presented a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for her termination &#8212; namely, that her appointment violated GDB Personnel Regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to their First Amendment claims, both plaintiffs allege violations of their Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. Specifically, Aguiar and Reyes claim deprivation of their property interests in employment without a meaningful hearing. Defendants respond, consistent with the district court's opinion, that because plaintiffs' appointments were made in violation of GDB Personnel Regulations, plaintiffs had no property interests in their positions and thus were not entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.

Plaintiffs only address one of these factors, contending that the delay was not within their control because neither Caballero nor defense counsel provided certain \"essential\" documents, despite repeated requests. By contrast, the district court found that plaintiffs did have a significant measure of control over &#8212; and ability to minimize &#8212; the delay. In an order dated August 26, 2003, the district judge allowed an additional fifteen days for plaintiffs to take Caballero's deposition because they had been previously unable to do so. The order stipulated that \"[i]f an impasse occurs, parties shall request the intervention of the Court, and should there be any other conflict regarding her deposition, Plaintiffs are therefore allowed to present a petition for sanctions.\" In its order denying plaintiffs' Amended Motion for Reconsideration, the district court found that plaintiffs \"were provided an exceptional amount of time to either file their opposition or to request the Court's intervention.\" Nevertheless, despite allegedly ongoing difficulties, plaintiffs filed no motion requesting the court's intervention until March 23, 2004, more than six months after the district court instructed plaintiffs to invoke its assistance in the event of difficulty or delay, and fully eight months after defendants' initial motion for summary judgment. Having exercised no diligence to meet the filing deadlines established by the district court, plaintiffs cannot now claim excusable neglect under Rule 60(b)(1) on grounds that the delay was outside of their control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs next argue that the district court should have granted their motion for reconsideration because \"[f]ailure to disclose or produce materials requested in discovery can constitute `misconduct' within the purview of [Rule 60(b)(3)].\" <i>Anderson v.
