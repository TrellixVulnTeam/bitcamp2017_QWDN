William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     George J. West, on brief, for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart and Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant United\nStates Attorneys, with whom Craig N. Moore, Acting United States\nAttorney, on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             April 6, 2004\n\f            Per Curiam.        Defendant-appellant Alvin White (\"White\")\n\nappeals the district court's denial of his request to credit the\n\ntime he served at a Rhode Island prison towards his federal\n\nsentence.    We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            White was stopped by Rhode Island police officers for a\n\nmotor vehicle violation on May 9, 2002.               He was taken into state\n\ncustody, where it was discovered that a bench warrant on an\n\nunrelated charge had been issued for White in New York.                    Beginning\n\non   May   10,   2002,    White   was     held   at   the    Adult    Correctional\n\nInstitution (\"ACI\") in Rhode Island. On August 29, 2002, White was\n\nreleased from state custody to the custody of the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\"), but he remained at ACI.\n\n            White, a citizen of Jamaica, had been incarcerated in New\n\nYork   state.     He     was   deported    on    August     14,    1995.     Without\n\nauthorization from the Attorney General, White reentered the United\n\nStates sometime in 2000.\n\n            White was indicted for illegal reentry in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1326(a) and (b)(2) on October 30, 2002.                   In due course,\n\nWhite entered a plea of guilty to the charges.                    At the sentencing\n\nhearing, the district judge asked White whether there were any\n\nmotions for downward departure. Counsel stated he would not pursue\n\nany such motion, but did request that the court recognize that\n\nWhite had been in detention prior to the sentencing and that he\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fshould be credited for time served at ACI.      The district court,\n\nafter hearing from the Probation Officer, declined that request\n\nbecause he did not have the authority to credit White for time\n\nserved.\n\n                                 II.\n\n           The issue is not whether White should receive credit for\n\nthe time spent at ACI before he was transferred to the custody of\n\nthe INS, but whether the district court had the power to credit the\n\ntime.     It did not.     It is settled law that under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3585(b),      discretion to credit time served is vested in the\n\nAttorney General, through the Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\"), and not in\n\nthe sentencing court.    See United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S. 329,\n\n331-36 (1992) (holding that under § 3585(b) the BOP has the\n\nresponsibility of computing the amount of credit a defendant\n\nreceives after defendant begins serving a sentence); United States\n\nv. Morales-Madera, 352 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"defendants who\n\nseek credit for discharged sentences must ordinarily apply to the\n\nAttorney General, through the Bureau of Prisons, under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3585(b)\").\n\n           To the extent that White now seeks to argue his appeal as\n\na denial of a motion for downward departure, we believe it is\n\nunavailing.    We have yet to determine the issue of whether credit\n\nfor time served is the proper subject of a motion for downward\n\ndeparture.     See Morales-Madeira, 352 F.3d at 15.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          Assuming arguendo that one could make a legitimate motion\n\nfor downward departure based on the lack of credit for time served,\n\nWhite made no such motion here.          While White's counsel made a\n\n\"request\" for the crediting, in the very same breath he indicated\n\nthat he would not pursue any motions for downward departure. Given\n\nthat a downward departure was never asked for by White, it cannot\n\nbe the case that the district court erred in failing to grant such\n\na departure sua sponte.     United States v. Field, 39 F.3d 15, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1088 (1995).\n\n                                  III.\n\n          For   the   reasons   stated   above,   the   judgment   of   the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
