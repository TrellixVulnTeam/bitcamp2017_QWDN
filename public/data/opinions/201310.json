Sutherland and\nBrickley, Sears &   Sorett, P.A. were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 28, 2004\n\n\n\n\n     *\n     Of the     Northern    District     of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge.         Plaintiff Richard C.\n\nYoung & Co., Ltd., brought this action against Dr. Morris Leventhal\n\nand Judith Leventhal for a declaration that the parties’ investment\n\nand trust management agreements required arbitration under them to\n\nbe held in Boston.     Young also sought an injunction against the\n\narbitration    initiated    by   the     Leventhals    against   Young   in\n\nCalifornia. The District Court enjoined the California arbitration\n\nbut declined the requested declaration and, instead, ordered the\n\nLeventhals to submit the dispute to the American Arbitration\n\nAssociation (AAA) in Boston.       Young appeals the District Court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n            Young is a Rhode Island corporation registered as an\n\ninvestment advisor with the United States Securities and Exchange\n\nCommission with its principal office in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nDr. Morris Leventhal and his wife, Judith Leventhal, are clients of\n\nYoung residing in Ventura, California.         Both Leventhals serve as\n\ntrustees of the Leventhal Family Revocable Trust.\n\n            Dr. Leventhal has employed Young’s services for over ten\n\nyears.    In March of 2002, he executed an investment management\n\nagreement with Young.      In May of 2002, the Leventhals        executed a\n\ntrust    management   agreement.       Both   agreements    contained    the\n\nfollowing arbitration clause:\n\n            Arbitration. In the event of any disagreement\n            between us in connection with this Agreement\n            we will meet in good faith to attempt to\n            resolve such disagreement. If we are unable to\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          resolve the disagreement within 30 days after\n          receipt of written notice by either party from\n          the other that such a disagreement exists, the\n          disagreement will be submitted for arbitration\n          to the American Arbitration Association in\n          Boston, Massachusetts, in accordance with the\n          Rules of Commercial Arbitration of the\n          Association. There is no obligation to\n          arbitrate changes in or additions to the terms\n          of this Agreement, and no arbitrator will have\n          the power to add to or subtract from the terms\n          of this Agreement. Each of us will bear his\n          own costs. Judgment may be entered in any\n          court within the State of Rhode Island.\n          (Emphasis added.)\n\n          At    some    point       after     executing      the     agreements,\n\nDr. Leventhal took exception to Young’s handling of his trust\n\nmanagement account.    He wrote a notice of claim letter to Young in\n\nan   attempt   to   resolve    his    dispute     in    accordance     with   the\n\narbitration clause, followed by a second letter. On February 3,\n\n2003, he instituted an arbitration proceeding against Young with\n\nthe AAA in California.\n\n           Upon receipt of notice of the arbitration claim, Young\n\nobjected to the arbitration being held in California.                    AAA in\n\nCalifornia     requested      and     received         submissions     regarding\n\ndetermination of the locale and concluded that the arbitration\n\nshould go forward in California.            Because of the pendency of this\n\naction, commencement of the arbitration was deferred.\n\n           Young then brought this action in the District Court,\n\ncontending that the language of the arbitration clause emphasized\n\nabove was a forum selection clause requiring any arbitration to be\n\nheld in Boston.     The District Court rejected this interpretation,\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fholding that the clause did not require the Leventhals to arbitrate\n\nin    Boston,   but   did   require    them   to    submit   the   request    for\n\narbitration to the Boston office of the AAA.             It enjoined further\n\nproceedings in California and compelled the Leventhals to submit\n\nthe arbitration request to the AAA in Boston.            Young then appealed\n\nto this court.\n\n            At oral argument counsel advised the court that while the\n\nappeal had been pending the Leventhals submitted their dispute to\n\nthe AAA in Boston as required by the agreement.              The AAA requested\n\nthe parties to provide information and their reasons with respect\n\nto the location of the arbitration and then determined that the\n\narbitration should be heard in California.\n\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\nI.     SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\n\n            The    Leventhals   challenge     the    court’s   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction. Young invoked diversity jurisdiction.                  28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1332(a).      The Leventhals dispute that the amount in controversy\n\nexceeds $75,000, arguing that the statute prohibits including\n\ninterest and costs in the calculation. The District Court rejected\n\nthe    argument.      It    found    the   amount   in   controversy     in   the\n\narbitration to be $59,703.56, plus interest.                 In addition, the\n\ncourt included the costs that Young would incur as a result of\n\narbitrating in California, i.e., the incremental costs it would\n\nincur if relief were denied in this action, amounting to $30,000.\n\nCourts have repeatedly held that the value of the matter in\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcontroversy is measured not by the monetary judgment which the\n\nplaintiff may recover but by the judgment’s pecuniary consequences\n\nto those involved in the litigation.       Duderwicz v. Sweetwater\n\nSavings Assoc., 595 F.2d 1008, 1014 (5th Cir. 1979); Beacon Constr.\n\nCo. v. Matco Elec. Co., 521 F.2d 392, 399 (2d Cir. 1975); Mass.\n\nState Pharmaceutical Ass’n v. Fed. Prescription Serv., 431 F.2d\n\n130, 132 (8th Cir. 1970).   Here, the object of the litigation was\n\nto avoid the additional costs Young would incur if the arbitration\n\nwere held in California instead of Boston.         Those costs are\n\nproperly included in the calculation of the amount in controversy.\n\nSee Hunt v. Wash. Apple Adver. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 347 (1977)\n\n(stating that “[i]n actions seeking declaratory or injunctive\n\nrelief it is well established that the amount in controversy is\n\nmeasured by the value of the object of the litigation”).         We\n\nconclude that the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nII.   THE MERITS\n\n           Because this appeal presents a question of law, appellate\n\nreview is plenary. Shaw’s Supermarkets v. United Food & Commercial\n\nWorkers Union, Local 791, 321 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          The central issue raised by Young’s appeal is whether the\n\nlanguage of the arbitration clause emphasized above is a forum\n\nselection clause, requiring the arbitration to be held in Boston.\n\nThe District Court rejected Young’s contention, interpreting the\n\nclause as merely requiring the Leventhals to submit their dispute\n\nto the AAA in Boston.     The court reasoned that the clause was\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fambiguous and that the agreement, as a contract of adhesion, should\n\nbe construed against Young.\n\n              At the threshold the court addressed the question of its\n\npower    to   interpret   the   forum   selection   clause.   The   court\n\nacknowledged that the recent Supreme Court decisions in Howsam v.\n\nDean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79 (2002), and Green Tree\n\nFinancial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444 (2003), arguably left it\n\nwithout authority to interpret the forum selection clause.            It\n\nfound more persuasive, however, earlier decisions by courts of\n\nappeals holding that the interpretation of forum selection clauses\n\nwas for the court, not the arbitrator, citing        Bear, Stearns & Co.\n\nInc. v. Bennett, 938 F.2d 31 (2d Cir. 1991); Snyder v. Smith,\n\n736 F.2d 409 (7th Cir. 1984), overruled on other grounds by Felzen\n\nv. Andreas, 134 F.3d 873 (7th Cir. 1998); McCullough v. Dean Witter\n\nReynolds, Inc., 177 F.3d 1307 (11th Cir. 1999); see also KKW Enter.\n\nInc. v. Gloria Jean’s Gourmet Coffees Franchising Corp., 184 F.3d\n\n42 (1st Cir. 1999).1\n\n              In Howsam, the Court held that the time limit rule\n\ngoverning arbitrations under the rules of the National Association\n\nof Securities Dealers was the kind of dispute that did not present\n\na question of arbitrability and was therefore presumptively for the\n\narbitrator.      537 U.S. at 85.    The Court explained that under its\n\n\n\n     1\n     KKW Enterprises involved an appeal from orders staying\narbitration. It did not involve a question of interpretation of a\nforum selection clause or of the respective powers of the\narbitrator and the court.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fprecedents, “a gateway dispute about whether the parties are bound\n\nby a given arbitration clause raises a question of arbitrability\n\nfor a court to decide.”   Id. at 84.        On the other hand, “the phrase\n\n‘question   of   arbitrability’      [is]    not   applicable    .    .   .   [to]\n\n‘procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its\n\nfinal disposition’ [and which] are presumptively not for the judge,\n\nbut for an arbitrator, to decide.”          Id. (citing John Wiley & Sons,\n\nInc. v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543, 557 (1964)). The dispute between\n\nthe parties in this case over the location of the arbitration\n\nraises not a question of arbitrability but a procedural question\n\nand is therefore for the arbitrator, not the court.\n\n            In Green Tree, a plurality held that the question whether\n\nthe   parties’   arbitration   agreement      forbade    the    use   of      class\n\narbitration was for an arbitrator, not a court.            539 U.S. at 447.\n\nIt reasoned that because the dispute fell within the terms of the\n\narbitration   agreement   as   one    “relating     to   this   [arbitration]\n\ncontract . . . the parties seem to have agreed that an arbitrator,\n\nnot a judge, would [decide it].”           Id. at 445.   Similarly, in this\n\ncase the arbitration agreement states that\n\n            [i]n the event of any disagreement between us\n            in connection with this Agreement, we will\n            meet in good faith to attempt to resolve the\n            disagreement. If we are unable to resolve the\n            disagreement . . . the disagreement will be\n            submitted to arbitration. (Emphasis added.)\n\nUnder the reasoning of Green Tree, the disagreement over the\n\ninterpretation of the so-called forum selection clause is one “in\n\nconnection with this Agreement” and hence one the parties agreed to\n\n                                     -7-\n\fsubmit to arbitration.    As the Court put it, “if there is any doubt\n\nabout the matter—about “the ‘scope of arbitrable issues’—we should\n\nresolve that doubt in favor of arbitration.” 539 U.S. at 445\n\n(quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,\n\n473 U.S. 614, 626 (1985)).\n\n           In Shaw’s Supermarkets, this court considered Howsam in\n\nthe context of a dispute over the consolidation for arbitration of\n\nthree grievances filed under a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThe court said:\n\n                The issue before us is who should make\n           the determination as to whether to consolidate\n           the   three    grievances   into    a   single\n           arbitration: the arbitrator or a federal\n           court. Since each of the three grievances is\n           itself concededly arbitrable, we think the\n           answer is clear. Under Howsam, this is a\n           procedural matter for the arbitrator.\n\n321 F.3d at 254 (citations omitted).      So here.    Since the dispute\n\nbetween the parties is concededly arbitrable, determining the place\n\nof the arbitration is simply a procedural matter and hence for the\n\narbitrator.\n\n           We conclude that the District Court lacked power to\n\ninterpret the forum selection clause and that the judgment must\n\ntherefore be vacated.      We should stress that the present case\n\nconcerns only the question whether, after the matter was properly\n\nrefiled with the Boston Office of the AAA, the AAA could then\n\ntransfer the matter to California.        It is this subsidiary issue\n\nwhich we regard as a matter for the arbitrator.            Whether the\n\nDistrict   Court   had   authority   to   intervene   to   address   the\n\n                                 -8-\n\fLeventhals' original filing in California is a different issue\n\nwhich has been mooted by the refiling and which we reserve for\n\nconsideration in a case where it matters.       The arbitration can\n\nproceed forthwith, and Young can present its arguments concerning\n\nthe forum selection clause to the arbitrator.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons stated, we VACATE the judgment of the\n\nDistrict Court and REMAND with directions to DISMISS the action.\n\n     VACATED AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

Young &amp; Co., Ltd., brought this action against Dr. Morris Leventhal and Judith Leventhal for a declaration that the parties' investment and trust management agreements required arbitration under them to be held in Boston. Young also sought an injunction against the arbitration initiated by the Leventhals against Young in California. The District Court enjoined the California arbitration but declined the requested declaration and, instead, ordered the Leventhals to submit the dispute to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in Boston. Young appeals the District Court's judgment.</p>\n      <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young is a Rhode Island corporation registered as an investment advisor with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission with its principal office in Newport, Rhode Island. Dr. Morris Leventhal and his wife, Judith Leventhal, are clients of Young residing in Ventura, California. Both Leventhals serve as trustees of the Leventhal Family Revocable Trust.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Leventhal has employed Young's services for over ten years. In March of 2002, he executed an investment management agreement with Young. In May of 2002, the Leventhals executed a trust management agreement. Both agreements contained the following arbitration clause:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arbitration. In the event of any disagreement between us in connection with this Agreement we will meet in good faith to attempt to resolve such disagreement. <i>If we are unable to resolve the disagreement</i> within 30 days after receipt of written notice by either party from the other that such a disagreement exists, <i>the disagreement will be submitted for arbitration to the American Arbitration Association in Boston, Massachusetts,</i> in accordance with the Rules of Commercial Arbitration of the Association. There is no obligation to arbitrate changes in or additions to the terms of this Agreement, and no arbitrator will have the power to add to or subtract from the terms of this Agreement. Each of us will bear his own costs. Judgment may be entered in any court within the State of Rhode Island. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point after executing the agreements, Dr. Leventhal took exception to Young's handling of his trust management account. He wrote a notice of claim letter to Young in an attempt to resolve his dispute in accordance with the arbitration clause, followed by a second letter. On February 3, 2003, he instituted an arbitration proceeding against Young with the AAA in California.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon receipt of notice of the arbitration claim, Young objected to the arbitration being held in California. AAA in California requested and received submissions regarding determination of the locale and concluded that the arbitration should go forward in California. Because of the pendency of this action, commencement of the arbitration was deferred.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young then brought this action in the District Court, contending that the language of the arbitration clause emphasized above was a forum selection clause requiring any arbitration to be held in Boston. The District Court rejected this interpretation, holding that the clause did not require the Leventhals to arbitrate in Boston, but did require them to submit the request for arbitration to the Boston office of the AAA.

The AAA requested the parties to provide information and their reasons with respect to the location of the arbitration and then determined that the arbitration should be heard in California.</p>\n      <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Leventhals challenge the court's subject matter jurisdiction. Young invoked diversity jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a). The Leventhals dispute that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, arguing that the statute prohibits including interest and costs in the calculation. The District Court rejected the argument. It found the amount in controversy in the arbitration to be $59,703.56, plus interest. In addition, the court included the costs that Young would incur as a result of arbitrating in California, i.e., the incremental costs it would incur if relief were denied in this action, amounting to $30,000. Courts have repeatedly held that the value of the matter in controversy is measured not by the monetary judgment which the plaintiff may recover but by the judgment's pecuniary consequences to those involved in the litigation. <i>Duderwicz v. Sweetwater Savings Assoc.,</i> 595 F.2d 1008, 1014 (5th Cir.1979); <i>Beacon Constr. Co. v. Matco Elec. Co.,</i> 521 F.2d 392, 399 (2d Cir.1975); <i>Mass. State Pharmaceutical Ass'n v. Fed. Prescription Serv.,</i> 431 F.2d 130, 132 (8th Cir.1970). Here, the object of the litigation was to avoid the additional costs Young would incur if the arbitration were held in California instead of Boston. Those costs are properly included in the calculation of the amount in controversy. <i>See Hunt v. Wash. Apple Adver.

Sutherland and Brickley, Sears &amp; Sorett, P.A. were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, LYNCH, Circuit Judge, and SCHWARZER,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> Senior District Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Richard C. Young &amp; Co., Ltd., brought this action against Dr. Morris Leventhal and Judith Leventhal for a declaration that the parties' investment and trust management agreements required arbitration under them to be held in Boston. Young also sought an injunction against the arbitration initiated by the Leventhals against Young in California. The District Court enjoined the California arbitration but declined the requested declaration and, instead, ordered the Leventhals to submit the dispute to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in Boston. Young appeals the District Court's judgment.</p>\n      <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young is a Rhode Island corporation registered as an investment advisor with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission with its principal office in Newport, Rhode Island. Dr. Morris Leventhal and his wife, Judith Leventhal, are clients of Young residing in Ventura, California. Both Leventhals serve as trustees of the Leventhal Family Revocable Trust.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Leventhal has employed Young's services for over ten years. In March of 2002, he executed an investment management agreement with Young. In May of 2002, the Leventhals executed a trust management agreement. Both agreements contained the following arbitration clause:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arbitration. In the event of any disagreement between us in connection with this Agreement we will meet in good faith to attempt to resolve such disagreement. <i>If we are unable to resolve the disagreement</i> within 30 days after receipt of written notice by either party from the other that such a disagreement exists, <i>the disagreement will be submitted for arbitration to the American Arbitration Association in Boston, Massachusetts,</i> in accordance with the Rules of Commercial Arbitration of the Association. There is no obligation to arbitrate changes in or additions to the terms of this Agreement, and no arbitrator will have the power to add to or subtract from the terms of this Agreement. Each of us will bear his own costs. Judgment may be entered in any court within the State of Rhode Island. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point after executing the agreements, Dr. Leventhal took exception to Young's handling of his trust management account. He wrote a notice of claim letter to Young in an attempt to resolve his dispute in accordance with the arbitration clause, followed by a second letter. On February 3, 2003, he instituted an arbitration proceeding against Young with the AAA in California.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon receipt of notice of the arbitration claim, Young objected to the arbitration being held in California. AAA in California requested and received submissions regarding determination of the locale and concluded that the arbitration should go forward in California. Because of the pendency of this action, commencement of the arbitration was deferred.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young then brought this action in the District Court, contending that the language of the arbitration clause emphasized above was a forum selection clause requiring any arbitration to be held in Boston. The District Court rejected this interpretation, holding that the clause did not require the Leventhals to arbitrate in Boston, but did require them to submit the request for arbitration to the Boston office of the AAA. It enjoined further proceedings in California and compelled the Leventhals to submit the arbitration request to the AAA in Boston. Young then appealed to this court.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument counsel advised the court that while the appeal had been pending the Leventhals submitted their dispute to the AAA in Boston as required by the agreement. The AAA requested the parties to provide information and their reasons with respect to the location of the arbitration and then determined that the arbitration should be heard in California.</p>\n      <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Leventhals challenge the court's subject matter jurisdiction. Young invoked diversity jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a). The Leventhals dispute that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, arguing that the statute prohibits including interest and costs in the calculation. The District Court rejected the argument. It found the amount in controversy in the arbitration to be $59,703.56, plus interest. In addition, the court included the costs that Young would incur as a result of arbitrating in California, i.e., the incremental costs it would incur if relief were denied in this action, amounting to $30,000. Courts have repeatedly held that the value of the matter in controversy is measured not by the monetary judgment which the plaintiff may recover but by the judgment's pecuniary consequences to those involved in the litigation. <i>Duderwicz v.

Here, the object of the litigation was to avoid the additional costs Young would incur if the arbitration were held in California instead of Boston. Those costs are properly included in the calculation of the amount in controversy. <i>See Hunt v. Wash. Apple Adver. Com'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 347, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We conclude that the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. THE MERITS</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this appeal presents a question of law, appellate review is plenary. <i>Shaw's Supermarkets v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 791,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200370\"><a href=\"/opinion/200370/shaws-supermarkets-v-united-food/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span>, 253 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central issue raised by Young's appeal is whether the language of the arbitration clause emphasized above is a forum selection clause, requiring the arbitration to be held in Boston. The District Court rejected Young's contention, interpreting the clause as merely requiring the Leventhals to submit their dispute to the AAA in Boston. The court reasoned that the clause was ambiguous and that the agreement, as a contract of adhesion, should be construed against Young.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold the court addressed the question of its power to interpret the forum selection clause. The court acknowledged that the recent Supreme Court decisions in <i>Howsam v.
