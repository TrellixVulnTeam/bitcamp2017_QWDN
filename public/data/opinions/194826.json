Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\n\n          Appellant  Jose A. Rivera Marcano (\"Rivera\") is the\n\nsole  owner   and  operator   of  J.A.R.  Enterprises,   Inc.\n\n(\"J.A.R.\"), a brokerage and distribution firm in Puerto Rico.\n\nBeginning in 1983, J.A.R.  served as the exclusive broker  in\n\nPuerto  Rico  of the  luncheon meat  and other  food products\n\nmanufactured  by  appellee  Normeat  Royal  Dane Quality  A/S\n\n(\"Normeat\"),  a  corporation  with  its  principal  place  of\n\nbusiness in Denmark.    Normeat normally  shipped merchandise\n\nto J.A.R. on a credit basis.  J.A.R. would then transport the\n\nmerchandise  to  customers  in  Puerto  Rico  and  bill  them\n\ndirectly.  After customers paid J.A.R.    usually by means of\n\nchecks  made payable to  either Normeat  or J.A.R.     J.A.R.\n\nwould  deposit the  money  in its  bank  account, keep  three\n\npercent of  the amount as  a sales commission, and  remit the\n\nbalance  to Normeat.    Ordinarily,  J.A.R.  had  an  account\n\npayable to Normeat with an outstanding balance of hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars.  \n\n          Sometime in 1987, Normeat's new management informed\n\nRivera that it would no longer extend credit for shipments to\n\nJ.A.R. and demanded immediate payment of J.A.R.'s outstanding\n\naccount balance of approximately $500,000.  Rivera  protested\n\n                             -2-\r\n\nthe   change,  informing   Normeat   that   the  new   policy\n\ncontradicted  long-standing  practice and  created  financial\n\ndifficulties for  J.A.R.   Negotiations  between the  parties\n\nfailed to resolve the dispute, and Normeat notified Rivera in\n\nOctober  1987 that  it would  cease  shipping merchandise  to\n\nJ.A.R.  and would  proceed to  collect all  sums  due through\n\nappropriate legal channels.\n\n          Two  years  later,  in June  1989,  Ken  Rasmussen,\n\ndeputy managing director  of Normeat, gave a  sworn statement\n\nto  a  state prosecutor  in  the  Puerto  Rico Department  of\n\nJustice  regarding Rivera's failure, as owner and operator of\n\nJ.A.R., to turn over one or more customer payments  allegedly\n\nbelonging to Normeat.  The  record contains neither a copy of\n\nRasmussen's sworn  statement nor  anything else  showing what\n\nRasmussen told the  prosecutors.  The Puerto  Rico Department\n\nof  Justice  conducted an  investigation of  the accusations,\n\nalthough the  extent of the  investigation is not  clear from\n\nthe record. \n\n          In September 1989, a Department of Justice attorney\n\nfiled criminal charges  against Rivera in the  Superior Court\n\nof  Puerto Rico, alleging  six separate counts  of aggravated\n\nunlawful appropriation    in violation  of Article 166 of the\n\nPuerto  Rico Penal  Code,  33  L.P.R.A.    42721     and  two\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  33 L.P.R.A.   4272 provides, in relevant part:\n\n                             -3-\r\n\ncounts of  forgery of  documents    in  violation of  Article\n\n271,  33 L.P.R.A.     45912     all  felonies.   The  charges\n\naccused Rivera, in essence, of depositing in the J.A.R.  bank\n\naccount  six checks  written  by  customers  as  payment  for\n\nNormeat  merchandise and not transferring the payments, minus\n\n                    \r                                \n\n               Any  person  committing  the offense\n          described in  section 4271 of  this title\n          [Unlawful    Appropriation]    shall   be\n          punished by imprisonment for a fixed term\n          of ten (10) years, whenever the following\n          circumstances exist:\n               . . .\n               (b)  Unlawfully   appropriating  the\n          property of another valued at two hundred\n          dollars or more; . . . .\n\n     33  L.P.R.A.     4271,  referred  to  in  section  4272,\nprovides:\n\n               Any     person     who    unlawfully\n          appropriates,    without   violence    or\n          intimidation, personal property belonging\n          to another person,  shall be punished  by\n          imprisonment for a term not exceeding six\n          months, a fine not exceeding five hundred\n          dollars, the  penalty of  restitution, or\n          any   combination    thereof,   in    the\n          discretion of the court.\n\n2.  33 L.P.R.A.   4591 provides in relevant part:\n\n               Any person  who, with the  intent to\n          defraud  another,  falsely draws  up,  in\n          whole or in part,  a document, instrument\n          or   writ   through  which   any   right,\n          obligation   or   interest   is  created,\n          transferred,   terminated   or  otherwise\n          affected,   or   who    falsely   alters,\n          counterfeits,  suppresses  or  destroys a\n          genuine one in whole or in part, shall be\n          punished by imprisonment for a fixed term\n          of nine (9) years. . . .\n\n                             -4-\r\n\nJ.A.R.'s sales  commission, to  Normeat.3   A Superior  Court\n\njudge found  probable cause  to issue  an arrest  warrant for\n\nRivera on all  eight charges, and referred the  case to three\n\ndifferent courts for preliminary hearings because the alleged\n\ncrimes  took place in  three different jurisdictions.   Three\n\nmagistrates  separately  considered  the  charges  and  found\n\nprobable  cause to  proceed  to  trial on  six  of the  eight\n\ncharges.  One aggravated unlawful appropriation count and one\n\nforgery count, both relating to a November 12, 1986 check for\n\n$59,274.12 from a company called Mister Price, were dismissed\n\nfor lack of probable cause.4\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  The six counts of aggravated  unlawful appropriation were\nbased on the following transactions:  \n\n     1)  a November 12, 1986 check for $59,274.12 from Mister\nPrice, Division  of Belca Equipment  Corporation, payable  to\nNormeat; \n     2) a November 22, 1986 check for  $60,557.41 from Pueblo\nInternational, Inc. payable to J.A.R.;\n     3) a  December 29, 1986 check for $61,337.16 from Mister\nPrice payable to Normeat;\n     4) a February  10, 1987 check  for $30,645.15 from  Alba\nImports Corporation payable to J.A.R.;\n     5) a  March  24, 1987  check  for $58,674.96  from  Alba\nImports payable to J.A.R.; and, \n     6)  an April  22, 1987  check for  $30,646.67 from  Alba\nImports payable to J.A.R.\n\nThe two counts of forgery  were based on the two  checks made\npayable to Normeat.\n\n4.  In the district  court, appellants submitted copies  of a\ncancelled  check purporting to  show that J.A.R.  did in fact\npay Normeat $57,495.90  for the Mister  Price shipment a  few\nmonths  after  receiving  the  $59,274.12  check from  Mister\nPrice.\n\n                             -5-\r\n\n          The remaining counts were consolidated for trial at\n\nthe  San Juan Superior Court.  After  one day of testimony on\n\nFebruary  21, 1990, the  main prosecution witness, Rasmussen,\n\nleft  Puerto  Rico for  Denmark  and  never returned  to  the\n\nisland.   The prosecutor moved for  dismissal of the criminal\n\ncharges,  and the court  granted dismissal with  prejudice on\n\nFebruary  26,  1990.    The   dismissal  is  now  final   and\n\nunappealable.\n\n          Rivera,  along  with his  wife  and  their conjugal\n\npartnership, brought this diversity action against Normeat on\n\nNovember 26,  1990, in the  United States District  Court for\n\nthe  District of  Puerto Rico,  seeking  damages pursuant  to\n\nPuerto Rico tort law for the alleged malicious prosecution of\n\nRivera by Normeat.   Normeat moved to dismiss  for failure to\n\nstate a claim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Because it had\r                               \n\nnumerous exhibits before  it from both parties,  the district\n\ncourt  treated Normeat's motion  as one for  summary judgment\n\nand granted  it on April 21, 1992.   See Fed. R.  Civ. P. 56.\r                                                    \n\nAppellants now appeal from that final judgment.5\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\n\n          We review summary judgment  grants de novo, reading\r                                                                \n\nthe  record in  the  light most  favorable  to the  nonmoving\n\nparty.

The district court had diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C.   1332(a)(2).

To demonstrate the existence  of a genuine\n\nissue  of material fact,  plaintiffs must point  to concrete,\n\nadmissible  evidence.  Id.   Mere allegations,  or conjecture\r                                      \n\nunsupported in the record, are insufficient.

The four essential elements of the tort are: (1) the\n\ncriminal   action  was  initiated   and  instigated   by  the\n\ndefendant; (2) the criminal action terminated in favor of the\n\nplaintiffs; (3)  the  defendant  initiated  the  action  with\n\nmalice and without probable cause;  and (4) as a consequence,\n\nthe  plaintiffs suffered damages.

The third element\r                                 \n\nmay  also be  described  as  two  separate  elements  because\n\nplaintiffs  must  show  both that  the  defendant  acted with\r                                        \n\nmalice and that he acted  without probable cause.

Probable cause does not  depend on the actual guilt or\n\ninnocence  of  the   accused,  but  simply  on   whether  the\n\ncircumstances  are \"sufficient  to produce  in the mind  of a\n\nreasonable  person  the belief  that the  charge he  makes is\n\ntrue.\"  Par s, 19 P.R.R. at 331.\r                         \n\n          In  respect  to  five  of  the  six   transactions,\n\nappellants pointed to  no evidence tending to  establish that\n\nNormeat   lacked   probable   cause  to   accuse   Rivera  of\n\nmisappropriating  and forging the alleged checks.  The record\n\nindicates  that  Rivera  received   those  five  checks  from\n\ncustomers and deposited them in the J.A.R.  bank account, but\n\nnothing shows that he  forwarded the paid amounts, minus  his\n\ncommission, to Normeat.   In addition, the record  shows that\n\nthe Department of  Justice attorney, after  an investigation,\n\nfound probable cause  sufficient to file the  charges against\n\nRivera, and a  Superior Court judge  found probable cause  on\n\nall eight charges  sufficient to issue an  arrest warrant for\n\nRivera.  Three different magistrates, in separate preliminary\n\nhearings, found that  evidence on the counts related to these\n\nfive transactions was sufficient to  send the case to  trial.\n\n                             -8-\r\n\nBecause  appellants  failed  to  produce  any  evidence  that\n\nNormeat  lacked probable cause  to prosecute Rivera  based on\n\nthose five checks, appellants would not be able to maintain a\n\nclaim for malicious prosecution based on those charges.\n\n          Appellants  instead   focus  on  the   two  charges\n\ndismissed after  a preliminary  hearing before a  magistrate,\n\nboth of  which were  related to the  November 12,  1986 check\n\nfrom the  Mister Price company  in the amount  of $59,274.12.\n\nAppellants argue that Normeat lacked probable cause to accuse\n\nRivera of misappropriating and forging this particular check.\n\nThe  record contains  a  cancelled check  purportedly showing\n\nthat  on February 13,  1987, J.A.R. paid  Normeat $57,495.90,\n\nthe balance due for the shipment of goods to the Mister Price\n\ncompany, and  a sworn  statement from  Rivera asserting  that\n\nJ.A.R. paid Normeat for the Mister Price shipment.  \n\n          Whether and in  what circumstances a plaintiff  may\n\nmaintain   a  malicious  prosecution   action  based  on  one\n\ngroundless accusation, when probable cause existed for one or\n\nmore  other  accusations made  concurrently,  has never  been\n\naddressed  by  the  Puerto  Rico Supreme  Court.    In  other\n\njurisdictions,  courts have  permitted  such  actions if  the\n\ncharges  stem from  different sets  of facts  and if  all the\n\nother  elements  of   a  malicious   prosecution  claim   are\n\nfulfilled.

As  discussed above, under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw a malicious prosecution plaintiff must show that:\n\n          [the] defendant was actively instrumental\n          in  the  initiation  of  the  prosecution\n          through some affirmative action by way of\n          advice,   petition,    encouragement   or\n          pressure.   To furnish  information to  a\n          prosecuting attorney  does not  by itself\n          constitute    an    instigation,    since\n          generally  in those  cases the  efficient\n          cause   of   the    initiation   of   the\n          prosecution has  been the  initiative and\n          decision of the  prosecuting attorney, in\n          the  exercise  of his  discretion,  after\n          having  carried  out   the  corresponding\n          investigation.\n\nJim nez v.

Where  the decision to\r                              \n\nfile charges is within  the discretion of the prosecutor,  it\n\nis  not  sufficient for  plaintiffs merely  to show  that the\n\ndefendant  gave  incomplete  information to  the  prosecutor.\n\nPlaintiffs must show  that the incomplete  information caused\n\nor  \"compelled\" the  government authorities  to  file charges\n\nagainst the plaintiff.

Unless the defendant is shown to have knowingly provided\n\nfalse  information to the  officials, \"[t]he exercise  of the\n\nofficer's discretion makes the initiation of  the prosecution\n\nhis   own  and  protects  from  liability  the  person  whose\n\ninformation or accusation has led the officer to initiate the\n\nproceedings.\"  Id.  at 819 (quoting 3 Restatement  (First) of\r                                                                         \n\nTorts   653(2), cmt.).\r                 \n\n                             -11-\r\n\n          The record  contains no evidence that  Rasmussen or\n\nother Normeat  officials specifically instigated  the charges\n\nbased on the November 12, 1986 check, nor  that they were the\n\nsource  of incomplete  or  false  information  to  the  state\n\nofficials  on that  item.   The  record  indicates only  that\n\nRasmussen gave a sworn statement to the prosecuting attorneys\n\nregarding  the failure  of J.A.R.  to turn  over one  or more\n\npayments due to  Normeat, a perfectly true  statement insofar\n\nas anything in the record shows.  No actual copy of the sworn\n\nstatement  appears in the  record, nor is  there an affidavit\n\nfrom  Rasmussen  or  a  prosecutor  indicating  exactly  what\n\nRasmussen  told the prosecutors.  Appellants concede that the\n\nprosecutors conducted  an investigation of  J.A.R.'s dealings\n\nwith  Normeat and that a Department  of Justice attorney, not\n\nRasmussen,  filed the formal charges in court against Rivera.\n\nIt  is  conceivable  that  the  two  charges related  to  the\n\nNovember 12, 1986 check resulted from oversights or errors by\n\npersonnel within the  Department of Justice rather  than from\n\nspecific   accusations  relative   to  that  check   made  by\n\nRasmussen.  Appellants bear the  burden of proof on the issue\n\nbut  have put  forward  no  concrete  evidence to  show  that\n\nRasmussen gave  inaccurate or  incomplete information  to the\n\nauthorities about  this check nor  that he coerced  them into\n\nfiling the charges in question against Rivera.  Consequently,\n\neven if appellants raised a  genuine issue regarding lack  of\n\n                             -12-\r\n\nprobable cause for the charges based on the November 12, 1986\n\ncheck,  appellants failed  to  raise  a  genuine  issue  over\n\nwhether  Normeat initiated or  instigated those  two charges.\n\nAppellants would be  unable at trial to meet  their burden of\n\nproof  on an essential element of their malicious prosecution\n\nclaim.7\n\n          Affirmed.

Rivera Marcano (\"Rivera\") is the\n\nsole  owner   and  operator   of  J.A.R.  Enterprises,   Inc.\n\n(\"J.A.R.\"), a brokerage and distribution firm in Puerto Rico.\n\nBeginning in 1983, J.A.R.  served as the exclusive broker  in\n\nPuerto  Rico  of the  luncheon meat  and other  food products\n\nmanufactured  by  appellee  Normeat  Royal  Dane Quality  A/S\n\n(\"Normeat\"),  a  corporation  with  its  principal  place  of\n\nbusiness in Denmark.    Normeat normally  shipped merchandise\n\nto J.A.R. on a credit basis.  J.A.R. would then transport the\n\nmerchandise  to  customers  in  Puerto  Rico  and  bill  them\n\ndirectly.  After customers paid J.A.R.    usually by means of\n\nchecks  made payable to  either Normeat  or J.A.R.     J.A.R.\n\nwould  deposit the  money  in its  bank  account, keep  three\n\npercent of  the amount as  a sales commission, and  remit the\n\nbalance  to Normeat.    Ordinarily,  J.A.R.  had  an  account\n\npayable to Normeat with an outstanding balance of hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars.  \n\n          Sometime in 1987, Normeat's new management informed\n\nRivera that it would no longer extend credit for shipments to\n\nJ.A.R. and demanded immediate payment of J.A.R.'s outstanding\n\naccount balance of approximately $500,000.  Rivera  protested\n\n                             -2-\r\n\nthe   change,  informing   Normeat   that   the  new   policy\n\ncontradicted  long-standing  practice and  created  financial\n\ndifficulties for  J.A.R.   Negotiations  between the  parties\n\nfailed to resolve the dispute, and Normeat notified Rivera in\n\nOctober  1987 that  it would  cease  shipping merchandise  to\n\nJ.A.R.  and would  proceed to  collect all  sums  due through\n\nappropriate legal channels.\n\n          Two  years  later,  in June  1989,  Ken  Rasmussen,\n\ndeputy managing director  of Normeat, gave a  sworn statement\n\nto  a  state prosecutor  in  the  Puerto  Rico Department  of\n\nJustice  regarding Rivera's failure, as owner and operator of\n\nJ.A.R., to turn over one or more customer payments  allegedly\n\nbelonging to Normeat.  The  record contains neither a copy of\n\nRasmussen's sworn  statement nor  anything else  showing what\n\nRasmussen told the  prosecutors.  The Puerto  Rico Department\n\nof  Justice  conducted an  investigation of  the accusations,\n\nalthough the  extent of the  investigation is not  clear from\n\nthe record. \n\n          In September 1989, a Department of Justice attorney\n\nfiled criminal charges  against Rivera in the  Superior Court\n\nof  Puerto Rico, alleging  six separate counts  of aggravated\n\nunlawful appropriation    in violation  of Article 166 of the\n\nPuerto  Rico Penal  Code,  33  L.P.R.A.    42721     and  two\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.  33 L.P.R.A.   4272 provides, in relevant part:\n\n                             -3-\r\n\ncounts of  forgery of  documents    in  violation of  Article\n\n271,  33 L.P.R.A.     45912     all  felonies.

Three\n\nmagistrates  separately  considered  the  charges  and  found\n\nprobable  cause to  proceed  to  trial on  six  of the  eight\n\ncharges.  One aggravated unlawful appropriation count and one\n\nforgery count, both relating to a November 12, 1986 check for\n\n$59,274.12 from a company called Mister Price, were dismissed\n\nfor lack of probable cause.4\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  The six counts of aggravated  unlawful appropriation were\nbased on the following transactions:  \n\n     1)  a November 12, 1986 check for $59,274.12 from Mister\nPrice, Division  of Belca Equipment  Corporation, payable  to\nNormeat; \n     2) a November 22, 1986 check for  $60,557.41 from Pueblo\nInternational, Inc. payable to J.A.R.;\n     3) a  December 29, 1986 check for $61,337.16 from Mister\nPrice payable to Normeat;\n     4) a February  10, 1987 check  for $30,645.15 from  Alba\nImports Corporation payable to J.A.R.;\n     5) a  March  24, 1987  check  for $58,674.96  from  Alba\nImports payable to J.A.R.; and, \n     6)  an April  22, 1987  check for  $30,646.67 from  Alba\nImports payable to J.A.R.\n\nThe two counts of forgery  were based on the two  checks made\npayable to Normeat.\n\n4.  In the district  court, appellants submitted copies  of a\ncancelled  check purporting to  show that J.A.R.  did in fact\npay Normeat $57,495.90  for the Mister  Price shipment a  few\nmonths  after  receiving  the  $59,274.12  check from  Mister\nPrice.\n\n                             -5-\r\n\n          The remaining counts were consolidated for trial at\n\nthe  San Juan Superior Court.  After  one day of testimony on\n\nFebruary  21, 1990, the  main prosecution witness, Rasmussen,\n\nleft  Puerto  Rico for  Denmark  and  never returned  to  the\n\nisland.   The prosecutor moved for  dismissal of the criminal\n\ncharges,  and the court  granted dismissal with  prejudice on\n\nFebruary  26,  1990.    The   dismissal  is  now  final   and\n\nunappealable.\n\n          Rivera,  along  with his  wife  and  their conjugal\n\npartnership, brought this diversity action against Normeat on\n\nNovember 26,  1990, in the  United States District  Court for\n\nthe  District of  Puerto Rico,  seeking  damages pursuant  to\n\nPuerto Rico tort law for the alleged malicious prosecution of\n\nRivera by Normeat.   Normeat moved to dismiss  for failure to\n\nstate a claim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Because it had\r                               \n\nnumerous exhibits before  it from both parties,  the district\n\ncourt  treated Normeat's motion  as one for  summary judgment\n\nand granted  it on April 21, 1992.   See Fed. R.  Civ.

Probable cause does not  depend on the actual guilt or\n\ninnocence  of  the   accused,  but  simply  on   whether  the\n\ncircumstances  are \"sufficient  to produce  in the mind  of a\n\nreasonable  person  the belief  that the  charge he  makes is\n\ntrue.\"  Par s, 19 P.R.R. at 331.\r                         \n\n          In  respect  to  five  of  the  six   transactions,\n\nappellants pointed to  no evidence tending to  establish that\n\nNormeat   lacked   probable   cause  to   accuse   Rivera  of\n\nmisappropriating  and forging the alleged checks.  The record\n\nindicates  that  Rivera  received   those  five  checks  from\n\ncustomers and deposited them in the J.A.R.  bank account, but\n\nnothing shows that he  forwarded the paid amounts, minus  his\n\ncommission, to Normeat.   In addition, the record  shows that\n\nthe Department of  Justice attorney, after  an investigation,\n\nfound probable cause  sufficient to file the  charges against\n\nRivera, and a  Superior Court judge  found probable cause  on\n\nall eight charges  sufficient to issue an  arrest warrant for\n\nRivera.  Three different magistrates, in separate preliminary\n\nhearings, found that  evidence on the counts related to these\n\nfive transactions was sufficient to  send the case to  trial.\n\n                             -8-\r\n\nBecause  appellants  failed  to  produce  any  evidence  that\n\nNormeat  lacked probable cause  to prosecute Rivera  based on\n\nthose five checks, appellants would not be able to maintain a\n\nclaim for malicious prosecution based on those charges.\n\n          Appellants  instead   focus  on  the   two  charges\n\ndismissed after  a preliminary  hearing before a  magistrate,\n\nboth of  which were  related to the  November 12,  1986 check\n\nfrom the  Mister Price company  in the amount  of $59,274.12.\n\nAppellants argue that Normeat lacked probable cause to accuse\n\nRivera of misappropriating and forging this particular check.\n\nThe  record contains  a  cancelled check  purportedly showing\n\nthat  on February 13,  1987, J.A.R. paid  Normeat $57,495.90,\n\nthe balance due for the shipment of goods to the Mister Price\n\ncompany, and  a sworn  statement from  Rivera asserting  that\n\nJ.A.R. paid Normeat for the Mister Price shipment.  \n\n          Whether and in  what circumstances a plaintiff  may\n\nmaintain   a  malicious  prosecution   action  based  on  one\n\ngroundless accusation, when probable cause existed for one or\n\nmore  other  accusations made  concurrently,  has never  been\n\naddressed  by  the  Puerto  Rico Supreme  Court.    In  other\n\njurisdictions,  courts have  permitted  such  actions if  the\n\ncharges  stem from  different sets  of facts  and if  all the\n\nother  elements  of   a  malicious   prosecution  claim   are\n\nfulfilled.

As  discussed above, under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw a malicious prosecution plaintiff must show that:\n\n          [the] defendant was actively instrumental\n          in  the  initiation  of  the  prosecution\n          through some affirmative action by way of\n          advice,   petition,    encouragement   or\n          pressure.   To furnish  information to  a\n          prosecuting attorney  does not  by itself\n          constitute    an    instigation,    since\n          generally  in those  cases the  efficient\n          cause   of   the    initiation   of   the\n          prosecution has  been the  initiative and\n          decision of the  prosecuting attorney, in\n          the  exercise  of his  discretion,  after\n          having  carried  out   the  corresponding\n          investigation.\n\nJim nez v.

Where  the decision to\r                              \n\nfile charges is within  the discretion of the prosecutor,  it\n\nis  not  sufficient for  plaintiffs merely  to show  that the\n\ndefendant  gave  incomplete  information to  the  prosecutor.\n\nPlaintiffs must show  that the incomplete  information caused\n\nor  \"compelled\" the  government authorities  to  file charges\n\nagainst the plaintiff.

Unless the defendant is shown to have knowingly provided\n\nfalse  information to the  officials, \"[t]he exercise  of the\n\nofficer's discretion makes the initiation of  the prosecution\n\nhis   own  and  protects  from  liability  the  person  whose\n\ninformation or accusation has led the officer to initiate the\n\nproceedings.\"  Id.  at 819 (quoting 3 Restatement  (First) of\r                                                                         \n\nTorts   653(2), cmt.).\r                 \n\n                             -11-\r\n\n          The record  contains no evidence that  Rasmussen or\n\nother Normeat  officials specifically instigated  the charges\n\nbased on the November 12, 1986 check, nor  that they were the\n\nsource  of incomplete  or  false  information  to  the  state\n\nofficials  on that  item.   The  record  indicates only  that\n\nRasmussen gave a sworn statement to the prosecuting attorneys\n\nregarding  the failure  of J.A.R.  to turn  over one  or more\n\npayments due to  Normeat, a perfectly true  statement insofar\n\nas anything in the record shows.  No actual copy of the sworn\n\nstatement  appears in the  record, nor is  there an affidavit\n\nfrom  Rasmussen  or  a  prosecutor  indicating  exactly  what\n\nRasmussen  told the prosecutors.  Appellants concede that the\n\nprosecutors conducted  an investigation of  J.A.R.'s dealings\n\nwith  Normeat and that a Department  of Justice attorney, not\n\nRasmussen,  filed the formal charges in court against Rivera.\n\nIt  is  conceivable  that  the  two  charges related  to  the\n\nNovember 12, 1986 check resulted from oversights or errors by\n\npersonnel within the  Department of Justice rather  than from\n\nspecific   accusations  relative   to  that  check   made  by\n\nRasmussen.  Appellants bear the  burden of proof on the issue\n\nbut  have put  forward  no  concrete  evidence to  show  that\n\nRasmussen gave  inaccurate or  incomplete information  to the\n\nauthorities about  this check nor  that he coerced  them into\n\nfiling the charges in question against Rivera.
