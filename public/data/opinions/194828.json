Around\n                                   \n\nApril 6, 1992, a  confidential informant received  a tip that  cocaine\n\ncould  be  purchased at  \"Los Companeros,\"  an  auto body  repair shop\n\noperated by  two brothers, Eduardo Gonzalez  Rodriguez (\"Eduardo\") and\n\nLuis Gonzalez (\"Luis\").   The informant went to the  shop, accompanied\n\nby one Harry  Burgos, and  there encountered Jose  Algarin Rosa  (\"Al-\n\ngarin\"), apparently  an employee.   The informant asked  Algarin about\n\nthe possibility of  purchasing a  half kilogram of  cocaine.   Algarin\n\ntold the informant  that in order to purchase  this amount, the infor-\n\nmant would need to talk to Luis.\n\n          As the informant was leaving the  shop, Luis arrived, accom-\n\npanied  by Eduardo.   Algarin  made introductions.   With  Algarin and\n\n                                  3\n\nEduardo present, the informant again asked to purchase a half kilogram\n\nof  cocaine.   Luis consulted with  Eduardo and  offered to  sell one-\n\neighth of a  kilogram of cocaine for $3000; the informant declined the\n\noffer.   Luis then indicated that a  large shipment was due from Vieq-\n\nues, Puerto Rico, and that when the shipment arrived he could sell the\n\ninformant  a full  kilogram  for $16,000.   The  informant tentatively\n\nassented.\n\n          On  April 13, 1992, the  informant met again  with Luis, who\n\nstated that he had received the shipment from Vieques and was ready to\n\ncomplete the kilogram deal.  The informant gave Luis his beeper number\n\nand left, ostensibly to get the purchase money.  Around 3:00 p.m., the\n\ninformant returned to the repair shop, accompanied by Ruben Diaz Padro\n\n(\"Diaz\"),  a federal  undercover agent.   Luis  and Algarin  were both\n\npresent.    Before  the  transaction could  be  consummated,  however,\n\nEduardo entered and warned  Luis that there were police nearby.   Luis\n\nthereupon arranged to  meet the informant on a  nearby road.  Accompa-\n\nnied by  Diaz, the informant drove to the site of the proposed rendez-\n\nvous,  and parked as  instructed.  A few  minutes later, the informant\n\nand Diaz observed Eduardo  drive by in a wine-colored  BMW automobile.\n\nAfter several passes,  Eduardo pulled over and parked in  front of the\n\ninformant's automobile.  Luis  pulled in behind.  Using  hand signals,\n\nLuis  attempted to  lead the informant  to a third  site, with Eduardo\n\nfollowing in his  own car.   Because the  informant was  uncomfortable\n\nwith this change in plans, he declined to follow, and drove away.\n\n                                  4\n\n          Later that  afternoon, Luis  called  the informant's  beeper\n\nnumber and agreed to complete their kilogram transaction at the repair\n\nshop.  Eduardo greeted the informant on arrival and instructed him not\n\nto park in  front of the shop.   As the informant and  Diaz made their\n\nway  into the office, Algarin reassured the informant of Luis's hones-\n\nty:  \"Do not be afraid,  they do not deal with tricks.\"   Eduardo, who\n\nwas leaving the office as the informant met with Luis, advised Luis on\n\nhow to remove the  cocaine from its bag:  \"That is not the way that it\n\nis done.  Don't take it  out like that.\"   Shortly thereafter,  at the\n\ninformant's signal, federal agents  raided the repair shop.   Luis was\n\narrested in  the office.    Algarin attempted  to  run away,  but  was\n\narrested after  a scuffle with DEA  agents at the shop  gate.  Eduardo\n\nwas  arrested on the street nearby.   All were indicted for aiding and\n\nabetting the distribution of cocaine.\n\n          The defendants were joined  for trial, over Eduardo's objec-\n\ntion.  On May 4, 1992, the defense filed an omnibus discovery  motion,\n\nseeking, inter alia, \"all  information which may be used  for impeach-\n                   \n\nment  of government  witnesses.\"   The  government  disclosed that  an\n\nadministrative fine had  been imposed on  the informant for  marijuana\n\npossession  in New York.   The government disclaimed  knowledge of any\n\nother impeachment material relating to the informant.\n\n          Ultimately, Luis entered a  guilty plea; Eduardo and Algarin\n\nwent to trial.   In an effort to discredit  the informant's testimony,\n\nthe defense  called Esteban Garcia  Rosario (\"Garcia\"),  a former  ac-\n\nquaintance of the informant, who testified that the informant had used\n\n                                  5\n\nand dealt drugs in the past.  To rebut Garcia's  testimony, the prose-\n\ncution  recalled the informant.  The informant admitted knowing Garcia\n\nand, later, on cross-examination, admitted  that he had once purchased\n\ndrugs from Garcia \"for  a friend.\"  Both defendants asserted  that the\n\ngovernment  should have  disclosed  this information  prior to  trial,\n\nrelying  on Brady  v. Maryland,  373   U.S. 83  (1963), and  moved for\n                              \n\njudgments of  acquittal under Fed. R.  Crim. P. 29.   The court denied\n\ntheir motion.\n\n          In the course of his redirect examination by the government,\n\nthe  informant was  asked whether  he \"had  any personal  knowledge if\n\n[Garcia] was  acquainted with  Eduardo Gonzalez or  Luis Gonzalez  and\n\nAlgarin.\"  The informant responded in Spanish:  \"as to Algarin I don't\n\nknow,  but I do know that he  [Garcia] bought one eighth [kilogram] of\n\ncocaine from  . . . Eduardo  Gonzalez.\"    Before the answer  could be\n\ntranslated into English, both  defendants moved for mistrial, invoking\n\nthe rule on \"other acts\" evidence.  See Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).  Reserv-\n                                       \n\ning its ruling  on the  mistrial motion, the  district court gave  the\n\ngovernment an opportunity to  show that the informant's statement  was\n\nbased  on  personal knowledge  of  Garcia's prior  drug  sources under\n\nEvidence  Rule 602.  Eventually, the informant was permitted to testi-\n\nfy:  \"I used to visit him [Garcia] at his house and I know that he was\n\nbuying from Luis and Eduardo.\"  A few hours later, as part of its jury\n\ncharge, the court delivered a  curative instruction proposed by defen-\n\ndants:\n\n                                  6\n\n          \"I instruct you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,\n          that the defendants are on trial solely and exclu-\n          sively on  the charge set forth  in the indictment\n          and  nothing else.   So  therefore I  instruct you\n          that  you should  disregard, that  is, get  out of\n          your mind completely, [the  informant's] testimony\n          concerning  [Garcia's]  prior  dealings  with  the\n          defendant.   It has nothing  to do with  this case\n          and it  is irrelevant and you  should not consider\n          it at all for  any purpose whatsoever in  your de-\n          liberation . . . .\"\n\nAlgarin and Eduardo were both convicted.\n\n                                  II\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n                                        \n\n          Appellants'  first contention  is  that  the district  court\n\nerred  in denying their motion  for mistrial based  on the informant's\n\ntestimony that Garcia had purchased \"one eighth [kilogram] of  cocaine\n\nfrom . . .  Eduardo Gonzalez.\"   Assuming, for present  purposes, that\n\nthe informant's  statement was  inadmissible  against appellants,1  we\n\nreview for \"abuse of discretion\" the district court's election to give\n\na cautionary instruction, rather than declare a  mistrial, to counter-\n\nact any prejudicial effect which may have resulted from the challenged\n\ntestimony.  See, e.g., United States v. Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d 664, 672\n                                                   \n\n(1st Cir.  1992); United States v.  Sclamo, 578 F.2d 888,  890-91 (1st\n                                          \n\nCir. 1978).\n\n                    \n\n     1Rule 404(b)  provides that \"[e]vidence of  other crimes, wrongs,\nor acts is not admissible  to prove the character of a person in order\nto show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible\nfor  other purposes,  such  as proof  of motive,  opportunity, intent,\npreparation,  plan,  knowledge, identity,  or  absence  of mistake  or\naccident.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).\n\n                                  7\n\n          There  was  no  abuse of  discretion.    Even assuming,  for\n\npurposes of discussion, that some improper prejudice may have resulted\n\nfrom  the informant's  testimony, the  degree of  any such  prejudice,\n                                             \n\nassessed  from the  vantage point  of a  \"cold appellate  record,\" see\n                                                                      \n\nFreeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988), was\n                            \n\nplainly insufficient  to  warrant second-guessing  the  trial  court's\n\njudgment  that its jury instruction was adequate cure for any possible\n\nunfair  prejudice.  Moreover,  although appellants now  fault the dis-\n\ntrict court's  failure to give a contemporaneous instruction, there is\n\nno indication  in the appellate  record that one  was requested.   See\n                                                                      \n\nUnited States v. Valencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d 506, 513-14 (1st Cir. 1991)\n                                \n\n(review \"limited to plain error\"  where defendant eschewed request for\n\nlimiting instruction  upon trial  court's denial of  mistrial motion).\n\nRather, the court permitted  the defense to draft a  curative instruc-\n\ntion  which  was included  in the  jury charge  delivered a  few hours\n\nlater.  \"We normally presume that a jury will follow an instruction to\n\ndisregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently  presented to it, unless\n\nthere is an 'overwhelming probability' that the jury will be unable to\n\nfollow  the court's instructions.\"  Greer v. Miller, 483 U.S. 756, 766\n                                                   \n\nn.8  (1987) (quoting Richardson v.  Marsh, 481 U.S.  200, 208 (1987)).\n                                         \n\nWhether  or not the brief  interval between the  subject testimony and\n\nthe curative instruction was the  product of a tactical choice  on the\n\npart of the defense, it did not amount to \"plain error.\"\n\n          Appellants contend that the government's failure to disclose\n\nthe informant's prior dealings with Garcia, in response to a discovery\n\n                                  8\n\nrequest from  the defense for \"all  information which may be  used for\n\nimpeachment of government witnesses,\"  constituted a Brady  violation.\n                                                          \n\nOnce  again  we assume,  for  purposes  of discussion,  that  Garcia's\n\ntestimony  relating  to the  informant's  prior  cocaine dealings  was\n\npotentially  exculpatory,  and we  accept the  government's concession\n\nthat it was material, in the sense that its disclosure would \"create a\n\nreasonable  probability . . . that the  result of the proceeding would\n\nbe different.\"  United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (opinion of\n                                       \n\nBlackmun, J.) (1985); United States v.

In order to warrant reversal, however,  a delayed disclo-\n\nsure  of material  evidence  must be  shown  to have  \"prevented  [the\n\ndefense] from  using the  disclosed material effectively  in preparing\n\nand  presenting the defendant's case.\"  United States v. Ingraldi, 793\n                                                                 \n\nF.2d 408,  411-12 (1st  Cir. 1986); United  States v.

In the present case, the defense was well  aware\n\nof  the informant's prior cocaine dealings with Garcia prior to trial.\n\nIndeed, Garcia  was called as a  witness by the defense,  for the very\n                                                       \n\npurpose  of testifying to these  matters.2  Accordingly,  there was no\n\nshowing  that prejudice  resulted from  the  delayed disclosure.

In addition to  Algarin's \"mere presence\"\n\nat the repair shop, the government presented evidence that Algarin (1)\n\nintroduced the informant  to Luis, after  learning that the  informant\n\nsought to purchase a large quantity of cocaine; (2) stood next to Luis\n\nduring negotiations with the  informant on April 6; (3) evinced famil-\n\niarity with Luis's business practices, and sought to offer reassurance\n\nto the informant and undercover agent (\"don't be afraid, they don't do\n\ntricks  here\"), when  the  informant arrived  to  consummate the  drug\n\ndeal; and, finally, (4) ran from the shop, scuffling with  a DEA agent\n\nat the gate, when the raid began.

Ct. 1005 (1993).   Around\n                                   \n\nApril 6, 1992, a  confidential informant received  a tip that  cocaine\n\ncould  be  purchased at  \"Los Companeros,\"  an  auto body  repair shop\n\noperated by  two brothers, Eduardo Gonzalez  Rodriguez (\"Eduardo\") and\n\nLuis Gonzalez (\"Luis\").   The informant went to the  shop, accompanied\n\nby one Harry  Burgos, and  there encountered Jose  Algarin Rosa  (\"Al-\n\ngarin\"), apparently  an employee.   The informant asked  Algarin about\n\nthe possibility of  purchasing a  half kilogram of  cocaine.   Algarin\n\ntold the informant  that in order to purchase  this amount, the infor-\n\nmant would need to talk to Luis.\n\n          As the informant was leaving the  shop, Luis arrived, accom-\n\npanied  by Eduardo.   Algarin  made introductions.   With  Algarin and\n\n                                  3\n\nEduardo present, the informant again asked to purchase a half kilogram\n\nof  cocaine.   Luis consulted with  Eduardo and  offered to  sell one-\n\neighth of a  kilogram of cocaine for $3000; the informant declined the\n\noffer.   Luis then indicated that a  large shipment was due from Vieq-\n\nues, Puerto Rico, and that when the shipment arrived he could sell the\n\ninformant  a full  kilogram  for $16,000.   The  informant tentatively\n\nassented.\n\n          On  April 13, 1992, the  informant met again  with Luis, who\n\nstated that he had received the shipment from Vieques and was ready to\n\ncomplete the kilogram deal.  The informant gave Luis his beeper number\n\nand left, ostensibly to get the purchase money.  Around 3:00 p.m., the\n\ninformant returned to the repair shop, accompanied by Ruben Diaz Padro\n\n(\"Diaz\"),  a federal  undercover agent.   Luis  and Algarin  were both\n\npresent.    Before  the  transaction could  be  consummated,  however,\n\nEduardo entered and warned  Luis that there were police nearby.   Luis\n\nthereupon arranged to  meet the informant on a  nearby road.  Accompa-\n\nnied by  Diaz, the informant drove to the site of the proposed rendez-\n\nvous,  and parked as  instructed.  A few  minutes later, the informant\n\nand Diaz observed Eduardo  drive by in a wine-colored  BMW automobile.\n\nAfter several passes,  Eduardo pulled over and parked in  front of the\n\ninformant's automobile.  Luis  pulled in behind.  Using  hand signals,\n\nLuis  attempted to  lead the informant  to a third  site, with Eduardo\n\nfollowing in his  own car.   Because the  informant was  uncomfortable\n\nwith this change in plans, he declined to follow, and drove away.\n\n                                  4\n\n          Later that  afternoon, Luis  called  the informant's  beeper\n\nnumber and agreed to complete their kilogram transaction at the repair\n\nshop.  Eduardo greeted the informant on arrival and instructed him not\n\nto park in  front of the shop.   As the informant and  Diaz made their\n\nway  into the office, Algarin reassured the informant of Luis's hones-\n\nty:  \"Do not be afraid,  they do not deal with tricks.\"   Eduardo, who\n\nwas leaving the office as the informant met with Luis, advised Luis on\n\nhow to remove the  cocaine from its bag:  \"That is not the way that it\n\nis done.  Don't take it  out like that.\"   Shortly thereafter,  at the\n\ninformant's signal, federal agents  raided the repair shop.   Luis was\n\narrested in  the office.    Algarin attempted  to  run away,  but  was\n\narrested after  a scuffle with DEA  agents at the shop  gate.  Eduardo\n\nwas  arrested on the street nearby.   All were indicted for aiding and\n\nabetting the distribution of cocaine.\n\n          The defendants were joined  for trial, over Eduardo's objec-\n\ntion.  On May 4, 1992, the defense filed an omnibus discovery  motion,\n\nseeking, inter alia, \"all  information which may be used  for impeach-\n                   \n\nment  of government  witnesses.\"   The  government  disclosed that  an\n\nadministrative fine had  been imposed on  the informant for  marijuana\n\npossession  in New York.   The government disclaimed  knowledge of any\n\nother impeachment material relating to the informant.\n\n          Ultimately, Luis entered a  guilty plea; Eduardo and Algarin\n\nwent to trial.   In an effort to discredit  the informant's testimony,\n\nthe defense  called Esteban Garcia  Rosario (\"Garcia\"),  a former  ac-\n\nquaintance of the informant, who testified that the informant had used\n\n                                  5\n\nand dealt drugs in the past.  To rebut Garcia's  testimony, the prose-\n\ncution  recalled the informant.  The informant admitted knowing Garcia\n\nand, later, on cross-examination, admitted  that he had once purchased\n\ndrugs from Garcia \"for  a friend.\"  Both defendants asserted  that the\n\ngovernment  should have  disclosed  this information  prior to  trial,\n\nrelying  on Brady  v. Maryland,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1963), and  moved for\n                              \n\njudgments of  acquittal under Fed. R.  Crim. P. 29.   The court denied\n\ntheir motion.\n\n          In the course of his redirect examination by the government,\n\nthe  informant was  asked whether  he \"had  any personal  knowledge if\n\n[Garcia] was  acquainted with  Eduardo Gonzalez or  Luis Gonzalez  and\n\nAlgarin.\"  The informant responded in Spanish:  \"as to Algarin I don't\n\nknow,  but I do know that he  [Garcia] bought one eighth [kilogram] of\n\ncocaine from  . . . Eduardo  Gonzalez.\"    Before the answer  could be\n\ntranslated into English, both  defendants moved for mistrial, invoking\n\nthe rule on \"other acts\" evidence.  See Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).  Reserv-\n                                       \n\ning its ruling  on the  mistrial motion, the  district court gave  the\n\ngovernment an opportunity to  show that the informant's statement  was\n\nbased  on  personal knowledge  of  Garcia's prior  drug  sources under\n\nEvidence  Rule 602.  Eventually, the informant was permitted to testi-\n\nfy:  \"I used to visit him [Garcia] at his house and I know that he was\n\nbuying from Luis and Eduardo.\"  A few hours later, as part of its jury\n\ncharge, the court delivered a  curative instruction proposed by defen-\n\ndants:\n\n                                  6\n\n          \"I instruct you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,\n          that the defendants are on trial solely and exclu-\n          sively on  the charge set forth  in the indictment\n          and  nothing else.   So  therefore I  instruct you\n          that  you should  disregard, that  is, get  out of\n          your mind completely, [the  informant's] testimony\n          concerning  [Garcia's]  prior  dealings  with  the\n          defendant.

Eduardo Gonzalez.\"   Assuming, for present  purposes, that\n\nthe informant's  statement was  inadmissible  against appellants,1  we\n\nreview for \"abuse of discretion\" the district court's election to give\n\na cautionary instruction, rather than declare a  mistrial, to counter-\n\nact any prejudicial effect which may have resulted from the challenged\n\ntestimony.
