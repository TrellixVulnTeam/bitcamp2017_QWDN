Pappas and Charles A. Pappas, Jr., Trustees of the\n\nDudley Supermarket, Inc. Defined Benefit Plan, brought this action\n\nin   the     Superior   Court      of       Massachusetts,     Worcester     Division,\nalleging,      purportedly        solely       under      state   law,    common      law\n\nnegligence,        breach   of    contract         and    statutory1     unfair     trade\npractices, inter alia, in connection with investment services\n\nprovided      by   Transamerica,        a    financial      services   company,      with\n\nrespect to the Dudley Supermarket, Inc. Defined Benefit Plan.\nAppellants explain that their complaint charged Transamerica with\nwrongdoing arising \"from the sale of Park 'N' Shop’s employee\n\nretirement plan . . ., the sale of investments to the Plan, and the\npreparation of misleading actuarial valuation reports which failed\nto disclose the Plan’s unfunded liability.\"                    Brief at 4.      See also\n\nBrief at 6.\n      Transamerica removed the case to the district court on both\ndiversity of citizenship and federal question grounds pursuant to\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1441(b).         It asserted that the complaint necessarily\n\n\n\n      1\n          See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, §§ 2 & 11 (West 1997).\n\n                                             -2-\n\fwas under federal law because it charged that it had breached its\n\nfiduciary duties in violation of the Employee Retirement Income\n\nSecurity Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq., in particular\n\nERISA § 409, 29 U.S.C. § 1109, and thus alleged a cause of action\n\nunder ERISA § 502(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2).       Inasmuch as\n\nappellants acknowledge that Transamerica properly removed the case\non diversity of citizenship grounds, they understandably did not\n\nmove in the district court to remand the case to the state court.\n\n     Subsequently, on Transamerica’s motion, and over appellants’\n\nobjection, the district court determined that ERISA completely\n\npreempted appellants’ claims and it accordingly entered the January\n\n28, 2002 order which recharacterized the state law claims as\n\narising under ERISA and struck appellants’ demand for a jury trial.\nThereafter, the parties entered into a stipulation for entry of\n\njudgment in Transamerica’s favor, reserving appellants' right to\n\nappeal from the district court's determination with regard to ERISA\npreemption.2   The district court accepted the stipulation and\n\nentered judgment in Transamerica’s favor with prejudice on February\n\n22, 2002.   Appellants then filed a timely notice of appeal.   The\n\nonly issue appellants raise on appeal is whether ERISA completely\n\npreempts their state law claims, thus justifying the district\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Appellants explain that they entered into the stipulation\nbecause they \"determined that [they] would probably not prevail at\ntrial on any claim under ERISA, in part because [they] did not\nallege that Transamerica had discretionary authority over Plan\nassets.\" Brief at 5.\n\n                               -3-\n\fcourt’s determination to treat their action as being under ERISA.3\nWe review this legal question on a de novo basis.                  See Aponte v.\n\nCalderon, 284 F.3d 184, 191 (1st Cir. 2002).4\n     There can be no doubt that if appellants’ purported state law\n\nclaims in fact charged Transamerica with breach of fiduciary duty\n\nwhile acting as an ERISA fiduciary, ERISA would preempt completely\ntheir claims which thus would have to be asserted, if at all, under\n\nERISA.     See Danca v. Private Health Care Sys., Inc., 185 F.3d 1, 4-\n\n6 (1st Cir. 1999).       Appellants, however, argue that they do not\n\nallege that Transamerica acted with respect to their plan as a plan\n\nfiduciary as defined by ERISA but rather as \"a provider of garden-\n\nvariety professional services regulated by state laws that do not\n\naffect     ERISA’s   regulatory    scheme.\"        Brief      at   14-15.     This\ncontention requires us to consider section 3(21)(A) of ERISA, 29\n\nU.S.C. § 1002(21)(A), which provides that a person is a \"fiduciary\"\n\nwith respect to an employee benefit plan, if, inter alia, he\n\n\"renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct\n\nor indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property\" with\nrespect to the plan.     \"Investment advice,\" according to Department\n\nof Labor regulations, covers advice as to the value of securities\n\nor other property, or as to the advisability of investing in,\n\npurchasing, or selling securities or other property, where the\n\nadvice is     individualized      and   is    rendered   on    a   regular   basis\n\n     3\n      Appellants do not challenge the district court’s ruling that\nthere is no right to trial by jury for actions alleging breach of\nfiduciary duty under ERISA.\n     4\n         We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fpursuant to a mutual agreement for a fee.                 See 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-\n\n21(c).\n\n      By the plain terms of the complaint, and as reflected in the\nrecord on appeal, Transamerica was compensated as the primary,\n\nindividualized, and routine provider of investment advice for the\n\nDudley   Supermarket,           Inc.   Defined     Benefit      Plan.         Therefore,\nTransamerica       was    an      ERISA     fiduciary      rather       than    a    mere\n\nprofessional service provider with an ancillary relationship to the\n\nplan.    See App. at 10, complaint ¶ 6 (\"The Trustee is experienced\n\nin the grocery business, but had little or no experience in\n\nmanaging investments, as a fiduciary or otherwise.                       He relied on\n\nTransamerica, and Transamerica solicited such reliance.\"); App. at\n\n11,   complaint     ¶    10     (\"Transamerica      entered     into     a    series   of\nagreements    with       Park    'N'   Shop      and/or   the    Trustee       by   which\n\nTransamerica became the Plan administrator and custodian of the\n\nPlan assets.        In addition, Transamerica undertook to provide\ninvestment services relating to the investment of Plan assets.\");\n\nApp. at 54-55, appellants’ pretrial memorandum (plan trustee had\n\n\"little or no experience with investments.                      Although nominally\n\nresponsible    for       the    selection     of   investments,         he    relied   on\n\nTransamerica to recommend investments and a level of contributions\n\nwhich would fully fund the Plan within twenty (20) years . . . .\n\nHe also relied on Transamerica to advise him if and when it became\n\nadvisable     to    change       the      investment      strategy,      or     increase\n\ncontributions.\").          The fact that in the absence of ERISA the\n\ncomplaint may have asserted viable state law claims cannot affect\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\four result.\n\n      Moreover,   appellants’     argument        at   its    core    implicates\n\nTransamerica’s allegedly deficient investment advice with respect\nto the management of plan assets.             In their state law counts,\n\nappellants claim, inter alia, that Transamerica failed to provide\n\nadequate    information     concerning      its   investment     practices,     to\nprovide accurate actuarial statements, and to disclose that the\n\nplan was underperforming. Likewise, in their Pre-Trial Memorandum,\n\nappellants list as contested issues of fact whether Transamerica\n\n\"failed to disclose various financial risks\" concerning the plan,\n\n\"failed to provide accurate information\" regarding the investment\n\nof   plan   assets,   and   \"failed   to     provide   Park     'N'   Shop    with\n\nreasonably prudent and diverse investments for Plan assets.\"                  App.\nat 58-59.\n\n      Indeed, appellants’ brief hardly could be clearer in alleging\n\nthat Transamerica violated its fiduciary duties under ERISA. Thus,\nafter complaining that Transamerica advised placing the plan assets\n\nin   interest-based    investments,      appellants     set     forth    that   at\n\n\"approximately the same period in the nineties, the stock market\n\nexperienced    very   substantial      increases       in    value\"     and   that\n\nTransamerica \"failed to notify Park 'N' Shop that Plan assets could\n\nbe invested in stocks, which have historically outperformed fixed\n\nincome investments by a substantial margin.\"                Brief at 11-12.     We\n\ncannot understand how appellants can argue seriously that such\n\nallegations do not assert that Transamerica breached its fiduciary\n\nduties when we take into account ERISA’s provision that \"a person\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fis a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent [that] he\n\nrenders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct\n\nor indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of such\nplan.\"       ERISA § 3(21), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21).\n\n       Fundamentally, it is clear that the gravamen of the complaint\n\nis that Transamerica breached its fiduciary duty under ERISA to\nprovide competent investment advice and services rather than, as\n\nappellants argue, that Transamerica merely violated \"run-of-the-\n\nmill\"5 state laws that are largely tangential to and not preempted\nby ERISA.      See ERISA § 404(a), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a) (ERISA fiduciary\n\nmust       discharge   his   duties   with   reasonable   care,   skill,   and\n\ndiligence, and with the goal of minimizing the risk of large loss\n\nthrough asset diversification); see also ERISA § 409(a), 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1109(a) (Any fiduciary who \"breaches any of the responsibilities,\n\nobligations, or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter\n\nshall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to\nthe plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore to such\n\nplan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use\n\nof assets of the plan by the fiduciary . . . .\").             Consequently,\n\nappellants' state law claims in reality assert that Transamerica as\n\nan ERISA fiduciary gave an ERISA plan inadequate investment advice\n\nand thus the claims fall squarely within the exclusive scope of the\n\nfederal civil enforcement provisions of ERISA § 502(a)(2), 29\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Serv., Inc., 486 U.S.\n825, 833, 108 S.Ct. 2182, 2187 (1988).\n\n                                       -7-\n\fU.S.C. § 1132(a)(2).6        ERISA therefore completely preempts the\n\nclaims. See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 63,\n\n66-67, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 1546-48 (1987); Danca, 185 F.3d at 7\n(complete preemption where the state law claims properly are\n\ncharacterized as \"alternative enforcement mechanism[s]\" of ERISA §\n\n502(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2)) (citations omitted).7\n     We have examined the many cases that appellants cite to\n\nsupport    their    assertion   that     \"claims   based   essentially    on\n\nprofessional malpractice are not preempted by ERISA even though the\n\nclaims involve in some way a plan governed by ERISA.\"          Brief at 30.\n\nThese    cases,    as   significant    here,   simply   indicate   that   the\n\nmalpractice claims against the defendants there, who were not\n\nfiduciaries with respect to an ERISA plan, were not preempted.\nSee, e.g., Berlin City Ford, Inc. v. Roberts Planning Group, 864 F.\n\nSupp. 292, 295 (D.N.H. 1994) (\"For the purpose of arguing the\n\nremoval issue, both parties assume that Roberts is not a plan\nfiduciary.    Thus, the issue to be resolved is whether a plan\n\nadministrator’s state law professional negligence claims against a\n\n\n     6\n      This section empowers a plan participant, beneficiary, or\nfiduciary to bring a civil action for appropriate relief under\nERISA § 409, 29 U.S.C. § 1109, the section governing liability for\nbreach of ERISA fiduciary duties.      Of course, the appellants\nthemselves are undoubtedly ERISA fiduciaries and they do not\ncontend otherwise.\n     7\n      We do not hold that appellants’ claims properly were\ndismissed as being insufficient under ERISA as we do not reach that\nissue. The district court entered judgment for Transamerica with\nprejudice only because appellants consented to its entry subject to\ntheir right to appeal from the complete preemption ruling. The\ndistrict court was prepared to proceed with the trial on\nappellants’ claims as restated under ERISA.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fnon-fiduciary ‘relate to’ an ERISA regulated plan within the\n\nmeaning of [ERISA § 514(a),] 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a).\"); Mertens v.\n\nKaiser      Steel      Ret.   Plan,   829    F.    Supp.    1158   (N.D.       Cal.    1992)\n(actuarial malpractice);8 see also Shofer v. Stuart Hack Co., 595\n\nA.2d 1078, 1081-82 (Md. 1991) (\"There are appellate cases holding\n\nthat       certain     professionals     who      gave    advice   to,   or     performed\nministerial services for, ERISA plans were not fiduciaries.\")\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n       On the other hand, \"there is no per se rule that prevents\n\nprofessionals who render advice to an ERISA plan from becoming\n\nfiduciaries.\"          Pappas v. Buck Consultants, Inc., 923 F.2d 531, 538\n\n(7th Cir. 1991). That situation describes this case as appellants’\n\ncontentions with respect to Transamerica’s functions establish that\nwherever the line that separates an ordinary professional from a\n\nfiduciary        for   ERISA    purposes     may    be,    Transamerica        is     on   the\n\nfiduciary side of the line.                 Thus, we are dealing with complete\npreemption.\n\n       Finally, reaching our result we emphasize that we do not\n\ndisregard        appellants’     characterization          of   their    complaint          as\n\nsetting forth \"allegations . . . related solely to Transamerica’s\n\nrole       in   selling   the    Plan,   selling         investments     and    providing\n\nprofessional actuarial services in an independent, non-fiduciary\n\ncapacity.\"        Brief at 20.     Rather, we do not accept their conclusory\n\nstatement that Transamerica acted in a \"non-fiduciary capacity,\"\n\n       8\n      Mertens subsequently was before the Supreme Court on an issue\nnot material here. See Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248,\n113 S.Ct. 2063 (1993).\n\n                                            -9-\n\ffor appellants’ specific factual allegations simply do not support\n\nthis conclusion. A court must make its determination of whether an\n\nentity acted in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the alleged\nwrongdoing not on the basis of a plaintiff’s characterization of\n\nthe activity but rather on the basis of the functions the entity\n\nperformed and its relationship to the plaintiff.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f",

Appellants, however, argue that they do not allege that Transamerica acted with respect to their plan as a plan fiduciary as defined by ERISA but rather as \"a provider of garden-variety professional services regulated by state laws that do not affect ERISA's regulatory scheme.\" Brief at 14-15. This contention requires us to consider section 3(21)(A) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A), which provides that a person is a \"fiduciary\" with respect to an employee benefit plan, if, <i>inter alia,</i> he \"renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property\" with respect to the plan. \"Investment advice,\" according to Department of Labor regulations, covers advice as to the value of securities or other property, or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities or other property, where the advice is individualized and is rendered on a regular basis pursuant to a mutual agreement for a fee. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2510.3-21(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the plain terms of the complaint, and as reflected in the record on appeal, Transamerica was compensated as the primary, individualized, and routine provider of investment advice for the Dudley Supermarket, Inc. Defined Benefit Plan. Therefore, Transamerica was an ERISA fiduciary rather than a mere professional service provider with an ancillary relationship to the plan. <i>See</i> App. at 10, complaint &#182; 6 (\"The Trustee is experienced in the grocery business, but had little or no experience in managing investments, as a fiduciary or otherwise. He relied on Transamerica, and Transamerica solicited such reliance.\"); App. at 11, complaint &#182; 10 (\"Transamerica entered into a series of agreements with Park `N' Shop and/or the Trustee by which Transamerica became the Plan administrator and custodian of the Plan assets.

Although nominally responsible for the selection of investments, he relied on Transamerica to recommend investments and a level of contributions which would fully fund the Plan within twenty (20) years.... He also relied on Transamerica to advise him if and when it became advisable to change the investment strategy, or increase contributions.\").

In their state law counts, appellants claim, <i>inter alia,</i> that Transamerica failed to provide adequate information concerning its investment practices, to provide accurate actuarial statements, and to disclose that the plan was under-performing. Likewise, in their Pre-Trial Memorandum, appellants list as contested issues of fact whether Transamerica \"failed to disclose various financial risks\" concerning the plan, \"failed to provide accurate information\" regarding the investment of plan assets, and \"failed to provide Park `N' Shop with reasonably prudent and diverse investments for Plan assets.\" App. at 58-59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, appellants' brief hardly could be clearer in alleging that Transamerica violated its fiduciary duties under ERISA.

We cannot understand how appellants can argue seriously that such allegations do not assert that Transamerica breached its fiduciary duties when we take into account ERISA's provision that \"a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent [that] he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan.\" ERISA &#167; 3(21), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fundamentally, it is clear that the gravamen of the complaint is that Transamerica breached its fiduciary duty under ERISA to provide competent investment advice and services rather than, as appellants argue, that Transamerica merely violated \"run-of-the-mill\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> state laws that are largely tangential to and not preempted by ERISA. <i>See</i> ERISA &#167; 404(a), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1104(a) (ERISA fiduciary must discharge his duties with reasonable care, skill, and diligence, and with the goal of minimizing the risk of large loss through asset diversification); <i>see also</i> ERISA &#167; 409(a), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1109(a) (Any fiduciary who \"breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary....\"). Consequently, appellants' state law claims in reality assert that Transamerica as an ERISA fiduciary gave an ERISA plan inadequate investment advice and thus the claims fall squarely within the exclusive scope of the federal civil enforcement provisions of ERISA &#167; 502(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> ERISA therefore completely preempts the claims. <i>See Metropolitan Life Ins.

These cases, as significant here, simply indicate that the malpractice claims against the defendants there, who were not fiduciaries with respect to an ERISA plan, were not preempted. <i>See, e.g., Berlin City Ford, Inc. v. Roberts Planning Group,</i> 864 F.Supp. 292, 295 (D.N.H.1994) (\"For the purpose of arguing the removal issue, both parties assume that Roberts is not a plan fiduciary. Thus, the issue to be resolved is whether a plan administrator's state law professional negligence claims against a non-fiduciary `relate to' an ERISA regulated plan within the meaning of [ERISA &#167; 514(a),] 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a).\"); <i>Mertens v. Kaiser Steel Ret. Plan,</i> 829 F.Supp. 1158 (N.D.Cal.1992) (actuarial malpractice);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>see also Shofer v.

Buck Consultants, Inc.,</i> 923 F.2d 531, 538 (7th Cir.1991). That situation describes this case as appellants' contentions with respect to Transamerica's functions establish that wherever the line that separates an ordinary professional from a fiduciary for ERISA purposes may be, Transamerica is on the fiduciary side of the line.

Rather, we do not accept their conclusory statement that Transamerica acted in a \"non-fiduciary capacity,\" for appellants' specific factual allegations simply do not support this conclusion. A court must make its determination of whether an entity acted in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the alleged wrongdoing not on the basis of a plaintiff's characterization of the activity but rather on the basis of the functions the entity performed and its relationship to the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>See</i> Mass.

That situation describes this case as appellants' contentions with respect to Transamerica's functions establish that wherever the line that separates an ordinary professional from a fiduciary for ERISA purposes may be, Transamerica is on the fiduciary side of the line.

Rather, we do not accept their conclusory statement that Transamerica acted in a \"non-fiduciary capacity,\" for appellants' specific factual allegations simply do not support this conclusion. A court must make its determination of whether an entity acted in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the alleged wrongdoing not on the basis of a plaintiff's characterization of the activity but rather on the basis of the functions the entity performed and its relationship to the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>See</i> Mass.
