After    reviewing       plaintiff-appellant's\n\narguments in his briefs and during oral argument, we are satisfied\n\nthat the district court correctly analyzed the case.                    We affirm\n\nsubstantially on the basis of the district court's memorandum and\n\norder.    Schneider v. Harrison Elec. Workers Trust Fund, 382 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 261 (D. Mass. 2005).1           We add only the following:\n\n           We disagree with Schneider's contention that the Supreme\n\nCourt's   holding   in   Local    144     Nursing   Home    Extension      Fund   v.\n\nDemisay, 508 U.S. 581 (1993), does not govern this case.                   He rests\n\nthis contention in part on the ground that while in Demisay the\n\nparties   were   disputing       the     purpose    for    which     the   benefit\n\ncontributions \"are used,\" he is now contesting the purpose for\n\nwhich the fund was \"established.\"              This distinction, however, is\n\nnot borne out even by Schneider's own complaint.                   In his amended\n\ncomplaint, at paragraph 5.2, plaintiff asserted:\n\n     Defendants the Local 103 Fund and/or the Trustees of the\n     Local 103 Fund violated 29 U.S.C. § 186(a) and/or (b)\n     when they retained the excess portion of contributions\n     earned by Schneider, thereby becoming a nonqualifying\n     trust under 29 U.S.C. § 186(c)(5) (emphasis added).\n\nBy alleging that the trust became nonqualifying when defendants\n\nretained the excess portion of contributions earned by Schneider,\n\nplaintiff himself suggested that he was contesting only the purpose\n\n\n     1\n      We note that in the district court's opinion at 382 F. Supp.\n2d. at 263, there is a reference to \"Section 103\" of the Labor\nManagement Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 186. Though the\nstatutory citation is correct, we believe the section reference\nshould be to Section 302, the provision at issue here.\n\n                                         -2-\n\ffor which these excess funds were \"used\" rather than the purpose\n\nfor which the trust fund was established.      See Demisay, 508 U.S. at\n\n588. The trustees' retention of a portion of the contributions did\n\nnot stem from some purported deficiency in the purpose for which\n\nthe trust was established.         Rather, the trustees' challenged\n\nactions stemmed from collateral agreements entered into long after\n\nestablishment   of   the   trust   and   occurred   sometime   after   the\n\ncontributions were \"'pa[id], len[t], or deliver[ed]' to the trust\n\nfund...or...'receive[d], or accept[ed]' by the trust fund....\" Id.\n\nSee also DeVito v. Hemstead China Shop Inc., 38 F.3d 651, 653-54\n\nn.3 (2d Cir. 1994) (holding that Demisay precludes the argument\n\nthat payment would be in violation of § 302(c)(5) of the Labor\n\nManagement Relations Act because defendant \"[did] not contest that\n\nthe Benefit Fund was properly established under section 302(c)(5)\"\n\nbut contended only that \"it was subsequently operated in a manner\n\ninconsistent with § 302(c)(5)\"); Ladzinski v. MEBA Pension Trust,\n\n951 F. Supp. 570, 573 (D. Md. 1997), aff'd, 120 F.3d 261 (4th Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n          Schneider also mischaracterizes the district court as\n\nhaving erroneously granted summary judgment against him, \"because\n\nERISA did not control Schneider's claim, because Schneider was not\n\na participant in the Local 103 Fund's heath and welfare plan and\n\ntherefore had no standing to sue.\"        We read the district court's\n\nmemorandum as holding simply that Schneider abandoned his ERISA\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fclaim, which, for that reason, the court no longer needed to\n\nanalyze.\n\n              The district court was on solid ground in holding that\n\nSchneider had abandoned his ERISA and unjust enrichment claims. In\n\nhis opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment,\n\nSchneider made the following statement:\n\n      Schneider now takes the position, following the back and\n      forth briefing between the parties about the legal theory\n      in this case, that the ERISA has no application\n      whatsoever to Schneider's claims against Defendants.\n      Hence, Schneider's theory of the case is that because\n      Defendants' conduct violates only § 302 of the LMRA, his\n      ERISA claim, his signature to the Authorization and\n      Release, and his unjust enrichment claim become\n      irrelevant.\n\nIt is true, as Schneider now argues, that at the end of his\n\nopposition, he referred to an unjust enrichment claim.             But this\n\nreference, standing alone, was insufficient to overcome his prior,\n\nexplicit abandonment of the ERISA and unjust enrichment claims, and\n\neven if these claims had remained still viable, he never responded\n\nto any of the arguments against them made by the defendants in\n\ntheir summary judgment memo.          Likewise, he has failed to develop\n\nany argument in favor of his unjust enrichment claim, which he\n\nclaims still to maintain, in his brief on appeal.           \"Even an issue\n\nraised in the complaint but ignored at summary judgment may be\n\ndeemed waived.\"      Grenier v. Cyanamid Plastics, Inc., 70 F.3d 667,\n\n678 (1st Cir. 1995). \"It is well-established that 'issues adverted\n\nto   in   a   perfunctory   manner,   unaccompanied   by   some   effort   at\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fdeveloped   argumentation,   are   deemed   waived.'\"      Nikijuluw   v.\n\nGonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).\n\n\"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most\n\nskeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work. . . .\n\n'Judges are not expected to be mindreaders.'\"           United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 494 U.S.\n\n1082 (1990) (citation omitted).\n\n            We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
