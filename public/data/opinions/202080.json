Judicial review of arbitration\n\nawards is extremely narrow.             As a result, \"disputes that are\n\ncommitted by contract to the arbitral process almost always are won\n\nor lost before the arbitrator.\"           Teamsters Local Union No. 42 v.\n\nSupervalu, Inc., 212 F.3d 59, 61 (1st Cir. 2000).                This case is no\n\nexception   to       that   general   rule.      Because   the   losing    party,\n\nappellant Cytyc Corporation (Cytyc), has failed to establish any\n\nlegally cognizable basis for setting aside the arbitrators' award,\n\nwe uphold the district court's order granting the confirmation\n\nmotion filed by the prevailing party, appellee DEKA Products\n\nLimited Partnership (DEKA).\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            Cytyc manufactures and sells a cervical cancer screening\n\nsystem.     DEKA operates a commercial research and development\n\nlaboratory.      In the late 1980s, Cytyc endeavored to improve the\n\naccuracy of the traditional Pap smear test — a test that relies on\n\ntechnicians to prepare a microscope slide from each cervical cell\n\nsample and then review the specimen for irregularities.                   Due to\n\nhuman error, this methodology yields a relatively high incidence of\n\nfalse negatives.        Cytyc proposed to solve that problem by using a\n\ncomputer imager to prescreen the slide specimens.\n\n            During the developmental phase of this project, Cytyc\n\nencountered      a    potentially     insuperable    obstacle:     its    imaging\n\ntechnology could accurately screen a thin, uniform layer of cells,\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fbut the slide specimens prepared by human technicians were often\n\ndisuniform.      Desirous of obtaining standardized slide specimens,\n\nCytyc retained DEKA to create an automated process for transferring\n\ncells from a test sample onto a slide.\n\n            DEKA successfully developed such a process (the ThinPrep\n\nsystem).    This system consists of two components.            The first is the\n\nThinPrep processor — a machine that transfers the cells onto the\n\nslide. The processor utilizes technology patented by DEKA prior to\n\nits association with Cytyc.        This body of knowledge is known as\n\nfluid management system (FMS) technology.            The second component of\n\nthe ThinPrep system is a set of four disposable accessories: a\n\nmicroscope slide, a sample collection device manufactured by a\n\nthird party, a vial of Cytyc's patented preservative solution, and\n\na filter cylinder invented specifically for use in the ThinPrep\n\nsystem. While the ThinPrep system employs a number of products and\n\nprocesses, its sine qua non is the FMS technology.\n\n            In March of 1993, Cytyc and DEKA entered into a licensing\n\nagreement (the Agreement) relative to the ThinPrep system.                  The\n\nAgreement recited that DEKA, by means of the FMS technology, had\n\ndeveloped    a   \"method   and   apparatus   .   .    .   to   facilitate   the\n\npreparation of slides for medical and laboratory purposes\" and\n\nwished to license the FMS technology to Cytyc for use in the\n\nThinPrep system. In exchange for this license, Cytyc agreed to pay\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fDEKA a royalty \"equal to One Percent . . . of the Net Sales of\n\nProducts or Improvements\" covered by the Agreement.\n\n            By   its   terms,   the   Agreement    divided    royalty-bearing\n\n\"Products\" into two categories: \"Product Hardware\" and \"Product\n\nDisposables.\"     \"Product Hardware\" meant, in effect, the ThinPrep\n\nprocessor (we do not dwell on this, as there is no dispute between\n\nthe parties concerning royalty payments related to hardware).\n\n\"Product Disposables\" comprised \"any filter cylinder or similar\n\ndisposable provided such disposable utilizes the Cytyc Technology,\n\nthe   FMS   Technology    or    both.\"      The   Agreement   noted   somewhat\n\ncryptically that the term \"Product Disposable[s] presently includes\n\n[the filter cylinder].\"\n\n            Although     the   ThinPrep   system    functioned   well,   Cytyc\n\nstruggled to perfect its imaging technology.           Finally, it began to\n\nmarket the ThinPrep system without the computer imager.               At some\n\npoint, Cytyc developed a special microscope slide for use in the\n\nThinPrep system and started to sell it, along with the other three\n\ndisposable accessories, in a single bundle called the ThinPrep kit.\n\nThe ThinPrep kit became a rousing commercial success, and Cytyc\n\nemerged as a leader in the market for cervical cancer screening\n\nsystems.\n\n            For some period of time, Cytyc made quarterly royalty\n\npayments to DEKA pursuant to the Agreement.            In November of 2001,\n\nhowever, Cytyc notified DEKA of its belief that, for an earlier\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthree-year    period,   it   had    calculated    DEKA's   royalties   too\n\ngenerously.    In staking out this position, Cytyc posited that the\n\nAgreement entitled DEKA to royalties only on sales of the filter\n\ncylinder and not on sales of the other three disposable accessories\n\nincluded in the ThinPrep kit.        Cytyc further informed DEKA that,\n\nconsistent with this reading of the Agreement, it had computed the\n\nroyalties referable to filter cylinder sales in accordance with the\n\nrelative cost of the kit components (the relative cost ratio\n\nmethod).     DEKA disputed both Cytyc's overpayment claim and its\n\nmethod for figuring royalties.            In DEKA's view, the Agreement\n\nrequired Cytyc to pay a flat one percent royalty on net sales of\n\nall disposable accessories.\n\n           The parties attempted on at least two occasions to\n\nresolve their differences.         At one such meeting, Cytyc's chief\n\nfinancial officer threatened that if DEKA continued to resist\n\nCytyc's royalty calculation method, he would \"manipulate\" the cost\n\ndata and suppress future royalties.\n\n           The Agreement gave DEKA the right to commission an\n\nindependent audit of Cytyc's books should questions arise about the\n\namount of royalty payments due.           When the parties' negotiations\n\nstalled, DEKA exercised this prerogative.         The final audit report\n\ncovered the period from January of 1996 through September of 2002.\n\nThe auditors described Cytyc's relative cost ratio method of\n\ncalculating royalties as \"unusual and uncommon\" and found that,\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\feven under this unorthodox approach, Cytyc had underpaid DEKA. The\n\nauditors further concluded that if the Agreement required the\n\npayment of royalties on the net sales of all disposable accessories\n\ncontained in the ThinPrep kits, the amount of the underpayment\n\nwould exceed $4,000,000 for the audit period alone.\n\n          The   Agreement   stipulated   that   disputes   between   the\n\nparties would be subject to binding arbitration.       Armed with the\n\naudit report, DEKA served a demand for arbitration.        It claimed,\n\ninter alia, that Cytyc had breached the Agreement by failing to pay\n\nroyalties on the net sales of all the disposable accessories or,\n\nalternatively, by allocating royalties referable to the filter\n\ncylinder based on the relative cost ratio method.\n\n          A three-member arbitration panel held an evidentiary\n\nhearing that focused on the interpretation of the term \"Product\n\nDisposables\" and the appropriate method for calculating DEKA's\n\nroyalties.   The parties' positions were in sharp contrast.     On the\n\none hand, DEKA maintained that the term \"Product Disposables\"\n\nincluded any and all disposable accessories that used the Cytyc or\n\nFMS technology in the creation of a sample slide (a reading that,\n\nin effect, mandated the payment of royalties with respect to sales\n\nof all four disposable accessories bundled in the ThinPrep kit).\n\nDEKA also asserted that royalties should be gauged by the net\n\nsales, rather than the relative costs, of the kit components.        On\n\nthe other hand, Cytyc argued that the term \"Product Disposables\"\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fcovered only the filter cylinder, not the other three disposable\n\naccessories bundled in the ThinPrep kit, and that royalties should\n\nbe computed by using the relative cost ratio method.\n\n           To bolster its position, Cytyc proffered two kinds of\n\nadscititious evidence.          The first was a set of three letters\n\nbetween the parties, exchanged prior to the execution of the\n\nAgreement, which purported to document an intent to exclude sales\n\nof Cytyc's preservative solution from DEKA's royalty base.                  The\n\nsecond comprised testimonial and documentary evidence suggesting\n\nthat, over a period of years, Cytyc had disclosed its use of the\n\nrelative cost ratio method to DEKA without eliciting any objection.\n\n           Shortly after the conclusion of the hearing, one of the\n\narbitrators died.    In March of 2005, the remaining two arbitrators\n\nissued a partial final award (the PFA).             The Agreement provided\n\nthat New Hampshire law would be controlling and, in the PFA, the\n\narbitrators ruled that the New Hampshire statute of limitations\n\nbarred   DEKA's   breach   of    contract   claim   for   periods   prior    to\n\nNovember 17, 2000.    As to subsequent periods, the linchpin of the\n\narbitrators' decision was a finding that:\n\n           FMS Technology is a system; it is not a\n           specific product.   It is the operation of a\n           system on certain components.        In this\n           particular situation the components are the\n           four units . . . : the filter, the collection\n           device, the vial and the slide. . . . [T]hese\n           units . . . are worthless by themselves, but\n           when put together and governed by this\n           patented system, the FMS technology, [they]\n           become[] enormously valuable.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fThe arbitrators coupled this finding with two other findings: that\n\nthe FMS technology was the \"key\" component of the ThinPrep system\n\nand that the four disposable accessories were \"integrated by design\n\nand function in order to work.\"\n\n           After making these findings, the arbitrators addressed\n\nthe contested contractual provision:\n\n           The phrase \"or similar disposable provided\n           such disposable utilizes the Cytyc Technology,\n           the FMS Technology or both\" cannot be read to\n           be restricted to only the filter.     The very\n           next    sentence,     which  reads    \"Product\n           Disposable[s] presently includes [the filter\n           cylinder],\"    must    mean  that   the   term\n           \"Disposables\" includes the other disposables\n           in   the   Kit    and   any  improvements   or\n           modifications.\n\nIn line with this parsing of the Agreement's text, the arbitrators\n\ndetermined that Cytyc's relative cost ratio method for figuring\n\nroyalties was \"contrary to the [A]greement\" and that \"the parties\n\nnever intended that royalties would be paid on parts of the Kit\n\nrather   tha[n]   the   Kit   as   a   whole.\"    Based      on   these   serial\n\ndeterminations    and   the   plain    language   of   the    Agreement,    the\n\narbitrators concluded that the term \"Product Disposables\" covered\n\nall four of the disposable accessories bundled in the ThinPrep kit\n\nand, accordingly, that the Agreement entitled DEKA to royalties on\n\nthe proceeds derived from the net sales of the kits.\n\n           Although the PFA resolved the central issues in dispute,\n\nthe panel believed that it could not make an accurate calculation\n\nof DEKA's damages on the record as it stood.              Consequently, the\n\n                                       -8-\n\farbitrators     ordered   the   parties     to   submit   proposed    damage\n\ncomputations    within    twenty-five     days   and   authorized    them   to\n\nsupplement the record to the extent necessary to buttress these\n\ncomputations.\n\n          The parties submitted widely disparate damage estimates.\n\nIn large part, that disparity arose because Cytyc claimed a right\n\nto offset DEKA's royalties by deducting commissions allegedly paid\n\non the sales of ThinPrep products, whereas DEKA argued that, in the\n\nlanguage of the Agreement, Cytyc was entitled to deduct only those\n\ncommissions that were \"actually stated on a customer invoice.\"\n\n          In their ensuing final award, the arbitrators once again\n\nsided with DEKA.    They found that \"[t]he only customer invoices in\n\nthe record are devoid of any . . . statement of commissions.\"\n\nLargely for that reason, the arbitrators' final award set DEKA's\n\ndamages in the amount of $7,524,168, plus interest of $563,645 —\n\namounts that pretty much tracked what the panel characterized as\n\nthe \"persuasive\" calculations made by DEKA's accountants.                   The\n\narbitrators also ordered Cytyc to bear the expenses of both the\n\naudit and the arbitration, and to reimburse DEKA $1,000,000 for\n\nattorneys' fees and costs.\n\n          Having lost at virtually every turn, Cytyc asked the\n\ndistrict court to vacate the arbitral award.           DEKA cross-moved for\n\nconfirmation of the award.      Ruling ore sponte, the district court\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\frejected Cytyc's importunings and granted DEKA's motion. This\n\ntimely appeal followed.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\n               On appeal, Cytyc asseverates that the arbitrators (i)\n\nneglected to interpret the Agreement or, alternatively, devised an\n\ninterpretation that was unfounded in reason and fact (and, thus,\n\nthat       failed   to   draw   its   essence   from   the   Agreement);   (ii)\n\nmanifestly disregarded applicable New Hampshire law; and (iii)\n\nrefused to consider material evidence referable to the issue of\n\ndamages.1       After limning the applicable standard of review, we\n\naddress each of these asseverations.\n\n                           A.   Standard of Review.\n\n               In an action to vacate or confirm an arbitral award, we\n\ntypically review the district court's decision de novo.2                   See,\n\ne.g., Supervalu, 212 F.3d at 65.          The authority of a federal court\n\nto disturb an arbitration award is tightly circumscribed.                  While\n\n\n\n       1\n      In its opening brief, Cytyc hinted at additional challenges\nbased on the untimely death of the third panel member, the interest\ncalculation, and the award of attorneys' fees.       Because Cytyc\nfailed to develop these embryonic arguments, we treat them as\nstillborn. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990) (explaining that \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\nwaived\").\n       2\n      The standard of review may be more nuanced where the district\ncourt has conducted an evidentiary hearing and made findings of\nfact. See First Options of Chi., Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938,\n947-48 (1995). The district court made no such findings in this\ncase.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthe award must \"draw its essence from the contract\" that underlies\n\nthe   arbitration   proceeding,   courts   will    deem   that   benchmark\n\nachieved as long as the arbitrators are \"even arguably construing\n\nor applying the contract and acting within the scope of [their]\n\nauthority.\"   United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484\n\nU.S. 29, 38 (1987).     That a reviewing court is convinced that the\n\narbitrators committed error — even serious error — does not justify\n\nsetting aside the arbitral decision.         Id.     This remains true\n\nwhether the arbitrators' apparent error concerns a matter of law or\n\na matter of fact.      Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy, 914 F.2d 6, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).\n\n           None of this means, however, that arbitral awards are\n\nutterly impregnable.    Although courts \"do not sit to hear claims of\n\nfactual or legal error by an arbitrator as an appellate court does\n\nin reviewing decisions of lower courts,\" Misco, 484 U.S. at 38,\n\nthere are nevertheless a few exceptions to the general rule that\n\narbitrators have the last word.    One set of exceptions is codified\n\nin the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA).       The operative provision,\n\nsection 10(a) of the FAA,3 authorizes vacatur only in cases of\n\n\n      3\n      The FAA authorizes a federal court to vacate an arbitral\naward:\n\n           (1)   Where  the   award   was  procured         by\n           corruption, fraud, or undue means.\n           (2) Where there was evident partiality           or\n           corruption in the arbitrators, or either         of\n           them.\n           (3) Where the arbitrators were guilty            of\n\n                                  -11-\n\f\"specified misconduct or misbehavior on the arbitrators' part,\n\nactions in excess of arbitral powers, or failures to consummate the\n\naward.\"      Advest, 914 F.2d at 8.\n\n               A second set of exceptions flows from the federal courts'\n\ninherent power to vacate arbitral awards.                See id.    This authority\n\nis    very     narrow.    One    manifestation     of    it,    usually     (but   not\n\nexclusively) associated with labor arbitration, arises when an award\n\ncontravenes the plain language of the applicable contract. See Bull\n\nHN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d 321, 330-31 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(recognizing the applicability of this principle outside the labor\n\ncontext). Another manifestation arises in those rare cases in which\n\nit    is   clear   from    the    record    that   the   arbitrators       cavalierly\n\ndisregarded applicable law.              Advest, 914 F.2d at 9.\n\n               At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, let us make\n\none    thing    perfectly       clear.      Despite     the    existence    of   these\n\n\n               misconduct in refusing to postpone the\n               hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in\n               refusing to hear evidence pertinent and\n               material to the controversy; or of any other\n               misbehavior by which the rights of any party\n               have been prejudiced.\n               (4) Where the arbitrators exceeded their\n               powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a\n               mutual, final, and definite award upon the\n               subject matter submitted was not made.\n\n9 U.S.C. § 10(a). An additional provision of the FAA, 9 U.S.C. §\n11, allows a federal court to correct \"evident\" and \"material\"\narithmetic or descriptive errors in arbitral awards. Cytyc has not\ninvoked section 11 here.\n\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fexceptions, great deference remains the general mode of approach to\n\njudicial review of arbitral awards.        Id. at 8.\n\n                             B.    The Merits.\n\n           Against this backdrop, we turn to Cytyc's asseverational\n\narray.\n\n           1.   Misinterpretation of the Agreement.            Cytyc's most\n\nbruited   contention   is   that   the   panel   neglected    to   offer   any\n\ninterpretation of the text of the Agreement or, alternatively, that\n\nthe panel's interpretation of the term \"Product Disposables\" is\n\nunfounded in reason and fact (and thus, in either event, that the\n\narbitral award fails to draw its essence from the Agreement).               If\n\neither part of that binary charge were correct, vacation would be\n\nan appropriate remedy.      See Misco, 484 U.S. at 38.       Cytyc, however,\n\nhas failed to carry its heavy burden of substantiating the charge.\n\n           Cytyc's claim that the panel neglected to interpret the\n\nAgreement is jejune.     We must uphold the arbitrators' decision as\n\nlong as they were even \"arguably\" construing the Agreement.                Id.\n\nThat standard is abundantly satisfied here.          The panel's decision\n\n(portions of which are quoted above) makes manifest that the\n\narbitrators pondered the pertinent language of the Agreement and\n\nconstrued that language in accordance with the parties' discernible\n\nintent.   That is contract interpretation, pure and simple.                See\n\nRobbins v. Salem Radiology, 764 A.2d 885, 887 (N.H. 2000) (holding\n\nthat, in reviewing a contract, a court must give the language \"the\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\finterpretation that best reflects the parties' intentions\" at the\n\ntime of contracting).\n\n             Cytyc's   more    robust   claim    is   that   the    arbitrators'\n\ninterpretation of the Agreement was flawed.            Even under the highly\n\ndeferential standard that constrains judicial review of arbitral\n\nawards, the moving party may establish entitlement to vacation of\n\nan arbitral award on a persuasive showing that the arbitrators'\n\ninterpretation is contrary to the plain language of the contract.\n\nBull HN Info. Sys., 229 F.3d at 330-31; Advest, 914 F.2d at 9.                   This\n\nconfiguration requires the movant to demonstrate that the award is\n\n\"(1) unfounded in reason and fact; (2) based on reasoning so\n\npalpably faulty that no judge, or group of judges, ever could\n\nconceivably have made such a ruling; or (3) mistakenly based on a\n\ncrucial assumption that is concededly a non-fact.\" Advest, 914 F.2d\n\nat   8-9    (citations   and     internal       quotation    marks        omitted).\n\n             In this case, the plain language of the Agreement, when\n\ncoupled with the arbitrators' factual findings, easily sustains the\n\ninterpretation upon which the award rests.             The Agreement defines\n\n\"Product Disposables\" as \"any filter cylinder or similar disposable\n\nprovided such disposable utilizes the Cytyc Technology, the FMS\n\nTechnology or both.\" In what necessarily amounted to an explication\n\nof   this   provision,   the   panel    supportably     found      that    the    FMS\n\ntechnology pervades the entire ThinPrep system and that the four\n\ndisposable accessories are \"systematically integrated\" into that\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fsystem \"by design and function.\"         With certain exceptions (none\n\nrelevant here), we are duty-bound to give effect to an arbitrator's\n\nfindings of fact. Mercy Hosp., Inc. v. Mass. Nurses Ass'n, 429 F.3d\n\n338, 344 (1st Cir. 2005).        Doing so, we hold that the panel's\n\nfinding that the term \"any similar disposable [which] utilizes the\n\nCytyc [or] FMS Technology\" captures all the disposable accessories\n\nin the ThinPrep kit was not plainly erroneous, much           less   so\n\nunfounded in reason and fact as to justify judicial correction.\n\n          Cytyc's     contrary     argument     relies   heavily     on\n\ncorrespondence which, it maintains, establishes the parties' shared\n\nintention to include only sales of filter cylinders in DEKA's\n\nroyalty base.    These letters cannot carry the weight that Cytyc\n\nloads upon them.\n\n          In the first place, the arbitrators' interpretation —\n\nwith or without the letters — does not appear to be strained or\n\nchimercial.     By its terms, the Agreement did not exclude any\n\ndisposable accessory from the definition of \"Product Disposables\"\n\nand DEKA presented evidence that, early in the parties' course of\n\ndealing, Cytyc included the sales of all the disposable accessories\n\nin DEKA's royalty base.\n\n          Moreover, the letters, even if taken at face value, are\n\nfar from dispositive.     This is especially so since DEKA adduced\n\nevidence that any informal agreement to exclude sales of the\n\npreservative solution from the royalty base only covered sales of\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fthe solution unrelated to the ThinPrep system. This proof comported\n\nwith documentation indicating that, at the time the parties executed\n\nthe Agreement, Cytyc had not decided whether to sell the filter\n\ncylinder individually or in combination with the other disposable\n\naccessories.\n\n             In the second place, Cytyc asks us to draw an inference,\n\nbased on nothing more than the panel's omission of any direct\n\nreference, that the arbitrators neglected to consider the letters.\n\nThis is whistling past the graveyard.      Arbitrators are not required\n\nto provide particularized reasons for their decisions. See Raytheon\n\nCo. v. Automated Bus. Sys., Inc., 882 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nIt follows that an arbitrator's failure to comment upon a specific\n\npiece of evidence cannot support an inference that he failed to\n\nconsider it. See Nat'l Cas. Co. v. First State Ins. Group, 430 F.3d\n\n492, 498-99 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             Third,   and   finally,     the   parties   exchanged   the\n\ncorrespondence in question months        before the execution of the\n\nAgreement.     When signed, the Agreement itself not only omitted any\n\nmention of excluding sales of Cytyc's preservative solution from\n\nDEKA's royalty base but also contained an integration clause.4 Under\n\n\n     4\n         The clause provided in relevant part:\n\n             This   Agreement   constitutes  the   entire\n             understanding of the parties with respect to\n             the subject matter hereof and supersedes all\n             prior understandings and writings relating\n             thereto.\n\n                                  -16-\n\fsuch circumstances, the arbitrators were not compelled to use the\n\nletters to vary the apparent meaning of the Agreement.     Cf. Richey\n\nv. Leighton, 632 A.2d 1215, 1217 (N.H. 1993) (holding that even\n\nwhere a contract is not completely integrated, \"parol evidence is\n\nadmissible only to prove unexpressed terms that are not inconsistent\n\nwith the writing\").\n\n             Refined to bare essence, Cytyc's argument reduces to a\n\nfrontal attack on the merits of the arbitral award.    Such an attack\n\nis easily repulsed.       It was the province of the arbitrators to\n\nscrutinize the language of the Agreement, weigh the conflicting\n\nevidence of the parties' intentions, and determine the dimensions of\n\nDEKA's royalty base.       See Major League Baseball Players Ass'n v.\n\nGarvey, 532 U.S. 504, 509-10 (2001).      Cytyc has advanced no sound\n\njustification for us to tamper with the arbitrators' resolution of\n\nthose issues.\n\n             2.    Manifest Disregard of the Law.   An arbitrator, of\n\ncourse, cannot intentionally flout the law.      See First Options of\n\nChi., Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 942 (1995); Advest, 914 F.2d at\n\n9.   In its second assignment of arbitral error, Cytyc tries to\n\nrepackage its misinterpretation claim as a manifest disregard of the\n\nlaw claim.        It begins by citing evidence that, for a period of\n\nyears, DEKA never objected to Cytyc's calculation of royalties in\n\naccordance with the relative cost ratio method.     It then points to\n\na New Hampshire statute providing that, with respect to contract\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\finterpretation, \"any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in\n\nwithout objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the\n\nagreement.\"     N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 382-A:2-208(1).               With this\n\nfoundation in place, it blithely asserts that the panel must have\n\ndisregarded the statute.       This assertion lacks force.\n\n             A party seeking to establish manifest disregard of the law\n\nsufficient    to   warrant    setting      aside   an   arbitral    award   must\n\ndemonstrate that the arbitrators appreciated the existence and\n\napplicability of a controlling legal rule but intentionally decided\n\nnot to apply it.      Advest, 914 F.2d at 10.         This tenet demands \"some\n\nshowing in the record, other than the result obtained, that the\n\narbitrators    knew   the    law   and    expressly   disregarded   it.\"    Id.\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).5\n\n             The record in this case contains no evidence that the\n\npanel appreciated the applicability of the New Hampshire statute and\n\nwillfully ignored it. Indeed, it is hopelessly unclear whether this\n\nprovision, which appears in New Hampshire's version of Article 2 of\n\nthe Uniform Commercial Code, governs agreements to license patented\n\nintellectual property.         See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 382-A:2-102\n\n\n     5\n      In George Watts & Son v. Tiffany & Co., 248 F.3d 577 (7th\nCir. 2001), the Seventh Circuit held that the manifest disregard of\nthe law exception has been restricted to cases in which the\narbitral award either requires the parties to violate the law or\n\"does not adhere to the legal principles specified by contract, and\nhence [is] unenforceable under § (10)(a)(4)\" of the FAA. Id. at\n581 (citing E. Assoc'd Coal Corp. v. UMW, Dist. 17, 531 U.S. 57\n(2000)). We need not decide today whether the exception has been\nlimited to that extent.\n\n                                         -18-\n\f(stating that \"this Article applies to transactions in goods\").\n\nGiven these deficiencies in Cytyc's proffer, the arbitral award\n\ncannot be said to have been rendered in manifest disregard of the\n\nlaw.\n\n             3.    Failure to Consider Material Evidence.            In a last-\n\nditch effort to salvage its appeal, Cytyc takes issue with the\n\narbitrators' refusal to discount DEKA's damage award by the amount\n\nof commissions allegedly paid on the sales of ThinPrep products.\n\nSpecifically, Cytyc avers that the panel failed to allow it to\n\nintroduce     material   evidence     anent   the   deductibility     of   these\n\ncommissions and, thus, that the award must fail under 9 U.S.C. §\n\n10(a)(3)     (authorizing   vacatur    when    arbitrators     are   \"guilty   of\n\nmisconduct . . . in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material\n\nto the controversy\").\n\n             Cytyc's argument is vecordious. Notwithstanding ample\n\nopportunity during the evidentiary hearing and before the issuance\n\nof the PFA, Cytyc failed to produce any evidence relating to the\n\npayment or deductibility of sales commissions.             To cinch matters,\n\nthe panel afforded the parties a twenty-five day window after\n\nannouncing the PFA within which to augment the record with evidence\n\npertaining to the computation of damages.           During that period, DEKA\n\nspecifically requested Cytyc to furnish \"appropriate documentation\"\n\nsubstantiating its supposed payment of commissions and warned that\n\nit   would   ask   the   arbitrators    to    disallow   any   commission      not\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f\"actually    stated   on   a   customer   invoice    by   Cytyc   or    [its]\n\naffiliates,\" as required by the Agreement.\n\n            Cytyc spurned the opportunity afforded by the arbitrators\n\nand turned a deaf ear to DEKA's warning; it produced neither a\n\nsingle invoice reflecting a commission nor a shred of evidence\n\nconcerning the propriety of deducting unstated commissions.             Given\n\nthese missed opportunities, Cytyc cannot now be heard to complain\n\nthat the panel followed the letter of the Agreement, refused to\n\nconsider    non-existent   extrinsic   evidence,    and   rejected     Cytyc's\n\ndamage computation.    Arbitrators are, after all, not expected to be\n\nmind readers.6\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.     For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe hold that Cytyc has failed to identify any legally cognizable\n\nbasis for vacating the arbitral award.       Accordingly, we uphold the\n\ndistrict court's order of confirmation.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      To be sure, Cytyc did make a motion for reconsideration after\nthe arbitrators handed down their final award. In that motion, it\npromised to present expert evidence bolstering its theory of\ndeductibility. This was clearly too little and too late, and we\ncannot fault the arbitrators for summarily denying the motion.\n\n                                   -20-\n\f",

Supervalu, Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 59, 61 (1st Cir.2000). This case is no exception to that general rule. Because the losing party, appellant Cytyc Corporation (Cytyc), has failed to establish any legally cognizable basis for setting aside the arbitrators' award, we uphold the district court's order granting the confirmation motion filed by the prevailing party, appellee DEKA Products Limited Partnership (DEKA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc manufactures and sells a cervical cancer screening system. DEKA operates a commercial research and development laboratory. In the late 1980s, Cytyc endeavored to improve the accuracy of the traditional Pap smear test &#8212; a test that relies on technicians to prepare a microscope slide from each cervical cell sample and then review the specimen for irregularities. Due to human error, this methodology yields a relatively high incidence of false negatives. Cytyc proposed to solve that problem by using a computer imager to prescreen the slide specimens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the developmental phase of this project, Cytyc encountered a potentially insuperable obstacle: its imaging technology could accurately screen a thin, uniform layer of cells, but the slide specimens prepared by human technicians were often disuniform. Desirous of obtaining standardized slide specimens, Cytyc retained DEKA to create an automated process for transferring cells from a test sample onto a slide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DEKA successfully developed such a process (the ThinPrep system). This system consists of two components. The first is the ThinPrep processor &#8212; a machine that transfers the cells onto the slide. The processor utilizes technology patented by DEKA prior to its association with Cytyc. This body of knowledge is known as fluid management system (FMS) technology. The second component of the ThinPrep system is a set of four disposable accessories: a microscope slide, a sample collection device manufactured by a third party, a vial of Cytyc's patented preservative solution, and a filter cylinder invented specifically for use in the ThinPrep system. While the ThinPrep system employs a number of products and processes, its sine qua non is the FMS technology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March of 1993, Cytyc and DEKA entered into a licensing agreement (the Agreement) relative to the ThinPrep system. The Agreement recited that DEKA, by means of the FMS technology, had developed a \"method and apparatus . . . to facilitate the preparation of slides for medical and laboratory purposes\" and wished to license the FMS technology to Cytyc for use in the ThinPrep system. In exchange for this license, Cytyc agreed to pay DEKA a royalty \"equal to One Percent. . . of the Net Sales of Products or Improvements\" covered by the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the Agreement divided royalty-bearing \"Products\" into two categories: \"Product Hardware\" and \"Product Disposables.\" \"Product Hardware\" meant, in effect, the ThinPrep processor (we do not dwell on this, as there is no dispute between the parties concerning royalty payments related to hardware). \"Product Disposables\" comprised \"any filter cylinder or similar disposable provided such disposable utilizes the Cytyc Technology, the FMS Technology or both.\" The Agreement noted somewhat cryptically that the term \"Product Disposable[s] presently includes [the filter cylinder].\" Although the ThinPrep system functioned well, Cytyc struggled to perfect its imaging technology. Finally, it began to market the ThinPrep system without the computer imager. At some point, Cytyc developed a special microscope slide for use in the ThinPrep system and started to sell it, along with the other three disposable accessories, in a single bundle called the ThinPrep kit. The ThinPrep kit became a rousing commercial success, and Cytyc emerged as a leader in the market for cervical cancer screening systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For some period of time, Cytyc made quarterly royalty payments to DEKA pursuant to the Agreement. In November of 2001, however, Cytyc notified DEKA of its belief that, for an earlier three-year period, it had calculated DEKA's royalties too generously. In staking out this position, Cytyc posited that the Agreement entitled DEKA to royalties only on sales of the filter cylinder and not on sales of the other three disposable accessories included in the ThinPrep kit. Cytyc further informed DEKA that, consistent with this reading of the Agreement, it had computed the royalties referable to filter cylinder sales in accordance with the relative cost of the kit components (the relative cost ratio method). DEKA disputed both Cytyc's overpayment claim and its method for figuring royalties. In DEKA's view, the Agreement required Cytyc to pay a flat one percent royalty on net sales of <i>all</i> disposable accessories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties attempted on at least two occasions to resolve their differences. At one such meeting, Cytyc's chief financial officer threatened that if DEKA continued to resist Cytyc's royalty calculation method, he would \"manipulate\" the cost data and suppress future royalties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement gave DEKA the right to commission an independent audit of Cytyc's books should questions arise about the amount of royalty payments due. When the parties' negotiations stalled, DEKA exercised this prerogative. The final audit report covered the period from January of 1996 through September of 2002. The auditors described Cytyc's relative cost ratio method of calculating royalties as \"unusual and uncommon\" and found that, even under this unorthodox approach, Cytyc had underpaid DEKA. The auditors further concluded that if the Agreement required the payment of royalties on the net sales of all disposable accessories contained in the ThinPrep kits, the amount of the underpayment would exceed $4,000,000 for the audit period alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement stipulated that disputes between the parties would be subject to binding arbitration. Armed with the audit report, DEKA served a demand for arbitration. It claimed, inter alia, that Cytyc had breached the Agreement by failing to pay royalties on the net sales of all the disposable accessories or, alternatively, by allocating royalties referable to the filter cylinder based on the relative cost ratio method.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A three-member arbitration panel held an evidentiary hearing that focused on the interpretation of the term \"Product Disposables\" and the appropriate method for calculating DEKA's royalties. The parties' positions were in sharp contrast. On the one hand, DEKA maintained that the term \"Product Disposables\" included any and all disposable accessories that used the Cytyc or FMS technology in the creation of a sample slide (a reading that, in effect, mandated the payment of royalties with respect to sales of all four disposable accessories bundled in the ThinPrep kit). DEKA also asserted that royalties should be gauged by the net sales, rather than the relative costs, of the kit components. On the other hand, Cytyc argued that the term \"Product Disposables\" covered only the filter cylinder, not the other three disposable accessories bundled in the ThinPrep kit, and that royalties should be computed by using the relative cost ratio method.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bolster its position, Cytyc proffered two kinds of adscititious evidence. The first was a set of three letters between the parties, exchanged prior to the execution of the Agreement, which purported to document an intent to exclude sales of Cytyc's preservative solution from DEKA's royalty base. The second comprised testimonial and documentary evidence suggesting that, over a period of years, Cytyc had disclosed its use of the relative cost ratio method to DEKA without eliciting any objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the conclusion of the hearing, one of the arbitrators died. In March of 2005, the remaining two arbitrators issued a partial final award (the PFA). The Agreement provided that New Hampshire law would be controlling and, in the PFA, the arbitrators ruled that the New Hampshire statute of limitations barred DEKA's breach of contract claim for periods prior to November 17, 2000. As to subsequent periods, the linchpin of the arbitrators' decision was a finding that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FMS Technology is a system; it is not a specific product. It is the operation of a system on certain components. In this particular situation the components are the four units . . .: the filter, the collection device, the vial and the slide. . . . [T]hese units . . . are worthless by themselves, but when put together and governed by this patented system, the FMS technology, [they] become[] enormously valuable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrators coupled this finding with two other findings: that the FMS technology was the \"key\" component of the ThinPrep system and that the four disposable accessories were \"integrated by design and function in order to work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After making these findings, the arbitrators addressed the contested contractual provision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase \"or similar disposable provided such disposable utilizes the Cytyc Technology, the FMS Technology or both\" cannot be read to be restricted to only the filter. The very next sentence, which reads \"Product Disposable[s] presently includes [the filter cylinder],\" must mean that the term \"Disposables\" includes the other disposables in the Kit and any improvements or modifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In line with this parsing of the Agreement's text, the arbitrators determined that Cytyc's relative cost ratio method for figuring royalties was \"contrary to the [A]greement\" and that \"the parties never intended that royalties would be paid on parts of the Kit rather tha[n] the Kit as a whole.\" Based on these serial determinations and the plain language of the Agreement, the arbitrators concluded that the term \"Product Disposables\" covered all four of the disposable accessories bundled in the ThinPrep kit and, accordingly, that the Agreement entitled DEKA to royalties on the proceeds derived from the net sales of the kits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the PFA resolved the central issues in dispute, the panel believed that it could not make an accurate calculation of DEKA's damages on the record as it stood. Consequently, the arbitrators ordered the parties to submit proposed damage computations within twenty-five days and authorized them to supplement the record to the extent necessary to buttress these computations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties submitted widely disparate damage estimates. In large part, that disparity arose because Cytyc claimed a right to offset DEKA's royalties by deducting commissions allegedly paid on the sales of ThinPrep products, whereas DEKA argued that, in the language of the Agreement, Cytyc was entitled to deduct only those commissions that were \"actually stated on a customer invoice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their ensuing final award, the arbitrators once again sided with DEKA. They found that \"[t]he only customer invoices in the record are devoid of any . . . statement of commissions.\" Largely for that reason, the arbitrators' final award set DEKA's damages in the amount of $7,524,168, plus interest of $563,645 &#8212; amounts that pretty much tracked what the panel characterized as the \"persuasive\" calculations made by DEKA's accountants. The arbitrators also ordered Cytyc to bear the expenses of both the audit and the arbitration, and to reimburse DEKA $1,000,000 for attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having lost at virtually every turn, Cytyc asked the district court to vacate the arbitral award. DEKA cross-moved for confirmation of the award. Ruling ore sponte, the district court rejected Cytyc's importunings and granted DEKA's motion. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Cytyc asseverates that the arbitrators (i) neglected to interpret the Agreement or, alternatively, devised an interpretation that was unfounded in reason and fact (and, thus, that failed to draw its essence from the Agreement); (ii) manifestly disregarded applicable New Hampshire law; and (iii) refused to consider material evidence referable to the issue of damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After limning the applicable standard of review, we address each of these asseverations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Standard of Review.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an action to vacate or confirm an arbitral award, we typically review the district court's decision de novo.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g., Supervalu,</i> 212 F.3d at 65. The authority of a federal court to disturb an arbitration award is tightly circumscribed. While the award must \"draw its essence from the contract\" that underlies the arbitration proceeding, courts will deem that benchmark achieved as long as the arbitrators are \"even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of [their] authority.\" <i>United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc.,</i> 484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987). That a reviewing court is convinced that the arbitrators committed error &#8212; even serious error &#8212; does not justify setting aside the arbitral decision. <i>Id.</i> This remains true whether the arbitrators' apparent error concerns a matter of law or a matter of fact. <i>Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy,</i> 914 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of this means, however, that arbitral awards are utterly impregnable. Although courts \"do not sit to hear claims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator as an appellate court does in reviewing decisions of lower courts,\" <i>Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 38, 108 S.Ct. 364, there are nevertheless a few exceptions to the general rule that arbitrators have the last word. One set of exceptions is codified in the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The operative provision, section 10(a) of the FAA,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> authorizes vacatur only in cases of \"specified misconduct or misbehavior on the arbitrators' part, actions in excess of arbitral powers, or failures to consummate the award.\" <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second set of exceptions flows from the federal courts' inherent power to vacate arbitral awards. <i>See id.</i> This authority is very narrow. One manifestation of it, usually (but not exclusively) associated with labor arbitration, arises when an award contravenes the plain language of the applicable contract. <i>See Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson,</i> 229 F.3d 321, 330-31 (1st Cir.2000) (recognizing the applicability of this principle outside the labor context). Another manifestation arises in those rare cases in which it is clear from the record that the arbitrators cavalierly disregarded applicable law. <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, let us make one thing perfectly clear. Despite the existence of these exceptions, great deference remains the general mode of approach to judicial review of arbitral awards. <i>Id.</i> at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Merits.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to Cytyc's asseverational array.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Misinterpretation of the Agreement.</i> Cytyc's most bruited contention is that the panel neglected to offer any interpretation of the text of the Agreement or, alternatively, that the panel's interpretation of the term \"Product Disposables\" is unfounded in reason and fact (and thus, in either event, that the arbitral award fails to draw its essence from the Agreement). If either part of that binary charge were correct, vacation would be an appropriate remedy. <i>See Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 38, 108 S.Ct. 364. Cytyc, however, has failed to carry its heavy burden of substantiating the charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc's claim that the panel neglected to interpret the Agreement is jejune. We must uphold the arbitrators' decision as long as they were even \"arguably\" construing the Agreement. <i>Id.</i> That standard is abundantly satisfied here. The panel's decision (portions of which are quoted above) makes manifest that the arbitrators pondered the pertinent language of the Agreement and construed that language in accordance with the parties' discernible intent. That is contract interpretation, pure and simple. <i>See Robbins v. Salem Radiology,</i> 145 N.H. 415, 764 A.2d 885, 887 (2000) (holding that, in reviewing a contract, a court must give the language \"the interpretation that best reflects the parties' intentions\" at the time of contracting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc's more robust claim is that the arbitrators' interpretation of the Agreement was flawed. Even under the highly deferential standard that constrains judicial review of arbitral awards, the moving party may establish entitlement to vacation of an arbitral award on a persuasive showing that the arbitrators' interpretation is contrary to the plain language of the contract. <i>Bull HN Info. Sys.,</i> 229 F.3d at 330-31; <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 9. This configuration requires the movant to demonstrate that the award is \"(1) unfounded in reason and fact; (2) based on reasoning so palpably faulty that no judge, or group of judges, ever could conceivably have made such a ruling; or (3) mistakenly based on a crucial assumption that is concededly a non-fact.\" <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 8-9 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the plain language of the Agreement, when coupled with the arbitrators' factual findings, easily sustains the interpretation upon which the award rests. The Agreement defines \"Product Disposables\" as \"any filter cylinder or similar disposable provided such disposable utilizes the Cytyc Technology, the FMS Technology or both.\" In what necessarily amounted to an explication of this provision, the panel supportably found that the FMS technology pervades the entire ThinPrep system and that the four disposable accessories are \"systematically integrated\" into that system \"by design and function.\" With certain exceptions (none relevant here), we are duty-bound to give effect to an arbitrator's findings of fact. <i>Mercy Hosp., Inc. v. Mass. Nurses Ass'n,</i> 429 F.3d 338, 344 (1st Cir.2005). Doing so, we hold that the panel's finding that the term \"any similar disposable [which] utilizes the Cytyc [or] FMS Technology\" captures all the disposable accessories in the ThinPrep kit was not plainly erroneous, much less so unfounded in reason and fact as to justify judicial correction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc's contrary argument relies heavily on correspondence which, it maintains, establishes the parties' shared intention to include only sales of filter cylinders in DEKA's royalty base. These letters cannot carry the weight that Cytyc loads upon them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the arbitrators' interpretation &#8212; with or without the letters &#8212; does not appear to be strained or chimercial. By its terms, the Agreement did not exclude any disposable accessory from the definition of \"Product Disposables\" and DEKA presented evidence that, early in the parties' course of dealing, Cytyc included the sales of <i>all</i> the disposable accessories in DEKA's royalty base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the letters, even if taken at face value, are far from dispositive. This is especially so since DEKA adduced evidence that any informal agreement to exclude sales of the preservative solution from the royalty base only covered sales of the solution <i>unrelated</i> to the ThinPrep system. This proof comported with documentation indicating that, at the time the parties executed the Agreement, Cytyc had not decided whether to sell the filter cylinder individually or in combination with the other disposable accessories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, Cytyc asks us to draw an inference, based on nothing more than the panel's omission of any direct reference, that the arbitrators neglected to consider the letters. This is whistling past the graveyard. Arbitrators are not required to provide particularized reasons for their decisions. <i>See Raytheon Co. v. Automated Bus. Sys., Inc.,</i> 882 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1989). It follows that an arbitrator's failure to comment upon a specific piece of evidence cannot support an inference that he failed to consider it. <i>See Nat'l Cas. Co. v. First State Ins. Group,</i> 430 F.3d 492, 498-99 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and finally, the parties exchanged the correspondence in question months before the execution of the Agreement. When signed, the Agreement itself not only omitted any mention of excluding sales of Cytyc's preservative solution from DEKA's royalty base but also contained an integration clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Under such circumstances, the arbitrators were not compelled to use the letters to vary the apparent meaning of the Agreement. <i>Cf. Richey v. Leighton,</i> 137 N.H. 661, 632 A.2d 1215, 1217 (1993) (holding that even where a contract is not completely integrated, \"parol evidence is admissible only to prove unexpressed terms that are not inconsistent with the writing\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Refined to bare essence, Cytyc's argument reduces to a frontal attack on the merits of the arbitral award. Such an attack is easily repulsed. It was the province of the arbitrators to scrutinize the language of the Agreement, weigh the conflicting evidence of the parties' intentions, and determine the dimensions of DEKA's royalty base. <i>See Major League Baseball Players Ass'n v. Garvey,</i> 532 U.S. 504, 509-10, 121 S.Ct. 1724, 149 L.Ed.2d 740 (2001). Cytyc has advanced no sound justification for us to tamper with the arbitrators' resolution of those issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Manifest Disregard of the Law.</i> An arbitrator, of course, cannot intentionally flout the law. <i>See First Options of Chi., Inc. v. Kaplan,</i> 514 U.S. 938, 942, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995); <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 9. In its second assignment of arbitral error, Cytyc tries to repackage its misinterpretation claim as a manifest disregard of the law claim. It begins by citing evidence that, for a period of years, DEKA never objected to Cytyc's calculation of royalties in accordance with the relative cost ratio method. It then points to a New Hampshire statute providing that, with respect to contract interpretation, \"any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement.\" N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 382-A:2-208(1). With this foundation in place, it blithely asserts that the panel must have disregarded the statute. This assertion lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party seeking to establish manifest disregard of the law sufficient to warrant setting aside an arbitral award must demonstrate that the arbitrators appreciated the existence and applicability of a controlling legal rule but intentionally decided not to apply it. <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 10. This tenet demands \"some showing in the record, other than the result obtained, that the arbitrators knew the law and expressly disregarded it.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case contains no evidence that the panel appreciated the applicability of the New Hampshire statute and willfully ignored it. Indeed, it is hopelessly unclear whether this provision, which appears in New Hampshire's version of Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, governs agreements to license patented intellectual property. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 382-A:2-102 (stating that \"this Article applies to transactions in goods\"). Given these deficiencies in Cytyc's proffer, the arbitral award cannot be said to have been rendered in manifest disregard of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Failure to Consider Material Evidence.</i> In a last-ditch effort to salvage its appeal, Cytyc takes issue with the arbitrators' refusal to discount DEKA's damage award by the amount of commissions allegedly paid on the sales of ThinPrep products. Specifically, Cytyc avers that the panel failed to allow it to introduce material evidence anent the deductibility of these commissions and, thus, that the award must fail under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(3) (authorizing vacatur when arbitrators are \"guilty of misconduct . . . in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc's argument is vecordious. Notwithstanding ample opportunity during the evidentiary hearing and before the issuance of the PFA, Cytyc failed to produce any evidence relating to the payment or deductibility of sales commissions. To cinch matters, the panel afforded the parties a twenty-five day window after announcing the PFA within which to augment the record with evidence pertaining to the computation of damages. During that period, DEKA specifically requested Cytyc to furnish \"appropriate documentation\" substantiating its supposed payment of commissions and warned that it would ask the arbitrators to disallow any commission not \"actually stated on a customer invoice by Cytyc or [its] affiliates,\" as required by the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc spurned the opportunity afforded by the arbitrators and turned a deaf ear to DEKA's warning; it produced neither a single invoice reflecting a commission nor a shred of evidence concerning the propriety of deducting unstated commissions. Given these missed opportunities, Cytyc cannot now be heard to complain that the panel followed the letter of the Agreement, refused to consider non-existent extrinsic evidence, and rejected Cytyc's damage computation. Arbitrators are, after all, not expected to be mind readers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we hold that Cytyc has failed to identify any legally cognizable basis for vacating the arbitral award. Accordingly, we uphold the district court's order of confirmation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In its opening brief, Cytyc hinted at additional challenges based on the untimely death of the third panel member, the interest calculation, and the award of attorneys' fees.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc manufactures and sells a cervical cancer screening system. DEKA operates a commercial research and development laboratory. In the late 1980s, Cytyc endeavored to improve the accuracy of the traditional Pap smear test &#8212; a test that relies on technicians to prepare a microscope slide from each cervical cell sample and then review the specimen for irregularities. Due to human error, this methodology yields a relatively high incidence of false negatives. Cytyc proposed to solve that problem by using a computer imager to prescreen the slide specimens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the developmental phase of this project, Cytyc encountered a potentially insuperable obstacle: its imaging technology could accurately screen a thin, uniform layer of cells, but the slide specimens prepared by human technicians were often disuniform. Desirous of obtaining standardized slide specimens, Cytyc retained DEKA to create an automated process for transferring cells from a test sample onto a slide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DEKA successfully developed such a process (the ThinPrep system). This system consists of two components. The first is the ThinPrep processor &#8212; a machine that transfers the cells onto the slide. The processor utilizes technology patented by DEKA prior to its association with Cytyc. This body of knowledge is known as fluid management system (FMS) technology. The second component of the ThinPrep system is a set of four disposable accessories: a microscope slide, a sample collection device manufactured by a third party, a vial of Cytyc's patented preservative solution, and a filter cylinder invented specifically for use in the ThinPrep system. While the ThinPrep system employs a number of products and processes, its sine qua non is the FMS technology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March of 1993, Cytyc and DEKA entered into a licensing agreement (the Agreement) relative to the ThinPrep system. The Agreement recited that DEKA, by means of the FMS technology, had developed a \"method and apparatus . . . to facilitate the preparation of slides for medical and laboratory purposes\" and wished to license the FMS technology to Cytyc for use in the ThinPrep system. In exchange for this license, Cytyc agreed to pay DEKA a royalty \"equal to One Percent. . . of the Net Sales of Products or Improvements\" covered by the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the Agreement divided royalty-bearing \"Products\" into two categories: \"Product Hardware\" and \"Product Disposables.\" \"Product Hardware\" meant, in effect, the ThinPrep processor (we do not dwell on this, as there is no dispute between the parties concerning royalty payments related to hardware). \"Product Disposables\" comprised \"any filter cylinder or similar disposable provided such disposable utilizes the Cytyc Technology, the FMS Technology or both.\" The Agreement noted somewhat cryptically that the term \"Product Disposable[s] presently includes [the filter cylinder].\" Although the ThinPrep system functioned well, Cytyc struggled to perfect its imaging technology. Finally, it began to market the ThinPrep system without the computer imager. At some point, Cytyc developed a special microscope slide for use in the ThinPrep system and started to sell it, along with the other three disposable accessories, in a single bundle called the ThinPrep kit. The ThinPrep kit became a rousing commercial success, and Cytyc emerged as a leader in the market for cervical cancer screening systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For some period of time, Cytyc made quarterly royalty payments to DEKA pursuant to the Agreement. In November of 2001, however, Cytyc notified DEKA of its belief that, for an earlier three-year period, it had calculated DEKA's royalties too generously. In staking out this position, Cytyc posited that the Agreement entitled DEKA to royalties only on sales of the filter cylinder and not on sales of the other three disposable accessories included in the ThinPrep kit. Cytyc further informed DEKA that, consistent with this reading of the Agreement, it had computed the royalties referable to filter cylinder sales in accordance with the relative cost of the kit components (the relative cost ratio method). DEKA disputed both Cytyc's overpayment claim and its method for figuring royalties. In DEKA's view, the Agreement required Cytyc to pay a flat one percent royalty on net sales of <i>all</i> disposable accessories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties attempted on at least two occasions to resolve their differences. At one such meeting, Cytyc's chief financial officer threatened that if DEKA continued to resist Cytyc's royalty calculation method, he would \"manipulate\" the cost data and suppress future royalties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement gave DEKA the right to commission an independent audit of Cytyc's books should questions arise about the amount of royalty payments due. When the parties' negotiations stalled, DEKA exercised this prerogative. The final audit report covered the period from January of 1996 through September of 2002. The auditors described Cytyc's relative cost ratio method of calculating royalties as \"unusual and uncommon\" and found that, even under this unorthodox approach, Cytyc had underpaid DEKA. The auditors further concluded that if the Agreement required the payment of royalties on the net sales of all disposable accessories contained in the ThinPrep kits, the amount of the underpayment would exceed $4,000,000 for the audit period alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement stipulated that disputes between the parties would be subject to binding arbitration. Armed with the audit report, DEKA served a demand for arbitration. It claimed, inter alia, that Cytyc had breached the Agreement by failing to pay royalties on the net sales of all the disposable accessories or, alternatively, by allocating royalties referable to the filter cylinder based on the relative cost ratio method.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A three-member arbitration panel held an evidentiary hearing that focused on the interpretation of the term \"Product Disposables\" and the appropriate method for calculating DEKA's royalties. The parties' positions were in sharp contrast. On the one hand, DEKA maintained that the term \"Product Disposables\" included any and all disposable accessories that used the Cytyc or FMS technology in the creation of a sample slide (a reading that, in effect, mandated the payment of royalties with respect to sales of all four disposable accessories bundled in the ThinPrep kit). DEKA also asserted that royalties should be gauged by the net sales, rather than the relative costs, of the kit components. On the other hand, Cytyc argued that the term \"Product Disposables\" covered only the filter cylinder, not the other three disposable accessories bundled in the ThinPrep kit, and that royalties should be computed by using the relative cost ratio method.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bolster its position, Cytyc proffered two kinds of adscititious evidence. The first was a set of three letters between the parties, exchanged prior to the execution of the Agreement, which purported to document an intent to exclude sales of Cytyc's preservative solution from DEKA's royalty base. The second comprised testimonial and documentary evidence suggesting that, over a period of years, Cytyc had disclosed its use of the relative cost ratio method to DEKA without eliciting any objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the conclusion of the hearing, one of the arbitrators died. In March of 2005, the remaining two arbitrators issued a partial final award (the PFA). The Agreement provided that New Hampshire law would be controlling and, in the PFA, the arbitrators ruled that the New Hampshire statute of limitations barred DEKA's breach of contract claim for periods prior to November 17, 2000. As to subsequent periods, the linchpin of the arbitrators' decision was a finding that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FMS Technology is a system; it is not a specific product. It is the operation of a system on certain components. In this particular situation the components are the four units . . .: the filter, the collection device, the vial and the slide. . . . [T]hese units . . . are worthless by themselves, but when put together and governed by this patented system, the FMS technology, [they] become[] enormously valuable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrators coupled this finding with two other findings: that the FMS technology was the \"key\" component of the ThinPrep system and that the four disposable accessories were \"integrated by design and function in order to work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After making these findings, the arbitrators addressed the contested contractual provision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase \"or similar disposable provided such disposable utilizes the Cytyc Technology, the FMS Technology or both\" cannot be read to be restricted to only the filter. The very next sentence, which reads \"Product Disposable[s] presently includes [the filter cylinder],\" must mean that the term \"Disposables\" includes the other disposables in the Kit and any improvements or modifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In line with this parsing of the Agreement's text, the arbitrators determined that Cytyc's relative cost ratio method for figuring royalties was \"contrary to the [A]greement\" and that \"the parties never intended that royalties would be paid on parts of the Kit rather tha[n] the Kit as a whole.\" Based on these serial determinations and the plain language of the Agreement, the arbitrators concluded that the term \"Product Disposables\" covered all four of the disposable accessories bundled in the ThinPrep kit and, accordingly, that the Agreement entitled DEKA to royalties on the proceeds derived from the net sales of the kits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the PFA resolved the central issues in dispute, the panel believed that it could not make an accurate calculation of DEKA's damages on the record as it stood. Consequently, the arbitrators ordered the parties to submit proposed damage computations within twenty-five days and authorized them to supplement the record to the extent necessary to buttress these computations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties submitted widely disparate damage estimates. In large part, that disparity arose because Cytyc claimed a right to offset DEKA's royalties by deducting commissions allegedly paid on the sales of ThinPrep products, whereas DEKA argued that, in the language of the Agreement, Cytyc was entitled to deduct only those commissions that were \"actually stated on a customer invoice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their ensuing final award, the arbitrators once again sided with DEKA. They found that \"[t]he only customer invoices in the record are devoid of any . . . statement of commissions.\" Largely for that reason, the arbitrators' final award set DEKA's damages in the amount of $7,524,168, plus interest of $563,645 &#8212; amounts that pretty much tracked what the panel characterized as the \"persuasive\" calculations made by DEKA's accountants. The arbitrators also ordered Cytyc to bear the expenses of both the audit and the arbitration, and to reimburse DEKA $1,000,000 for attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having lost at virtually every turn, Cytyc asked the district court to vacate the arbitral award. DEKA cross-moved for confirmation of the award. Ruling ore sponte, the district court rejected Cytyc's importunings and granted DEKA's motion. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Cytyc asseverates that the arbitrators (i) neglected to interpret the Agreement or, alternatively, devised an interpretation that was unfounded in reason and fact (and, thus, that failed to draw its essence from the Agreement); (ii) manifestly disregarded applicable New Hampshire law; and (iii) refused to consider material evidence referable to the issue of damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After limning the applicable standard of review, we address each of these asseverations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Standard of Review.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an action to vacate or confirm an arbitral award, we typically review the district court's decision de novo.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g., Supervalu,</i> 212 F.3d at 65. The authority of a federal court to disturb an arbitration award is tightly circumscribed.

One set of exceptions is codified in the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The operative provision, section 10(a) of the FAA,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> authorizes vacatur only in cases of \"specified misconduct or misbehavior on the arbitrators' part, actions in excess of arbitral powers, or failures to consummate the award.\" <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second set of exceptions flows from the federal courts' inherent power to vacate arbitral awards. <i>See id.</i> This authority is very narrow. One manifestation of it, usually (but not exclusively) associated with labor arbitration, arises when an award contravenes the plain language of the applicable contract. <i>See Bull HN Info.

Another manifestation arises in those rare cases in which it is clear from the record that the arbitrators cavalierly disregarded applicable law. <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, let us make one thing perfectly clear.

If either part of that binary charge were correct, vacation would be an appropriate remedy. <i>See Misco,</i> 484 U.S. at 38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111965\"><a href=\"/opinion/111965/paperworkers-v-misco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Cytyc, however, has failed to carry its heavy burden of substantiating the charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc's claim that the panel neglected to interpret the Agreement is jejune. We must uphold the arbitrators' decision as long as they were even \"arguably\" construing the Agreement. <i>Id.</i> That standard is abundantly satisfied here. The panel's decision (portions of which are quoted above) makes manifest that the arbitrators pondered the pertinent language of the Agreement and construed that language in accordance with the parties' discernible intent. That is contract interpretation, pure and simple. <i>See Robbins v. Salem Radiology,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></span>, 887 (2000) (holding that, in reviewing a contract, a court must give the language \"the interpretation that best reflects the parties' intentions\" at the time of contracting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc's more robust claim is that the arbitrators' interpretation of the Agreement was flawed. Even under the highly deferential standard that constrains judicial review of arbitral awards, the moving party may establish entitlement to vacation of an arbitral award on a persuasive showing that the arbitrators' interpretation is contrary to the plain language of the contract. <i>Bull HN Info. Sys.,</i> 229 F.3d at 330-31; <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 9. This configuration requires the movant to demonstrate that the award is \"(1) unfounded in reason and fact; (2) based on reasoning so palpably faulty that no judge, or group of judges, ever could conceivably have made such a ruling; or (3) mistakenly based on a crucial assumption that is concededly a non-fact.\" <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 8-9 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the plain language of the Agreement, when coupled with the arbitrators' factual findings, easily sustains the interpretation upon which the award rests. The Agreement defines \"Product Disposables\" as \"any filter cylinder or similar disposable provided such disposable utilizes the Cytyc Technology, the FMS Technology or both.\" In what necessarily amounted to an explication of this provision, the panel supportably found that the FMS technology pervades the entire ThinPrep system and that the four disposable accessories are \"systematically integrated\" into that system \"by design and function.\" With certain exceptions (none relevant here), we are duty-bound to give effect to an arbitrator's findings of fact. <i>Mercy Hosp., Inc. v. Mass. Nurses Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201930\"><a href=\"/opinion/201930/mercy-hospital-inc-v-massachusetts-nurses/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span>, 344 (1st Cir.2005). Doing so, we hold that the panel's finding that the term \"any similar disposable [which] utilizes the Cytyc [or] FMS Technology\" captures all the disposable accessories in the ThinPrep kit was not plainly erroneous, much less so unfounded in reason and fact as to justify judicial correction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc's contrary argument relies heavily on correspondence which, it maintains, establishes the parties' shared intention to include only sales of filter cylinders in DEKA's royalty base. These letters cannot carry the weight that Cytyc loads upon them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the arbitrators' interpretation &#8212; with or without the letters &#8212; does not appear to be strained or chimercial. By its terms, the Agreement did not exclude any disposable accessory from the definition of \"Product Disposables\" and DEKA presented evidence that, early in the parties' course of dealing, Cytyc included the sales of <i>all</i> the disposable accessories in DEKA's royalty base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the letters, even if taken at face value, are far from dispositive. This is especially so since DEKA adduced evidence that any informal agreement to exclude sales of the preservative solution from the royalty base only covered sales of the solution <i>unrelated</i> to the ThinPrep system. This proof comported with documentation indicating that, at the time the parties executed the Agreement, Cytyc had not decided whether to sell the filter cylinder individually or in combination with the other disposable accessories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, Cytyc asks us to draw an inference, based on nothing more than the panel's omission of any direct reference, that the arbitrators neglected to consider the letters. This is whistling past the graveyard. Arbitrators are not required to provide particularized reasons for their decisions. <i>See Raytheon Co. v. Automated Bus. Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527574\"><a href=\"/opinion/527574/raytheon-company-v-automated-business-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1989). It follows that an arbitrator's failure to comment upon a specific piece of evidence cannot support an inference that he failed to consider it. <i>See Nat'l Cas. Co. v. First State Ins. Group,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201945\"><a href=\"/opinion/201945/national-casualty-co-v-first-state-insuranc/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 498-99 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and finally, the parties exchanged the correspondence in question months before the execution of the Agreement. When signed, the Agreement itself not only omitted any mention of excluding sales of Cytyc's preservative solution from DEKA's royalty base but also contained an integration clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Under such circumstances, the arbitrators were not compelled to use the letters to vary the apparent meaning of the Agreement. <i>Cf. Richey v. Leighton,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></span>, 1217 (1993) (holding that even where a contract is not completely integrated, \"parol evidence is admissible only to prove unexpressed terms that are not inconsistent with the writing\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Refined to bare essence, Cytyc's argument reduces to a frontal attack on the merits of the arbitral award. Such an attack is easily repulsed. It was the province of the arbitrators to scrutinize the language of the Agreement, weigh the conflicting evidence of the parties' intentions, and determine the dimensions of DEKA's royalty base. <i>See Major League Baseball Players Ass'n v.

In its second assignment of arbitral error, Cytyc tries to repackage its misinterpretation claim as a manifest disregard of the law claim. It begins by citing evidence that, for a period of years, DEKA never objected to Cytyc's calculation of royalties in accordance with the relative cost ratio method. It then points to a New Hampshire statute providing that, with respect to contract interpretation, \"any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement.\" N.H.Rev.Stat.

Ann. &#167; 382-A:2-102 (stating that \"this Article applies to transactions in goods\"). Given these deficiencies in Cytyc's proffer, the arbitral award cannot be said to have been rendered in manifest disregard of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Failure to Consider Material Evidence.</i> In a last-ditch effort to salvage its appeal, Cytyc takes issue with the arbitrators' refusal to discount DEKA's damage award by the amount of commissions allegedly paid on the sales of ThinPrep products. Specifically, Cytyc avers that the panel failed to allow it to introduce material evidence anent the deductibility of these commissions and, thus, that the award must fail under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(3) (authorizing vacatur when arbitrators are \"guilty of misconduct . . . in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc's argument is vecordious. Notwithstanding ample opportunity during the evidentiary hearing and before the issuance of the PFA, Cytyc failed to produce any evidence relating to the payment or deductibility of sales commissions. To cinch matters, the panel afforded the parties a twenty-five day window after announcing the PFA within which to augment the record with evidence pertaining to the computation of damages. During that period, DEKA specifically requested Cytyc to furnish \"appropriate documentation\" substantiating its supposed payment of commissions and warned that it would ask the arbitrators to disallow any commission not \"actually stated on a customer invoice by Cytyc or [its] affiliates,\" as required by the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cytyc spurned the opportunity afforded by the arbitrators and turned a deaf ear to DEKA's warning; it produced neither a single invoice reflecting a commission nor a shred of evidence concerning the propriety of deducting unstated commissions. Given these missed opportunities, Cytyc cannot now be heard to complain that the panel followed the letter of the Agreement, refused to consider non-existent extrinsic evidence, and rejected Cytyc's damage computation. Arbitrators are, after all, not expected to be mind readers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.
