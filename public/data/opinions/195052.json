In  this appeal,  claimant\n                               \n\nClaire  Soule seeks  costs and  attorneys'  fees incurred  in\n\nrecovering $2450 in cash which  was seized in a drug raid  on\n\nher home.  We affirm the denial of costs and fees,  though we\n\ndo  so on  grounds different  from those  relied upon  by the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n          FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS1\n          FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\n                                                  \n\n          During July of 1988, United States Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration  (DEA) agents  received information  that 1500\n\npounds of marijuana were to  be delivered to Jeffrey Soule at\n\n255 Broadway in Hanover, Massachusetts.  A local police check\n\nrevealed that a John Jeffrey  Soule resided in nearby Carver,\n\nMassachusetts,  but that his mother lived  at 255 Broadway in\n\nHanover.\n\n          On the evening of July 23, 1988, after local police\n\nand DEA  agents observed  the delivery  of  marijuana to  255\n\nBroadway, search warrants were obtained for the premises.  At\n\n4:30  a.m. the following morning, local and federal officials\n\nexecuted the warrants.  The search revealed, inter alia:  (1)\n                                                       \n\napproximately 1600 pounds of marijuana in a barn adjacent  to\n\nthe house; (2) $874,510 in cash found in a box in a closet on\n\nthe first  floor of  the house; (3)  461.8 grams  of cocaine,\n\n                    \n\n1.  For a more  detailed version of the factual background in\nthis case,  see United States  v. 255 Broadway, 795  F. Supp.\n                                              \n1225 (D.

Only this\n\nlast item is at issue in this appeal.\n\n          On  April  17,  1989, John  Jeffrey  Soule  pleaded\n\nguilty  to charges  of conspiracy  to  possess marijuana  and\n\npossession  of marijuana with  intent to distribute.   On May\n\n25, 1989, less  than one month later, the  government filed a\n\ncomplaint for  forfeiture in  rem  of, inter  alia, the  cash\n                                                  \n\nproceeds found  in the  search of Claire  Soule's home.2   On\n\nJune 1, 1989, at the government's request, the district court\n\nissued a  warrant and  monition for, inter  alia, all  of the\n                                                \n\n                    \n\n2.  21  U.S.C. 881(a)(6) states  that the following  shall be\nsubject to forfeiture:\n\n          All moneys, negotiable instruments, securities\n     or other things  of value furnished or  intended to\n     be  furnished by  any  person  in  exchange  for  a\n     controlled   substance   in   violation   of   this\n     subchapter,  all  proceeds  traceable  to  such  an\n     exchange, and  all moneys,  negotiable instruments,\n     and  securities  used  or intended  to  be  used to\n     facilitate any violation of this subchapter, except\n     that  no property  shall  be  forfeited under  this\n     paragraph,  to the  extent of  the  interest of  an\n     owner, by reason of any act or omission established\n     by that  owner to  have been  committed or  omitted\n     without knowledge or consent of that owner.\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\nseized cash.3   Claire Soule  responded on June 14,  1989, by\n\nfiling a notice of claim for the money found in the envelopes\n\nin the dining room hutch.     On September 6, 1989, a default\n\njudgment  of forfeiture  was  entered  against  the  lots  of\n\n$874,510,  $26,500 and  $5310.4   On  February 13,  1991, the\n\ndistrict court  held a  hearing at  which the government  was\n\nasked to show probable cause  for the forfeiture of the money\n\nfound  in  the five  envelopes  inside  the  hutch.   At  the\n\nconclusion of the hearing, the district  court found that the\n\ngovernment had failed  to show probable cause  for forfeiture\n\nof  that money,  and  awarded  $2450 to  Claire  Soule.   The\n\ngovernment  moved immediately for a certificate of reasonable\n\ncause pursuant to  28 U.S.C.   2465,  so as not to  be liable\n\nfor   costs.5    Claire  Soule  opposed   the  motion  for  a\n\n                    \n\n3.  21  U.S.C.     881(b) provides,  in  relevant  part, that\n\"[a]ny  property subject to  forfeiture to the  United States\nunder this subchapter may be  seized by the Attorney  General\nupon  process issued pursuant  to the Supplemental  Rules for\nCertain  Admiralty and  Maritime Claims.\"    The  warrant and\nmonition   in  this  case   was  issued  pursuant   to  these\nSupplemental   Rules.      See,  e.g.,   United   States   v.\n                                                        \nApproximately Two  Thousand, Five Hundred  Thirty-Eight Point\n                                                             \nEighty-Five Shares of Stock, 988 F.2d 1281, 1283-84 (1st Cir.\n                           \n1993).\n\n4.  Though  the appellate record  is not entirely  clear, the\n$3171 found in  the leather bag appears to  have been subject\nto administrative, rather than judicial, forfeiture.\n\n5.  28 U.S.C.   2465 provides:\n\n          Upon the entry of judgment for the claimant in\n     any  proceeding  to  condemn  or  forfeit  property\n     seized under  any  Act of  Congress, such  property\n     shall  be returned forthwith to the claimant or his\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\ncertificate of  reasonable cause  and sought  attorneys' fees\n\nunder the Equal Access to  Justice Act (hereinafter EAJA), 28\n\nU.S.C.     2412,6  for expenses  incurred  in  recovering the\n\n$2450.  The  district court granted the  government's request\n\nfor the certificate of reasonable cause and denied claimant's\n\nrequest for attorneys' fees.   \n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          We begin  by noting that  \"we are free to  affirm a\n\ndistrict  court's decision  on any  ground  supported in  the\n\nrecord even if the issue  was not pleaded, tried or otherwise\n\nreferred to in the proceedings below.\"  De Casenave v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 991  F.2d 11, 12  n.2 (1st Cir. 1993)  (citations and\n      \n\ninternal quotations  omitted).   In this  case, although  the\n\ndistrict  court  misapplied   the  statutory  burden-shifting\n\nscheme   applicable  to   federal   forfeiture  actions,   we\n\nnonetheless affirm its denial of costs and attorneys' fees.\n\n                    \n\n     agent;  but if it appears that there was reasonable\n     cause  for the  seizure, the  court  shall cause  a\n     proper  certificate thereof  to be entered  and the\n     claimant  shall not, in  such case, be  entitled to\n     costs, nor shall  the person who made  the seizure,\n     nor the prosecutor,  be liable to suit  or judgment\n     on account of such suit or prosecution. \n\n6.  28  U.S.C.    2412(d)(1)(A) provides,  in relevant  part,\nthat \"a  court shall award  to a prevailing party  other than\nthe United States  fees and other  expenses . . .  unless the\ncourt finds  that  the  position of  the  United  States  was\nsubstantially justified or that special circumstances make an\naward unjust.\"\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nA.    The Statutory  Scheme:    Probable  Cause to  Institute\n                                                             \nForfeiture Proceedings\n                      \n\n          In  a forfeiture action  brought under 21  U.S.C.  \n\n881, the allocation of the parties' burdens is provided by 19\n\nU.S.C.   1615.  See 21 U.S.C.   881(d); United States v. 1933\n                                                             \n\nCommonwealth Ave.,  913 F.2d 1,  3 (1st Cir. 1990).   Section\n                 \n\n1615 states, in relevant part,  that the \"the burden of proof\n\nshall be  upon the defendant:  Provided,  That probable cause\n                                       \n\nshall  be first  shown for  the institution  of such  suit or\n                                                             \n\naction,  to  be   judged  by  the  court\"   (second  emphasis\n      \n\nsupplied).  \n\n          In other words, under  section 1615, the government\n\nhas a preliminary  burden to show that it  had probable cause\n\nto  institute the forfeiture  proceeding.  See,  e.g., United\n                                                             \n\nStates  v. 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, 983 F.2d 670, 675\n                                          \n\n(5th  Cir.  1993) (affirming  district  court's finding  that\n\ngovernment  had  \"probable  cause to  institute  a forfeiture\n                                               \n\naction\") (emphasis  supplied); United  States v.

Once  the government has  made this showing,  the\n\nburden then shifts to the claimant to show by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that the property  at issue is not subject to\n\nforfeiture.  See, e.g., United  States v. 18 Oakwood St., 958\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Here, the district court did not assess whether the\n\ngovernment had probable  cause to institute  the proceedings.\n                                           \n\nRather, it improperly focused its inquiry on whether probable\n\ncause  existed on  the  date of  the  probable cause  hearing\n\nitself, and concluded  that no probable cause existed at that\n\ntime.  See United States v.  255 Broadway, 795 F. Supp. 1225,\n                                         \n\n1231-32 (D. Mass.  1992).  The record before  us makes clear,\n\nhowever, that on May 25, 1989, the date of the institution of\n                                                          \n\nforfeiture  proceedings, the government had probable cause to\n\nbelieve that the funds at issue were forfeitable.\n\nB.  The Existence of Probable Cause in this Case\n                                                \n\n          \"Probable   cause  to   forfeit  requires   only  a\n\n`reasonable ground for  belief of guilt[,] supported  by less\n\nthan prima facie proof but more than mere suspicion' that the\n\nproperty is  subject  to forfeiture.\"   United  States v.  28\n                                                             \n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\nEmery  St., 914  F.2d 1,  3 (1st  Cir. 1990)  (quoting United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. $250,000  in United States Currency,  808 F.2d 895,\n                                             \n\n897 (1st Cir. 1987)).

While  the district  court did  not\n\ndetermine  precisely what  Claire Soule's  answers  were that\n\nnight,   it  nonetheless  did   find  those  answers   to  be\n\n\"inconsistent,  indeed suspicious.\"   This  finding is  fully\n\nsupported by the record.7   Moreover, there were  1600 pounds\n\n                    \n\n7.  Agent  Lively of the DEA testified as follows with regard\nto Claire Soule's answers:\n\n          I had a concern as  to what this money [in the\n     envelopes] was  and I wanted to talk  to Mrs. Soule\n     concerning what it  was.  She agreed to  talk to us\n     about  the money.   And  myself  and Agent  Hayes--\n     Lieutenant  Hayes--talked  with  her.    Lieutenant\n     Hayes began the conversation with her by asking her\n     about  what the  money was.   And  she said  it was\n     money that was for a pool, which was fairly obvious\n     from the notation  on the envelope.   She was asked\n     how much  money  it was  and she  responded it  was\n     about $10,000. She was asked what the source of the\n     monies  were.   And her  first response was  it was\n     money from an  inheritance.  And I  believe I asked\n     her  who was  the inheritance  from,  what was  the\n     source of the inheritance, which person.  Her words\n     were, in effect, what difference does it that make?\n     And I told her, I said, \"I'm trying to determine if\n     this is your money or this is somebody else's money\n     or where this money came from.  If you  can tell me\n     what  the source  of the inheritance  is or  if you\n     have some probate document that shows you receiving\n     this kind  of money, you  know, help me out.\"   She\n     said,  \"Well, I  got the  money in  cash.\"   And my\n     response was  you usually  don't get  that kind  of\n     money from an estate in  cash, it comes in the form\n     of checks.   Her  response was,  \"Well, I also  got\n     monies  from  --  yes, for  my  birthday  and other\n     occasions.\" \n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\nof marijuana in the barn  adjacent to Claire Soule's house, a\n\nsizeable amount  of cocaine  in a safe  in the  basement, and\n\nover $900,000 in cash in the house.   Not only was there cash\n\nnear  the hutch in which the funds at issue were found, there\n\nwas also a bag containing $3171  found directly on top of the\n\nhutch.   Suspicious and contradictory answers in the presence\n\nof the large  quantities of cash and drugs  uncovered in this\n\nsearch are  certainly probative in determining  the existence\n\nof probable cause.\n\n          Equally important  is  the fact  that Claire  Soule\n\nmade  no  offers  of  proof,   either  before  or  after  the\n\ngovernment's   initiation  of   forfeiture  proceedings,   to\n\nsubstantiate  her  allegations  that   the  cash  came   from\n\nlegitimate sources.   Thus, even if Claire  Soule's responses\n\nhad  not  been  adjudged  \"suspicious,\"  her  denials  alone,\n\nunaccompanied  by offers of proof, were insufficient to rebut\n\na showing of  probable cause.  See, e.g.,  One Hundred Forty-\n                                                             \n\nNine  Thousand Four Hundred Forty-Two and 43/100 Dollars, 965\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  at 878 (\"We  conclude that claimants'  proffer of three\n\n`possible'  innocent sources of  income does not  vitiate the\n\ngovernment's  showing of a strong probability that the source\n\nof  the  money is  in  fact  illegal drug  activity.\");  1933\n                                                             \n\nCommonwealth Ave., 913  F.2d at 4 (finding  \"general denials\"\n                 \n\ninsufficient  to  overcome government's  showing  of probable\n\ncause).\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\n          Finally, it is undisputed  that Claire Soule's keys\n\nto a safe deposit  box were seized during  the drug raid  and\n\nthat she surreptitiously went to the bank just days after the\n\nsearch of  her home  and had  the  box drilled  open by  bank\n\nemployees so she could empty  it before it could be searched.\n\nThe government  was aware of  this act  at the  time that  it\n\ninstituted  forfeiture   proceedings.    Again,   while  such\n\nbehavior is far from determinative, we believe it relevant to\n\nthe probable cause determination.\n\n          Without  making   any  credibility   determinations\n\nbeyond those  made by  the district  court, and  while noting\n\nthat   none  of  these  factors  standing  alone  necessarily\n\nestablishes probable  cause, we find that these circumstances\n\ntaken as a whole support a finding that, on May 25, 1989, the\n\ndate  of  the  initiation   of  forfeiture  proceedings,  the\n\ngovernment had  probable  cause to  believe that  all of  the\n\nmoney seized  from 255 Broadway, including the money found in\n\nthe envelopes inside the hutch, was subject to forfeiture.\n\nC.  Adversarial Evidence and the Probable Cause Hearing\n                                                       \n\n          The  government   did  commit  serious   errors  in\n\nhandling the  cash found in and around  Claire Soule's dining\n\nroom hutch.   For example, initial notations by  a DEA agent,\n\nmade on  the envelopes themselves  on the night of  the raid,\n\nindicated  that the envelopes  contained the following:   one\n\n$10  bill, one-hundred and  fourteen $20 bills,  eighteen $50\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nbills and  eight $100  bills for a  total of  $3990.    About\n\nthree  days  later, forms  filed  by  the same  agent  showed\n\nstartlingly  different  denominations.    These  later  forms\n\nstated that the envelopes seized from the hutch contained one\n\n$10  bill, sixty-four $20 bills, sixty-two  $50 bills and one\n\n$100 bill  for a total  of $4490.   In  addition, one  report\n\nfiled by  a  local police  officer  who participated  in  the\n\nsearch stated that the amount  of cash found in the envelopes\n\ncombined with the cash found in the leather bag on top of the\n             \n\nhutch totaled $2911.\n\n          At the  February 13, 1991,  probable cause hearing,\n\nClaire  Soule's counsel  focused almost exclusively  on these\n\nvarious  deficiencies   in  the  government's   handling  and\n\naccounting of  the money found  in the envelopes.   While the\n\ngovernment's   errors  as  to   the  amount  at   issue  were\n                                           \n\nsignificant, it is the source of the funds in this case which\n                             \n\nwould have rendered them forfeitable.  Thus, the government's\n\nhandling  and  accounting  errors  did  nothing  to  diminish\n\nprobable cause.   In  other words,  despite the  government's\n\nerrors,  there  remained  ample reason  to  believe  that the\n\nsource  of the  funds  rendered  them  forfeitable.   Cf.  18\n                                                             \n\nOakwood St., 958  F.2d at 5 (\"[T]he  [government's] affidavit\n           \n\nasserts that  $50,000 was  seized during  a particular  drug-\n\nrelated arrest at 18 Oakwood  Street, whereas in fact, as the\n\ngovernment  concedes, only  $611.00 was  seized.   While  the\n\n                             -13-\n                              13\n\nmonetary  discrepancy is  large, [claimant]  made no  showing\n\nthat  it  was of  any  consequence  to the  establishment  of\n\nprobable cause.\").  \n\n          In  sum, the district  court first erred  in fixing\n\nthe date of  the probable cause hearing as the  date at which\n\nthe government must  demonstrate probable cause.   Rather, as\n\nnoted above,  in  order to  meet  its preliminary  burden  at\n\ntrial,  the government  need only  show that it  had probable\n\ncause  to  institute  forfeiture   proceedings.  Second,  the\n                    \n\ndistrict court erred  in ruling that the  government's errors\n\nin handling  and accounting for  the money at  issue vitiated\n\nthe existence of probable cause.  \n\nD.

A local police check revealed that a John Jeffrey Soule resided in nearby Carver, Massachusetts, but that his mother lived at 255 Broadway in Hanover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of July 23, 1988, after local police and DEA agents observed the delivery of marijuana to 255 Broadway, search warrants were obtained for the premises.  At 4:30 a.m. the following morning, local and federal officials executed the warrants.  The search revealed, inter alia:  (1) approximately 1600 pounds of marijuana in a barn adjacent to the house;  (2) $874,510 in cash found in a box in a closet on the first floor of the house;  (3) 461.8 grams of cocaine, along with $5310 in cash in a basement safe;  (4) $26,500 in cash found in a gym bag beside the bed in which John Jeffrey Soule was sleeping;  (5) $3171 in cash found in a leather travel bag on top of a hutch in the dining room;  and (6) a disputed amount of cash between $2450 and $4490 contained in five envelopes found inside the dining room hutch.  Only this last item is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 17, 1989, John Jeffrey Soule pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to possess marijuana and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.  On May 25, 1989, less than one month later, the government filed a complaint for forfeiture in rem of, inter alia, the cash proceeds found in the search of Claire Soule's home.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On June 1, 1989, at the government's request, the district court issued a warrant and monition for, inter alia, all of the seized cash.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Claire Soule responded on June 14, 1989, by filing a notice of claim for the money found in the envelopes in the dining room hutch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, 1989, a default judgment of forfeiture was entered against the lots of $874,510, $26,500 and $5310.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  On February 13, 1991, the district court held a hearing at which the government was asked to show probable cause for the forfeiture of the money found in the five envelopes inside the hutch.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court found that the government had failed to show probable cause for forfeiture of that money, and awarded $2450 to Claire Soule.  The government moved immediately for a certificate of reasonable cause pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2465, so as not to be liable for costs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Claire Soule opposed the motion for a certificate of reasonable cause and sought attorneys' fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (hereinafter EAJA), 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2412,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> for expenses incurred in recovering the $2450.  The district court granted the government's request for the certificate of reasonable cause and denied claimant's request for attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that \"we are free to affirm a district court's decision on any ground supported in the record even if the issue was not pleaded, tried or otherwise referred to in the proceedings below.\"  De Casenave v. United States, 991 F.2d 11, 12 n. 2 (1st Cir.1993) (citations and internal quotations omitted).  In this case, although the district court misapplied the statutory burden-shifting scheme applicable to federal forfeiture actions, we nonetheless affirm its denial of costs and attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>A. The Statutory Scheme:  Probable Cause to Institute Forfeiture Proceedings</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a forfeiture action brought under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881, the allocation of the parties' burdens is provided by 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1615.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(d);  United States v. 1933 Commonwealth Ave., 913 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1990).  Section 1615 states, in relevant part, that the \"the burden of proof shall be upon the defendant:  Provided, That probable cause shall be first shown for the institution of such suit or action, to be judged by the court\" (second emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, under section 1615, the government has a preliminary burden to show that it had probable cause to institute the forfeiture proceeding.  See, e.g., United States v. 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, 983 F.2d 670, 675 (5th Cir.1993) (affirming district court's finding that government had \"probable cause to institute a forfeiture action\") (emphasis supplied);  United States v. One Hundred Forty-Nine Thousand Four Hundred Forty-Two and 43/100 Dollars, 965 F.2d 868, 876 (10th Cir.1992) (\"In forfeiture proceedings, the government bears the initial burden to show probable cause for the institution of the forfeiture action.\")  (emphasis supplied);  United States v. 526 Liscum Drive, 866 F.2d 213, 216 (6th Cir.1989) (\"[O]nce the government has met its burden of showing probable cause to institute the forfeiture action, the burden then shifts to the claimant....\") (emphasis supplied); United States v. One 1976 Ford F-150 Pick-Up, 769 F.2d 525, 526 (8th Cir.1985) (\"[T]he government has the initial burden of showing probable cause for the institution of the forfeiture suit.\")  (citations and internal quotations omitted and emphasis supplied).  Once the government has made this showing, the burden then shifts to the claimant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property at issue is not subject to forfeiture.   See, e.g., United States v. 18 Oakwood St., 958 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court did not assess whether the government had probable cause to institute the proceedings.  Rather, it improperly focused its inquiry on whether probable cause existed on the date of the probable cause hearing itself, and concluded that no probable cause existed at that time.  See United States v. 255 Broadway, 795 F.Supp. 1225, 1231-32 (D.Mass.1992).  The record before us makes clear, however, that on May 25, 1989, the date of the institution of forfeiture proceedings, the government had probable cause to believe that the funds at issue were forfeitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>B. The Existence of Probable Cause in this Case</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Probable cause to forfeit requires only a 'reasonable ground for belief of guilt[,] supported by less than prima facie proof but more than mere suspicion' that the property is subject to forfeiture.\"  United States v. 28 Emery St., 914 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting United States v. $250,000 in United States Currency, 808 F.2d 895, 897 (1st Cir.1987)).  In other words, the government has a \"relatively light burden of showing probable cause\" to believe that the subject property is forfeitable.  United States v. Plat 20, Lot 17, Great Harbor Neck, 960 F.2d 200, 205 (1st Cir.1992) (hereinafter Great Harbor Neck ).   Moreover, \"[b]ecause there are so many variables in the probable cause equation, probable cause findings are not invariably bound by precedent.\"  United States v. Maguire, 918 F.2d 254, 258 (1st Cir.1990) (citations and internal quotations omitted), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 950, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1421, 2861, 113 L.Ed.2d 474, 115 L.Ed.2d 1027 (1991).  Rather, in each case, we must consider \"the totality of the circumstances to evaluate the government's demonstration\" of probable cause.  Id.  In doing so, \"we review each piece of evidence only to determine whether it is probative, not whether it establishes probable cause standing alone.\"  United States v. $67,220.00 in United States Currency, 957 F.2d 280, 285 (6th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, we note that in order to show probable cause to forfeit in this particular case, the government was not required to show that the money at issue was traceable to the very contraband found on the night of the search.  Rather, the district court held, and Claire Soule does not dispute on appeal, that the money at issue would be forfeitable if found to be the proceeds of any of John Jeffrey Soule's drug transactions.  See, e.g., 1933 Commonwealth Ave., 913 F.2d at 3 (stating that the government is not \"require[d to] link[ ] the property to a particular transaction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, while we accept the district court's underlying factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, Maguire, 918 F.2d at 257, we note that \"[t]he existence of probable cause is a question of law, and as such, is subject to plenary review.\"  United States v. One 1986 Chevrolet Van, 927 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir.1991).  Cf. United States v. Holder, 990 F.2d 1327, 1328 (D.C.Cir.1993) (\"We review de novo the district court's legal conclusion that probable cause supported the arrest, but we examine the court's findings of fact only for clear error.\");  United States v. Greene, 783 F.2d 1364, 13 (9th Cir.)  (\"The ultimate conclusion of presence or absence of probable cause is a mixed question of law and fact.  The underlying facts as found by the district court are to be accepted unless clearly erroneous.  The court's ultimate conclusion, however, is reviewed de novo.\")  (citations omitted), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1185, 106 S.Ct. 2923, 91 L.Ed.2d 551 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these standards, we find the record replete with probative evidence which supports a finding that, on May 25, 1989, the government had probable cause to institute forfeiture proceedings against the money at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the search of 255 Broadway, Claire Soule was questioned by a DEA agent about the source of the cash at issue in this appeal.  While the district court did not determine precisely what Claire Soule's answers were that night, it nonetheless did find those answers to be \"inconsistent, indeed suspicious.\"   This finding is fully supported by the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Moreover, there were 1600 pounds of marijuana in the barn adjacent to Claire Soule's house, a sizeable amount of cocaine in a safe in the basement, and over $900,000 in cash in the house.  Not only was there cash near the hutch in which the funds at issue were found, there was also a bag containing $3171 found directly on top of the hutch.  Suspicious and contradictory answers in the presence of the large quantities of cash and drugs uncovered in this search are certainly probative in determining the existence of probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally important is the fact that Claire Soule made no offers of proof, either before or after the government's initiation of forfeiture proceedings, to substantiate her allegations that the cash came from legitimate sources.  Thus, even if Claire Soule's responses had not been adjudged \"suspicious,\" her denials alone, unaccompanied by offers of proof, were insufficient to rebut a showing of probable cause.  See, e.g., One Hundred Forty-Nine Thousand Four Hundred Forty-Two and 43/100 Dollars, 965 F.2d at 878 (\"We conclude that claimants' proffer of three 'possible' innocent sources of income does not vitiate the government's showing of a strong probability that the source of the money is in fact illegal drug activity.\");  1933 Commonwealth Ave., 913 F.2d at 4 (finding \"general denials\" insufficient to overcome government's showing of probable cause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it is undisputed that Claire Soule's keys to a safe deposit box were seized during the drug raid and that she surreptitiously went to the bank just days after the search of her home and had the box drilled open by bank employees so she could empty it before it could be searched.  The government was aware of this act at the time that it instituted forfeiture proceedings.  Again, while such behavior is far from determinative, we believe it relevant to the probable cause determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without making any credibility determinations beyond those made by the district court, and while noting that none of these factors standing alone necessarily establishes probable cause, we find that these circumstances taken as a whole support a finding that, on May 25, 1989, the date of the initiation of forfeiture proceedings, the government had probable cause to believe that all of the money seized from 255 Broadway, including the money found in the envelopes inside the hutch, was subject to forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>C. Adversarial Evidence and the Probable Cause Hearing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government did commit serious errors in handling the cash found in and around Claire Soule's dining room hutch.  For example, initial notations by a DEA agent, made on the envelopes themselves on the night of the raid, indicated that the envelopes contained the following:  one $10 bill, one-hundred and fourteen $20 bills, eighteen $50 bills and eight $100 bills for a total of $3990.  About three days later, forms filed by the same agent showed startlingly different denominations.  These later forms stated that the envelopes seized from the hutch contained one $10 bill, sixty-four $20 bills, sixty-two $50 bills and one $100 bill for a total of $4490.  In addition, one report filed by a local police officer who participated in the search stated that the amount of cash found in the envelopes combined with the cash found in the leather bag on top of the hutch totaled $2911.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the February 13, 1991, probable cause hearing, Claire Soule's counsel focused almost exclusively on these various deficiencies in the government's handling and accounting of the money found in the envelopes.  While the government's errors as to the amount at issue were significant, it is the source of the funds in this case which would have rendered them forfeitable.  Thus, the government's handling and accounting errors did nothing to diminish probable cause.  In other words, despite the government's errors, there remained ample reason to believe that the source of the funds rendered them forfeitable.  Cf. 18 Oakwood St., 958 F.2d at 5 (\"[T]he [government's] affidavit asserts that $50,000 was seized during a particular drug-related arrest at 18 Oakwood Street, whereas in fact, as the government concedes, only $611.00 was seized.  While the monetary discrepancy is large, [claimant] made no showing that it was of any consequence to the establishment of probable cause.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the district court first erred in fixing the date of the probable cause hearing as the date at which the government must demonstrate probable cause.  Rather, as noted above, in order to meet its preliminary burden at trial, the government need only show that it had probable cause to institute forfeiture proceedings.  Second, the district court erred in ruling that the government's errors in handling and accounting for the money at issue vitiated the existence of probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>D. The Certificate of Reasonable Cause and the Denial of Attorneys' Fees</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these errors below, however, we nonetheless affirm the district court's denial of costs and fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claire Soule's argument that the district court's issuance of the certificate of reasonable cause was error is based solely on the ground that the district court found no probable cause at the pre-trial hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In view of our determination that there was probable cause to institute the instant proceedings, this argument is of no avail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Accordingly, Claire Soule's request for costs under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2465 fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claire Soule also seeks to recover attorneys' fees under the EAJA based both upon the government's \"agency position\", i.e., its decision to institute proceedings, and its \"litigation position\", i.e., its persistence in seeking forfeiture well after its May 25, 1989, initiation of proceedings.  See, e.g., Great Harbor Neck, 960 F.2d at 208-09 (differentiating, for EAJA purposes, between government's \"agency position,\" and its \"litigation position\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like her \"certificate of reasonable cause\" argument, Claire Soule's argument that the government's agency position was not \"substantially justified\" for EAJA purposes hinges entirely on the district court's finding that the government failed to meet its initial burden of showing probable cause.  Our conclusion to the contrary similarly forecloses this arm of her EAJA argument.  Cf. United States v. One 1985 Chevrolet Corvette, 914 F.2d 804, 809 (6th Cir.1990) (finding that \"when the government established probable cause in the forfeiture proceeding, its position was substantially justified\" for EAJA purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Claire Soule seeks attorneys' fees based on the government's litigation position, the district court specifically found that the government's persistence in seeking forfeiture was fully justified.  See 255 Broadway, 795 F.Supp. at 1237 (\"[T]he claimant points to no intervening evidence that might have given the government pause over whether to continue onward with the case.  No newly unearthed information, for instance, substantiated Claire Soule's conflicting accounts of the source of the money or disproved the money's apparent connection to the wealth of drug activity that took place in the house.\").  This finding is fully supported by the record.  Accordingly, we decline to overturn the district court's denial of attorneys' fees under the EAJA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that the government does not cross-appeal in this case.  As a result, it is foreclosed from further pursuit of its forfeiture claim, despite our ruling that it met its initial burden of demonstrating probable cause to institute a forfeiture proceeding against the money in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court denying costs and attorneys' fees to Claire Soule is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

She agreed to talk to us about the money.  And myself and Agent Hayes--Lieutenant Hayes--talked with her.  Lieutenant Hayes began the conversation with her by asking her about what the money was.  And she said it was money that was for a pool, which was fairly obvious from the notation on the envelope.  She was asked how much money it was and she responded it was about $10,000.  She was asked what the source of the monies were.  And her first response was it was money from an inheritance.  And I believe I asked her who was the inheritance from, what was the source of the inheritance, which person.  Her words were, in effect, what difference does it that make?   And I told her, I said, \"I'm trying to determine if this is your money or this is somebody else's money or where this money came from.  If you can tell me what the source of the inheritance is or if you have some probate document that shows you receiving this kind of money, you know, help me out.\"   She said, \"Well, I got the money in cash.\"   And my response was you usually don't get that kind of money from an estate in cash, it comes in the form of checks.

At 4:30 a.m. the following morning, local and federal officials executed the warrants.  The search revealed, inter alia:  (1) approximately 1600 pounds of marijuana in a barn adjacent to the house;  (2) $874,510 in cash found in a box in a closet on the first floor of the house;  (3) 461.8 grams of cocaine, along with $5310 in cash in a basement safe;  (4) $26,500 in cash found in a gym bag beside the bed in which John Jeffrey Soule was sleeping;  (5) $3171 in cash found in a leather travel bag on top of a hutch in the dining room;  and (6) a disputed amount of cash between $2450 and $4490 contained in five envelopes found inside the dining room hutch.

Sec. 881, the allocation of the parties' burdens is provided by 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1615.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(d);  United States v. 1933 Commonwealth Ave., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547465\"><a href=\"/opinion/547465/united-states-v-parcels-of-real-property-with-the-building-appurtenances/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1990).

Once the government has made this showing, the burden then shifts to the claimant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property at issue is not subject to forfeiture.   See, e.g., United States v. 18 Oakwood St., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578669\"><a href=\"/opinion/578669/united-states-v-parcel-of-land-and-residence-at-18-oakwood-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court did not assess whether the government had probable cause to institute the proceedings.

Rather, the district court held, and Claire Soule does not dispute on appeal, that the money at issue would be forfeitable if found to be the proceeds of any of John Jeffrey Soule's drug transactions.

While the district court did not determine precisely what Claire Soule's answers were that night, it nonetheless did find those answers to be \"inconsistent, indeed suspicious.\"   This finding is fully supported by the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Moreover, there were 1600 pounds of marijuana in the barn adjacent to Claire Soule's house, a sizeable amount of cocaine in a safe in the basement, and over $900,000 in cash in the house.  Not only was there cash near the hutch in which the funds at issue were found, there was also a bag containing $3171 found directly on top of the hutch.  Suspicious and contradictory answers in the presence of the large quantities of cash and drugs uncovered in this search are certainly probative in determining the existence of probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally important is the fact that Claire Soule made no offers of proof, either before or after the government's initiation of forfeiture proceedings, to substantiate her allegations that the cash came from legitimate sources.  Thus, even if Claire Soule's responses had not been adjudged \"suspicious,\" her denials alone, unaccompanied by offers of proof, were insufficient to rebut a showing of probable cause.  See, e.g., One Hundred Forty-Nine Thousand Four Hundred Forty-Two and 43/100 Dollars, 965 F.2d at 878 (\"We conclude that claimants' proffer of three 'possible' innocent sources of income does not vitiate the government's showing of a strong probability that the source of the money is in fact illegal drug activity.\");  1933 Commonwealth Ave., 913 F.2d at 4 (finding \"general denials\" insufficient to overcome government's showing of probable cause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it is undisputed that Claire Soule's keys to a safe deposit box were seized during the drug raid and that she surreptitiously went to the bank just days after the search of her home and had the box drilled open by bank employees so she could empty it before it could be searched.  The government was aware of this act at the time that it instituted forfeiture proceedings.  Again, while such behavior is far from determinative, we believe it relevant to the probable cause determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without making any credibility determinations beyond those made by the district court, and while noting that none of these factors standing alone necessarily establishes probable cause, we find that these circumstances taken as a whole support a finding that, on May 25, 1989, the date of the initiation of forfeiture proceedings, the government had probable cause to believe that all of the money seized from 255 Broadway, including the money found in the envelopes inside the hutch, was subject to forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>C. Adversarial Evidence and the Probable Cause Hearing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government did commit serious errors in handling the cash found in and around Claire Soule's dining room hutch.  For example, initial notations by a DEA agent, made on the envelopes themselves on the night of the raid, indicated that the envelopes contained the following:  one $10 bill, one-hundred and fourteen $20 bills, eighteen $50 bills and eight $100 bills for a total of $3990.  About three days later, forms filed by the same agent showed startlingly different denominations.  These later forms stated that the envelopes seized from the hutch contained one $10 bill, sixty-four $20 bills, sixty-two $50 bills and one $100 bill for a total of $4490.  In addition, one report filed by a local police officer who participated in the search stated that the amount of cash found in the envelopes combined with the cash found in the leather bag on top of the hutch totaled $2911.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the February 13, 1991, probable cause hearing, Claire Soule's counsel focused almost exclusively on these various deficiencies in the government's handling and accounting of the money found in the envelopes.  While the government's errors as to the amount at issue were significant, it is the source of the funds in this case which would have rendered them forfeitable.  Thus, the government's handling and accounting errors did nothing to diminish probable cause.  In other words, despite the government's errors, there remained ample reason to believe that the source of the funds rendered them forfeitable.  Cf. 18 Oakwood St., 958 F.2d at 5 (\"[T]he [government's] affidavit asserts that $50,000 was seized during a particular drug-related arrest at 18 Oakwood Street, whereas in fact, as the government concedes, only $611.00 was seized.  While the monetary discrepancy is large, [claimant] made no showing that it was of any consequence to the establishment of probable cause.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the district court first erred in fixing the date of the probable cause hearing as the date at which the government must demonstrate probable cause.  Rather, as noted above, in order to meet its preliminary burden at trial, the government need only show that it had probable cause to institute forfeiture proceedings.  Second, the district court erred in ruling that the government's errors in handling and accounting for the money at issue vitiated the existence of probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>D. The Certificate of Reasonable Cause and the Denial of Attorneys' Fees</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these errors below, however, we nonetheless affirm the district court's denial of costs and fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claire Soule's argument that the district court's issuance of the certificate of reasonable cause was error is based solely on the ground that the district court found no probable cause at the pre-trial hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In view of our determination that there was probable cause to institute the instant proceedings, this argument is of no avail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Accordingly, Claire Soule's request for costs under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2465 fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claire Soule also seeks to recover attorneys' fees under the EAJA based both upon the government's \"agency position\", i.e., its decision to institute proceedings, and its \"litigation position\", i.e., its persistence in seeking forfeiture well after its May 25, 1989, initiation of proceedings.  See, e.g., Great Harbor Neck, 960 F.2d at 208-09 (differentiating, for EAJA purposes, between government's \"agency position,\" and its \"litigation position\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like her \"certificate of reasonable cause\" argument, Claire Soule's argument that the government's agency position was not \"substantially justified\" for EAJA purposes hinges entirely on the district court's finding that the government failed to meet its initial burden of showing probable cause.  Our conclusion to the contrary similarly forecloses this arm of her EAJA argument.  Cf. United States v. One 1985 Chevrolet Corvette, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548395\"><a href=\"/opinion/548395/united-states-v-one-1985-chevrolet-corvette/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 809 (6th Cir.1990) (finding that \"when the government established probable cause in the forfeiture proceeding, its position was substantially justified\" for EAJA purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Claire Soule seeks attorneys' fees based on the government's litigation position, the district court specifically found that the government's persistence in seeking forfeiture was fully justified.  See 255 Broadway, 795 F.Supp. at 1237 (\"[T]he claimant points to no intervening evidence that might have given the government pause over whether to continue onward with the case.  No newly unearthed information, for instance, substantiated Claire Soule's conflicting accounts of the source of the money or disproved the money's apparent connection to the wealth of drug activity that took place in the house.\").  This finding is fully supported by the record.  Accordingly, we decline to overturn the district court's denial of attorneys' fees under the EAJA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that the government does not cross-appeal in this case.  As a result, it is foreclosed from further pursuit of its forfeiture claim, despite our ruling that it met its initial burden of demonstrating probable cause to institute a forfeiture proceeding against the money in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district court denying costs and attorneys' fees to Claire Soule is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

She agreed to talk to us about the money.  And myself and Agent Hayes--Lieutenant Hayes--talked with her.  Lieutenant Hayes began the conversation with her by asking her about what the money was.  And she said it was money that was for a pool, which was fairly obvious from the notation on the envelope.  She was asked how much money it was and she responded it was about $10,000.  She was asked what the source of the monies were.  And her first response was it was money from an inheritance.  And I believe I asked her who was the inheritance from, what was the source of the inheritance, which person.  Her words were, in effect, what difference does it that make?   And I told her, I said, \"I'm trying to determine if this is your money or this is somebody else's money or where this money came from.  If you can tell me what the source of the inheritance is or if you have some probate document that shows you receiving this kind of money, you know, help me out.\"   She said, \"Well, I got the money in cash.\"   And my response was you usually don't get that kind of money from an estate in cash, it comes in the form of checks.
