Eastern    Seaboard     Concrete\n\nConstruction      Company    (\"Eastern\")       appeals      the   district   court\n\ndecision vacating an amended arbitration award and denying Eastern\n\nprejudgment interest on its award.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           The     background      facts     of   this   case     are   thoroughly\n\ndiscussed in the magistrate judge's Recommended Decision, see E.\n\nSeaboard Concrete Constr. Co. v. Gray Constr. Inc., 2008 WL 1803781\n\n(D. Me. 2008).     For our purposes, Gray Construction              (\"Gray\"), the\n\nprime contractor on a construction project at the Portsmouth Naval\n\nShipyard in Kittery, Maine, contracted with Eastern to perform the\n\nsite work at the project. A dispute arose when Eastern encountered\n\nunexpected conditions that increased the project's scope and as a\n\nresult, put the job behind schedule.              When the Navy refused to pay\n\nGray for the extra work and Gray in turn refused to pay Eastern,\n\nEastern   left    the    job,     returned    briefly,      and   ultimately   was\n\nterminated by Gray. Gray then hired replacement subcontractors and\n\nsuppliers to complete Eastern's scope of the work.\n\n           Eastern filed a complaint premised on the Miller Act, 40\n\nU.S.C. § 3131 et seq., which requires surety bonds on federal\n\nconstruction projects, against Gray in federal district court in\n\nMaine. Gray counterclaimed and simultaneously motioned to stay the\n\nproceedings      because    Eastern    had     not   exhausted      the   parties'\n\ncontractual and administrative remedies pursuant to the parties'\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fsubcontract.     The parties then agreed to submit the case to\n\narbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause in their contract\n\nand later voluntarily dismissed the court action to permit the\n\narbitration to proceed on a more extended basis.        Eastern and Gray\n\nagreed that the American Arbitration Association's Construction\n\nIndustry Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures (\"AAA Rules\")\n\nwould apply to the proceeding.\n\n           Following the arbitration proceedings in May 2007, the\n\narbitrator issued a nine-page arbitration award on September 21,\n\n2007.   Noting that \"[t]o the extent that an issue or claim is not\n\nexplicitly discussed and resolved, it is denied,\" the arbitrator\n\nawarded Eastern recovery on all but one of its claims, and he also\n\ndetermined that Eastern breached its contract by abandoning its\n\nwork and awarded Gray $77,000 for the completion of the contract,\n\n\"to be deducted from the award paid to Eastern Seaboard.\"              The\n\narbitrator rejected Eastern's contention that it was entitled to\n\ninterest under a Federal Prompt Payment Act interest penalty, 31\n\nU.S.C. §§ 3901-3907, or its implementing regulations.\n\n           Eastern then filed an Application for Clarification of\n\nthe Arbitration Award and sought to have the $77,000 award to Gray\n\nreduced   by   $66,613.89,   the   amount   remaining   on   the   parties'\n\nsubcontract. Eastern previously had alerted the arbitrator to this\n\namount in its Post-Trial Brief in which it observed, \"The Parties\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fdo not dispute that there was           $66,613.81 remaining under the base\n\ncontract.\"\n\n            Gray,        in    its   Post-Hearing       Arbitration      Brief,       had\n\ncontended that it was not in breach of contract for non-payment.\n\nGray made three independent arguments in its defense.                         First, it\n\nnoted the pay-when-paid clause of the contract.                  Second, it stated\n\nthat    Eastern    \"had       effectively    already    been   paid     the    sums   in\n\nquestion by virtue of Gray's overpayment on the base contract.\"\n\nFinally, Gray suggested that even if Eastern had not been paid for\n\nthe work, the contract permitted Gray to withhold payment \"when\n\nthere is reasonable doubt that [Eastern] could complete the Work on\n\ntime, was satisfactorily prosecuting the Work, or that the Work\n\ncould be completed for the unpaid balance of the subcontract\n\nprice.\"    While the arbitrator's initial award disposed of Gray's\n\nfirst     defense,       finding     that     the     pay-when-paid      clause       was\n\nunenforceable under the Miller Act, it did not address Gray's other\n\narguments.\n\n            On November 4, 2007, acknowledging that \"[t]he award\n\ncould    have     been    clearer,\"    the        arbitrator   issued    an     amended\n\narbitration award and adopted Eastern's request, noting that \"Gray\n\ndoes not seriously dispute the $66,613.89 figure.\"                    He also cited\n\nSection    11.2    of    the    contract     which    required   that    any     unpaid\n\ncontract balance owed to the subcontractor be offset by the cost of\n\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fcompleting the subcontractor's work, \"which is precisely what is\n\nbeing awarded here.\"\n\n              Gray moved to vacate the award, and Eastern filed a\n\ncross-motion to confirm the award and requested the court award\n\nprejudgment interest.         On April 18, 2008, the magistrate judge\n\nrecommended a decision granting Gray's motion to vacate, finding\n\nthat   AAA    Rule   R-47    (\"Rule     47\")    prohibited    the    substantive\n\nmodifications in the amended award.               She also determined that\n\nEastern was not entitled to interest before the date of the award.\n\nOn May 23, 2008, the district court affirmed the magistrate's\n\ndecision after de novo review.          Eastern now appeals the decision.\n\n                                        II.\n\n              We review the district court's decision to vacate the\n\narbitral award de novo.       UMass Mem'l Med. Ctr., Inc. v. United Food\n\n& Commercial Workers Union, 527 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2008).                   Our\n\nconsideration of the award is \"extremely narrow and exceedingly\n\ndeferential,\" Wheelabrator Envirotech Operating Servs. Inc. v.\n\nMass. Laborers Dist. Council Local 1144, 88 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (citations omitted), such that our de novo review is \"among\n\nthe narrowest known in the law,\"               Me. Cent. R. Co. v. Bhd. of\n\nMaint.   of    Way   Employees,   873    F.2d    425,   428   (1st   Cir.   1989)\n\n(citations omitted).        Indeed, we have recognized that \"[a]rbitral\n\nawards are nearly impervious to judicial oversight.\"                  Teamsters\n\nLocal Union No. 42 v. Supervalu, Inc., 212 F.3d 59, 61 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f2000)   (citations     omitted).         Thus,    \"[a]   court's    review     of   an\n\narbitration award is highly deferential because the parties 'have\n\ncontracted to have disputes settled by an arbitrator' and thus, 'it\n\nis the arbitrator's view of the facts and of the meaning of the\n\ncontract that they have agreed to accept.'\"                  Bull HN Info. Sys.,\n\nInc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d 321, 330 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting United\n\nPaperworkers    Int'l      Union   v.    Misco,    Inc.,    484   U.S.   29,      37-38\n\n(1987)).\n\n            \"Courts     must    accord     substantial       deference       to     the\n\ndecisions of arbitrators.          Nevertheless, there are limits to that\n\ndeference.\" Kashner Davidson Sec. Corp. v. Mscisz, 531 F.3d 68, 70\n\n(1st Cir. 2008). Section 10 of the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\")\n\npermits     courts    to    vacate      arbitrators'       awards   \"[w]here        the\n\narbitrators exceeded their powers.\"              9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(4).        Because\n\n\"arbitration is simply a matter of contract between the parties,\"\n\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943 (1995),\n\nwe look to the parties' contract to determine the powers the\n\nparties intended to bestow upon the arbitrator. \"Arbitration under\n\nthe [FAA] is a matter of consent, not coercion, and parties are\n\ngenerally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they\n\nsee fit.\"     Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S.\n\n52, 57 (1999).        A court may reverse an arbitrator's award on\n\ncontractual grounds only \"where an award is contrary to the plain\n\nlanguage of the [contract]\" and in \"instances where it is clear\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\ffrom the record that the arbitrator recognized the applicable law\n\n-- and then ignored it.\"    Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy, 914 F.2d 6, 9\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (citations omitted).    We thus proceed to determine\n\nwhether the arbitrator exceeded his authority in the instant case.\n\n            Eastern and Gray agreed that the AAA Rules would govern\n\nthe arbitration process.1    Hence, the AAA Rules \"became part and\n\nparcel of the arbitration contract.\"        Mscisz, 531 F.3d at 77\n\n(citing 11 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 30:25 (4th ed.\n\n2008)).   AAA Rule 47 reads as follows:\n\n     Within twenty calendar days after the transmittal of an\n     award, the arbitrator on his or her initiative, or any\n     party, upon notice to the other parties, may request that\n     the arbitrator correct any clerical, typographical,\n     technical or computational errors in the award.       The\n     arbitrator is not empowered to redetermine the merits of\n     any claim already decided.\n\nGray argues that Rule 47 precluded the arbitrator from revisiting\n\nhis initial award and reducing Gray's award by $66,613.89.        We\n\ndisagree.\n\n            While previously we have not had occasion to consider the\n\napplication of Rule 47, we have discussed more generally the\n\nfunctus officio doctrine2 and an arbitrator's ability to revisit an\n\n\n     1\n       Notwithstanding Eastern's argument to the contrary, the AAA\nRules and the FAA govern the scope of the arbitrator's authority to\namend the award.     Mastrobuono, 514 U.S. at 58, 63-64.        See\nalso Volt Info. Sci., Inc. v. Bd. of Trs. of Leland Stanford Jr.\nUniv., 489 U.S. 468, 478-79 (1989).\n     2\n       This common law doctrine refers to the exhaustion of the\narbitrator's powers which precludes him \"from vacating, modifying,\nsupplementing, or correcting his award.\" Courier-Citizen Co. v.\n\n                                 -7-\n\faward, recently noting that \"the question whether and when an\n\narbitrator may reverse or substantially alter his ruling is perhaps\n\nan open one.\"    Local 2322, Int'l Bhd. v. Verizon New England, Inc.,\n\n464   F.3d    93,     97-98   (1st   Cir.       2006)        (citations    omitted).\n\nSee also Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics, and Allied Workers\n\nInt'l Union v. Excelsior Foundry Co., 56 F.3d 844, 846 (7th Cir.\n\n1995) (noting that the functus officio doctrine \"[t]oday, [is]\n\nriddled   with      exceptions   .   .    .    [and]    is    hanging     on   by   its\n\nfingernails\").       Our cases still tend to differentiate between a\n\nsecond award which is \"fundamentally inconsistent with the first\n\naward\" and one which \"simply flesh[es] out the remedy announced\n\ninitially.\"      Courier-Citizen Co., 702 F.2d at 279; Verizon, 464\n\nF.3d at 98 (distinguishing between \"clarify\" and \"alter\").                      Thus,\n\nwe have permitted an arbitrator to clarify whether an award to make\n\nwhole an employee includes a back pay remedy.                 Verizon, 464 F.3d at\n\n100; Locals 2222 v. New England Telephone and Telegraph Co., 628\n\nF.2d 644, 649 (1st Cir. 1980).           See also Fradella v. Petricca, 183\n\nF.3d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1999) (finding an amendment to the award\n\nministerial where the arbitrator first incorrectly listed New York\n\nlaw as governing the arbitration and then revised the award to\n\ndelete the New York references and replace with Massachusetts).\n\n\n\n\nBoston Electrotypers Union No. 11, 702 F.2d 273, 278 (1st Cir.\n1983).\n\n                                         -8-\n\f           We find in our sister circuits further evidence of \"how\n\nlimited the doctrine of functus officio has become.\" Excelsior, 56\n\nF.3d at 849.     For example, in La Vale Plaza, Inc. v. R.S. Noonan,\n\nInc., 378 F.2d 569, 570 (3d Cir. 1967), a case not unlike our own,\n\nthe arbitrators proceeded according to the AAA Rules and awarded\n\nNoonan $30,861.64 \"in full settlement of all claims submitted to\n\nthis arbitration one against the other.\"    The arbitrators did not,\n\nhowever, discuss $56,429.66 that La Vale had delivered to Noonan in\n\nanticipation of the arbitration, and La Vale brought an action to\n\nrecover $25,568.02, the difference between the award and its\n\ndeposit.   Id.     The Third Circuit, after discussing the functus\n\nofficio doctrine, held that the arbitrators should \"remove the\n\ncloud of doubt as to whether they considered the payment of\n\n$56,429.66 in making their award\" as it \"will in no way reopen the\n\nmerits of the controversy.\"      Id. at 573.     The court explained,\n\n\"Where the award, though seemingly complete, leaves doubt whether\n\nthe submission has been fully executed, an ambiguity arises which\n\nthe arbitrator is entitled to clarify.\"    Id.    See also Excelsior,\n\n56 F.3d at 847-49 (holding that neither the AAA Rules nor functus\n\nofficio barred an arbitrator from clarifying his award to explain\n\nwhich party was responsible for the costs of a rehabilitative\n\nprogram); Kennecott Utah Cooper Corp. v. Becker, 186 F.3d 1261,\n\n1271-72 (10th Cir. 1999) (permitting arbitrator to explain whether\n\nhe intended to include back pay in the award); Int'l Bhd. of\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fTeamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, and Helpers of Am. v.

Conn. 2007)\n\n(citing Rule 47 to permit the arbitrator to add the first names of\n\nthe parties to the award to clarify joint and several liability).\n\n            In the present case, the arbitrator issued what appeared\n\nto be a complete award.                But as the Seventh Circuit observed,\n\narbitrators       can    \"leave       much   to     implication     and    assumption,\"\n\nExcelsior, 56 F.3d at 847, and the arbitrator, as he acknowledged\n\nin his amended award, failed to make clear that his award to\n\nEastern included the $66,613.89 still owed for work performed on\n\nthe contract.           In its Post-Trial Brief, before the arbitrator\n\nissued his initial award, Eastern noted that \"[t]he parties do not\n\ndispute    that    there        was   $66,613.89       remaining     under    the    base\n\ncontract.\"        After     Eastern       moved      to   clarify    the    award,   the\n\narbitrator in his amended arbitration award observed that \"Gray\n\ndoes not seriously dispute\" the $66,613.89 figure and that failure\n\nto offset the $77,000 would result in a \"windfall\" to Gray.\n\n            We acknowledge that whether this amended award exceeded\n\nthe arbitrator's authority under Rule 47 and therefore justified\n\nthe district court's decision to vacate the award is a close\n\nquestion.    The arbitration record before us is sparse.                     We do not\n\nknow what arguments were made before the arbitrator during the\n\nhearings    nor    can     we    review      the     exhibits   submitted      for    his\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fconsideration to ascertain whether the $66,613.89 was discussed.\n\nBut good evidence as to whether the $66,613.89 was discussed during\n\nthe arbitration can be found in Gray's own representations to this\n\ncourt in which it did not take issue with Eastern's claim that the\n\ncontract balance of $66,613.89 was undisputed.               Instead, Gray\n\nprimarily argued that the arbitrator's initial award was not\n\nambiguous and therefore did not require clarification. As the case\n\nlaw reveals, this kind of assertion belies the reality that even\n\nseemingly    complete   awards   may   omit    information    or    overlook\n\ncontingencies, failures that AAA Rule 47 would allow the arbitrator\n\nto remedy.\n\n            \"Judicial   intrusion    is    restricted   to   extraordinary\n\nsituations indicating abuse of arbitral power.\"          Raytheon Co. v.\n\nComputer Distrib., Inc., 632 F. Supp. 553, 557 (D. Mass. 1986)\n\n(citing Mobil Oil v. Oil, Chem. and Atomic Workers Int'l Union, 600\n\nF.3d 322, 326 (1st Cir. 1979)).            If the arbitrator is \"even\n\narguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the\n\nscope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed a\n\nserious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.\"             Misco,\n\n484 U.S. at 38.    In the amended arbitration award, the arbitrator\n\nexpressly confirmed Eastern's assertion that Gray did not dispute\n\nthe $66,613.89 contract balance during arbitration.                Given our\n\ndeferential review of arbitration awards, it is not within the\n\npurview of this court to question such an assertion.           Instead, we\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthink the arbitrator's statement provides evidence adequate to show\n\nthat he did not exceed his authority under Rule 47.              Assuming the\n\nveracity of his statement, as we must, and given the lack of\n\nevidence to the contrary, we believe the arbitrator's omission of\n\nthe $66,613.89 contract balance in the initial award, rather than\n\na   redetermination   of   the   merits,   was   the    type    of   \"clerical,\n\ntypographical, technical or computational error[]\" which AAA Rule\n\n47 permitted him to amend or clarify.        The amendment did not reopen\n\nthe merits of the case.     Rather, it clarified a latent ambiguity.\n\nSee La Vale, 378 F.2d at 573.\n\n                                   III.\n\n           Eastern also requests that we vacate the arbitrator's\n\naward insofar as it denied prejudgment interest.              We summarily can\n\naddress this claim.

Me. 2008).     For our purposes, Gray Construction              (\"Gray\"), the\n\nprime contractor on a construction project at the Portsmouth Naval\n\nShipyard in Kittery, Maine, contracted with Eastern to perform the\n\nsite work at the project. A dispute arose when Eastern encountered\n\nunexpected conditions that increased the project's scope and as a\n\nresult, put the job behind schedule.              When the Navy refused to pay\n\nGray for the extra work and Gray in turn refused to pay Eastern,\n\nEastern   left    the    job,     returned    briefly,      and   ultimately   was\n\nterminated by Gray. Gray then hired replacement subcontractors and\n\nsuppliers to complete Eastern's scope of the work.\n\n           Eastern filed a complaint premised on the Miller Act, 40\n\nU.S.C. § 3131 et seq., which requires surety bonds on federal\n\nconstruction projects, against Gray in federal district court in\n\nMaine. Gray counterclaimed and simultaneously motioned to stay the\n\nproceedings      because    Eastern    had     not   exhausted      the   parties'\n\ncontractual and administrative remedies pursuant to the parties'\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fsubcontract.     The parties then agreed to submit the case to\n\narbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause in their contract\n\nand later voluntarily dismissed the court action to permit the\n\narbitration to proceed on a more extended basis.        Eastern and Gray\n\nagreed that the American Arbitration Association's Construction\n\nIndustry Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures (\"AAA Rules\")\n\nwould apply to the proceeding.\n\n           Following the arbitration proceedings in May 2007, the\n\narbitrator issued a nine-page arbitration award on September 21,\n\n2007.   Noting that \"[t]o the extent that an issue or claim is not\n\nexplicitly discussed and resolved, it is denied,\" the arbitrator\n\nawarded Eastern recovery on all but one of its claims, and he also\n\ndetermined that Eastern breached its contract by abandoning its\n\nwork and awarded Gray $77,000 for the completion of the contract,\n\n\"to be deducted from the award paid to Eastern Seaboard.\"              The\n\narbitrator rejected Eastern's contention that it was entitled to\n\ninterest under a Federal Prompt Payment Act interest penalty, 31\n\nU.S.C. §§ 3901-3907, or its implementing regulations.\n\n           Eastern then filed an Application for Clarification of\n\nthe Arbitration Award and sought to have the $77,000 award to Gray\n\nreduced   by   $66,613.89,   the   amount   remaining   on   the   parties'\n\nsubcontract. Eastern previously had alerted the arbitrator to this\n\namount in its Post-Trial Brief in which it observed, \"The Parties\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fdo not dispute that there was           $66,613.81 remaining under the base\n\ncontract.\"\n\n            Gray,        in    its   Post-Hearing       Arbitration      Brief,       had\n\ncontended that it was not in breach of contract for non-payment.\n\nGray made three independent arguments in its defense.                         First, it\n\nnoted the pay-when-paid clause of the contract.                  Second, it stated\n\nthat    Eastern    \"had       effectively    already    been   paid     the    sums   in\n\nquestion by virtue of Gray's overpayment on the base contract.\"\n\nFinally, Gray suggested that even if Eastern had not been paid for\n\nthe work, the contract permitted Gray to withhold payment \"when\n\nthere is reasonable doubt that [Eastern] could complete the Work on\n\ntime, was satisfactorily prosecuting the Work, or that the Work\n\ncould be completed for the unpaid balance of the subcontract\n\nprice.\"    While the arbitrator's initial award disposed of Gray's\n\nfirst     defense,       finding     that     the     pay-when-paid      clause       was\n\nunenforceable under the Miller Act, it did not address Gray's other\n\narguments.\n\n            On November 4, 2007, acknowledging that \"[t]he award\n\ncould    have     been    clearer,\"    the        arbitrator   issued    an     amended\n\narbitration award and adopted Eastern's request, noting that \"Gray\n\ndoes not seriously dispute the $66,613.89 figure.\"                    He also cited\n\nSection    11.2    of    the    contract     which    required   that    any     unpaid\n\ncontract balance owed to the subcontractor be offset by the cost of\n\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fcompleting the subcontractor's work, \"which is precisely what is\n\nbeing awarded here.\"\n\n              Gray moved to vacate the award, and Eastern filed a\n\ncross-motion to confirm the award and requested the court award\n\nprejudgment interest.         On April 18, 2008, the magistrate judge\n\nrecommended a decision granting Gray's motion to vacate, finding\n\nthat   AAA    Rule   R-47    (\"Rule     47\")    prohibited    the    substantive\n\nmodifications in the amended award.               She also determined that\n\nEastern was not entitled to interest before the date of the award.\n\nOn May 23, 2008, the district court affirmed the magistrate's\n\ndecision after de novo review.          Eastern now appeals the decision.\n\n                                        II.\n\n              We review the district court's decision to vacate the\n\narbitral award de novo.

Conn. 2007)\n\n(citing Rule 47 to permit the arbitrator to add the first names of\n\nthe parties to the award to clarify joint and several liability).\n\n            In the present case, the arbitrator issued what appeared\n\nto be a complete award.                But as the Seventh Circuit observed,\n\narbitrators       can    \"leave       much   to     implication     and    assumption,\"\n\nExcelsior, 56 F.3d at 847, and the arbitrator, as he acknowledged\n\nin his amended award, failed to make clear that his award to\n\nEastern included the $66,613.89 still owed for work performed on\n\nthe contract.           In its Post-Trial Brief, before the arbitrator\n\nissued his initial award, Eastern noted that \"[t]he parties do not\n\ndispute    that    there        was   $66,613.89       remaining     under    the    base\n\ncontract.\"        After     Eastern       moved      to   clarify    the    award,   the\n\narbitrator in his amended arbitration award observed that \"Gray\n\ndoes not seriously dispute\" the $66,613.89 figure and that failure\n\nto offset the $77,000 would result in a \"windfall\" to Gray.\n\n            We acknowledge that whether this amended award exceeded\n\nthe arbitrator's authority under Rule 47 and therefore justified\n\nthe district court's decision to vacate the award is a close\n\nquestion.    The arbitration record before us is sparse.                     We do not\n\nknow what arguments were made before the arbitrator during the\n\nhearings    nor    can     we    review      the     exhibits   submitted      for    his\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fconsideration to ascertain whether the $66,613.89 was discussed.\n\nBut good evidence as to whether the $66,613.89 was discussed during\n\nthe arbitration can be found in Gray's own representations to this\n\ncourt in which it did not take issue with Eastern's claim that the\n\ncontract balance of $66,613.89 was undisputed.               Instead, Gray\n\nprimarily argued that the arbitrator's initial award was not\n\nambiguous and therefore did not require clarification. As the case\n\nlaw reveals, this kind of assertion belies the reality that even\n\nseemingly    complete   awards   may   omit    information    or    overlook\n\ncontingencies, failures that AAA Rule 47 would allow the arbitrator\n\nto remedy.\n\n            \"Judicial   intrusion    is    restricted   to   extraordinary\n\nsituations indicating abuse of arbitral power.\"          Raytheon Co. v.\n\nComputer Distrib., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2260882\"><a href=\"/opinion/2260882/raytheon-co-v-computer-distributors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Oil, Chem. and Atomic Workers Int'l Union, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326 (1st Cir. 1979)).            If the arbitrator is \"even\n\narguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the\n\nscope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed a\n\nserious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.\"             Misco,\n\n484 U.S. at 38.    In the amended arbitration award, the arbitrator\n\nexpressly confirmed Eastern's assertion that Gray did not dispute\n\nthe $66,613.89 contract balance during arbitration.                Given our\n\ndeferential review of arbitration awards, it is not within the\n\npurview of this court to question such an assertion.           Instead, we\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthink the arbitrator's statement provides evidence adequate to show\n\nthat he did not exceed his authority under Rule 47.              Assuming the\n\nveracity of his statement, as we must, and given the lack of\n\nevidence to the contrary, we believe the arbitrator's omission of\n\nthe $66,613.89 contract balance in the initial award, rather than\n\na   redetermination   of   the   merits,   was   the    type    of   \"clerical,\n\ntypographical, technical or computational error[]\" which AAA Rule\n\n47 permitted him to amend or clarify.        The amendment did not reopen\n\nthe merits of the case.     Rather, it clarified a latent ambiguity.\n\nSee La Vale, 378 F.2d at 573.\n\n                                   III.\n\n           Eastern also requests that we vacate the arbitrator's\n\naward insofar as it denied prejudgment interest.              We summarily can\n\naddress this claim.    AAA Rule R-44(d), which, as discussed above,\n\ngoverned   this   arbitration,    dictates    that     \"the    arbitrator   may\n\ninclude interest at such a rate and from such a date as the\n\narbitrator may deem appropriate.\"             The parties contracted to\n\nprovide the arbitrator with this discretionary power.                Eastern did\n\nnot within three months request modification of the award with\n\nrespect to the denial of prejudgment interest, see 9 U.S.C. § 12,\n\nand therefore, it is bound by the award.                The district court\n\ntherefore rightly declined to upset the arbitrator's decision\n\nregarding prejudgment interest.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f                               IV.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the district court's decision\n\nis affirmed in part and reversed in part, and this case is remanded\n\nfor entry of an order affirming the amended arbitration award in\n\nits entirety.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f</pre>",
