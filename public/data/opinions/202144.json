The Massachusetts Department of\n\nTelecommunications and Energy (DTE), acting as an arbitrator of a\n\ndispute over an interconnection agreement between Verizon New\n\nEngland, Inc. and Global NAPs, Inc., issued an order requiring\n\nGlobal NAPs to pay Verizon compensation for certain phone calls;\n\nthe amount Global NAPs owes is at least $42 million.         The question\n\nbefore the DTE involved a particular variant on a larger question\n\nof   allocation   of   compensation   for    telephone   calls   placed   to\n\ninternet service providers (ISPs).          The larger question has been\n\naddressed in a series of orders from the Federal Communications\n\nCommission (FCC).      At the heart of this case is one such order, the\n\nISP Remand Order.\n\n           The DTE, in an arbitration order, required Global NAPs to\n\npay Verizon access charges for all \"virtual NXX\" traffic, including\n\nnon-local ISP-bound traffic, rejecting Global NAPs' argument that\n\nstate commissions were preempted by the ISP Remand Order from\n\nregulating intercarrier compensation for all ISP-bound traffic.\n\nGlobal NAPs filed suit challenging the DTE's conclusion in federal\n\ndistrict court.     Verizon and the DTE argued that the DTE retained\n\nauthority to decide the issue because the FCC order only preempted\n\nstate commission regulation of \"local\" traffic sent to an ISP, and\n\nthe FCC did not hold that virtual NXX traffic is such local\n\ntraffic.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f             The district court never reached the preemption issue,\n\nbecause it found that Global NAPs had implicitly consented to the\n\n\"jurisdiction\" of the DTE to resolve the dispute, and so could not\n\nlater challenge the DTE's jurisdiction to impose access charges for\n\nISP-bound traffic.       It granted Verizon and the DTE's motions for\n\npartial summary judgment.         No party on appeal agrees with that\n\nreasoning.\n\n             In the end, we affirm, though on different grounds.           A\n\nparty contesting an issue of whether federal law has preempted a\n\nstate commission's authority does not waive judicial review of the\n\nargument by first presenting it to the commission in the course of\n\nan arbitration under the Telecommunications Act of 1996.           Because\n\nthe preemption question was not waived, it must be addressed.             The\n\nissue is one of federal law over which the federal court exercises\n\nde novo, not deferential, review.          We reach the merits and hold\n\nthat   the   FCC   did   not   expressly   preempt   state   regulation   of\n\nintercarrier compensation for non-local ISP-bound calls as are\n\ninvolved here, leaving the DTE free to impose access charges for\n\nsuch calls under state law.\n\n                                     I.\n\n                          Regulatory Background\n\n             Prior history between these parties is set forth in our\n\nopinions in Global NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New England, Inc. (Global\n\nNAPs I), 396 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2005), and Global NAPs, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fMassachusetts Department of Telecommunications & Energy (Global\n\nNAPs II), 427 F.3d 34 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA), Pub. L. No.\n\n104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (codified as amended in scattered sections of\n\n47 U.S.C.), was enacted \"to end the local telephone monopolies and\n\ncreate a national telecommunications policy that strongly favored\n\ncompetition in local telephone markets.\"           Global NAPs I, 396 F.3d\n\nat 18; P.R. Tel. Co. v. Telecomms. Regulatory Bd., 189 F.3d 1, 7\n\n(1st Cir. 1999); see also Verizon Md. Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,\n\n535 U.S. 635, 638 (2002); AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utils. Bd., 525 U.S.\n\n366, 371 (1999).     To achieve this goal, the TCA requires the former\n\nlocal phone monopolies, called incumbent local exchange carriers\n\n(ILECs), to allow competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) to\n\ninterconnect with their networks.            See 47 U.S.C. § 251(c)(2).\n\nInterconnection permits customers of one local exchange carrier to\n\nmake calls to, and receive calls from, customers of other local\n\nexchange carriers.       Global NAPs II, 427 F.3d at 36.           The TCA also\n\nrequires   the   ILECs    to   negotiate   in    good   faith    the    terms   of\n\ninterconnection      agreements    with    the   CLECs.         See    47   U.S.C.\n\n§   251(c)(1).        \"These      agreements      provide    the       terms    of\n\ninterconnection and 'fulfill the duties' enumerated in § 251.\"\n\nGlobal NAPs II, 427 F.3d at 37 (quoting 47 U.S.C. § 251(c)(1)).\n\n           Section       252    prescribes       the    process        by    which\n\ninterconnection agreements are to be formed.                47 U.S.C. § 252.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fUnder    this     provision,     if    negotiations     between     local   exchange\n\ncarriers do not result in a final agreement, either party can\n\npetition the relevant state commission to arbitrate unresolved\n\nissues.     See id. § 252(b)(1).          The state commission must limit its\n\nconsideration        of    the   agreement      to    the    matters    specifically\n\npresented in the petition for arbitration and in the response. See\n\nid. § 252(b)(4)(A).           The state commission has \"the authority to\n\ndecide     the    open     issues     between   the    parties,     and   to   impose\n\nconditions on the parties for the implementation of the terms of\n\narbitration into an agreement,\" Global NAPs I, 396 F.3d at 19\n\n(citing 47 U.S.C. § 252(b)(4)(C)), so long as its resolutions are\n\nconsistent with § 251 and any regulations promulgated by the FCC,\n\nsee   47   U.S.C.     §§    252(c)(1),     253(a).          Once   an   agreement   is\n\nconcluded, it is submitted to the state commission for final\n\napproval.        Id. § 252(e).\n\n             State commission decisions are subject to judicial review\n\nin federal court under 47 U.S.C. § 252(e)(6):\n\n             In any case in which a State commission makes\n             a determination under this section, any party\n             aggrieved by such determination may bring an\n             action in an appropriate Federal district\n             court to determine whether the agreement or\n             statement meets the requirements of section\n             251 of this title and this section.\n\nA.           Reciprocal Compensation and Access Charges\n\n             The underlying issue on appeal is whether, as Global NAPs\n\nargues, the FCC's ISP Remand Order preempted state commissions from\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fregulating   intercarrier    compensation       for    all    ISP-bound   calls.\n\nVerizon and the DTE take the position that the FCC only expressly\n\npreempted state regulation of intercarrier compensation for \"local\"\n\nISP-bound calls.     This issue requires a brief discussion of the\n\ndistinction between local and \"interexchange\" calling and the\n\ndifferent mechanisms of intercarrier compensation that apply to\n\nthem.\n\n            The FCC and the DTE have maintained a distinction between\n\n\"local\"    and   \"interexchange\"     traffic.         See    Local   Competition\n\nProvisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Local Competition\n\nOrder) ¶¶ 1033-35, 11 F.C.C.R. 15499, 16012-14 (1996) (drawing the\n\ndistinction). Local traffic stays within the boundaries of a local\n\ncalling area.     Interexchange (or \"non-local\") traffic crosses the\n\nboundaries of a local calling area and is generally subject to toll\n\nor   long-distance      charges      paid     by      the     calling     party.1\n\nTraditionally,     local   calling    areas     have    been    geographically\n\ndefined.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Interexchange traffic consists of so-called \"local toll\"\ncalls, which cross the boundaries of local calling areas but remain\nwithin a local access and transport area (LATA), and \"long\ndistance\" calls, which cross the boundaries of LATAs.       See SBC\nCommc'ns Inc. v. FCC, 407 F.3d 1223, 1227 (D.C. Cir. 2005)\n(\"IntraLATA service is what consumers generally know as local\nservice; intraLATA 'toll' calls, however, encompass those long-\ndistance calls that do not travel beyond the borders of a single\nLATA.\"); SBC Commc'ns, Inc. v. FCC, 154 F.3d 226, 231 n.3 (5th Cir\n1998); Mich. Bell Tel. Co. v. Chapelle, 222 F. Supp. 2d 905, 909\nn.6 (E.D. Mich. 2002).\n\n                                     -7-\n\f          Intercarrier compensation comes into play whenever two or\n\nmore carriers collaborate to complete a phone call. Whether a call\n\nis \"local\" or \"interexchange\" generally makes a difference in what\n\nregime of intercarrier compensation -- reciprocal compensation or\n\naccess charges -- applies to that call.\n\n          The TCA requires interconnecting local exchange carriers\n\n(LECs) to establish \"reciprocal compensation arrangements,\" 47\n\nU.S.C. § 251(b)(5), under which the originating LEC compensates the\n\nterminating     LEC   for    the    transport     and    termination    of\n\ntelecommunications traffic.        See Global NAPs II, 427 F.3d at 36\n\n(citing 47 C.F.R. § 51.701).       The FCC, in its initial regulations\n\nimplementing the TCA, limited reciprocal compensation obligations\n\n\"to [telecommunications] traffic that originates and terminates\n\nwithin a local area,\" leaving interexchange calls outside the\n\nreciprocal    compensation   regime.      See   Local   Competition   Order\n\n¶ 1034, 11 F.C.C.R at 16013; see also Global NAPs II, 427 F.3d at\n\n36-37.\n\n          In those regulations, the FCC made clear that it was\n\nleaving in place the pre-existing access charge regime that applied\n\nto interexchange calls:\n\n          [A]s a legal matter, . . . transport and\n          termination of local traffic are different\n          services than access service for long distance\n          telecommunications. . . . The [TCA] preserves\n          the legal distinctions between charges for\n          transport and termination of local traffic and\n          interstate   and   intrastate    charges   for\n          terminating long-distance traffic.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fLocal    Competition        Order    ¶   1033,   11    F.C.C.R.     at     16012-13;\n\nsee also id. ¶ 1035, 11 F.C.C.R. at 16013 (\"Traffic originating or\n\nterminating outside of the applicable local area would be subject\n\nto interstate and intrastate access charges.\").\n\n             Importantly,      the    FCC's    initial   TCA    regulations     also\n\nreaffirmed the ability of states to regulate intrastate access\n\ncharges.     As a result, Verizon's intrastate access charge tariffs\n\nfor all phone calls are approved by the DTE.\n\n             In its initial TCA regulations, the FCC also left with\n\nthe state commissions the power to define local calling areas\n\n\"consistent with [their] historical practice of defining local\n\nservice areas for wireline LECs,\" and decided that the states\n\nshould \"determine whether intrastate transport and termination of\n\ntraffic between competing LECs, where a portion of their local\n\nservice areas are not the same, should be governed by section\n\n251(b)(5)'s      reciprocal         compensation      obligations     or     whether\n\nintrastate access charges should apply to the portions of their\n\nlocal service areas that are different.\"               Id. ¶ 1035, 11 F.C.C.R.\n\nat 16013.\n\nB.           Global NAPs' VNXX System\n\n             Under the traditional system for rating calls, whether a\n\ncall    is   \"local\"   or    \"interexchange\"       depends     on   geographically\n\ndefined local calling areas.              The DTE established the existing\n\ngeographic local calling area structure for Massachusetts after a\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fgeneric    proceeding     \"in   which     all   interested    Parties    had   the\n\nopportunity     to    comment.\"     Verizon      implements    this   system    by\n\ncomparing the \"NXX\" numbers (the \"NXX\" is the middle three digits\n\nof a ten-digit phone number) of the caller and the recipient.                  The\n\n\"NXX\" has generally been associated with a particular \"switch\"\n\n(that   is,     the    equipment   that    routes    phone    calls     to   their\n\ndestination) physically located within a local calling area; NXXs\n\nhave thus served as proxies for geographic location.                  This means\n\nthat if the NXX numbers of the caller and the recipient were within\n\nthe same local calling area, one could assume that the caller and\n\nrecipient were actually physically within the same calling area and\n\nbill the call as a local call.\n\n              Global NAPs has the ability to assign its customers\n\n\"virtual\" NXXs (VNXX), so that a Global NAPs customer can be given\n\nVNXX numbers that are different than those that would normally be\n\nassigned to him based on his physical location.                 This allows a\n\nparty to call what appears to be a \"local\" number, although behind\n\nthe scenes that call is actually routed to a different local\n\ncalling area.         When the party making such a call is a Verizon\n\ncustomer, the call is transmitted outside the local calling area by\n\nVerizon.\n\n              Many of Global NAPs' ISP customers use VNXX arrangements,\n\nand many of these ISPs' end-user customers use Verizon for local\n\nphone service.        To access the Internet, the end-user dials in to a\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fVNXX number assigned to his or her own local calling area.    Then,\n\nVerizon transports the call across local calling areas to Global\n\nNAPs' point of interconnection with the Verizon network.     Global\n\nNAPs and Verizon agree that \"[u]nder VNXX arrangements, the Verizon\n\nend user's call to the ISP's server is toll-free [to the end user]\n\nwhether or not the ISP's server is located in the same local\n\nexchange area in which the end-user originates the call.\" (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nC.        The ISP Traffic Debate\n\n          The treatment of intercarrier compensation for ISP-bound\n\ntraffic has been a matter of considerable debate in recent years.\n\nCalls to ISPs tend to be long, and generally go exclusively from\n\nthe ISP customer to the ISP.   This has created opportunities for\n\nregulatory arbitrage.   For example, in the context of reciprocal\n\ncompensation, since reciprocal compensation flows from the LEC\n\nwhose customer makes the phone call to the LEC whose customer\n\nreceives the phone call, an LEC with a high proportion of ISP\n\ncustomers -- as Global NAPs has -- stands to gain a windfall in a\n\nreciprocal compensation scheme which includes traffic to an ISP.\n\nSee Global NAPs II, 427 F.3d at 37 (citing Bell Atl. Tel. Cos. v.\n\nFCC, 206 F.3d 1, 2-3 (D.C. Cir. 2000)).2\n\n\n     2\n       Global NAPs II involved the question of whether the\ninterpretation of a provision of an interconnection agreement by\none state commission precluded a different interpretation by\nanother state commission of an identically worded provision. 427\nF.3d at 48-49.   That case involved a different interconnection\n\n                               -11-\n\f            The FCC has issued several orders related to intercarrier\n\ncompensation for ISP-bound traffic.             In 1999, the FCC ruled that\n\nISP-bound    traffic   was    not    subject    to    reciprocal       compensation\n\nobligations under 47 U.S.C. § 251, although it left to state\n\ncommissions    the   ability    to    conclude      \"pursuant     to   contractual\n\nprinciples    or   other     legal   or   equitable       considerations,      that\n\nreciprocal compensation is an appropriate interim . . . rule\"\n\npending final FCC rulemaking on the matter.                   Local Competition\n\nProvisions in the Telecomms. Act of 1996 (Internet Traffic Order)\n\n¶¶ 26, 27, 14 F.C.C.R. 3689, 3705-06 (1999).\n\n            The D.C. Circuit vacated the Internet Traffic Order on\n\nMarch 24, 2000 and remanded to the FCC, \"finding that the FCC's\n\nrationale for treating ISP-bound traffic as interstate traffic for\n\nthe purposes of reciprocal compensation was inadequate.\"                    Global\n\nNAPs II, 427 F.3d at 39 (citing Bell Atl. Tel. Cos., 206 F.3d at\n\n9).   On April 27, 2001, the FCC issued an order in response to the\n\nD.C. Circuit's remand, holding once again that the \"provisions of\n\nsection 251(b)(5) do not extend to ISP-bound traffic\" but resting\n\nits decision on a different legal ground.                    Local Competition\n\nProvisions in the Telecomms. Act of 1996 (ISP Remand Order) ¶ 1-2,\n\n16 F.C.C.R. 9151, 9153 (2001).            The FCC also provided an interim\n\nintercarrier    compensation        regime    for    at   least   some   ISP-bound\n\ntraffic to supplant existing state regimes going forward.                     This\n\n\nagreement than that at issue here.             See id. at 36 n.1.\n\n                                       -12-\n\finterim regime was meant to limit opportunities for regulatory\n\narbitrage.   It is undisputed that this interim regime preempts\n\nstate commission regulation of intercarrier compensation for local\n\nISP-bound calls.   The question here is whether the preemptive\n\neffect extends to the interexchange ISP-bound calls at issue here.\n\n          The D.C. Circuit held that the FCC's new legal grounds as\n\nexpressed in the ISP Remand Order were still inadequate. See\n\nWorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, 288 F.3d 429, 433-34 (D.C.

See Developing a Unified\n\nIntercarrier Compensation Regime (Intercarrier Compensation NPRM),\n\n16 F.C.C.R. 9610 (2001); see also Developing a Unified Intercarrier\n\nCompensation Regime (Intercarrier Compensation FNPRM), 20 F.C.C.R.\n\n4685 (2005) (further notice of proposed rulemaking).\n\n                                 II.\n\n                        Procedural History\n\n          Verizon and Global NAPs began the negotiation process for\n\na new interconnection agreement in 2002.     Global NAPs I, 396 F.3d\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fat 19-20.    On July 30, 2002, Global NAPs filed a petition for\n\narbitration with the DTE for resolution of a number of open\n\ndisputes concerning the proposed interconnection agreement, id. at\n\n20, including whether VNXX calls should be treated as local or\n\ninterexchange for purposes of intercarrier compensation.           Included\n\nwith this petition was a marked-up version of the interconnection\n\nagreement, reflecting Global NAPs' proposed changes. Verizon filed\n\nits response to Global NAPs' petition on August 22, 2002, including\n\nits own marked-up version of the interconnection agreement.             The\n\nparties filed direct testimony with the DTE on September 10, 2002.\n\nAn evidentiary hearing was held on October 9, 2002, and the parties\n\nsubmitted briefs on October 21, 28, and 30, 2002.\n\n            With respect to the VNXX issue, Global NAPs argued that\n\nallowing Verizon to impose access charges on such calls would\n\nthwart technological advances.       Indeed, Global NAPs argued that\n\nVNXX traffic should be treated as local traffic, and therefore be\n\nsubject to the state reciprocal compensation regime or, to the\n\nextent the traffic was ISP-bound, the federal interim compensation\n\nregime. As detailed below, during the course of the administrative\n\nproceedings Global NAPs also made clear its position that the ISP\n\nRemand   Order   had   preempted   the    DTE's   authority   to   regulate\n\nintercarrier compensation for all ISP-bound traffic, while leaving\n\nin place the DTE's ability to regulate intercarrier compensation\n\nfor other intrastate calls.\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f            Verizon argued that the entire VNXX system was simply a\n\nway for Global NAPs to engage in regulatory arbitrage.            In effect,\n\nVerizon argued, Global NAPs' VNXX system was a way to provide toll-\n\nfree services to Verizon customers (so that Verizon would not get\n\nany fees from those customers), deprive Verizon of the access fees\n\nit would normally get for toll-free calls, and instead require\n\nVerizon to pay Global NAPs reciprocal compensation.\n\n            The DTE issued an order on December 12, 2002, resolving\n\nall open issues.    With respect to the VNXX issue, the DTE rejected\n\nGlobal NAPs' position that all VNXX calls be treated as local for\n\nintercarrier compensation purposes. It found Global NAPs' position\n\nwould create \"considerable market distortion based on an implicit\n\nVerizon subsidy of [Global NAPs'] operations.\"            Instead, the DTE\n\ndecided that \"VNXX calls will be rated as local or toll based on\n\nthe geographic end points of the call.\"            It further found that\n\nVerizon's proposal to have the parties collaborate to determine the\n\ngeographic end points of VNXX calls was \"an acceptable starting\n\npoint,\" and ordered the parties to submit contract language with\n\nthe final agreement to implement Verizon's solution.\n\n            The DTE also rejected Global NAPs' arguments based on the\n\nISP Remand Order, finding that the order \"explicitly recognized\n\nthat intrastate access regimes in place prior to the Act remain\n\nunchanged until further state commission action\" and \"continues to\n\nrecognize   that   calls   that   travel   to   points   beyond   the   local\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fexchange are access calls.\"      The DTE expressed its intent to\n\ncontinue enforcement of the existing intrastate access charge\n\nregime.\n\n           The DTE ordered the parties to incorporate the arbitrated\n\nterms into a final interconnection agreement by January 2, 2003;\n\nthis deadline was later extended to January 17, 2003 on the\n\nparties' joint motion.    Global NAPs I, 396 F.3d at 20    After the\n\nDTE issued its December 12 order, the parties began negotiating\n\nfinal terms of interconnection.        However, on January 9, 2003,\n\nGlobal NAPs informed Verizon that it refused to negotiate any\n\nfurther.   Instead, it attempted to adopt the terms of a different\n\nagreement between Verizon and Sprint.3     Id.\n\n           Verizon responded on January 17, 2003 by filing a motion\n\nfor approval of a final arbitrated agreement, attaching a proposed\n\nfinal agreement.    Id.   This agreement contained the following\n\nprovision, § 7.3.8, to deal with the VNXX compensation issue:\n\n\"[Global NAPs] shall pay Verizon's originating access charges for\n\nall [VNXX] Traffic originated by a Verizon Customer, and [Global\n\nNAPs] shall pay Verizon's terminating access charges for all [VNXX]\n\ntraffic originated by a [Global NAPs] customer.\"          It is this\n\nprovision of the agreement that Global NAPs challenges, to the\n\n\n     3\n       \"[T]he TCA requires ILECs to allow any requesting CLEC to\nadopt the terms and conditions of any interconnection agreement it\nhas with any other CLEC, provided that agreement has been approved\nby the requisite state telecommunications commission.\" Global NAPs\nI, 396 F.3d at 19 (citing 47 U.S.C. § 252(i)).\n\n                                -16-\n\fextent that it requires payment of access charges for ISP-bound\n\ntraffic.\n\n           In a February 19, 2003 order, the DTE rebuffed Global\n\nNAPs' attempt to opt into the Verizon-Sprint agreement.    Id.   It\n\napproved Verizon's proposed final agreement and ordered the parties\n\nto sign and file that agreement.   The parties eventually4 filed a\n\nfinal agreement on March 18, 2003, including § 7.3.8, and it is the\n\nagreement currently in effect between the parties.\n\n           In the meantime, on December 30, 2002, Global NAPs\n\nbrought an action in federal district court challenging the merits\n\nof the DTE's arbitration determination. Global NAPs I, 396 F.3d at\n\n20. In its complaint, Global NAPs asserted that the DTE \"lacked\n\njurisdiction to impose access charges on ISP bound traffic.\"     It\n\nalso complained that the DTE's reasoning, at least with respect to\n\nISP-bound traffic, was \"wholly at odds with the ISP Remand Order.\"5\n\nThe February 19, 2003 ruling by the DTE rejecting Global NAPs'\n\nattempt to opt in to the Sprint-Verizon agreement led Global NAPs\n\nto file a second action in district court, on March 3, 2003.\n\n\n     4\n       On March 14, 2003, the DTE, noting that the Global NAPs had\nstill not complied with its February 19, 2003 order, directed the\nparties to file a fully executed interconnection agreement.\n     5\n       In its complaint, Global NAPs challenged a number of other\ndeterminations made by the DTE, including the imposition of\ntransport costs on Global NAPs and the rejection of Global NAPs'\nproposal to expand local calling areas. On October 28, 2005, after\nthe district court's summary judgment decision leading to this\nappeal, Global NAPs stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of\nits remaining challenges to the DTE's decision.\n\n                               -17-\n\f          On March 11, 2003, Global NAPs, Verizon and the DTE moved\n\nto consolidate Global NAPs' two federal actions, and asked the\n\ndistrict court to first resolve the question of whether Global NAPs\n\nwas permitted to opt in to the Sprint-Verizon agreement before\n\nruling on the challenge to the arbitration agreement.    On May 12,\n\n2004, the district court affirmed the DTE's decision not to allow\n\nGlobal NAPs to opt in to the Sprint-Verizon agreement. Global NAPs\n\nI, 396 F.3d at 21.    On January 19, 2005, in Global NAPs I, we\n\naffirmed that judgment.   Id. at 28.\n\n          Global NAPs then revived its challenge to the DTE's\n\nDecember 12, 2002 arbitration order by filing a motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment in the district court on May 20, 2005.6     Global\n\nNAPs argued that in the ISP Remand Order, \"[t]he FCC expressed in\n\nunambiguous language its intention to assert exclusive jurisdiction\n\nover intercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic.\"     Thus, it\n\nargued, the DTE lacked the authority to require Global NAPs to\n\nenter into an interconnection agreement that included § 7.3.8,\n\nwhich required Global NAPs pay Verizon access charges for all VNXX\n\n\n\n     6\n       After this court's opinion in Global NAPs I, Verizon\ndemanded that Global NAPs pay the accrued access charges that\nGlobal NAPs had failed to pay during the pendency of litigation.\nAs of February 2005, according to Verizon, Global NAPs had accrued\nmore than $42 million in unpaid access charges. Verizon threatened\nto cut off service to Global NAPs if payment was not made. Global\nNAPs filed for a preliminary injunction in the district court, and\nthe district court granted that request, on the condition that\nGlobal NAPs post a $1 million bond, and expedited the briefing\nschedule for the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\n                               -18-\n\ftraffic, including traffic bound for ISPs.7          Global NAPs based its\n\npreemption argument solely on the FCC's ISP Remand Order.\n\n            Verizon and the DTE filed motions for partial summary\n\njudgment in response, arguing that the ISP Remand Order did not\n\npreempt the DTE from imposing access charges for non-local ISP-\n\nbound traffic, but dealt only with the narrow issue of reciprocal\n\ncompensation for ISP-bound calls within a local calling area.\n\n            On September 21, 2005, the district court granted Verizon\n\nand the DTE's motions for partial summary judgment.             The district\n\ncourt correctly noted that it was \"unclear\" whether the ISP Remand\n\nOrder preempted state commissions from imposing access charges on\n\nall ISP-bound traffic.          But it did not reach the merits of that\n\nquestion; it held that since Global NAPs \"voluntarily sought\n\narbitration by DTE after the FCC issued the ISP Remand Order and\n\nthus impliedly consented to DTE's jurisdiction over its petition,\n\nit may not now challenge DTE's authority on the basis of unsettled\n\nlaw   in   order   to   avoid   the   consequences   of   its   own   business\n\nstrategy.\"\n\n            Global NAPs appeals, arguing (1) that it did not waive\n\nany claim regarding the preemptive effect of the FCC's ISP Remand\n\n\n      7\n       Global NAPs argued that its petition for arbitration did not\nraise the issue of whether access charges could be imposed on ISP-\nbound traffic, and so, under 47 U.S.C. § 252(b)(4)(A), the DTE\ncould not decide the issue.      The district court rejected this\nargument, finding that it was sufficient that Global NAPs had\nraised the issue of access charges for VNXX traffic generally to\nthe DTE. Global NAPs does not press this argument on appeal.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fOrder or impliedly consent to the DTE's authority to decide the\n\nissue which had been preempted by the ISP Remand Order, and so the\n\ndistrict court erred in not reaching the merits of its claim; and\n\n(2) that this court should reach the merits and find that the ISP\n\nRemand Order preempts the DTE from imposing access charges for ISP-\n\nbound traffic.8\n\n                                        III.\n\n            The District Court's \"Jurisdictional\" Holding\n\n            The district court's conclusion that Global NAPs could\n\nnot obtain review of the DTE's preemption decision, because Global\n\nNAPs had \"impliedly consented to the DTE's jurisdiction over its\n\npetition,\"       was   error.   The     issue   of    preemption   was   squarely\n\npresented to the DTE, the DTE decided this issue of federal law,\n\nand Global NAPs challenged that decision before the district court.\n\nThe district court should have reviewed the DTE's conclusion, as it\n\nwould any other conclusion of federal law by a state commission.\n\n            Global NAPs admits that in its petition for arbitration,\n\nit   did   not    explicitly    spell    out    its   views   with   respect   to\n\n\n\n\n      8\n       On November 1, 2005, Global NAPs moved this court to issue\na preliminary injunction to stop Verizon from cutting off service\npending appeal. On November 2, 2005, we issued an order enjoining\nVerizon from cutting off service to Global NAPs, conditioned on\nGlobal NAPs' payment of additional security in an amount determined\nby the district court, and expedited our review.      The district\ncourt, on November 9, 2005, entered an order requiring $15 million\nin additional security, which Global NAPs posted on November 14,\n2005.\n\n                                        -20-\n\fintercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic,9 but points to a\n\nnumber of instances during the administrative proceedings in which\n\nit did.   In testimony during the hearing before the DTE on October\n\n9, 2005, Global NAPs' expert, Lee Selwyn, testified with respect to\n\nthe VNXX issue as follows:\n\n           Let me first preface my remarks on [the VNXX\n           issue] by making the point that we are\n           speaking here of traffic originating by\n           Verizon customers, terminating to Global NAPs,\n           that is not ISP-bound traffic.       ISP-bound\n           traffic is not subject to any treatment other\n           than the reciprocal-compensation arrangement\n           as set forth in the FCC's ISP Remand Order.\n\nIn its brief to the DTE after the hearing, Global NAPs reiterated\n\nthis point:\n\n           In the ISP Remand Order, the FCC determined\n           that inter-carrier compensation for ISP-bound\n           traffic is solely within the jurisdiction of\n           the FCC and that on a going forward basis,\n           state commissions have been preempted from\n           addressing the issue. Thus the Department has\n           no jurisdiction to impose access charges or\n           other    limitations     on    ISP    in-bound\n           traffic. . . . The Arbitration Order should\n           be clear that the Interconnection Agreement is\n           not   intended   to   regulate   inter-carrier\n           compensation for ISP-bound traffic in any\n           manner.\n\nGlobal NAPs made the same argument in its reply brief to the DTE\n\nand in a February 27, 2003 letter to the DTE after the DTE issued\n\nits December 12, 2002 order.    The DTE rejected these arguments,\n\n\n\n     9\n       Global NAPs states that it did not do so because it was\nlaboring under the impression that there was no real dispute on the\nissue.\n\n                                -21-\n\frequiring Global NAPs to pay access charges to Verizon for ISP-\n\nbound VNXX traffic under the intrastate tariffs.\n\n            Global NAPs also argues that it could not voluntarily\n\nconsent to the jurisdiction of the DTE to determine access charges,\n\nbecause the TCA requires arbitration before the DTE under 47 U.S.C.\n\n§ 252(b) when negotiation leaves open issues, and because \"[t]he\n\nDTE may not enlarge its own subject matter jurisdiction beyond that\n\ngranted to it by the Act and FCC rulings implementing the TCA.\n\nNeither may DTE jurisdiction be expanded by agreement of DTE\n\nlitigants.\"\n\n            Global NAPs' use of the phraseology of jurisdiction may\n\nhave led to some confusion.     Questions about federal preemption of\n\nstate law in this context may or may not be properly thought of as\n\n\"jurisdictional\" in nature.         Cf. Wolf v. Reliance Standard Life\n\nIns. Co., 71 F.3d 444, 446-49 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that ERISA\n\npreemption    is   not   jurisdictional    but   a     waivable   affirmative\n\ndefense).\n\n            In the end, however the claim is characterized, Global\n\nNAPs properly presented an issue of federal preemption to the DTE,\n\nand the DTE rejected Global NAPs' argument.            This does not mean it\n\nwaived   federal   court   review   of   the   DTE's    conclusion   on   that\n\nquestion.     See Global NAPs I, 396 F.3d at 21-22 (\"[T]he federal\n\ncourts have subject matter jurisdiction to review state agency\n\ndeterminations under the TCA for compliance with federal law,\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fpursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\"); United States v.

Rotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Before       reaching    the    merits     of     Global    NAPs'   claim,\n\nhowever, we must deal with an issue raised by the DTE, but rejected\n\nby Verizon, regarding the appropriate standard of review of state\n\ncommission     conclusions    of    federal      law       made    pursuant   to   an\n\narbitration under 47 U.S.C. § 252(b).\n\nA.        Standard of Review             of    the    DTE's       Determination    of\n          Preemption Issue\n\n          The DTE argues that \"judicial review of an interpretation\n\nof the [TCA] by a state commission in an arbitration should be\n\nlimited   to     the    question     whether         the     state     commission's\n\ninterpretation of the [TCA] is reasonable.\"10                     The DTE draws an\n\n\n     10\n       To the extent the DTE is arguing for a broad, Chevron-like\ndeference to the state agency whenever it has made a determination\nregarding the meaning of an FCC order, see Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.\nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), that line of\n\n                                     -23-\n\fanalogy to the deferential standard of review given arbitral awards\n\nunder the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), as expressed in cases like\n\nJCI Communications, Inc. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical\n\nWorkers, Local 103, 324 F.3d 42, 48 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n             The DTE argues that because Congress used the term\n\n\"arbitration\"    in    §   252(b),   we   should   treat   state   commission\n\narbitral decisions with the same deference as arbitral decisions\n\nunder the FAA, which predates the TCA.             The DTE points out that\n\nCongress used terms other than \"arbitration\" to describe other\n\ntypes of actions taken by state commissions.\n\n             The DTE's position has no basis either in the TCA, its\n\nlegislative history, or in case law.           The DTE points to nothing\n\nmore than the use of the term \"arbitration\" in the TCA.             The DTE's\n\nargument, furthermore, is in flat conflict with our holding in\n\nGlobal NAPs I, where, in the context of review of a decision\n\npursuant to an arbitration, we held that determinations of federal\n\nlaw by state agencies under the TCA were subject to de novo review.\n\nSee 396 F.3d at 23.        We noted in Global NAPs I that \"[e]ach of the\n\nCircuits that has addressed the standard of review under the TCA\n\nhas   held    that    where   the    state   agency   determination     rests\n\n\n\nreasoning has already been foreclosed by this court in Global NAPs\nI: \"Since the FCC, and not the individual state commissions, is the\nagency with the power granted by Congress to administer the TCA,\nthrough the formulation of policy, rulemaking, and regulation, we\ndo not afford deference to the DTE's interpretation of the statute\nunder [Chevron].\" 396 F.3d at 23 n.7.\n\n                                     -24-\n\fprincipally on an interpretation of the TCA, de novo review is\n\napplied.\"    Id. at 23 n.8.            A number of circuits have reached this\n\nconclusion       in   the    context     of   federal    court   review     of   state\n\ncommission arbitrations under the TCA.                  See, e.g., MCI Telecomms.\n\nCorp. v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co., 376 F.3d 539, 548 (6th Cir. 2004) (de\n\nnovo review of questions of federal law after state commission\n\narbitration); Ind. Bell Tel. Co. v. McCarty, 362 F.3d 378, 383 (7th\n\nCir. 2004) (same); MCImetro Access Transmission Servs., Inc. v.\n\nBellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 352 F.3d 872, 876 (4th Cir. 2003)\n\n(same).\n\n             The DTE states that it \"does not seek consideration of\n\nbroader questions [than review of arbitration] regarding the proper\n\nstandard of judicial review for other determinations by state\n\ncommissions under the [TCA].\"                 If we were to accept the DTE's\n\nposition, it would create a strange result. The standard of review\n\nwould     vary    not       by   the    nature    of    the   question      presented\n\n(interpretations of the TCA) but by the nature of the proceeding in\n\nwhich the question is presented.                 Thus, under the DTE's view, a\n\nstate commission's conclusions of federal law when it is acting as\n\nan arbitrator under § 252(b) would be subject to deferential\n\nreview, but the very same conclusions about the TCA made pursuant\n\nto   other   state      commission      proceedings,      such   as   the   §    252(e)\n\napproval process, would be subject to de novo review.

See, e.g.,\n\nISP Remand Order ¶ 1, 16 F.C.C.R. at 9153 (\"[W]e reaffirm our\n\nprevious conclusion [in the Internet Traffic Order] that traffic\n\ndelivered to an ISP is predominantly interstate access traffic\n\nsubject to [the FCC's jurisdiction].\"); id. ¶ 57, 16 F.C.C.R. at\n\n9177-78 (finding that ISP-bound traffic is \"properly characterized\n\nas interstate access\" and thus is subject to FCC jurisdiction).\n\nEven   assuming   that   this   language   could   cover   the   non-local\n\nISP-bound calls at issue here, it does not help answer the question\n\nbefore us.    A matter may be subject to FCC jurisdiction, without\n\nthe FCC having exercised that jurisdiction and preempted state\n\nregulation.   The question before us is whether the FCC intended in\n\nthe ISP Remand Order to exercise its jurisdiction over the precise\n\nissue here, to the exclusion of state regulation.          See Qwest Corp.\n\nv. Scott, 380 F.3d 367, 372 (8th Cir. 2004) (\"There is no dispute\n\nin this case that the FCC has the power to preempt states from\n\nestablishing standards and requiring reports relating to special\n\naccess services.    The fighting issue is whether the FCC actually\n\nintended to do so . . . .\").\n\n           In this context, the law requires a clear indication that\n\nan agency intends to preempt state regulation. Hillsborough County\n\nv. Automated Med. Labs. Inc., 471 U.S. 707, 718 (1985) (\"[B]ecause\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fagencies normally address problems in a detailed manner and can\n\nspeak through a variety of means, . . . we can expect that they\n\nwill    make    their    intentions   clear    if     they    intend     for     their\n\nregulations to be exclusive.\"); see also Qwest Corp., 380 F.3d at\n\n374    (finding     no   preemption    of     state    regulation        where     FCC\n\nregulations were \"notably agnostic\" on the question).12\n\n               The requirement of a clear indication of the agency's\n\nintent to preempt is especially important in the context of the\n\nTCA,    which    \"divide[d]     authority    among    the    FCC   and   the     state\n\ncommissions in an unusual regime of 'cooperative federalism,' with\n\nthe intended effect of leaving state commissions free, where\n\nwarranted, to reflect the policy choices made by their states.\"\n\nGlobal NAPs II, 427 F.3d at 46 (quoting P.R. Tel. Co. v. Telecomms.\n\nRegulatory Bd., 189 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1999)).                    As we noted in\n\nGlobal NAPs II, \"[t]he goal of preserving a role for the state\n\nregulatory commissions is reflected in a number of provisions in\n\nthe TCA.\"       Id. at 46-47.\n\n               Also relevant is Congress's express pre-TCA instruction\n\nthat \"nothing in this chapter [including 47 U.S.C. §§ 251, 252]\n\nshall be construed to apply or to give the Commission jurisdiction\n\n\n\n       12\n       This requirement of clarity applies to express preemption,\nsee Hillsborough County, 471 U.S. at 713, and to certain types of\nimplied preemption, see id. at 718 (describing requirements of\n\"field\" preemption); Geier v. Am.

Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 476 U.S. at\n\n370, 379 (relying on § 152(b) to find that the FCC could not\n\npreempt state law depreciation regulation).\n\n             With these principles in mind, we turn to the facts of\n\nthis case.    Global NAPs does not challenge the DTE's determination\n\nthat whether a call is local or \"interexchange\" should be based on\n\nthe geographic endpoints of the call, or the decision to impose\n\naccess charges on non-ISP-bound VNXX calls.           Rather, the challenge\n\nis to the DTE's imposition of access charges on that subset of VNXX\n\ncalls that are bound for an ISP.        Global NAPs argues that we should\n\ndetermine the scope of preemption by limiting our examination to\n\nthe text of the ISP Remand Order.            Verizon and the DTE13 ask us to\n\nalso consider the context in which the order was passed and the\n\nregulatory objectives of the order; they argue that the FCC only\n\nintended to preempt state regulation of intercarrier compensation\n\nfor local ISP-bound traffic and did not address the question before\n\nthe DTE.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n       The DTE has joined almost all of Verizon's arguments on the\nmerits. At oral argument, the DTE explained that it did not wish\nto join Verizon's arguments to the extent that they reached outside\nthe scope of the arbitration between the parties.\n\n                                      -29-\n\f            Regardless of which approach is used, the ISP Remand\n\nOrder does not clearly preempt state authority to impose access\n\ncharges for interexchange VNXX ISP-bound traffic; it is, at best,\n\nambiguous on the question, and ambiguity is not enough to preempt\n\nstate regulation here.\n\n            Global NAPs cannot point to any language in the order\n\nthat explicitly preempts state regulation of access charges for the\n\nnon-local ISP-bound traffic at issue.                     Instead, Global NAPs'\n\ncentral    argument    is    that,     in    preempting       state    regulation   of\n\nintercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic in the ISP Remand\n\nOrder,    the   FCC    did    not    expressly        limit    itself    to   traffic\n\noriginating and terminating within a local calling area.                            It\n\nsuggests    that      the    interim        federal    regime     of    intercarrier\n\ncompensation established by the ISP Remand Order actually applies\n\nto all ISP-bound calls, so that the preemptive effect of the order\n\nshould extend to the access charges at issue here.                       Global NAPs\n\npoints in particular to paragraph 82 of the ISP Remand Order, in\n\nwhich the FCC stated:\n\n            The interim compensation regime we establish\n            here applies as carriers renegotiate expired\n            or expiring interconnection agreements. . . .\n            This Order does not preempt any state\n            commission decision regarding compensation for\n            ISP-bound traffic for the period prior to the\n            effective date of the interim regime we adopt\n            here. Because we now exercise our authority\n            under section 201 to determine the appropriate\n            intercarrier   compensation    for   ISP-bound\n            traffic, however, state commissions will no\n            longer have authority to address this issue.\n\n                                        -30-\n\fISP Remand Order ¶ 82, 16 F.C.C.R. at 9189.            It argues that if the\n\nFCC   intended   only    to   preempt     state    regulation   of    reciprocal\n\ncompensation for local ISP-bound traffic, it would have expressed\n\nits intent more clearly, by specifying \"local ISP-bound traffic.\"14\n\n           Global NAPs' argument ignores an important distinction.\n\nThe FCC has consistently maintained a distinction between local and\n\n\"interexchange\" calling and the intercarrier compensation regimes\n\nthat apply to them, and reaffirmed that states have authority over\n\nintrastate access charge regimes.             Against the FCC's policy of\n\nrecognizing such a distinction, a clearer showing is required that\n\nthe FCC preempted state regulation of both access charges and\n\nreciprocal   compensation        for   ISP-bound     traffic.        Cf.   Shaw's\n\nSupermarkets, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 884 F.2d 34, 36 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(\"The law that governs an agency's significant departure from its\n\nown prior precedent is clear. The agency cannot do so without\n\nexplicitly recognizing that it is doing so and explaining why.\").\n\n           Indeed,      in    the   ISP   Remand    Order   itself,     the   FCC\n\nreaffirmed the distinction between reciprocal compensation and\n\naccess charges.      It noted that Congress, in passing the TCA, did\n\nnot intend to disrupt the pre-TCA access charge regime, under which\n\n\n      14\n       Global NAPs also argues that we \"confirmed\" the preemptive\neffect of the ISP Remand Order in Global NAPs II, in which we said\nthat the \"FCC . . . made clear that it had exclusive regulatory\nauthority to address the issue, so that state commissions no longer\nhave the power to do the same.\" 427 F.3d at 40. This was not a\nholding of the case; rather, it appeared in the background section\nof the opinion and merely paraphrased ¶ 82 of the ISP Remand Order.\n\n                                       -31-\n\f\"LECs provided access services . . . in order to connect calls that\n\ntravel to points -- both interstate and intrastate -- beyond the\n\nlocal exchange.    In turn, both the Commission and the states had in\n\nplace access regimes applicable to this traffic, which they have\n\ncontinued to modify over time.\"    ISP Remand Order ¶ 37, 16 F.C.C.R.\n\nat 9168.\n\n           Furthermore, the context in which the ISP Remand Order\n\nwas issued casts additional doubt on Global NAPs' contention.        The\n\nSupreme Court has held that in interpreting its own prior cases\n\n\"[i]t is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions,\n\nin every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in\n\nwhich those expressions are used.\"       See Cent. Va. Cmty. Coll. v.\n\nKatz, 126 S.Ct. 990, 996 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(quoting Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 399-400\n\n(1821)).   Such a rule also properly applies to interpretations of\n\nagency orders, especially where the order itself details the\n\nbackground against which it was passed.        See Qwest Corp., 380 F.3d\n\nat 373-74 (\"The FCC's statement . . . is susceptible of a broader\n\ninterpretation if plucked out of context, but we conclude that when\n\nthe [FCC order] is read as a whole, the [FCC's] expressed intent to\n\npreempt    state   regulation   does     not   extend   to   performance\n\nmeasurements and standards.\").\n\n           The issue that necessitated FCC action in the Internet\n\nTraffic Order and the ISP Remand Order was \"whether reciprocal\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\fcompensation obligations apply to the delivery of calls from one\n\nLEC's end-user customer to an ISP in the same local calling area\n\nthat is served by a competing LEC.\"                   ISP Remand Order ¶ 13, 16\n\nF.C.C.R. at 9159; see also WorldCom, Inc., 288 F.3d at 430 (stating\n\nthat the question before the FCC involved \"calls made to [ISPs]\n\nlocated within the caller's local calling area\").                          The order\n\nexpressly holds at a number of points that ISP-bound traffic is not\n\nsubject to reciprocal compensation under § 251(b)(5).                         See ISP\n\nRemand     Order    ¶    23,   16   F.C.C.R.     at   9163   (\"In   [the    statutory\n\nanalysis] section, we reexamine our findings in the [Internet\n\nTraffic Order] and conclude that ISP-bound traffic is not subject\n\nto   the   reciprocal         compensation     requirement     in   section    251(b)\n\n. . . .\"); id. ¶ 44, 16 F.C.C.R. at 9172 (\"ISP-bound traffic . . .\n\nis excepted from the scope of the 'telecommunications' subject to\n\nreciprocal compensation under section 251(b)(5).\").                      There is no\n\nexpress statement that ISP-bound traffic is not subject to access\n\ncharges.\n\n             In issuing the ISP Remand Order and setting forth the\n\ninterim federal intercarrier compensation regime, the FCC was\n\nfocused on limiting the problem of regulatory arbitrage. Id. ¶ 77,\n\n16 F.C.C.R. at 9187 (the interim compensation regime \"serves to\n\nlimit, if not end, the opportunity for regulatory arbitrage\"). In\n\ndiscussing     these      regulatory      arbitrage     opportunities,       the   FCC\n\nmentions     only       the    problems   created      by    requiring     reciprocal\n\n\n                                          -33-\n\fcompensation for ISP-bound traffic.        Id ¶ 68, 16 F.C.C.R. at 9181-\n\n82 (\"Carriers . . . have the incentive to seek out customers,\n\nincluding but not limited to ISPs, with high volumes of incoming\n\ntraffic     that   will   generate     high   reciprocal     compensation\n\npayments.\").15\n\n            This court invited the FCC to file a brief as amicus\n\ncuriae on the question of the preemptive effect of the ISP Remand\n\nOrder.    The FCC's helpful brief, while not taking a position on the\n\noutcome of this appeal, nonetheless supports the conclusion that\n\nthe order did not clearly preempt state regulation of intrastate\n\naccess charges. The brief states that \"[t]he ISP Remand Order does\n\nnot provide a clear answer to [the] question\" of whether the order\n\n\"was intended to preempt states from establishing\" a requirement of\n\nintercarrier compensation for interexchange VNXX ISP-bound calls.\n\nIt notes that \"[i]n some respects, the ISP Remand Order appears to\n\naddress all calls placed to ISPs\" but also that \"the administrative\n\nhistory that led up to the ISP Remand Order indicates that in\n\naddressing    compensation,   the    Commission   was   focused   on   calls\n\nbetween dial-up users and ISPs in a single local calling area.\"\n\n\n\n\n     15\n       Indeed, Verizon suggests that interpreting the ISP Remand\nOrder as preempting state access charge regulation as well as\nreciprocal compensation regulation would create new opportunities\nfor regulatory arbitrage, by requiring Verizon to pay compensation\non all calls to ISPs, including \"toll-free calls to ISPs . . . for\nwhich   [ILECs]  had   previously  received   compensation   under\nestablished rules.\"\n\n                                    -34-\n\fThus it concludes that the ISP Remand Order \"can be read to support\n\nthe interpretation set forth by either party in this dispute.\"\n\n           The FCC further notes that \"in establishing the new\n\ncompensation     scheme     for   ISP-bound     calls,     the    Commission     was\n\nconsidering only calls placed to ISPs located in the same local\n\ncalling   area   as   the    caller.\"      According     to      the   FCC,   \"[t]he\n\nCommission itself has not addressed application of the ISP Remand\n\nOrder to ISP-bound calls outside a local calling area\" or \"decided\n\nthe   implications     of     using      VNXX    numbers      for      intercarrier\n\ncompensation more generally.\"\n\n           In response to the FCC's brief, Global NAPs makes an\n\nargument that the DTE's imposition of access charges on VNXX ISP-\n\nbound traffic \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and\n\nexecution of the full objectives of Congress\" because the charges\n\n\"obstruct the FCC's declared policy of a uniform, rather than\n\npatchwork,     approach      to   the     entire    field        of    intercarrier\n\ncompensation\" and \"obstruct the FCC's effort to implement key\n\npolicies served by the [TCA]: universal service and competition in\n\nthe provision of such service.\"                This particular argument, if\n\nraised at all during initial briefing or oral argument, was barely\n\ndone so and may have been waived.              See United States v. Zannino,\n\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).          Nonetheless, we address the point.\n\n           The Supreme Court has stated that, in determining whether\n\na federal agency regulation impliedly preempts state law because it\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\fposes an obstacle to federal policy, \"a court should not find pre-\n\nemption      too    readily   in   the    absence     of    clear    evidence    of   a\n\nconflict.\"         See Geier v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861, 881,\n\n885 (2000) (finding, in that case, such clear evidence).                        Global\n\nNAPs does not point us to any clear evidence, in the ISP Remand\n\nOrder or elsewhere, that the DTE's imposition of access charges on\n\ninterexchange VNXX ISP-bound calls will obstruct the implementation\n\nof federal objectives.\n\n              As to the FCC's purported policy of a uniform approach to\n\nthe \"entire field\" of intercarrier compensation, the ISP Remand\n\nOrder       was    focused    on   a     particular    issue        of   intercarrier\n\ncompensation; the FCC deferred fuller consideration of a unified\n\nsystem of intercarrier compensation to a future rulemaking.                       See\n\nISP Remand Order ¶ 2, 16 F.C.C.R. at 9153 (\"[I]n this Order we\n\n.   .   .   take    interim   steps    to   limit     the   regulatory      arbitrage\n\nopportunity presented by ISP-bound traffic while we consider the\n\nbroader issues of intercarrier compensation in the [Intercarrier\n\nCompensation NPRM] proceeding.\").                As to the second point about\n\naccess charges serving as an obstacle to the goal of universal\n\nservice and competition for that service, Global NAPs says that the\n\naccess charges will \"virtually eliminate competition in the non-\n\nbroadband internet access market.\"               In the face of the FCC's long-\n\nstanding recognition of state authority over intrastate access\n\ncharges, and in the absence of clear evidence that the access\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\fcharges   here    would   impede    competition,   this   argument   is\n\ninsufficient to find implied preemption.16\n\n          We find that there is a lack of clarity about whether the\n\nISP Remand Order preempts state regulation of the access charges at\n\nissue here.17    Given the requirement of a clear indication that the\n\nFCC has preempted state law, the ISP Remand Order does not have the\n\nbroad preemptive effect that Global NAPs seeks to assign to it.\n\n                                    V.\n\n          We affirm the entry of judgment for Verizon and the DTE.\n\nCosts of appeal are awarded to Verizon and the DTE.        The case is\n\nremanded to the district court for any further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n     16\n       Global NAPs, in its reply to the FCC's amicus brief, also\nasks us to refer the question of the preemptive effect of the ISP\nRemand Order to the FCC under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.\nThis was an argument certainly not discussed in the initial\nbriefing or at oral argument, and we deem it waived. Zannino, 895\nF.2d at 17.\n     17\n       Global NAPs relies on a decision by a Connecticut federal\ndistrict court, S. New Eng. Tel. Co. v. MCI WorldCom Commc'ns, Inc.\n(SNET), 359 F. Supp. 2d 229 (D. Conn. 2005), which held that the\nISP Remand Order was unambiguous in its preemption of state\nregulation of intercarrier compensation for all ISP-bound traffic.\nId. at 232.

Armstrong, Associate General Counsel, on brief for the Federal Communications Commission, amicus curiae.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before LYNCH, Circuit Judge, CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, and HOWARD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy (DTE), acting as an arbitrator of a dispute over an interconnection agreement between Verizon New England, Inc. and Global NAPs, Inc., issued an order requiring Global NAPs to pay Verizon compensation for certain phone calls; the amount Global NAPs owes is at least $42 million. The question before the DTE involved a particular variant on a larger question of allocation of compensation for telephone calls placed to internet service providers (ISPs). The larger question has been addressed in a series of orders from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). At the heart of this case is one such order, the <i>ISP Remand Order.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DTE, in an arbitration order, required Global NAPs to pay Verizon access charges for all \"virtual NXX\" traffic, including non-local ISP-bound traffic, rejecting Global NAPs' argument that state commissions were preempted by the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> from regulating intercarrier compensation for all ISP-bound traffic. Global NAPs filed suit challenging the DTE's conclusion in federal district court. Verizon and the DTE argued that the DTE retained authority to decide the issue because the FCC order only preempted state commission regulation of \"local\" traffic sent to an ISP, and the FCC did not hold that virtual NXX traffic is such local traffic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court never reached the preemption issue, because it found that Global NAPs had implicitly consented to the \"jurisdiction\" of the DTE to resolve the dispute, and so could not later challenge the DTE's jurisdiction to impose access charges for ISP-bound traffic. It granted Verizon and the DTE's motions for partial summary judgment. No party on appeal agrees with that reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we affirm, though on different grounds. A party contesting an issue of whether federal law has preempted a state commission's authority does not waive judicial review of the argument by first presenting it to the commission in the course of an arbitration under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Because the preemption question was not waived, it must be addressed. The issue is one of federal law over which the federal court exercises de novo, not deferential, review. We reach the merits and hold that the FCC did not expressly preempt state regulation of intercarrier compensation for non-local ISP-bound calls as are involved here, leaving the DTE free to impose access charges for such calls under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Regulatory Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior history between these parties is set forth in our opinions in <i>Global Naps, Inc. v.

No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 47 U.S.C.), was enacted \"to end the local telephone monopolies and create a national telecommunications policy that strongly favored competition in local telephone markets.\" <i>Global Naps I,</i> 396 F.3d at 18; <i>P.R.

To achieve this goal, the TCA requires the former local phone monopolies, called incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs), to allow competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) to interconnect with their networks. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 251(c)(2). Interconnection permits customers of one local exchange carrier to make calls to, and receive calls from, customers of other local exchange carriers. <i>Global Naps II,</i> 427 F.3d at 36. The TCA also requires the ILECs to negotiate in good faith the terms of interconnection agreements with the CLECs. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 251(c)(1). \"These agreements provide the terms of interconnection and `fulfill the duties' enumerated in &#167; 251.\" <i>Global Naps II,</i> 427 F.3d at 37 (quoting 47 U.S.C. &#167; 251(c)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 252 prescribes the process by which interconnection agreements are to be formed. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 252. Under this provision, if negotiations between local exchange carriers do not result in a final agreement, either party can petition the relevant state commission to arbitrate unresolved issues. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 252(b)(1). The state commission must limit its consideration of the agreement to the matters specifically presented in the petition for arbitration and in the response. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 252(b)(4)(A). The state commission has \"the authority to decide the open issues between the parties, and to impose conditions on the parties for the implementation of the terms of arbitration into an agreement,\" <i>Global Naps I,</i> 396 F.3d at 19 (citing 47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(b)(4)(C)), so long as its resolutions are consistent with &#167; 251 and any regulations promulgated by the FCC, <i>see</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 252(c)(1), 253(a).

Verizon and the DTE take the position that the FCC only expressly preempted state regulation of intercarrier compensation for \"local\" ISP-bound calls.

Local traffic stays within the boundaries of a local calling area. Interexchange (or \"non-local\") traffic crosses the boundaries of a local calling area and is generally subject to toll or long-distance charges paid by the calling party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Traditionally, local calling areas have been geographically defined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Intercarrier compensation comes into play whenever two or more carriers collaborate to complete a phone call.

The FCC, in its initial regulations implementing the TCA, limited reciprocal compensation obligations \"to [telecommunications] traffic that originates and terminates within a local area,\" leaving interexchange calls outside the reciprocal compensation regime. <i>See Local Competition Order</i> &#182; 1034, 11 F.C.C.R at 16013, 1996 WL 452885; <i>see also Global Naps II,</i> 427 F.3d at 36-37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In those regulations, the FCC made clear that it was leaving in place the preexisting access charge regime that applied to interexchange calls:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]s a legal matter, . . . transport and termination of local traffic are different services than access service for long distance telecommunications. . . .

The DTE established the existing geographic local calling area structure for Massachusetts after a generic proceeding \"in which all interested Parties had the opportunity to comment.\" Verizon implements this system by comparing the \"NXX\" numbers (the \"NXX\" is the middle three digits of a ten-digit phone number) of the caller and the recipient. The \"NXX\" has generally been associated with a particular \"switch\" (that is, the equipment that routes phone calls to their destination) physically located within a local calling area; NXXs have thus served as proxies for geographic location. This means that if the NXX numbers of the caller and the recipient were within the same local calling area, one could assume that the caller and recipient were actually physically within the same calling area and bill the call as a local call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs has the ability to assign its customers \"virtual\" NXXs (VNXX), so that a Global NAPs customer can be given VNXX numbers that are different than those that would normally be assigned to him based on his physical location. This allows a party to call what appears to be a \"local\" number, although behind the scenes that call is actually routed to a different local calling area. When the party making such a call is a Verizon customer, the call is transmitted outside the local calling area by Verizon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many of Global NAPs' ISP customers use VNXX arrangements, and many of these ISPs' end-user customers use Verizon for local phone service. To access the Internet, the end-user dials in to a VNXX number assigned to his or her own local calling area. Then, Verizon transports the call across local calling areas to Global NAPs' point of interconnection with the Verizon network. Global NAPs and Verizon agree that \"[u]nder VNXX arrangements, the Verizon end user's call to the ISP's server is toll-free [to the end user] <i>whether or not the ISP's server is located in the same local exchange area in which the end-user originates the call.</i>\" (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The ISP Traffic Debate</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The treatment of intercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic has been a matter of considerable debate in recent years. Calls to ISPs tend to be long, and generally go exclusively from the ISP customer to the ISP. This has created opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. For example, in the context of reciprocal compensation, since reciprocal compensation flows from the LEC whose customer makes the phone call to the LEC whose customer receives the phone call, an LEC with a high proportion of ISP customers &#8212; as Global NAPs has &#8212; stands to gain a windfall in a reciprocal compensation scheme which includes traffic to an ISP. <i>See Global Naps II,</i> 427 F.3d at 37 (citing <i>Bell Atl. Tel. Cos. v. FCC,</i> 206 F.3d 1, 2-3 (D.C.Cir.2000)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FCC has issued several orders related to intercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic. In 1999, the FCC ruled that ISP-bound traffic was not subject to reciprocal compensation obligations under 47 U.S.C. &#167; 251, although it left to state commissions the ability to conclude \"pursuant to contractual principles or other legal or equitable considerations, that reciprocal compensation is an appropriate interim . . . rule\" pending final FCC rulemaking on the matter. <i>LOCAL COMPETITION</i> <i>PROVISIONS IN THE TELECOMMS.

Tel. Cos.,</i> 206 F.3d at 9). On April 27, 2001, the FCC issued an order in response to the D.C. Circuit's remand, holding once again that the \"provisions of section 251(b)(5) do not extend to ISP-bound traffic\" but resting its decision on a different legal ground. <i>Local Competition Provisions In The Telecomms.

The FCC also provided an interim intercarrier compensation regime for at least some ISP-bound traffic to supplant existing state regimes going forward. This interim regime was meant to limit opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. It is undisputed that this interim regime preempts state commission regulation of intercarrier compensation for <i>local</i> ISP-bound calls. The question here is whether the preemptive effect extends to the interexchange ISP-bound calls at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The D.C.

On July 30, 2002, Global NAPs filed a petition for arbitration with the DTE for resolution of a number of open disputes concerning the proposed interconnection agreement, <i>id.</i> at 20, including whether VNXX calls should be treated as local or interexchange for purposes of intercarrier compensation. Included with this petition was a marked-up version of the interconnection agreement, reflecting Global NAPs' proposed changes. Verizon filed its response to Global NAPs' petition on August 22, 2002, including its own marked-up version of the interconnection agreement. The parties filed direct testimony with the DTE on September 10, 2002.

Indeed, Global NAPs argued that VNXX traffic should be treated as local traffic, and therefore be subject to the state reciprocal compensation regime or, to the extent the traffic was ISP-bound, the federal interim compensation regime. As detailed below, during the course of the administrative proceedings Global NAPs also made clear its position that the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> had preempted the DTE's authority to regulate intercarrier compensation for all ISP-bound traffic, while leaving in place the DTE's ability to regulate intercarrier compensation for other intrastate calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon argued that the entire VNXX system was simply a way for Global NAPs to engage in regulatory arbitrage. In effect, Verizon argued, Global NAPs' VNXX system was a way to provide toll-free services to Verizon customers (so that Verizon would not get any fees from those customers), deprive Verizon of the access fees it would normally get for toll-free calls, and instead require Verizon to pay Global NAPs reciprocal compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DTE issued an order on December 12, 2002, resolving all open issues. With respect to the VNXX issue, the DTE rejected Global NAPs' position that all VNXX calls be treated as local for intercarrier compensation purposes. It found Global NAPs' position would create \"considerable market distortion based on an implicit Verizon subsidy of [Global NAPs'] operations.\" Instead, the DTE decided that \"VNXX calls will be rated as local or toll based on the geographic end points of the call.\" It further found that Verizon's proposal to have the parties collaborate to determine the geographic end points of VNXX calls was \"an acceptable starting point,\" and ordered the parties to submit contract language with the final agreement to implement Verizon's solution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DTE also rejected Global NAPs' arguments based on the <i>ISP Remand Order,</i> finding that the order \"explicitly recognized that intrastate access regimes in place prior to the Act remain unchanged until further state commission action\" and \"continues to recognize that calls that travel to points beyond the local exchange are access calls.\" The DTE expressed its intent to continue enforcement of the existing intrastate access charge regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DTE ordered the parties to incorporate the arbitrated terms into a final interconnection agreement by January 2, 2003; this deadline was later extended to January 17, 2003 on the parties' joint motion. <i>Global Naps I,</i> 396 F.3d at 20 After the DTE issued its December 12 order, the parties began negotiating final terms of interconnection.

But it did not reach the merits of that question; it held that since Global NAPs \"voluntarily sought arbitration by DTE after the FCC issued the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> and thus impliedly consented to DTE's jurisdiction over its petition, it may not now challenge DTE's authority on the basis of unsettled law in order to avoid the consequences of its own business strategy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs appeals, arguing (1) that it did not waive any claim regarding the preemptive effect of the FCC's <i>ISP Remand Order</i> or impliedly consent to the DTE's authority to decide the issue which had been preempted by the <i>ISP Remand Order,</i> and so the district court erred in not reaching the merits of its claim; and (2) that this court should reach the merits and find that the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> preempts the DTE from imposing access charges for ISP-bound traffic.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The District Court's \"Jurisdictional\" Holding</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's conclusion that Global NAPs could not obtain review of the DTE's preemption decision, because Global NAPs had \"impliedly consented to the DTE's jurisdiction over its petition,\" was error.

In testimony during the hearing before the DTE on October 9, 2005, Global NAPs' expert, Lee Selwyn, testified with respect to the VNXX issue as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let me first preface my remarks on [the VNXX issue] by making the point that we are speaking here of traffic originating by Verizon customers, terminating to Global NAPs, that is not ISP-bound traffic.

Thus the Department has no jurisdiction to impose access charges or other limitations on ISP in-bound traffic. . . . The Arbitration Order should be clear that the Interconnection Agreement is not intended to regulate inter-carrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic in any manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs made the same argument in its reply brief to the DTE and in a February 27, 2003 letter to the DTE after the DTE issued its December 12, 2002 order. The DTE rejected these arguments, requiring Global NAPs to pay access charges to Verizon for ISP-bound VNXX traffic under the intrastate tariffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs also argues that it could not voluntarily consent to the jurisdiction of the DTE to determine access charges, because the TCA <i>requires</i> arbitration before the DTE under 47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(b) when negotiation leaves open issues, and because \"[t]he DTE may not enlarge its own subject matter jurisdiction beyond that granted to it by the Act and FCC rulings implementing the TCA.

Questions about federal preemption of state law in this context may or may not be properly thought of as \"jurisdictional\" in nature. <i>Cf. Wolf v. Reliance Standard Life Ins.

The DTE points out that Congress used terms other than \"arbitration\" to describe other types of actions taken by state commissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DTE's position has no basis either in the TCA, its legislative history, or in case law. The DTE points to nothing more than the use of the term \"arbitration\" in the TCA. The DTE's argument, furthermore, is in flat conflict with our holding in <i>Global Naps I,</i> where, in the context of review of a decision pursuant to an arbitration, we held that determinations of federal law by state agencies under the TCA were subject to de novo review. <i>See</i> 396 F.3d at 23. We noted in <i>Global Naps I</i> that \"[e]ach of the Circuits that has addressed the standard of review under the TCA has held that where the state agency determination rests principally on an interpretation of the TCA, de novo review is applied.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23 n. 8. A number of circuits have reached this conclusion in the context of federal court review of state commission arbitrations under the TCA. <i>See, e.g., MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co.,</i> 376 F.3d 539, 548 (6th Cir. 2004) (de novo review of questions of federal law after state commission arbitration); <i>Ind. Bell Tel. Co. v.

The standard of review would vary not by the nature of the question presented (interpretations of the TCA) but by the nature of the proceeding in which the question is presented. Thus, under the DTE's view, a state commission's conclusions of federal law when it is acting as an arbitrator under &#167; 252(b) would be subject to deferential review, but the very same conclusions about the TCA made pursuant to other state commission proceedings, such as the &#167; 252(e) approval process, would be subject to de novo review.

Even assuming that this language could cover the non-local ISP-bound calls at issue here, it does not help answer the question before us. A matter may be <i>subject to</i> FCC jurisdiction, without the FCC having exercised that jurisdiction and preempted state regulation. The question before us is whether the FCC intended in the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> to exercise its jurisdiction over the precise issue here, to the exclusion of state regulation. <i>See Qwest Corp. v. Scott,</i> 380 F.3d 367, 372 (8th Cir.2004) (\"There is no dispute in this case that the FCC has the <i>power</i> to preempt states from establishing standards and requiring reports relating to special access services.

Global NAPs does not challenge the DTE's determination that whether a call is local or \"interexchange\" should be based on the geographic endpoints of the call, or the decision to impose access charges on non-ISP-bound VNXX calls. Rather, the challenge is to the DTE's imposition of access charges on that subset of VNXX calls that are bound for an ISP. Global NAPs argues that we should determine the scope of preemption by limiting our examination to the text of the <i>ISP Remand Order.</i> Verizon and the DTE<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> ask us to also consider the context in which the order was passed and the regulatory objectives of the order; they argue that the FCC only intended to preempt state regulation of intercarrier compensation for local ISP-bound traffic and did not address the question before the DTE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of which approach is used, the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> does not clearly preempt state authority to impose access charges for interexchange VNXX ISP-bound traffic; it is, at best, ambiguous on the question, and ambiguity is not enough to preempt state regulation here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs cannot point to any language in the order that explicitly preempts state regulation of access charges for the non-local ISP-bound traffic at issue. Instead, Global NAPs' central argument is that, in preempting state regulation of intercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic in the <i>ISP Remand Order,</i> the FCC did not expressly limit itself to traffic originating and terminating within a local calling area. It suggests that the interim federal regime of intercarrier compensation established by the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> actually applies to all ISP-bound calls, so that the preemptive effect of the order should extend to the access charges at issue here. Global NAPs points in particular to paragraph 82 of the <i>ISP Remand Order,</i> in which the FCC stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interim compensation regime we establish here applies as carriers renegotiate expired or expiring interconnection agreements. . . . This Order does not preempt any state commission decision regarding compensation for ISP-bound traffic for the period prior to the effective date of the interim regime we adopt here. Because we now exercise our authority under section 201 to determine the appropriate intercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic, however, state commissions will no longer have authority to address this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>ISP Remand Order</i> &#182; 82, 16 F.C.C.R. at 9189, 2001 WL 455869. It argues that if the FCC intended only to preempt state regulation of reciprocal compensation for local ISP-bound traffic, it would have expressed its intent more clearly, by specifying \"local ISP-bound traffic.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs' argument ignores an important distinction. The FCC has consistently maintained a distinction between local and \"interexchange\" calling and the intercarrier compensation regimes that apply to them, and reaffirmed that states have authority over intrastate access charge regimes. Against the FCC's policy of recognizing such a distinction, a clearer showing is required that the FCC preempted state regulation of both access charges and reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound traffic. <i>Cf. Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc. v. N.L.R.B.,</i> 884 F.2d 34, 36 (1st Cir.1989) (\"The law that governs an agency's significant departure from its own prior precedent is clear. The agency cannot do so without explicitly recognizing that it is doing so and explaining why.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, in the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> itself, the FCC reaffirmed the distinction between reciprocal compensation and access charges. It noted that Congress, in passing the TCA, did not intend to disrupt the pre-TCA access charge regime, under which \"LECs provided access services . . . in order to connect calls that travel to points &#8212; both interstate and intrastate &#8212; beyond the local exchange. In turn, both the Commission and the states had in place access regimes applicable to this traffic, which they have continued to modify over time.\" <i>ISP Remand Order</i> &#182; 37, 16 F.C.C.R. at 9168.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the context in which the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> was issued casts additional doubt on Global NAPs' contention. The Supreme Court has held that in interpreting its own prior cases \"[i]t is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used.\" <i>See Cent. Va. Cmty. Coll. v. Katz,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 126 S.Ct. 990, 996, 163 L.Ed.2d 945, ___ (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Cohens v. Virginia,</i> 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 399-400, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821)). Such a rule also properly applies to interpretations of agency orders, especially where the order itself details the background against which it was passed. <i>See Qwest Corp.,</i> 380 F.3d at 373-74 (\"The FCC's statement . . . is susceptible of a broader interpretation if plucked out of context, but we conclude that when the [FCC order] is read as a whole, the [FCC's] expressed intent to preempt state regulation does not extend to performance measurements and standards.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue that necessitated FCC action in the <i>Internet Traffic Order</i> and the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> was \"whether reciprocal compensation obligations apply to the delivery of calls from one LEC's end-user customer to an ISP in the same local calling area that is served by a competing LEC.\" <i>ISP Remand Order</i> &#182; 13, 16 F.C.C.R. at 9159, 2001 WL 455869; <i>see also WorldCom, Inc.,</i> 288 F.3d at 430 (stating that the question before the FCC involved \"calls made to [ISPs] located within the caller's local calling area\").

The question before the DTE involved a particular variant on a larger question of allocation of compensation for telephone calls placed to internet service providers (ISPs). The larger question has been addressed in a series of orders from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). At the heart of this case is one such order, the <i>ISP Remand Order.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DTE, in an arbitration order, required Global NAPs to pay Verizon access charges for all \"virtual NXX\" traffic, including non-local ISP-bound traffic, rejecting Global NAPs' argument that state commissions were preempted by the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> from regulating intercarrier compensation for all ISP-bound traffic. Global NAPs filed suit challenging the DTE's conclusion in federal district court. Verizon and the DTE argued that the DTE retained authority to decide the issue because the FCC order only preempted state commission regulation of \"local\" traffic sent to an ISP, and the FCC did not hold that virtual NXX traffic is such local traffic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court never reached the preemption issue, because it found that Global NAPs had implicitly consented to the \"jurisdiction\" of the DTE to resolve the dispute, and so could not later challenge the DTE's jurisdiction to impose access charges for ISP-bound traffic. It granted Verizon and the DTE's motions for partial summary judgment. No party on appeal agrees with that reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we affirm, though on different grounds. A party contesting an issue of whether federal law has preempted a state commission's authority does not waive judicial review of the argument by first presenting it to the commission in the course of an arbitration under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Because the preemption question was not waived, it must be addressed. The issue is one of federal law over which the federal court exercises de novo, not deferential, review. We reach the merits and hold that the FCC did not expressly preempt state regulation of intercarrier compensation for non-local ISP-bound calls as are involved here, leaving the DTE free to impose access charges for such calls under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Regulatory Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior history between these parties is set forth in our opinions in <i>Global Naps, Inc. v.

The DTE established the existing geographic local calling area structure for Massachusetts after a generic proceeding \"in which all interested Parties had the opportunity to comment.\" Verizon implements this system by comparing the \"NXX\" numbers (the \"NXX\" is the middle three digits of a ten-digit phone number) of the caller and the recipient. The \"NXX\" has generally been associated with a particular \"switch\" (that is, the equipment that routes phone calls to their destination) physically located within a local calling area; NXXs have thus served as proxies for geographic location. This means that if the NXX numbers of the caller and the recipient were within the same local calling area, one could assume that the caller and recipient were actually physically within the same calling area and bill the call as a local call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs has the ability to assign its customers \"virtual\" NXXs (VNXX), so that a Global NAPs customer can be given VNXX numbers that are different than those that would normally be assigned to him based on his physical location. This allows a party to call what appears to be a \"local\" number, although behind the scenes that call is actually routed to a different local calling area. When the party making such a call is a Verizon customer, the call is transmitted outside the local calling area by Verizon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many of Global NAPs' ISP customers use VNXX arrangements, and many of these ISPs' end-user customers use Verizon for local phone service. To access the Internet, the end-user dials in to a VNXX number assigned to his or her own local calling area. Then, Verizon transports the call across local calling areas to Global NAPs' point of interconnection with the Verizon network. Global NAPs and Verizon agree that \"[u]nder VNXX arrangements, the Verizon end user's call to the ISP's server is toll-free [to the end user] <i>whether or not the ISP's server is located in the same local exchange area in which the end-user originates the call.</i>\" (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The ISP Traffic Debate</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The treatment of intercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic has been a matter of considerable debate in recent years. Calls to ISPs tend to be long, and generally go exclusively from the ISP customer to the ISP. This has created opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. For example, in the context of reciprocal compensation, since reciprocal compensation flows from the LEC whose customer makes the phone call to the LEC whose customer receives the phone call, an LEC with a high proportion of ISP customers &#8212; as Global NAPs has &#8212; stands to gain a windfall in a reciprocal compensation scheme which includes traffic to an ISP. <i>See Global Naps II,</i> 427 F.3d at 37 (citing <i>Bell Atl.

Indeed, Global NAPs argued that VNXX traffic should be treated as local traffic, and therefore be subject to the state reciprocal compensation regime or, to the extent the traffic was ISP-bound, the federal interim compensation regime. As detailed below, during the course of the administrative proceedings Global NAPs also made clear its position that the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> had preempted the DTE's authority to regulate intercarrier compensation for all ISP-bound traffic, while leaving in place the DTE's ability to regulate intercarrier compensation for other intrastate calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon argued that the entire VNXX system was simply a way for Global NAPs to engage in regulatory arbitrage. In effect, Verizon argued, Global NAPs' VNXX system was a way to provide toll-free services to Verizon customers (so that Verizon would not get any fees from those customers), deprive Verizon of the access fees it would normally get for toll-free calls, and instead require Verizon to pay Global NAPs reciprocal compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DTE issued an order on December 12, 2002, resolving all open issues.

It found Global NAPs' position would create \"considerable market distortion based on an implicit Verizon subsidy of [Global NAPs'] operations.\" Instead, the DTE decided that \"VNXX calls will be rated as local or toll based on the geographic end points of the call.\" It further found that Verizon's proposal to have the parties collaborate to determine the geographic end points of VNXX calls was \"an acceptable starting point,\" and ordered the parties to submit contract language with the final agreement to implement Verizon's solution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DTE also rejected Global NAPs' arguments based on the <i>ISP Remand Order,</i> finding that the order \"explicitly recognized that intrastate access regimes in place prior to the Act remain unchanged until further state commission action\" and \"continues to recognize that calls that travel to points beyond the local exchange are access calls.\" The DTE expressed its intent to continue enforcement of the existing intrastate access charge regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DTE ordered the parties to incorporate the arbitrated terms into a final interconnection agreement by January 2, 2003; this deadline was later extended to January 17, 2003 on the parties' joint motion. <i>Global Naps I,</i> 396 F.3d at 20 After the DTE issued its December 12 order, the parties began negotiating final terms of interconnection.

ISP-bound traffic is not subject to any treatment other than the reciprocal-compensation arrangement as set forth in the FCC's <i>ISP Remand Order.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief to the DTE after the hearing, Global NAPs reiterated this point:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the <i>ISP Remand Order,</i> the FCC determined that inter-carrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic is solely within the jurisdiction of the FCC and that on a going forward basis, state commissions have been preempted from addressing the issue. Thus the Department has no jurisdiction to impose access charges or other limitations on ISP in-bound traffic. . . . The Arbitration Order should be clear that the Interconnection Agreement is not intended to regulate inter-carrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic in any manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs made the same argument in its reply brief to the DTE and in a February 27, 2003 letter to the DTE after the DTE issued its December 12, 2002 order. The DTE rejected these arguments, requiring Global NAPs to pay access charges to Verizon for ISP-bound VNXX traffic under the intrastate tariffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs also argues that it could not voluntarily consent to the jurisdiction of the DTE to determine access charges, because the TCA <i>requires</i> arbitration before the DTE under 47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(b) when negotiation leaves open issues, and because \"[t]he DTE may not enlarge its own subject matter jurisdiction beyond that granted to it by the Act and FCC rulings implementing the TCA.

The standard of review would vary not by the nature of the question presented (interpretations of the TCA) but by the nature of the proceeding in which the question is presented. Thus, under the DTE's view, a state commission's conclusions of federal law when it is acting as an arbitrator under &#167; 252(b) would be subject to deferential review, but the very same conclusions about the TCA made pursuant to other state commission proceedings, such as the &#167; 252(e) approval process, would be subject to de novo review.

Global NAPs does not challenge the DTE's determination that whether a call is local or \"interexchange\" should be based on the geographic endpoints of the call, or the decision to impose access charges on non-ISP-bound VNXX calls. Rather, the challenge is to the DTE's imposition of access charges on that subset of VNXX calls that are bound for an ISP. Global NAPs argues that we should determine the scope of preemption by limiting our examination to the text of the <i>ISP Remand Order.</i> Verizon and the DTE<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> ask us to also consider the context in which the order was passed and the regulatory objectives of the order; they argue that the FCC only intended to preempt state regulation of intercarrier compensation for local ISP-bound traffic and did not address the question before the DTE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of which approach is used, the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> does not clearly preempt state authority to impose access charges for interexchange VNXX ISP-bound traffic; it is, at best, ambiguous on the question, and ambiguity is not enough to preempt state regulation here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs cannot point to any language in the order that explicitly preempts state regulation of access charges for the non-local ISP-bound traffic at issue. Instead, Global NAPs' central argument is that, in preempting state regulation of intercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic in the <i>ISP Remand Order,</i> the FCC did not expressly limit itself to traffic originating and terminating within a local calling area. It suggests that the interim federal regime of intercarrier compensation established by the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> actually applies to all ISP-bound calls, so that the preemptive effect of the order should extend to the access charges at issue here. Global NAPs points in particular to paragraph 82 of the <i>ISP Remand Order,</i> in which the FCC stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interim compensation regime we establish here applies as carriers renegotiate expired or expiring interconnection agreements. . . . This Order does not preempt any state commission decision regarding compensation for ISP-bound traffic for the period prior to the effective date of the interim regime we adopt here. Because we now exercise our authority under section 201 to determine the appropriate intercarrier compensation for ISP-bound traffic, however, state commissions will no longer have authority to address this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>ISP Remand Order</i> &#182; 82, 16 F.C.C.R. at 9189, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">455869</span></span>. It argues that if the FCC intended only to preempt state regulation of reciprocal compensation for local ISP-bound traffic, it would have expressed its intent more clearly, by specifying \"local ISP-bound traffic.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Global NAPs' argument ignores an important distinction. The FCC has consistently maintained a distinction between local and \"interexchange\" calling and the intercarrier compensation regimes that apply to them, and reaffirmed that states have authority over intrastate access charge regimes. Against the FCC's policy of recognizing such a distinction, a clearer showing is required that the FCC preempted state regulation of both access charges and reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound traffic. <i>Cf. Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc. v.

It noted that Congress, in passing the TCA, did not intend to disrupt the pre-TCA access charge regime, under which \"LECs provided access services . . . in order to connect calls that travel to points &#8212; both interstate and intrastate &#8212; beyond the local exchange. In turn, both the Commission and the states had in place access regimes applicable to this traffic, which they have continued to modify over time.\" <i>ISP Remand Order</i> &#182; 37, 16 F.C.C.R. at 9168.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the context in which the <i>ISP Remand Order</i> was issued casts additional doubt on Global NAPs' contention.
