Pro se plaintiff  Sherman Miller  appeals\n          Per Curiam.\n                              \n\nfrom  a district  court judgment  for the  defendants in  this 42\n\nU.S.C.    1983  action.   For  the  reasons discussed  below,  we\n\naffirm.  \n\n                                I\n\n          Miller is sixty-five years  old.  For most of  the past\n\nfifteen years, he has been a resident of the Treatment Center for\n\nSexually Dangerous Persons  located in Bridgewater, Massachusetts\n\n(hereinafter:  \"Treatment  Center\" or \"BTC\").   Following a  1978\n\nconviction  for rape, Miller was committed to the BTC pursuant to\n\na Suffolk  Superior  Court  order  adjudicating  him  a  Sexually\n\nDangerous Person (\"SDP\")  pursuant to  M.G.L. c. 123A,    6  (re-\n\npealed) and  directing that he  \"be voluntarily committed  to the\n                                               \n\nTreatment Center  . . . .\" (emphasis supplied).   In 1984, Miller\n\ncommenced this civil rights action.  The amended complaint sought\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and damages for alleged consti-\n\ntutional deprivations  attending his confinement at the BTC.  All\n\nnamed defendants  are state  officials  formerly responsible  for\n\noperations  at the BTC.1  Although the amended complaint asserted\n\nseven claims, only two  are implicated by this appeal.   Miller's\n\nfirst claim alleged  that the defendants  violated his  constitu-\n\ntional right of access to the courts by maintaining an inadequate\n\n                    \n\n     1The defendants are former Department of Corrections Commis-\nsioner Michael  Fair, Charles  Gaughan (former Superintendent  of\nthe Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Bridgewater), James\nCallahan  (former  Commissioner  of   the  Department  of  Mental\nHealth), Richard  Boucher (former  Administrator of the  BTC) and\nMildred Gil (law librarian at the BTC).\n\n                                2\n\nlaw library and restricting library access.  The other  surviving\n\nclaim alleged that the defendants violated Miller's constitution-\n\nal right  to rehabilitative treatment.   Miller alleged  that the\n\ndefendants failed to develop an individual treatment plan (\"ITP\")\n\nfor  him although he believed  such plans had  been developed for\n\nother  BTC patients and  that the denial  of an ITP  violated his\n\nright to due  process and equal  protection under the  Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.2  He sought injunctive relief requiring defendants  to\n\ndevelop  an ITP which would afford him a realistic opportunity to\n\nimprove his mental condition, and requiring defendants to  afford\n\nhim adequate access to the BTC law library.\n\n          On December  10, 1985,  the  district court  granted  a\n\npreliminary injunction on Miller's \"access to the courts\"  claim.\n\nThe order required  the defendants to  obtain certain  additional\n\nvolumes for the  law library  and to ensure  that Miller  receive\n\nreasonable  photocopying  services.   Miller's  criminal sentence\n\nexpired on May 8, 1989.  No significant judicial proceedings took\n\nplace thereafter until the  case was called for trial  in January\n\n1991.  Relying on the expiration of his criminal sentence, Miller\n\nsought release from  the BTC by instituting  a state-court habeas\n\ncorpus proceeding.  On  March 20, 1991, the superior  court ruled\n\nthat  Miller had  been involuntarily  committed to  the Treatment\n                                    \n\nCenter  and, therefore, was  not entitled  to release  until such\n\ntime as  his adjudication as  a SDP  was revoked under  M.G.L. c.\n\n                    \n\n     2Miller  alleged that  the defendants  discriminated against\nhim because of his unique \"voluntary\"  commitment status and that\nthe  BTC maintained  that  Miller's right  to participate  in its\nprograms  was inferior  to  that of  involuntarily committed  BTC\npatients. \n\n                                3\n\n123A,   9.3  Thus, but  for his status as a SDP, Miller  would be\n\na  free man.  Nevertheless, he has never submitted an administra-\n\ntive request for release or reclassification.\n\n          Miller's   1983  action was called for trial in January\n\n1991.  Both sides sought a continuance; the BTC had lost its case\n\nfile and Miller required  further discovery.  The district  judge\n\ncontinued the trial to April but  warned that belated dispositive\n\nmotions  would not be  allowed to delay the  trial further.  Four\n\ndays before the  rescheduled trial, defendants filed  a motion to\n\ndismiss  or for summary judgment, based on this court's March 22,\n\n1991 decision in  Langton v.  Johnston, 928 F.2d  1206 (1st  Cir.\n                                      \n\n1991).  Langton resolved an appeal from a class action, Bruder v.\n                                                              \n\nJohnston, brought on  behalf of all patients civilly committed to\n        \n\nthe BTC.4  The  Langton plaintiffs sought to have  the defendants\n                       \n\n    all of them state officials responsible for operations at the\n\nBTC     held in contempt of certain consent decrees requiring the\n\nestablishment of various therapeutic, educational, and vocational\n\nprograms at the BTC.   See generally Williams v. Lesiak, 822 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1223 (1st Cir. 1987) (describing consent decrees).  Like  Miller,\n\nthe Langton  plaintiffs had raised an  inadequate treatment claim\n           \n\nthat  alleged, inter  alia,  that the  defendants  had failed  to\n                          \n\n                    \n\n     3The superior court ruling was based  on the statements made\nby the committing  judge during the course of the SDP hearing, as\nwell  as Miller's own  conduct.  The  Massachusetts Appeals Court\naffirmed.  See  Miller v. Tink,  33 Mass.  App. Ct. 1103  (1992),\n                              \nfurther rev. denied, 413 Mass. 1106 (1992).\n                   \n\n     4We refer to  Bruder and Langton  interchangeably.  We  note\n                                     \nthat  Miller's     1983 action  and  Bruder  were  pending before\n                                           \ndifferent district judges at roughly  the same time, although the\nBruder  suit  was filed  two years  after  Miller's suit  and the\n      \nMiller  case was not resolved until almost two years after Bruder\n                                                                 \nwas decided.   Miller unsuccessfully filed a motion  to intervene\nas a class representative in Bruder.  See also infra note 14.\n                                                    \n\n                                4\n\nprovide treatment  reasonably designed  to  bring about  the  pa-\n\ntients' recovery.  See 928 F.2d at 1212.  Our decision in Langton\n                                                                 \n\nupheld  the district court's ruling that  the defendants were not\n\nin contempt  of  the  consent decrees  but  rather  had  achieved\n\nsubstantial compliance  with  those decrees  notwithstanding  the\n\nfact that the  ITPs of many patients were  not being fully imple-\n\nmented.  We also observed that the BTC had a \"current and compre-\n\nhensive law  library.\"   See  id. at  1213, 1216,  1220-23.   The\n                                 \n\ndefendants contended  that Langton barred  Miller's claims  under\n                                  \n\nthe doctrine  of res  judicata  or collateral  estoppel.   Miller\n                              \n\nmoved to strike defendants' dispositive motion.5\n\n          When the case was called for trial, defendants'  motion\n\nto dismiss/for summary  judgment and Miller's  motions to  strike\n\nand compel  discovery  remained  pending.    The  district  court\n\ninitially told Miller that he would  not have to file a  response\n\nto  defendants'  motion  and  instructed  defendants'  counsel to\n\nassert  their  legal arguments  in the  context  of a  motion for\n\ndirected verdict.   Miller, however, was not  prepared for trial.\n\nHe  had not subpoenaed any  witnesses, being uncertain  as to how\n\nthe  court would proceed on the pending motions.6  Loath to delay\n\nthe resolution of Miller's claims any longer, the  district court\n\n                    \n\n     5Shortly before defendants filed their motion to dismiss/for\nsummary  judgment, Miller  moved  to compel  discovery and  for a\njudgment of contempt.   He sought to compel Michael  Stevens, the\nChairman  of the  BTC's  Reintegration Review  Board (\"RRB\"),  to\ncomplete his  deposition and produce documents.   Miller's motion\nto  strike argued  that defendants  improperly moved  for summary\njudgment before discovery was completed.\n\n     6Miller complained that  he had been unable  to complete the\ndeposition of Michael Stevens, Chairman of the BTC's RRB.  Miller\nhoped to  elicit Stevens'  admission that Miller's  treatment was\nnot  being  based on  professional  judgment  under Youngberg  v.\n                                                             \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).\n     \n\n                                5\n\nexpressed  a preference  for  proceeding  to  trial.   But  after\n\nhearing defendants'  arguments, the court  expressed some  uncer-\n\ntainty as  to whether  the  case would  be tried  or resolved  on\n\ndefendants'  motion.7   The  court  recessed to  allow  Miller to\n\nprepare a subpoena for Stevens,  as well as a witness list  and a\n\nproffer indicating how Miller's evidence might defeat defendants'\n\nLangton/Bruder  defense.   After the  recess, Miller  submitted a\n              \n\nwitness  list identifying  six witnesses  on  his \"access  to the\n\ncourts\"  claim and  seven witnesses  on his  inadequate treatment\n\nclaim.8  He  argued that Bruder did not bar  these claims because\n                               \n\n(1) Bruder was not decided  on constitutional grounds; (2) Miller\n          \n\nhad  not been  a party  to  Bruder, in  part due  to his  alleged\n                                  \n\nvoluntary commitment status; (3) many of the issues Miller sought\n\n                    \n\n     7The district court  explained to Miller, \"If you don't have\na proffer of evidence that would establish if credited that there\nis a cause of action remaining in the face of the legal arguments\nthe  defendant is asserting, then whether we  do it as a trial or\n                                                                 \ndo  it as a motion  for a summary judgment, it's  time to end the\n                                          \ncase . . . .\" (emphasis added).\n\n     8Miller's proffer indicated that  he expected two members of\nthe  BTC's  Reintegration Review  Board      Dr.  Mark Sokol  and\nMichael  Stevens     to identify  the treatments  recommended for\nMiller that had not been provided.  Miller further indicated that\nhe  wished to question  Dr. Albert Jurgela,  Director of Clinical\nServices, to find out why various recommended treatments had  not\nbeen  provided.  Miller complained  that the BTC  refused to give\nhim clozapine    a drug  Miller had taken for six or  seven years\nprior to his  incarceration and  which allegedly  allowed him  to\nfunction normally in society    even though the BTC's RRB specif-\nically recommended it.  He implied  that his only hope of release\nmight  rest on securing clozapine therapy.  Miller wanted to call\nDr. Daniel Kreigman and Dr. Martin Miller to inquire  why the BTC\nwas not giving him clozapine.  He expressed the hope that another\nwitness, Dr. Guy Seymour, would testify that Miller suffered from\nschizophrenia, thus justifying the use of clozapine.  (continued)\n     In  support of  his  \"access to  the  courts\" claim,  Miller\nsought to prove that certain restrictions  on his movement within\nthe law  library violated the  constitutional right of  access to\nthe  courts of  inmates he  was assisting in  his capacity  as an\nappointed research assistant.  \n\n                                6\n\nto raise concerning his treatment arose after Bruder was decided,\n                                                    \n\nand  (4) Bruder merely determined that the state was not required\n               \n\nto  implement all  treatments recommended  in a  particular SDP's\n\nITP, it did not decide what the state was required  to provide to\n\na SDP,  such  as Miller,  whose  criminal sentence  had  expired.\n\nDefendants reiterated  their argument that  Langton/Bruder barred\n                                                          \n\nMiller's remaining claims.\n\n          The  district court  concluded that  the case  could be\n\nresolved by affording  Miller an opportunity  to file  affidavits\n\nand memoranda in opposition to defendants' arguments.  The  court\n\nadjourned the  \"trial\" after  one day,  allowing Miller  leave to\n\nsubmit such  filings.    Thereafter,  Miller filed  a  number  of\n\nsubmissions  in support  of  his claims.    With respect  to  his\n\ninadequate  treatment  claim, Miller  averred  that  he had  been\n\nadjudicated  a SDP  and committed  to the  BTC in 1979,  that the\n\nBTC's RRB had formulated  an extensive treatment plan for  him on\n\nNovember 1, 1989, but that  he had \"not been afforded one  of the\n\nbehavioral and pharmacological  treatment modalities  recommended\n\nby the [RRB].\"  He reiterated his complaint that he  had not been\n\ntreated with clozapine, notwithstanding the RRB's recommendation.\n\n          On June 11,  1991, the district court issued a memoran-\n\ndum of  decision denying relief on  Miller's inadequate treatment\n\nclaim.   The  court ruled  that it  was not  necessary to  decide\n\nwhether Langton/Bruder barred  the claim under  the doctrines  of\n                      \n\nres  judicata and collateral  estoppel.  The  court ruled instead\n             \n\nthat Langton/Bruder precluded relief under the doctrine of  stare\n                                                                 \n\ndecisis.   Noting that Miller had based  his inadequate treatment\n       \n\n                                7\n\nclaim largely on the fact that he had not been given clozapine as\n\nrecommended by the RRB, the court reasoned:  \n\n          In light of the recognition by the courts  in\n          Bruder and  Langton  that patients  were  not\n                             \n          receiving all of the treatment recommended in\n          their individual treatment plans,  . . . pla-\n          intiff  has failed  to demonstrate  a genuine\n                                                       \n          issue of  material fact on the  claim of con-\n                                                       \n          stitutionally inadequate treatment . . . [and\n                                            \n          the] defendants are entitled to judgment as a\n          matter of law.  (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n          The court awarded Miller partial relief on his  \"access\n\nto the  courts\" claim,9 but  held that he  had not stated  an ac-\n\ntionable claim  for denial of access  to the courts on  behalf of\n\nhis  fellow  patients because  he  failed  to allege  that  those\n\npatients had no  avenue of  access to the  courts except  through\n\nMiller.  \n\n          Miller  filed  a  motion  for  partial reconsideration,\n\narguing that  the district court  erred in construing  his inade-\n\nquate treatment claim as similar to that raised by the plaintiffs\n\nin Langton/Bruder.  Relying on his May 13, 1991 affidavit, Miller\n                 \n\nargued that, unlike the Langton  plaintiffs, he was not complain-\n                               \n\ning  that he had  not received all  the treatments  that had been\n                                  \n\nrecommended  for him.  Rather, Miller's complaint was that he had\n\nnot received any of the behavioral and pharmacological  treatment\n                \n\nmodalities that had been recommended for him by the  RRB in 1989.\n\nMiller argued  that simply because the BTC was not able to imple-\n\nment  all of the programs  recommended in each  patient's ITP did\n         \n\nnot mean that the BTC had no obligation to implement  some of the\n                                                          \n\n                    \n\n     9The court issued a  judgment declaring that as  of December\n10, 1985,  the BTC  law library was  constitutionally inadequate.\nMiller was awarded  $500 for attorney fees incurred  in enforcing\nthe district court's December 10, 1985 preliminary injunction.\n\n                                8\n\nprograms repeatedly recommended for him.  Miller further  averred\n\nthat his group  therapist and another staff  person were recently\n\n\"bumped,\" which would leave him without treatment.\n\n          The defendants  filed an  opposition which included  an\n\naffidavit from Dr.  Jurgela and  copies of the  RRB's reports  on\n\nMiller's  11/1/89  and 7/25/90  status  reviews.10   Dr.  Jurgela\n\nattested  that  Miller's  therapist  continued to  provide  group\n\ntherapy  to Miller  notwithstanding the  fact  that she  had been\n\n\"bumped,\"  and that Miller also received treatment in the form of\n\nweekly \"house  meetings\" led  by  another staff  clinician.   Dr.\n\nJurgela acknowledged, however, that the current RRB report recom-\n\nmended  that  Miller   receive  individual  therapy,  personality\n\ntesting,  general  behavioral  and plethysmographic  assessments,\n\ncovert conditioning, relapse prevention, and anger and depression\n\nmanagement, but that Miller had not received any of these assess-\n\nments or treatments.11   He also acknowledged that  a psychophar-\n\nmacological consultation had been recommended for Miller, presum-\n\nably a reference to  the recommended clozapine therapy.   The RRB\n\nreports confirmed Miller's allegation that the RRB had recommend-\n\ned a trial use of clozapine in 1989 and that, as of July 1990, he\n\nhad received neither clozapine nor the other recommended services\n\nnoted  immediately above.   The  1989 RRB  report  concluded that\n\nMiller  remained a  SDP whose prognosis  was poor.   The 1990 RRB\n\nreport noted that  services might  be lacking for  Miller and  if\n\n                    \n\n     10Under the consent decree, the RRB is required to  evaluate\neach  patient, on an annual  basis, to determine  the progress of\ntherapy and the advisability of permitting the patient to reenter\nthe community on a limited basis.  See Langton, 928 F.2d at 1210.\n                                              \n\n     11Dr. Jurgela noted that Department of Mental Health (\"DMH\")\npolicy prohibited the use of plethysmography at any DMH facility.\n\n                                9\n\nthat were the case, as opposed to Miller simply resisting servic-\n\nes that had been offered, \"such conditions should be corrected as\n\nsoon  as possible.\"  Miller responded  to the defendants' opposi-\n\ntion, arguing  that defendants' evidence established  that of the\n\nten  treatment modalities that had been recommended by the RRB in\n\n1989, he had received only one (group therapy).\n\n          The district court rejected Miller's contentions on the\n\nground that  Miller  had \"not  demonstrated  a genuine  issue  of\n\nmaterial fact on  the adequacy  of treatment claim.\"   The  court\n\nreiterated that \"the Treatment Center is not obligated to  imple-\n\nment the  [ITP] drawn up  by the  [RRB] in all  its details\"  and\n\nfound that Miller's claim that  he had \"not been afforded  one of\n\nthe  behavioral and  pharmacological treatment  modalities recom-\n\nmended by the [RRB]\" in 1989 was \"a factual assertion not clearly\n\nsupported  by  the  ambiguous  language  in\"  Miller's  affidavit\n\nbecause  Miller  had failed  to identify  a treatment  other than\n\nclozapine that he had not received.  The court further found that\n\nMiller's claim that he  was no longer receiving any  treatment   \n\nsince certain staff members had been \"bump[ed]\"    merely assert-\n\ned \"sketchy facts  and unsupported conclusions\"  which failed  to\n\ncomply with  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56(e).   The court  denied Miller's\n\nmotion  for partial  reconsideration and  his amended  motion for\n\npartial reconsideration.\n\n          Miller then  filed  other  postjudgment  motions:    to\n\nsupplement the pleadings, reopen the case,  and amend the pleadi-\n\nngs to conform to the facts  set forth in Miller's September  23,\n\n1991 affidavit (\"Supplementary Affidavit\").  In the first motion,\n\nMiller argued that further reconsideration  was warranted because\n\n                                10\n\nthe court had failed to  apprise him of the requirements  of Rule\n\n56(e).  Miller's Supplementary Affidavit spelled out each  recom-\n\nmended treatment  with  which  he  had not  been  provided  since\n\n1986.12   The court  declined further reconsideration,  asserting\n\nthat  its June  11, 1991  decision was  not based  on defendants'\n\nmotion for summary judgment,  therefore Miller's alleged unaware-\n\nness of the requirements of Rule 56(e) was irrelevant.  The court\n\nfurther found that Miller's Supplementary Affidavit  disclosed no\n\nset  of facts that might entitle him to relief and that amendment\n\nof  the pleadings following \"trial\"  was not in  the interests of\n\njustice.  The  court held that  Miller's Supplementary  Affidavit\n\nwas  not part  of the record.   Miller's motions  were denied and\n\nthis appeal followed.\n\n                                II\n\n          The district court orders disposing of Miller's postju-\n\ndgment motions  are reviewable  for \"abuse of  discretion.\"   See\n                                                                 \n\nDesenne v. Jamestown  Boat Yard,  968 F.2d 1388,  1392 (1st  Cir.\n                               \n\n1992)(deci-sion on Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration reviewed\n\nfor  abuse of  discretion); Rodriguez-Antuna  v. Chase  Manhattan\n                                                                 \n\nBank Corporation, 871 F.2d  1, 3 (1st Cir. 1989)(denials  of Rule\n                \n\n60(b) motions may be reversed only for abuse of  discretion).  We\n\nfind  that the district  court acted well  within its discretion,\n\nparticularly  in view  of the  extreme tardiness of  Miller's re-\n\nquests  for relief  in an  action commenced  in 1984.   Moreover,\n\n                    \n\n     12Among these  were  treatments for  anger,  depression  and\nself-control management, personality testing,  relapse prevention\ntreatment  and plethysmographic  assessment.   But  cf. note  11,\n                                                       \nsupra.\n     \n\n                                11\n\nMiller misapprehends the district court ruling on his  inadequate\n\ntreatment claim.  The district  court correctly ruled that Miller\n\nfailed  to  provide evidentiary  support,  or  even a  sufficient\n\nproffer of evidence,  to support the  claim of inadequate  treat-\n\nment, since he  failed to show that  the claim was not  precluded\n\nunder  the doctrine  of  stare decisis  by  Langton/Bruder.   The\n                                                          \n\ndistrict court arrived at  its decision on the basis  of Miller's\n\nambiguous affidavit attesting that \"he had 'not been afforded one\n                                                                 \n\nof the behavioral and pharmacological treatment modalities recom-\n\nmended by the [RRB]' . . . .\"   Memorandum of August 26, 1991, at\n\np.  2.   The  district  court  supportably construed  the  quoted\n\nlanguage as  a  reference  to  the BTC's  failure  to  administer\n\nclozapine,  as recommended  by the RRB.   Id.  at 4.   Relying on\n                                             \n\nLangton, the district court ruled  that, without more, the  BTC's\n       \n\nmere failure  to  provide  this  one  recommended  treatment  was\n\ninsufficient  to demonstrate  a genuine  issue of  material fact.\n\nId. at pp. 3-4.   As concerns  the alleged \"bumping\" of  Miller's\n   \n\n\"therapists,\" see  id. at 4,  the district court  correctly noted\n                      \n\nthat the term \"bumping\" is ambiguous and conclusory.  Id. at 4-5.\n                                                         \n\nThus, the district  court's disposition of  Miller's motions  for\n\nreconsideration and for relief from judgment, see id. at pp. 5-6,\n                                                     \n\nconstituted no abuse of its discretion.\n\n          Thereafter,   Miller   filed  additional   postjudgment\n\nmotions.   See   Memorandum of  November 4,  1991.   The district\n              \n\ncourt denied Miller's motion to amend the pleadings to conform to\n\nhis  Supplementary Affidavit.   See  Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 15(a),(b).\n                                   \n\nHere, we believe the district court erred in holding that Miller-\n\n's \"Supplementary Affidavit reveal[ed] no set of facts that would\n\n                                12\n\nentitle  plaintiff to  relief  under the  law  as stated  in  the\n\nMemorandum and Order of June 11, 1991.\"   Id. at 3.  The June  11\n                                             \n\norder relied on  Langton/Bruder, but the  Supplementary Affidavit\n                               \n\nfiled by  Miller materially altered the  record evidence tendered\n\nin support of his inadequate treatment claim by relating numerous\n\nother procedures  and therapies recommended for Miller by the RRB\n\nwhich were not afforded him by the BTC.  In our view, the Supple-\n\nmentary Affidavit may well have raised a genuine issue of materi-\n\nal  fact as  to whether  Miller's constitutional  claim based  on\n\ninadequate  treatment was actionable.  Nevertheless, the district\n\ncourt did not  abuse its  discretion.  This  court determined  in\n\nLangton that  it was  unnecessary,  indeed inadvisable,  for  the\n       \n\ndistrict court to  address the constitutional  claim to  adequate\n\ntreatment \"because the  existing consent decrees 'require[d]  the\n\nprovision of  adequate treatment for  [BTC] patients' at  a level\n\nbeyond that  required by any  applicable constitutional  minima.\"\n\nLangton,  928 F.2d at 1217.   And so it  is here.  Thus, although\n       \n\nMiller attempted to  assert a constitutional  right to  treatment\n\nbased on professional judgment under Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n307, 323 (1982), and  such cases as Ohlinger v.  Watson, 652 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n775, 777 (9th Cir. 1981) (holding that sex offenders committed to\n\nindeterminate  life  sentences  have  a  constitutional right  to\n\ntreatment providing a realistic opportunity for cure or  improve-\n\nment), and  Cameron v. Tomes, 783  F. Supp. 1511, 1516  (D. Mass.\n                            \n\n1992) (holding  that  involuntarily  committed  SDP  at  BTC  has\n\nconstitutional  right to  treatment based  on professional  judg-\n\n                                13\n\nment), modified,  slip op. 92-1343 (1st Cir.,  March 31, 1993),13\n               \n\nwe  think  the district  court did  not  abuse its  discretion by\n\ndismissing Miller's postjudgment motion to amend the pleadings so\n\nlate in the day.\n\n                               III\n\n          Miller further argues that the district court erred  in\n\nholding that Langton bars his inadequate treatment claim  because\n                    \n\nhe was not a party to Langton.  Nevertheless, and notwithstanding\n                             \n\nthe dispute over whether Miller was voluntarily or  involuntarily\n\ncommitted to the BTC, see supra note 3 &amp; accompanying text, it is\n                               \n\nclear that  he is among  the plaintiff  class in  Langton/Bruder,\n                                                                \n\nwhich is defined as \"all individuals  who are presently or in the\n\nfuture will be civilly  committed to the Treatment Center.\"   See\n                                                                 \n\nBruder, slip  op. at  p. 43.14   Moreover,  both  Miller and  the\n      \n\nBruder plaintiffs charged that the treatment  received at the BTC\n      \n\nwas not constitutionally adequate.  \n\n          Finally, even if Miller's  rights under the  applicable\n\nconsent decree  were violated, the appropriate  vehicle for their\n\nenforcement  is not  a  section 1983  action  but an  action  for\n\ncontempt (like the one  filed by the Bruder plaintiffs  two years\n                                           \n\nafter Miller commenced this action).  See, e.g., DeGidio v. Pung,\n                                                                \n\n                    \n\n     13We decided  that Cameron's  claim was  a challenge to  the\nconditions of  confinement.  See  slip op. at  pp. 12-13.   Thus,\n                                \nwhether SDPs have a constitutional right to  treatment remains an\nopen question in this circuit.  See slip op. at  11-12; Knight v.\n                                                              \nMills, 836 F.2d 659, 668 &amp; n.13 (1st Cir. 1987).\n     \n\n     14Miller's motion to intervene in Bruder sought intervention\n                                             \nas  a named class representative.  Its denial imported no finding\nthat  Miller  was not  adequately  represented  by the  plaintiff\nclass.\n\n                                14\n\n920 F.2d  525, 534 (8th Cir.  1990); Green v.  McKaskle, 788 F.2d\n                                                       \n\n1116, 1123 (5th Cir. 1986).  Cf. Welch v. Spangler, 939 F.2d 570,\n                                                  \n\n572 (8th Cir.  1991).  Any  other rule would  tend to  discourage\n\ngovernmental authorities  from entering  into consent decrees  in\n\npublic law litigation, encourage the splintering of civil  rights\n\nclaims on an individual  basis, and promote disrespect for  judi-\n\ncial decrees  duly entered following careful  proactive review of\n\nthe often  complex mix of individual  and institutional consider-\n\nations involved in such litigation.\n\n                                IV\n\n          Miller next  contends that the district  court erred in\n\nholding  that he lacked standing to assert a constitutional right\n\nof access to the courts on the part of certain other BTC patients\n\nwhom he assisted.  Before the district court, Miller alleged that\n\nhe had been appointed as the legal research assistant for minimum\n\nprivilege  and segregation patients on June  21, 1989 (five years\n\nafter he  commenced this action).   His responsibilities included\n\ninstructing such  patients on the procedure  for requesting legal\n\nmaterials, assisting  their preparation of  legal pleadings,  and\n\nobtaining  and returning books for  patients.  On  March 31, 1991\n\n(approximately two weeks before trial), the Department of Correc-\n\ntions  (\"DOC\")  imposed   certain  restrictions  which  allegedly\n\nprevented  Miller from  performing his  duties as  legal research\n\nassistant.  As of that date, Miller was prohibited from obtaining\n\nbooks from  the shelves of the law library.   As a result, he was\n\nno longer able to Shepardize cases  nor to procure cases cited in\n\ntexts.   In addition, Miller  had to request books  in advance so\n\nthat  some other person could retrieve them.  Miller alleged that\n\n                                15\n\nbooks  requested by him often  were not produced  when Miller and\n\nthe patients arrived at the library.  Other limitations allegedly\n\nimpinged on Miller's ability to communicate with the  patients he\n\nwas supposed  to assist.15   Miller  alleged that these  restric-\n\ntions foreclosed  meaningful legal  research assistance  to other\n\npatients  and that he was  the only legal  assistance afforded to\n\nBTC.\n\n          The district  court rejected the right  of access claim\n\nbecause  Miller had not pleaded a third party claim and failed to\n\nshow that the patients he had  been assisting had no other avenue\n\nof relief.   We affirm the dismissal of the third party claim; it\n\ncame too late.  Cf. Andrews v. Bechtel Power Corp., 780 F.2d 124,\n                                                  \n\n139 (1st Cir.  1985) (upholding  denial of motion  to amend  com-\n\nplaint after  commencement of  trial,  where complaint  had  been\n\nfiled seven years earlier).\n\n          Affirmed; no costs.\n                            \n\n                    \n\n     15For example, Miller was required to sit at one table while\nthe patients he assisted  sat at separate tables in  the library.\nMiller also claimed that often he was not notified by corrections\nofficers that his assistance had been requested by patients.\n\n                                16\n",

Pro se plaintiff  Sherman Miller  appeals\n          Per Curiam.\n                              \n\nfrom  a district  court judgment  for the  defendants in  this 42\n\nU.S.C.    1983  action.   For  the  reasons discussed  below,  we\n\naffirm.  \n\n                                I\n\n          Miller is sixty-five years  old.  For most of  the past\n\nfifteen years, he has been a resident of the Treatment Center for\n\nSexually Dangerous Persons  located in Bridgewater, Massachusetts\n\n(hereinafter:  \"Treatment  Center\" or \"BTC\").   Following a  1978\n\nconviction  for rape, Miller was committed to the BTC pursuant to\n\na Suffolk  Superior  Court  order  adjudicating  him  a  Sexually\n\nDangerous Person (\"SDP\")  pursuant to  M.G.L. c. 123A,    6  (re-\n\npealed) and  directing that he  \"be voluntarily committed  to the\n                                               \n\nTreatment Center  . . . .\" (emphasis supplied).   In 1984, Miller\n\ncommenced this civil rights action.  The amended complaint sought\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and damages for alleged consti-\n\ntutional deprivations  attending his confinement at the BTC.  All\n\nnamed defendants  are state  officials  formerly responsible  for\n\noperations  at the BTC.1  Although the amended complaint asserted\n\nseven claims, only two  are implicated by this appeal.   Miller's\n\nfirst claim alleged  that the defendants  violated his  constitu-\n\ntional right of access to the courts by maintaining an inadequate\n\n                    \n\n     1The defendants are former Department of Corrections Commis-\nsioner Michael  Fair, Charles  Gaughan (former Superintendent  of\nthe Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Bridgewater), James\nCallahan  (former  Commissioner  of   the  Department  of  Mental\nHealth), Richard  Boucher (former  Administrator of the  BTC) and\nMildred Gil (law librarian at the BTC).\n\n                                2\n\nlaw library and restricting library access.  The other  surviving\n\nclaim alleged that the defendants violated Miller's constitution-\n\nal right  to rehabilitative treatment.   Miller alleged  that the\n\ndefendants failed to develop an individual treatment plan (\"ITP\")\n\nfor  him although he believed  such plans had  been developed for\n\nother  BTC patients and  that the denial  of an ITP  violated his\n\nright to due  process and equal  protection under the  Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.2  He sought injunctive relief requiring defendants  to\n\ndevelop  an ITP which would afford him a realistic opportunity to\n\nimprove his mental condition, and requiring defendants to  afford\n\nhim adequate access to the BTC law library.\n\n          On December  10, 1985,  the  district court  granted  a\n\npreliminary injunction on Miller's \"access to the courts\"  claim.\n\nThe order required  the defendants to  obtain certain  additional\n\nvolumes for the  law library  and to ensure  that Miller  receive\n\nreasonable  photocopying  services.   Miller's  criminal sentence\n\nexpired on May 8, 1989.  No significant judicial proceedings took\n\nplace thereafter until the  case was called for trial  in January\n\n1991.  Relying on the expiration of his criminal sentence, Miller\n\nsought release from  the BTC by instituting  a state-court habeas\n\ncorpus proceeding.  On  March 20, 1991, the superior  court ruled\n\nthat  Miller had  been involuntarily  committed to  the Treatment\n                                    \n\nCenter  and, therefore, was  not entitled  to release  until such\n\ntime as  his adjudication as  a SDP  was revoked under  M.G.L. c.\n\n                    \n\n     2Miller  alleged that  the defendants  discriminated against\nhim because of his unique \"voluntary\"  commitment status and that\nthe  BTC maintained  that  Miller's right  to participate  in its\nprograms  was inferior  to  that of  involuntarily committed  BTC\npatients. \n\n                                3\n\n123A,   9.3  Thus, but  for his status as a SDP, Miller  would be\n\na  free man.  Nevertheless, he has never submitted an administra-\n\ntive request for release or reclassification.\n\n          Miller's   1983  action was called for trial in January\n\n1991.  Both sides sought a continuance; the BTC had lost its case\n\nfile and Miller required  further discovery.  The district  judge\n\ncontinued the trial to April but  warned that belated dispositive\n\nmotions  would not be  allowed to delay the  trial further.  Four\n\ndays before the  rescheduled trial, defendants filed  a motion to\n\ndismiss  or for summary judgment, based on this court's March 22,\n\n1991 decision in  Langton v.

Our decision in Langton\n                                                                 \n\nupheld  the district court's ruling that  the defendants were not\n\nin contempt  of  the  consent decrees  but  rather  had  achieved\n\nsubstantial compliance  with  those decrees  notwithstanding  the\n\nfact that the  ITPs of many patients were  not being fully imple-\n\nmented.  We also observed that the BTC had a \"current and compre-\n\nhensive law  library.\"   See  id. at  1213, 1216,  1220-23.   The\n                                 \n\ndefendants contended  that Langton barred  Miller's claims  under\n                                  \n\nthe doctrine  of res  judicata  or collateral  estoppel.   Miller\n                              \n\nmoved to strike defendants' dispositive motion.5\n\n          When the case was called for trial, defendants'  motion\n\nto dismiss/for summary  judgment and Miller's  motions to  strike\n\nand compel  discovery  remained  pending.    The  district  court\n\ninitially told Miller that he would  not have to file a  response\n\nto  defendants'  motion  and  instructed  defendants'  counsel to\n\nassert  their  legal arguments  in the  context  of a  motion for\n\ndirected verdict.   Miller, however, was not  prepared for trial.\n\nHe  had not subpoenaed any  witnesses, being uncertain  as to how\n\nthe  court would proceed on the pending motions.6  Loath to delay\n\nthe resolution of Miller's claims any longer, the  district court\n\n                    \n\n     5Shortly before defendants filed their motion to dismiss/for\nsummary  judgment, Miller  moved  to compel  discovery and  for a\njudgment of contempt.   He sought to compel Michael  Stevens, the\nChairman  of the  BTC's  Reintegration Review  Board (\"RRB\"),  to\ncomplete his  deposition and produce documents.   Miller's motion\nto  strike argued  that defendants  improperly moved  for summary\njudgment before discovery was completed.\n\n     6Miller complained that  he had been unable  to complete the\ndeposition of Michael Stevens, Chairman of the BTC's RRB.  Miller\nhoped to  elicit Stevens'  admission that Miller's  treatment was\nnot  being  based on  professional  judgment  under Youngberg  v.\n                                                             \nRomeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110746\"><a href=\"/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982).\n     \n\n                                5\n\nexpressed  a preference  for  proceeding  to  trial.   But  after\n\nhearing defendants'  arguments, the court  expressed some  uncer-\n\ntainty as  to whether  the  case would  be tried  or resolved  on\n\ndefendants'  motion.7   The  court  recessed to  allow  Miller to\n\nprepare a subpoena for Stevens,  as well as a witness list  and a\n\nproffer indicating how Miller's evidence might defeat defendants'\n\nLangton/Bruder  defense.   After the  recess, Miller  submitted a\n              \n\nwitness  list identifying  six witnesses  on  his \"access  to the\n\ncourts\"  claim and  seven witnesses  on his  inadequate treatment\n\nclaim.8  He  argued that Bruder did not bar  these claims because\n                               \n\n(1) Bruder was not decided  on constitutional grounds; (2) Miller\n          \n\nhad  not been  a party  to  Bruder, in  part due  to his  alleged\n                                  \n\nvoluntary commitment status; (3) many of the issues Miller sought\n\n                    \n\n     7The district court  explained to Miller, \"If you don't have\na proffer of evidence that would establish if credited that there\nis a cause of action remaining in the face of the legal arguments\nthe  defendant is asserting, then whether we  do it as a trial or\n                                                                 \ndo  it as a motion  for a summary judgment, it's  time to end the\n                                          \ncase . . . .\" (emphasis added).\n\n     8Miller's proffer indicated that  he expected two members of\nthe  BTC's  Reintegration Review  Board      Dr.  Mark Sokol  and\nMichael  Stevens     to identify  the treatments  recommended for\nMiller that had not been provided.  Miller further indicated that\nhe  wished to question  Dr. Albert Jurgela,  Director of Clinical\nServices, to find out why various recommended treatments had  not\nbeen  provided.  Miller complained  that the BTC  refused to give\nhim clozapine    a drug  Miller had taken for six or  seven years\nprior to his  incarceration and  which allegedly  allowed him  to\nfunction normally in society    even though the BTC's RRB specif-\nically recommended it.  He implied  that his only hope of release\nmight  rest on securing clozapine therapy.  Miller wanted to call\nDr. Daniel Kreigman and Dr. Martin Miller to inquire  why the BTC\nwas not giving him clozapine.  He expressed the hope that another\nwitness, Dr. Guy Seymour, would testify that Miller suffered from\nschizophrenia, thus justifying the use of clozapine.  (continued)\n     In  support of  his  \"access to  the  courts\" claim,  Miller\nsought to prove that certain restrictions  on his movement within\nthe law  library violated the  constitutional right of  access to\nthe  courts of  inmates he  was assisting in  his capacity  as an\nappointed research assistant.  \n\n                                6\n\nto raise concerning his treatment arose after Bruder was decided,\n                                                    \n\nand  (4) Bruder merely determined that the state was not required\n               \n\nto  implement all  treatments recommended  in a  particular SDP's\n\nITP, it did not decide what the state was required  to provide to\n\na SDP,  such  as Miller,  whose  criminal sentence  had  expired.\n\nDefendants reiterated  their argument that  Langton/Bruder barred\n                                                          \n\nMiller's remaining claims.\n\n          The  district court  concluded that  the case  could be\n\nresolved by affording  Miller an opportunity  to file  affidavits\n\nand memoranda in opposition to defendants' arguments.  The  court\n\nadjourned the  \"trial\" after  one day,  allowing Miller  leave to\n\nsubmit such  filings.    Thereafter,  Miller filed  a  number  of\n\nsubmissions  in support  of  his claims.    With respect  to  his\n\ninadequate  treatment  claim, Miller  averred  that  he had  been\n\nadjudicated  a SDP  and committed  to the  BTC in 1979,  that the\n\nBTC's RRB had formulated  an extensive treatment plan for  him on\n\nNovember 1, 1989, but that  he had \"not been afforded one  of the\n\nbehavioral and pharmacological  treatment modalities  recommended\n\nby the [RRB].\"  He reiterated his complaint that he  had not been\n\ntreated with clozapine, notwithstanding the RRB's recommendation.\n\n          On June 11,  1991, the district court issued a memoran-\n\ndum of  decision denying relief on  Miller's inadequate treatment\n\nclaim.   The  court ruled  that it  was not  necessary to  decide\n\nwhether Langton/Bruder barred  the claim under  the doctrines  of\n                      \n\nres  judicata and collateral  estoppel.  The  court ruled instead\n             \n\nthat Langton/Bruder precluded relief under the doctrine of  stare\n                                                                 \n\ndecisis.   Noting that Miller had based  his inadequate treatment\n       \n\n                                7\n\nclaim largely on the fact that he had not been given clozapine as\n\nrecommended by the RRB, the court reasoned:  \n\n          In light of the recognition by the courts  in\n          Bruder and  Langton  that patients  were  not\n                             \n          receiving all of the treatment recommended in\n          their individual treatment plans,  . . . pla-\n          intiff  has failed  to demonstrate  a genuine\n                                                       \n          issue of  material fact on the  claim of con-\n                                                       \n          stitutionally inadequate treatment . . . [and\n                                            \n          the] defendants are entitled to judgment as a\n          matter of law.  (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n          The court awarded Miller partial relief on his  \"access\n\nto the  courts\" claim,9 but  held that he  had not stated  an ac-\n\ntionable claim  for denial of access  to the courts on  behalf of\n\nhis  fellow  patients because  he  failed  to allege  that  those\n\npatients had no  avenue of  access to the  courts except  through\n\nMiller.  \n\n          Miller  filed  a  motion  for  partial reconsideration,\n\narguing that  the district court  erred in construing  his inade-\n\nquate treatment claim as similar to that raised by the plaintiffs\n\nin Langton/Bruder.  Relying on his May 13, 1991 affidavit, Miller\n                 \n\nargued that, unlike the Langton  plaintiffs, he was not complain-\n                               \n\ning  that he had  not received all  the treatments  that had been\n                                  \n\nrecommended  for him.  Rather, Miller's complaint was that he had\n\nnot received any of the behavioral and pharmacological  treatment\n                \n\nmodalities that had been recommended for him by the  RRB in 1989.\n\nMiller argued  that simply because the BTC was not able to imple-\n\nment  all of the programs  recommended in each  patient's ITP did\n         \n\nnot mean that the BTC had no obligation to implement  some of the\n                                                          \n\n                    \n\n     9The court issued a  judgment declaring that as  of December\n10, 1985,  the BTC  law library was  constitutionally inadequate.\nMiller was awarded  $500 for attorney fees incurred  in enforcing\nthe district court's December 10, 1985 preliminary injunction.\n\n                                8\n\nprograms repeatedly recommended for him.  Miller further  averred\n\nthat his group  therapist and another staff  person were recently\n\n\"bumped,\" which would leave him without treatment.\n\n          The defendants  filed an  opposition which included  an\n\naffidavit from Dr.  Jurgela and  copies of the  RRB's reports  on\n\nMiller's  11/1/89  and 7/25/90  status  reviews.10   Dr.  Jurgela\n\nattested  that  Miller's  therapist  continued to  provide  group\n\ntherapy  to Miller  notwithstanding the  fact  that she  had been\n\n\"bumped,\"  and that Miller also received treatment in the form of\n\nweekly \"house  meetings\" led  by  another staff  clinician.   Dr.\n\nJurgela acknowledged, however, that the current RRB report recom-\n\nmended  that  Miller   receive  individual  therapy,  personality\n\ntesting,  general  behavioral  and plethysmographic  assessments,\n\ncovert conditioning, relapse prevention, and anger and depression\n\nmanagement, but that Miller had not received any of these assess-\n\nments or treatments.11   He also acknowledged that  a psychophar-\n\nmacological consultation had been recommended for Miller, presum-\n\nably a reference to  the recommended clozapine therapy.   The RRB\n\nreports confirmed Miller's allegation that the RRB had recommend-\n\ned a trial use of clozapine in 1989 and that, as of July 1990, he\n\nhad received neither clozapine nor the other recommended services\n\nnoted  immediately above.   The  1989 RRB  report  concluded that\n\nMiller  remained a  SDP whose prognosis  was poor.   The 1990 RRB\n\nreport noted that  services might  be lacking for  Miller and  if\n\n                    \n\n     10Under the consent decree, the RRB is required to  evaluate\neach  patient, on an annual  basis, to determine  the progress of\ntherapy and the advisability of permitting the patient to reenter\nthe community on a limited basis.  See Langton, 928 F.2d at 1210.\n                                              \n\n     11Dr. Jurgela noted that Department of Mental Health (\"DMH\")\npolicy prohibited the use of plethysmography at any DMH facility.\n\n                                9\n\nthat were the case, as opposed to Miller simply resisting servic-\n\nes that had been offered, \"such conditions should be corrected as\n\nsoon  as possible.\"  Miller responded  to the defendants' opposi-\n\ntion, arguing  that defendants' evidence established  that of the\n\nten  treatment modalities that had been recommended by the RRB in\n\n1989, he had received only one (group therapy).\n\n          The district court rejected Miller's contentions on the\n\nground that  Miller  had \"not  demonstrated  a genuine  issue  of\n\nmaterial fact on  the adequacy  of treatment claim.\"   The  court\n\nreiterated that \"the Treatment Center is not obligated to  imple-\n\nment the  [ITP] drawn up  by the  [RRB] in all  its details\"  and\n\nfound that Miller's claim that  he had \"not been afforded  one of\n\nthe  behavioral and  pharmacological treatment  modalities recom-\n\nmended by the [RRB]\" in 1989 was \"a factual assertion not clearly\n\nsupported  by  the  ambiguous  language  in\"  Miller's  affidavit\n\nbecause  Miller  had failed  to identify  a treatment  other than\n\nclozapine that he had not received.  The court further found that\n\nMiller's claim that he  was no longer receiving any  treatment   \n\nsince certain staff members had been \"bump[ed]\"    merely assert-\n\ned \"sketchy facts  and unsupported conclusions\"  which failed  to\n\ncomply with  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56(e).   The court  denied Miller's\n\nmotion  for partial  reconsideration and  his amended  motion for\n\npartial reconsideration.\n\n          Miller then  filed  other  postjudgment  motions:    to\n\nsupplement the pleadings, reopen the case,  and amend the pleadi-\n\nngs to conform to the facts  set forth in Miller's September  23,\n\n1991 affidavit (\"Supplementary Affidavit\").  In the first motion,\n\nMiller argued that further reconsideration  was warranted because\n\n                                10\n\nthe court had failed to  apprise him of the requirements  of Rule\n\n56(e).  Miller's Supplementary Affidavit spelled out each  recom-\n\nmended treatment  with  which  he  had not  been  provided  since\n\n1986.12   The court  declined further reconsideration,  asserting\n\nthat  its June  11, 1991  decision was  not based  on defendants'\n\nmotion for summary judgment,  therefore Miller's alleged unaware-\n\nness of the requirements of Rule 56(e) was irrelevant.  The court\n\nfurther found that Miller's Supplementary Affidavit  disclosed no\n\nset  of facts that might entitle him to relief and that amendment\n\nof  the pleadings following \"trial\"  was not in  the interests of\n\njustice.  The  court held that  Miller's Supplementary  Affidavit\n\nwas  not part  of the record.

We\n\nfind  that the district  court acted well  within its discretion,\n\nparticularly  in view  of the  extreme tardiness of  Miller's re-\n\nquests  for relief  in an  action commenced  in 1984.   Moreover,\n\n                    \n\n     12Among these  were  treatments for  anger,  depression  and\nself-control management, personality testing,  relapse prevention\ntreatment  and plethysmographic  assessment.   But  cf. note  11,\n                                                       \nsupra.\n     \n\n                                11\n\nMiller misapprehends the district court ruling on his  inadequate\n\ntreatment claim.  The district  court correctly ruled that Miller\n\nfailed  to  provide evidentiary  support,  or  even a  sufficient\n\nproffer of evidence,  to support the  claim of inadequate  treat-\n\nment, since he  failed to show that  the claim was not  precluded\n\nunder  the doctrine  of  stare decisis  by  Langton/Bruder.   The\n                                                          \n\ndistrict court arrived at  its decision on the basis  of Miller's\n\nambiguous affidavit attesting that \"he had 'not been afforded one\n                                                                 \n\nof the behavioral and pharmacological treatment modalities recom-\n\nmended by the [RRB]' . . . .\"   Memorandum of August 26, 1991, at\n\np.  2.   The  district  court  supportably construed  the  quoted\n\nlanguage as  a  reference  to  the BTC's  failure  to  administer\n\nclozapine,  as recommended  by the RRB.   Id.  at 4.   Relying on\n                                             \n\nLangton, the district court ruled  that, without more, the  BTC's\n       \n\nmere failure  to  provide  this  one  recommended  treatment  was\n\ninsufficient  to demonstrate  a genuine  issue of  material fact.\n\nId. at pp. 3-4.   As concerns  the alleged \"bumping\" of  Miller's\n   \n\n\"therapists,\" see  id. at 4,  the district court  correctly noted\n                      \n\nthat the term \"bumping\" is ambiguous and conclusory.  Id. at 4-5.\n                                                         \n\nThus, the district  court's disposition of  Miller's motions  for\n\nreconsideration and for relief from judgment, see id. at pp. 5-6,\n                                                     \n\nconstituted no abuse of its discretion.\n\n          Thereafter,   Miller   filed  additional   postjudgment\n\nmotions.   See   Memorandum of  November 4,  1991.   The district\n              \n\ncourt denied Miller's motion to amend the pleadings to conform to\n\nhis  Supplementary Affidavit.   See  Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 15(a),(b).\n                                   \n\nHere, we believe the district court erred in holding that Miller-\n\n's \"Supplementary Affidavit reveal[ed] no set of facts that would\n\n                                12\n\nentitle  plaintiff to  relief  under the  law  as stated  in  the\n\nMemorandum and Order of June 11, 1991.\"   Id. at 3.  The June  11\n                                             \n\norder relied on  Langton/Bruder, but the  Supplementary Affidavit\n                               \n\nfiled by  Miller materially altered the  record evidence tendered\n\nin support of his inadequate treatment claim by relating numerous\n\nother procedures  and therapies recommended for Miller by the RRB\n\nwhich were not afforded him by the BTC.  In our view, the Supple-\n\nmentary Affidavit may well have raised a genuine issue of materi-\n\nal  fact as  to whether  Miller's constitutional  claim based  on\n\ninadequate  treatment was actionable.  Nevertheless, the district\n\ncourt did not  abuse its  discretion.  This  court determined  in\n\nLangton that  it was  unnecessary,  indeed inadvisable,  for  the\n       \n\ndistrict court to  address the constitutional  claim to  adequate\n\ntreatment \"because the  existing consent decrees 'require[d]  the\n\nprovision of  adequate treatment for  [BTC] patients' at  a level\n\nbeyond that  required by any  applicable constitutional  minima.\"\n\nLangton,  928 F.2d at 1217.

Any  other rule would  tend to  discourage\n\ngovernmental authorities  from entering  into consent decrees  in\n\npublic law litigation, encourage the splintering of civil  rights\n\nclaims on an individual  basis, and promote disrespect for  judi-\n\ncial decrees  duly entered following careful  proactive review of\n\nthe often  complex mix of individual  and institutional consider-\n\nations involved in such litigation.\n\n                                IV\n\n          Miller next  contends that the district  court erred in\n\nholding  that he lacked standing to assert a constitutional right\n\nof access to the courts on the part of certain other BTC patients\n\nwhom he assisted.  Before the district court, Miller alleged that\n\nhe had been appointed as the legal research assistant for minimum\n\nprivilege  and segregation patients on June  21, 1989 (five years\n\nafter he  commenced this action).   His responsibilities included\n\ninstructing such  patients on the procedure  for requesting legal\n\nmaterials, assisting  their preparation of  legal pleadings,  and\n\nobtaining  and returning books for  patients.  On  March 31, 1991\n\n(approximately two weeks before trial), the Department of Correc-\n\ntions  (\"DOC\")  imposed   certain  restrictions  which  allegedly\n\nprevented  Miller from  performing his  duties as  legal research\n\nassistant.  As of that date, Miller was prohibited from obtaining\n\nbooks from  the shelves of the law library.   As a result, he was\n\nno longer able to Shepardize cases  nor to procure cases cited in\n\ntexts.   In addition, Miller  had to request books  in advance so\n\nthat  some other person could retrieve them.  Miller alleged that\n\n                                15\n\nbooks  requested by him often  were not produced  when Miller and\n\nthe patients arrived at the library.  Other limitations allegedly\n\nimpinged on Miller's ability to communicate with the  patients he\n\nwas supposed  to assist.15   Miller  alleged that these  restric-\n\ntions foreclosed  meaningful legal  research assistance  to other\n\npatients  and that he was  the only legal  assistance afforded to\n\nBTC.\n\n          The district  court rejected the right  of access claim\n\nbecause  Miller had not pleaded a third party claim and failed to\n\nshow that the patients he had  been assisting had no other avenue\n\nof relief.   We affirm the dismissal of the third party claim; it\n\ncame too late.  Cf. Andrews v.
