Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Robert A.

Plaintiffs-appellants Diana\n\nand Humberto Ramírez appeal from the denial of a motion for\n\nmistrial and claim that the district court erred by admitting\n\nhearsay evidence during the testimony of an expert witness for the\n\ndefendant-appellee,       Dr.     Natalio       Debs-Elías,       in    a     medical\n\nmalpractice trial in the District of Puerto Rico.                   After careful\n\nreview,   we   find   that   the     district       court   did   not    abuse      its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion or in admitting the testimony in\n\nquestion.1\n\n                                I.       Background\n\n             Appellants   filed      a    medical     malpractice      suit   in   the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico, sitting in diversity, against Debs,\n\nalleging that he negligently performed surgery to investigate fluid\n\nleakage that occurred after stitches were removed following Diana\n\nRamírez's breast augmentation and scar-removal surgery.                            Debs\n\n\n\n1\n  We note that appellants' brief fails to comply with Federal Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 28(a)(4), which requires a jurisdictional\nstatement identifying the basis for subject-matter jurisdiction, a\nstatement of the relevant facts supporting appellate jurisdiction,\ndates of filing, and an assertion that the appeal is from a final\norder or judgment or is otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of\nthis court. Ramírez's brief states only that jurisdiction exists\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2255.     The incorrect citation of the federal\nhabeas statute as the source of federal jurisdiction, combined with\nthe various other procedural shortcomings of appellants' filings\nwith this court, go beyond appellants' characterization at oral\nargument as a mere \"technical oversight.\" While it is within our\nauthority to take action -- including dismissal as requested by\nDebs -- in response to the failure to comply with the rules of\nprocedure, see Fed. R. App. P. 3(a)(2), we find it unnecessary\nbecause the appeal lacks substantive merit.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fperformed no diagnostic testing to confirm his suspicion that the\n\nleakage came from a ruptured implant prior to performing the second\n\nsurgery.       Appellants claimed that, as a result of the second\n\nsurgery, the scarring Ramírez had sought to have corrected was\n\nactually made worse, and one of her breasts was deformed.\n\n            During a six-day trial in February 2003, the appellants\n\npresented an expert witness, Dr. José Pérez-Guerri, to establish\n\nthat the treatment Debs provided fell below the relevant standard\n\nof care, a required element for a claim of medical negligence under\n\nPuerto Rico law.       See Olivers v. Abreu, 101 D.P.R. 209, 226-27, 1\n\nP.R. Sup. Ct. Off'l Translations 293, 313 (1973).                To rebut this\n\nevidence, the defense called its own expert, Dr. Robert Walton,\n\nwhose testimony is the subject of this appeal.\n\n            During Dr. Walton's direct examination, over repeated\n\nobjections from the appellants, the defense referred Dr. Walton to\n\nDr. Pérez-Guerri's testimony that the second procedure had caused\n\nadditional scarring, and asked, \"What do you have to say about\n\nthat?\"     Dr. Walton responded, \"My Spanish is not very good, but\n\nthere is a term for this, it's called 'disparate.'\" \"Disparate\" is\n\na Spanish term that translates as \"nonsense\" or \"absurdity,\" New\n\nRevised    Velázquez    Spanish   and    English    Dictionary    268   (1985),\n\nalthough appellants contend that it carries a more negative or\n\ndisparaging connotation than its English equivalents suggest.                The\n\njury   burst    into   laughter   at    the   use   of   the   term,   prompting\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fappellants' counsel to move for a mistrial on the ground that Dr.\n\nWalton had improperly characterized the testimony of Dr. Pérez-\n\nGuerri, thus resulting in prejudice to the jury.      The district\n\ncourt agreed that Dr. Walton had stepped outside the bounds of his\n\nrole as witness, and accordingly struck the response from the\n\nrecord, instructed the jury to \"totally disregard\" the response,\n\nand admonished Dr. Walton to adhere strictly to his professional\n\nopinion.2\n\n            After the direct examination resumed, Dr. Walton was\n\nasked what the medical literature indicates about scarring caused\n\nby a second surgery.     Following an objection that the question\n\ncalled for a response that would necessarily be comprised of\n\nhearsay, the defense asked Dr. Walton whether he was familiar with\n\nthe literature on the subject.    Over a renewed hearsay objection,\n\nDr. Walton responded by referring to a Dr. Earl Peacock, who, Dr.\n\nWalton testified, had published research on the topic of scarring.\n\nHe then continued, \"A long time ago, when surgeons started doing\n\nrepairs in the fingers,\" at which point the appellants' counsel\n\nobjected that the answer was nonresponsive, and then made another\n\nhearsay objection and a request to strike the references to Dr.\n\nPeacock.    The court questioned the witness directly, establishing\n\nthat he was testifying not from Dr. Peacock's work, but from his\n\n\n2\n   In addition, when it instructed the jury at the close of the\ntrial, the district court twice reminded the jurors that they must\nnot consider stricken testimony in their deliberations.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fown collective knowledge, including other sources, independent\n\nresearch, and experience with the subject of scarring.   Dr. Walton\n\nwas then permitted to continue his answer, in which he explained\n\nthat the only clinical evidence or other research that indicated\n\nincreased scarring when a second surgery is performed soon after a\n\nfirst was specific to surgery performed on the hand.\n\n          On February 23, 2003, the jury returned a verdict for the\n\ndefendant, indicating on a special verdict form that it did not\n\nfind that Debs violated the standard of care by performing the\n\nsecond surgery.   Appellants now argue that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial as a\n\nresult of Dr. Walton's characterization of the appellants' expert\n\ntestimony as \"disparate,\" and in permitting Dr. Walton to present\n\nhearsay testimony,3 in the form of an oral summary of Dr. Peacock's\n\npublished research.   Since we find no abuse of discretion, we\n\naffirm the judgment below.\n\n\n\n\n3\n   Debs suggests that appellants have waived the hearsay issue by\nfailing to address it adequately in their brief.      We disagree.\nWhile the brief devotes only a few pages to the issue, it\nadequately describes the relevant facts, which it analyzes in the\ncontext of specific rules of evidence and caselaw. Thus, the issue\nis not raised in the \"perfunctory manner\" that would result in its\nwaiver. See, e.g., United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                               -5-\n\f                            II.   Analysis\n\n1.   Motion for mistrial\n\n            Debs does not challenge the district court's ruling that\n\nDr. Walton's description of Dr. Pérez-Guerri's conclusions was an\n\ninadmissible characterization of the latter's testimony.      Thus, we\n\nhave only to consider whether, assuming the evidentiary error, the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion when it opted to strike the\n\ntestimony and issue a curative instruction instead of declaring a\n\nmistrial.   See United States v. Rullán-Rivera, 60 F.3d 16, 18 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (\"A ruling denying a motion for mistrial is reviewed for\n\nmanifest abuse of discretion . . . .\").      Our caselaw on this point\n\nis clear:\n\n            When . . . a motion to declare a mistrial has\n            its genesis in a claim that improper evidence\n            came before the jury, the court must first\n            weigh the claim of impropriety and, if that\n            claim is well founded, strike the offending\n            evidence.    Next, unless the court believes\n            that the evidence is seriously prejudicial and\n            that a curative instruction will be an\n            insufficient    antidote,  the  court   should\n            proceed with the trial after instructing the\n            jury to disregard the evidence. Declaring a\n            mistrial is a last resort, only to be\n            implemented if the taint is ineradicable, that\n            is, only if the trial judge believes that the\n            jury's exposure to the evidence is likely to\n            prove beyond realistic hope of repair.\n\nUnited States v. Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1184 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(emphasis added); see also Rodríguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms\n\nMfr., Inc., 399 F.3d 52, 63 (1st Cir. 2005) (applying same standard\n\nto civil employment discrimination claim). We went on to note that\n\n                                  -6-\n\f\"within wide margins, the potential for prejudice stemming from\n\nimproper testimony          .    .   .   can   be    satisfactorily          dispelled   by\n\nappropriate curative instructions.\"                  Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d at 1184.\n\nMoreover, on review, we must presume that jurors will follow a\n\ndirect instruction to disregard the offending evidence.                            Id. at\n\n1185.      This presumption is only rebutted if \"it appears probable\n\nthat . . . responsible jurors will not be able to put the testimony\n\nto one side, and, moreover, that the testimony will likely be\n\nseriously prejudicial to the aggrieved party.\" Id.; see also Greer\n\nv. Miller, 483 U.S. 756, 766 n.8 (1987) (\"We normally presume that\n\na   jury    will   follow       an   instruction        to    disregard      inadmissible\n\nevidence . . . unless there is an overwhelming probability that the\n\njury will be unable to follow the court's instructions, and a\n\nstrong     likelihood   that         the    effect    of      the    evidence   would    be\n\ndevastating to the defendant.\") (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n             Put simply, appellants have not come close to rebutting\n\nour presumption that the district court's curative instruction to\n\ndisregard     --   issued        immediately        after      Dr.    Walton    gave     the\n\nchallenged     testimony         and       reinforced        during    the    final    jury\n\ninstructions -- was sufficient to remedy any prejudice caused by\n\nDr. Walton's use of the term \"disparate.\"                       Appellants argue that\n\nthey were prejudiced by the undercutting of Dr. Pérez-Guerri's\n\ntestimony, which was the only evidence submitted to show the\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\frequisite standard of care, yet they have made no satisfactory\n\nshowing that it was \"probable\" that the jury would have been unable\n\nto put aside Dr. Walton's comment when instructed to do so.      On\n\nthis point, appellants can offer only the observations that the\n\njurors laughed when Dr. Walton referred to Dr. Pérez-Guerri's\n\nconclusions as \"disparate,\" and that the statement constituted an\n\nassessment of Dr. Pérez-Guerri's credibility.   With regard to the\n\nformer, the jury's outburst preceded the curative instructions, and\n\nappears to have been nothing more than a spontaneous response to\n\nthe use of an unexpected colloquialism in the courtroom.        The\n\ndistrict court observed this behavior from a much better vantage\n\npoint than ours, and evidently did not interpret it to be an\n\nindication that the jury had been irredeemably biased.    We see no\n\nreason to question this evaluation.\n\n          We also reject appellants' argument that the nature of\n\nthe erroneous testimony -- a statement that, they argue, impugned\n\ntheir expert's credibility -- required a mistrial.       Even if we\n\naccept appellants' claim that the challenged testimony impugned\n\ntheir expert's credibility, we still would not think that they were\n\nentitled to a mistrial. Contrary to the appellants' reading of our\n\ndecision in United States v. Shay, we there held that expert\n\ntestimony directed at credibility need not always be excluded as a\n\nmatter of law.     57 F.3d 126, 131-32 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[N]o\n\nconstitutional provision, law, or rule requires the automatic\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fexclusion    of    expert   testimony      simply    because     it   concerns   a\n\ncredibility question.\").           If such testimony need not always be\n\nexcluded, it cannot be the case that it must always lead to a\n\nmistrial.     Under the circumstances, we can find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the district court's choice to issue a curative\n\ninstruction rather than take the drastic step of declaring a\n\nmistrial.\n\n2.   Hearsay objection\n\n            We find appellants' hearsay objection equally lacking in\n\nmerit.      They   argue    that   Dr.    Walton    summarized    the   published\n\nfindings of Dr. Peacock, which, if true, would constitute hearsay\n\ntestimony as defined by Federal Rule of Evidence 801.                 The hearsay\n\ndid not, they argue, fall within the \"learned treatise\" exception\n\nof Rule 803(18) because no foundation was laid to establish the\n\nreliability of Dr. Peacock's studies.              Moreover, they argue, Rule\n\n803(18) permits only the reading of the text of a learned treatise,\n\nnot an oral summary thereof.4              We review the district court's\n\nevidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Rodríguez-\n\nTorres, 399 F.3d at 62.\n\n            We find that appellants' analysis went off course at the\n\nstart.   It may appear from Dr. Walton's initial response that he\n\n\n4\n   Appellants also argue that Dr. Walton's failure to mention the\nPeacock studies at his pre-trial deposition \"compound[ed] the\nhearsay problem[],\" Br. of Appellants at 15, although they cite no\nlegal authority to explain how. We note that appellants have made\nno separate claim of any discovery violation.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fwas launching into a summary of Dr. Peacock's published works.\n\nHowever, the district court questioned Dr. Walton extensively on\n\nthis point prior to letting him continue his answer:\n\n          THE COURT: Are you talking now from your own\n          experience, Doctor?\n\n          THE WITNESS: I'm talking about the concept of\n          intervening early versus intervening late.\n\n          THE COURT:   Are you talking about what the\n          previous writer has indicated or are you\n          talking about other sources of information?\n\n          THE WITNESS:   Other sources of information,\n          it's my collective --\n\n          . . .\n\n          THE COURT:      Have you independently written\n          about this?\n\n          THE WITNESS:      Yes,    I   have,   sir.    I   have\n          written --\n\n          THE COURT:       And     researched    this   subject\n          yourself?\n\n          THE WITNESS:    Yes, I have.\n\n          THE COURT:    And you have had experience on\n          this subject?\n\n          THE WITNESS:    Yes, sir.\n\n          THE COURT:     Very well.       You can go ahead and\n          answer.\n\nTrial Tr. at 62-64, Ramírez v. Debs-Elías (D.P.R. Feb. 21, 2003)\n\n(No. 01-1034).    Based on this exchange, it is clear that the\n\ntestimony following Dr. Walton's reference to the studies of Dr.\n\nPeacock was not a summary thereof, but rather a description, based\n\n                                   -10-\n\fon Dr. Walton's own expertise, of the current state of medical\n\nresearch on the subject of scarring.5            While it may be that Dr.\n\nWalton's expert opinion was formed, in part, on the basis of the\n\npublished works of Dr. Peacock and other researchers, scholarly\n\nliterature    is   information      reasonably   relied    upon   by   medical\n\nexperts.     See Fed. R. Evid. 703; cf. Trull v. Volkswagen of Am.,\n\nInc., 187 F.3d 88, 97 (1st Cir. 1999) (finding no abuse of\n\ndiscretion    in   admission   of    testimony   about    the   content   of   a\n\npublished report based on federally collected data, because, inter\n\nalia, it \"appear[ed] to satisfy Fed. R. Evid. 703\").               We see no\n\nabuse of discretion in the district court's admission of Dr.\n\nWalton's expert testimony.\n\n3.   Sanctions\n\n             Finally, Debs has requested that we award costs and\n\nattorney's fees to him as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous\n\nappeal.    We have imposed sanctions under Federal Rule of Appellate\n\nProcedure 38 where \"the overwhelming weight of precedent was\n\nagainst appellant's position, where appellant could set forth no\n\nfacts to support its position, or where, in short, there simply was\n\nno legitimate basis for pursuing an appeal.\"              Kowalski v. Gagne,\n\n914 F.2d 299, 309 (1st Cir. 1990).          With respect to their appeal of\n\n\n5\n  To the extent that the initial statement that a Dr. Peacock had\npublished studies on scarring was itself hearsay, we find that it\nwould have had no prejudicial effect because there was no testimony\nconcerning the content of those studies. Thus, any potential error\nin admitting it was harmless.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthe district court's refusal to declare a mistrial, appellants\n\nfailed even to mention our controlling precedent from Sepúlveda in\n\ntheir brief, and have fallen far short of rebutting our presumption\n\nthat the district court's curative instruction was sufficient to\n\nrepair any prejudice that resulted from the characterization of Dr.\n\nPérez-Guerri's   testimony   as    \"disparate.\"     Appellants'     hearsay\n\nargument also lacks any legitimate basis in light of the testimony\n\nactually admitted.     We are therefore inclined to award reasonable\n\nattorney's fees, in addition to the costs automatically awarded\n\nupon affirmance, against appellants.\n\n                            III.   Conclusion\n\n          For    the   reasons   stated   above,   the   judgment   of   the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.        In accordance with Federal Rule of\n\nAppellate Procedure 38, appellants are ordered to file, within 14\n\ndays of the entry of this judgment, a response indicating why\n\nattorney's fees should not be awarded to appellee.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f",

Appellants claimed that, as a result of the second surgery, the scarring Ram&#237;rez had sought to have corrected was actually made worse, and one of her breasts was deformed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a six-day trial in February 2003, the appellants presented an expert witness, Dr. Jos&#233; P&#233;rez-Guerri, to establish that the treatment Debs provided fell below the relevant standard of care, a required element for a claim of medical negligence under Puerto Rico law. <i>See Oliveros v. Abreu,</i> 101 D.P.R. 209, 226-27, 1973 WL 35678, P.R. Sup.Ct. Off'l Translations 293, 313 (1973). To rebut this evidence, the defense called its own expert, Dr. Robert Walton, whose testimony is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Dr. Walton's direct examination, over repeated objections from the appellants, the defense referred Dr. Walton to Dr. P&#233;rez-Guerri's testimony that the second procedure had caused additional scarring, and asked, \"What do you have to say about that?\" Dr. Walton responded, \"My Spanish is not very good, but there is a term for this, it's called `disparate.'\" \"Disparate\" is a Spanish term that translates as \"nonsense\" or \"absurdity,\" <i>New Revised Vel&#225;zquez Spanish and English Dictionary</i> 268 (1985), although appellants contend that it carries a more negative or disparaging connotation than its English equivalents suggest. The jury burst into laughter at the use of the term, prompting appellants' counsel to move for a mistrial on the ground that Dr. Walton had improperly characterized the testimony of Dr. P&#233;rez-Guerri, thus resulting in prejudice to the jury. The district court agreed that Dr. Walton had stepped outside the bounds of his role as witness, and accordingly struck the response from the record, instructed the jury to \"totally disregard\" the response, and admonished Dr. Walton to adhere strictly to his professional opinion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the direct examination resumed, Dr. Walton was asked what the medical literature indicates about scarring caused by a second surgery. Following an objection that the question called for a response that would necessarily be comprised of hearsay, the defense asked Dr. Walton whether he was familiar with the literature on the subject. Over a renewed hearsay objection, Dr. Walton responded by referring to a Dr. Earl Peacock, who, Dr. Walton testified, had published research on the topic of scarring. He then continued, \"A long time ago, when surgeons started doing repairs in the fingers,\" at which point the appellants' counsel objected that the answer was nonresponsive, and then made another hearsay objection and a request to strike the references to Dr. Peacock. The court questioned the witness directly, establishing that he was testifying not from Dr. Peacock's work, but from his own collective knowledge, including other sources, independent research, and experience with the subject of scarring. Dr. Walton was then permitted to continue his answer, in which he explained that the only clinical evidence or other research that indicated increased scarring when a second surgery is performed soon after a first was specific to surgery performed on the hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 23, 2003, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, indicating on a special verdict form that it did not find that Debs violated the standard of care by performing the second surgery. Appellants now argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial as a result of Dr. Walton's characterization of the appellants' expert testimony as \"disparate,\" and in permitting Dr. Walton to present hearsay testimony,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> in the form of an oral summary of Dr. Peacock's published research. Since we find no abuse of discretion, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Motion for mistrial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Debs does not challenge the district court's ruling that Dr. Walton's description of Dr. P&#233;rez-Guerri's conclusions was an inadmissible characterization of the latter's testimony. Thus, we have only to consider whether, assuming the evidentiary error, the district court abused its discretion when it opted to strike the testimony and issue a curative instruction instead of declaring a mistrial. <i>See United States v. Rullan-Rivera,</i> 60 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"A ruling denying a motion for mistrial is reviewed for manifest abuse of discretion....\"). Our caselaw on this point is clear:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When ... a motion to declare a mistrial has its genesis in a claim that improper evidence came before the jury, the court must first weigh the claim of impropriety and, if that claim is well founded, strike the offending evidence. Next, unless the court believes that the evidence is seriously prejudicial and that a curative instruction will be an insufficient antidote, the court should proceed with the trial after instructing the jury to disregard the evidence. <i>Declaring a mistrial is a last resort,</i> only to be implemented if the taint is ineradicable, that is, only if the trial judge believes that the jury's exposure to the evidence is likely to prove beyond realistic hope of repair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1184 (1st Cir.1993) (emphasis added); <i>see also Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 52, 63 (1st Cir.2005) (applying same standard to civil employment discrimination claim). We went on to note that \"within wide margins, the potential for prejudice stemming from improper testimony ... can be satisfactorily dispelled by appropriate curative instructions.\" <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1184. Moreover, on review, we must presume that jurors will follow a direct instruction to disregard the offending evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 1185. This presumption is only rebutted if \"it appears probable that ... responsible jurors will not be able to put the testimony to one side, and, moreover, that the testimony will likely be seriously prejudicial to the aggrieved party.\" <i>Id.; see also Greer v. Miller,</i> 483 U.S. 756, 766 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987) (\"We normally presume that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence ... unless there is an overwhelming probability that the jury will be unable to follow the court's instructions, and a strong likelihood that the effect of the evidence would be devastating to the defendant.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Put simply, appellants have not come close to rebutting our presumption that the district court's curative instruction to disregard&#8212;issued immediately after Dr. Walton gave the challenged testimony and reinforced during the final jury instructions&#8212;was sufficient to remedy any prejudice caused by Dr. Walton's use of the term \"disparate.\" Appellants argue that they were prejudiced by the undercutting of Dr. P&#233;rez-Guerri's testimony, which was the only evidence submitted to show the requisite standard of care, yet they have made no satisfactory showing that it was \"probable\" that the jury would have been unable to put aside Dr. Walton's comment when instructed to do so. On this point, appellants can offer only the observations that the jurors laughed when Dr. Walton referred to Dr. P&#233;rez-Guerri's conclusions as \"disparate,\" and that the statement constituted an assessment of Dr. P&#233;rez-Guerri's credibility. With regard to the former, the jury's outburst preceded the curative instructions, and appears to have been nothing more than a spontaneous response to the use of an unexpected colloquialism in the courtroom. The district court observed this behavior from a much better vantage point than ours, and evidently did not interpret it to be an indication that the jury had been irredeemably biased. We see no reason to question this evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject appellants' argument that the nature of the erroneous testimony&#8212;a statement that, they argue, impugned their expert's credibility&#8212;required a mistrial. Even if we accept appellants' claim that the challenged testimony impugned their expert's credibility, we still would not think that they were entitled to a mistrial. Contrary to the appellants' reading of our decision in <i>United States v. Shay,</i> we there held that expert testimony directed at credibility need not always be excluded as a matter of law. 57 F.3d 126, 131-32 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[N]o constitutional provision, law, or rule requires the automatic exclusion of expert testimony simply because it concerns a credibility question.\"). If such testimony need not always be excluded, it cannot be the case that it must always lead to a mistrial. Under the circumstances, we can find no abuse of discretion in the district court's choice to issue a curative instruction rather than take the drastic step of declaring a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Hearsay objection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find appellants' hearsay objection equally lacking in merit. They argue that Dr. Walton summarized the published findings of Dr. Peacock, which, if true, would constitute hearsay testimony as defined by Federal Rule of Evidence 801. The hearsay did not, they argue, fall within the \"learned treatise\" exception of Rule 803(18) because no foundation was laid to establish the reliability of Dr. Peacock's studies. Moreover, they argue, Rule 803(18) permits only the reading of the text of a learned treatise, not an oral summary thereof.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We review the district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., Rodriguez-Torres,</i> 399 F.3d at 62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that appellants' analysis went off course at the start. It may appear from Dr. Walton's initial response that he was launching into a summary of Dr. Peacock's published works. However, the district court questioned Dr. Walton extensively on this point prior to letting him continue his answer:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Are you talking now from your own experience, Doctor?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE WITNESS: I'm talking about the concept of intervening early versus intervening late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Are you talking about what the previous writer has indicated or are you talking about other sources of information?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE WITNESS: Other sources of information, it's my collective&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Have you independently written about this?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE WITNESS: Yes, I have, sir.

Debs-El&#237;as</i> (D.P.R. Feb. 21, 2003) (No. 01-1034). Based on this exchange, it is clear that the testimony following Dr. Walton's reference to the studies of Dr. Peacock was not a summary thereof, but rather a description, based on Dr. Walton's own expertise, of the current state of medical research on the subject of scarring.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> While it may be that Dr. Walton's expert opinion was formed, in part, on the basis of the published works of Dr. Peacock and other researchers, scholarly literature is information reasonably relied upon by medical experts. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 703; <i>cf. Trull v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,</i> 187 F.3d 88, 97 (1st Cir.1999) (finding no abuse of discretion in admission of testimony about the content of a published report based on federally collected data, because, <i>inter alia,</i> it \"appear[ed] to satisfy Fed.R.Evid. 703\"). We see no abuse of discretion in the district court's admission of Dr. Walton's expert testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Sanctions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Debs has requested that we award costs and attorney's fees to him as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous appeal. We have imposed sanctions under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 where \"the overwhelming weight of precedent was against appellant's position, where appellant could set forth no facts to support its position, or where, in short, there simply was no legitimate basis for pursuing an appeal.\" <i>Kowalski v. Gagne,</i> 914 F.2d 299, 309 (1st Cir.1990). With respect to their appeal of the district court's refusal to declare a mistrial, appellants failed even to mention our controlling precedent from <i>Sepulveda</i> in their brief, and have fallen far short of rebutting our presumption that the district court's curative instruction was sufficient to repair any prejudice that resulted from the characterization of Dr. P&#233;rez-Guerri's testimony as \"disparate.\" Appellants' hearsay argument also lacks any legitimate basis in light of the testimony actually admitted. We are therefore inclined to award reasonable attorney's fees, in addition to the costs automatically awarded upon affirmance, against appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

Ram&#237;rez's brief states only that jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. The incorrect citation of the federal habeas statute as the source of federal jurisdiction, combined with the various other procedural shortcomings of appellants' filings with this court, go beyond appellants' characterization at oral argument as a mere \"technical oversight.\" While it is within our authority to take action&#8212;including dismissal as requested by Debs&#8212;in response to the failure to comply with the rules of procedure,<i>see</i> Fed. R.App. P. 3(a)(2), we find it unnecessary because the appeal lacks substantive merit.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In addition, when it instructed the jury at the close of the trial, the district court twice reminded the jurors that they must not consider stricken testimony in their deliberations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Debs suggests that appellants have waived the hearsay issue by failing to address it adequately in their brief.

Next, unless the court believes that the evidence is seriously prejudicial and that a curative instruction will be an insufficient antidote, the court should proceed with the trial after instructing the jury to disregard the evidence. <i>Declaring a mistrial is a last resort,</i> only to be implemented if the taint is ineradicable, that is, only if the trial judge believes that the jury's exposure to the evidence is likely to prove beyond realistic hope of repair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

On this point, appellants can offer only the observations that the jurors laughed when Dr. Walton referred to Dr. P&#233;rez-Guerri's conclusions as \"disparate,\" and that the statement constituted an assessment of Dr. P&#233;rez-Guerri's credibility. With regard to the former, the jury's outburst preceded the curative instructions, and appears to have been nothing more than a spontaneous response to the use of an unexpected colloquialism in the courtroom. The district court observed this behavior from a much better vantage point than ours, and evidently did not interpret it to be an indication that the jury had been irredeemably biased. We see no reason to question this evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject appellants' argument that the nature of the erroneous testimony&#8212;a statement that, they argue, impugned their expert's credibility&#8212;required a mistrial. Even if we accept appellants' claim that the challenged testimony impugned their expert's credibility, we still would not think that they were entitled to a mistrial. Contrary to the appellants' reading of our decision in <i>United States v. Shay,</i> we there held that expert testimony directed at credibility need not always be excluded as a matter of law. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196160\"><a href=\"/opinion/196160/united-states-v-shay/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 131-32 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[N]o constitutional provision, law, or rule requires the automatic exclusion of expert testimony simply because it concerns a credibility question.\"). If such testimony need not always be excluded, it cannot be the case that it must always lead to a mistrial. Under the circumstances, we can find no abuse of discretion in the district court's choice to issue a curative instruction rather than take the drastic step of declaring a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Hearsay objection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find appellants' hearsay objection equally lacking in merit. They argue that Dr. Walton summarized the published findings of Dr. Peacock, which, if true, would constitute hearsay testimony as defined by Federal Rule of Evidence 801. The hearsay did not, they argue, fall within the \"learned treatise\" exception of Rule 803(18) because no foundation was laid to establish the reliability of Dr. Peacock's studies. Moreover, they argue, Rule 803(18) permits only the reading of the text of a learned treatise, not an oral summary thereof.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We review the district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., Rodriguez-Torres,</i> 399 F.3d at 62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that appellants' analysis went off course at the start. It may appear from Dr. Walton's initial response that he was launching into a summary of Dr. Peacock's published works. However, the district court questioned Dr. Walton extensively on this point prior to letting him continue his answer:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Are you talking now from your own experience, Doctor?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE WITNESS: I'm talking about the concept of intervening early versus intervening late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Are you talking about what the previous writer has indicated or are you talking about other sources of information?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE WITNESS: Other sources of information, it's my collective&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Have you independently written about this?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE WITNESS: Yes, I have, sir.

Debs-El&#237;as</i> (D.P.R. Feb. 21, 2003) (No. 01-1034). Based on this exchange, it is clear that the testimony following Dr. Walton's reference to the studies of Dr. Peacock was not a summary thereof, but rather a description, based on Dr. Walton's own expertise, of the current state of medical research on the subject of scarring.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> While it may be that Dr. Walton's expert opinion was formed, in part, on the basis of the published works of Dr. Peacock and other researchers, scholarly literature is information reasonably relied upon by medical experts. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 703; <i>cf.

We see no abuse of discretion in the district court's admission of Dr. Walton's expert testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Sanctions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Debs has requested that we award costs and attorney's fees to him as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous appeal. We have imposed sanctions under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 where \"the overwhelming weight of precedent was against appellant's position, where appellant could set forth no facts to support its position, or where, in short, there simply was no legitimate basis for pursuing an appeal.\" <i>Kowalski v. Gagne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548343\"><a href=\"/opinion/548343/linda-kowalski-aka-linda-larochelle-etc-v-richard-j-gagne-aetna/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 309 (1st Cir.1990). With respect to their appeal of the district court's refusal to declare a mistrial, appellants failed even to mention our controlling precedent from <i>Sepulveda</i> in their brief, and have fallen far short of rebutting our presumption that the district court's curative instruction was sufficient to repair any prejudice that resulted from the characterization of Dr. P&#233;rez-Guerri's testimony as \"disparate.\" Appellants' hearsay argument also lacks any legitimate basis in light of the testimony actually admitted. We are therefore inclined to award reasonable attorney's fees, in addition to the costs automatically awarded upon affirmance, against appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. In accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, appellants are ordered to file, within 14 days of the entry of this judgment, a response indicating why attorney's fees should not be awarded to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We note that appellants' brief fails to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(4), which requires a jurisdictional statement identifying the basis for subject-matter jurisdiction, a statement of the relevant facts supporting appellate jurisdiction, dates of filing, and an assertion that the appeal is from a final order or judgment or is otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of this court. Ram&#237;rez's brief states only that jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. The incorrect citation of the federal habeas statute as the source of federal jurisdiction, combined with the various other procedural shortcomings of appellants' filings with this court, go beyond appellants' characterization at oral argument as a mere \"technical oversight.\" While it is within our authority to take action&#8212;including dismissal as requested by Debs&#8212;in response to the failure to comply with the rules of procedure,<i>see</i> Fed. R.App. P. 3(a)(2), we find it unnecessary because the appeal lacks substantive merit.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In addition, when it instructed the jury at the close of the trial, the district court twice reminded the jurors that they must not consider stricken testimony in their deliberations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Debs suggests that appellants have waived the hearsay issue by failing to address it adequately in their brief. We disagree. While the brief devotes only a few pages to the issue, it adequately describes the relevant facts, which it analyzes in the context of specific rules of evidence and caselaw. Thus, the issue is not raised in the \"perfunctory manner\" that would result in its waiver<i>See, e.g., United States v.
