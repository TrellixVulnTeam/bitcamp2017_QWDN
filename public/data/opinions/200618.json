Defendant Otoniel Medina\n\nand Defendant José Medina each appeal their convictions, following\n\na joint jury trial, on conspiracy and drug charges.1                José Medina\n\nalso       appeals   his   sentence.         This   Court   has   jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.                We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n              Defendants      José   and     Otoniel   Medina     are   brothers.\n\nEvidence at trial indicated José was the leader of a cocaine\n\ndistribution conspiracy.             Otoniel lived with his brother and\n\nassisted in the sale of cocaine; making deliveries, accepting\n\npayments, and taking orders when José was not available.\n\n              In December 1999, Edward Giargiari arranged to purchase\n\none half kilogram of cocaine from José.                   On December 9, José\n\ndelivered a quarter kilogram and arranged to deliver the remaining\n\namount      the   following   evening.        Following     the   initial   sale,\n\nGiargiari was arrested by members of the local police.                  The police\n\nsearched his hotel room and discovered the cocaine and $8,000 in\n\n\n\n       1\n      The jury convicted Defendant Otoniel Medina on one count of\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846,\nand one count of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).        The district court\nsentenced Otoniel to 63 months imprisonment. The jury convicted\nDefendant José Medina on one count of conspiracy to distribute\ncocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, two counts of possession\nwith intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine in violation\nof 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and two counts of unlawful use of a\ncommunication facility in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 843(b). The\ndistrict court sentenced José to 121 months imprisonment.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fcash. Following his arrest, Giargiari agreed to work with the Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration as a cooperating witness. Giargiari\n\nnamed José as his supplier and confessed to the planned purchase of\n\nadditional cocaine.\n\n            Over the next three months, Giargiari, at the direction\n\nof DEA agents, contacted José and arranged to purchase additional\n\nquantities of cocaine. On December 23, 1998, Giargiari arranged to\n\npurchase a quarter kilogram of cocaine. José sent an intermediary,\n\nco-defendant Josué Vázquez, to deliver the cocaine and accept\n\npayment.     In   March    1999,   Giargiari       arranged   to   purchase   one\n\nkilogram of cocaine. José conducted the sale. Otoniel and Vázquez\n\neach were    present      and   assisted    with    the   transaction.    After\n\nGiargiari confirmed the presence of one kilogram of cocaine, law\n\nenforcement agents interrupted the sale and arrested José, Otoniel,\n\nand Vázquez.       The agents recovered a paper bag containing 1.2\n\nkilograms of cocaine.\n\n            Following his arrest, José consented to a search of the\n\nresidence he shared with Otoniel.                During the search, officers\n\nrecovered a scale, cash, cocaine, and other evidence of narcotics\n\npossession and distribution.\n\n            At    trial,    Giargiari      and     several    other   Government\n\nwitnesses testified that they had purchased significant amounts of\n\ncocaine from José on a regular basis.              Vázquez and José's cousin,\n\nJosé Ortiz, both testified that they had sold or delivered cocaine\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fon José's behalf.         Most witnesses also testified that Otoniel\n\nassisted his brother in selling cocaine.\n\n            A key component of Defendants' trial strategy was to\n\ndiscredit the Government's witnesses, most of whom were admitted\n\ndrug dealers that had received immunity or a reduced sentence in\n\nexchange for their testimony.         During trial, cross-examination of\n\na   key   Government      witness   revealed   impeachment   evidence   the\n\nGovernment    had   not    previously   disclosed   to   Otoniel.   Cross-\n\nexamination of a later Government witness revealed impeachment\n\nevidence the Government did not disclose to either Defendant.\n\nOtoniel twice moved for a mistrial based on the Government's\n\nfailure to disclose evidence.           The district court denied both\n\nmotions.     Neither Defendant sought a continuance.\n\n             José also attempted to argue that the DEA's use of\n\nGiargiari to arrange controlled buys was a form of entrapment, but\n\nthe district court refused José's requests to instruct the jury on\n\nentrapment.     During deliberations, the jury sent a note to the\n\ncourt asking whether it should consider José's entrapment defense.\n\nThe district court responded that the issue of entrapment was not\n\nbefore the jury and instructed the jurors to continue deliberations\n\nbased on the instructions given.        The jury subsequently returned a\n\nguilty verdict on each charged count.\n\n             On appeal, Otoniel asserts 1) the district court abused\n\nits discretion in failing to grant a continuance following the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fGovernment's delayed disclosure of impeachment evidence; and 2) the\n\ncourt reporter's delay in providing a complete transcript delayed\n\nhis appeal and thereby deprived him of his due process rights.2\n\nJosé asserts 1) the district court erred in refusing to instruct\n\nthe jury on entrapment; and 2) the district court committed clear\n\nerror in calculating the quantity of drugs attributable to him for\n\nsentencing.\n\n                                II.\n\n          Otoniel first asserts the district court erred in failing\n\nto, sua sponte, grant a continuance after the Government failed to\n\ndisclose impeachment evidence. Assuming Otoniel properly preserved\n\nthis claim, this Court reviews for an abuse of discretion the\n\ndistrict court's decision on how to handle a delayed disclosure of\n\nBrady or Giglio material.3   United States v. Villarman-Oviedo, 325\n\n\n     2\n      In a pro se supplemental brief, Otoniel also raises a number\nof additional claims that counsel declined to raise on his behalf.\nThis Court did not enter an order requiring the Government to\nrespond and the Government did not respond.      Otoniel's pro se\nclaims are without merit.\n     3\n      Otoniel arguably did not properly preserve the claim. \"As a\ngeneral rule, a defendant who does not request a continuance will\nnot be heard to complain on appeal that he has suffered prejudice\nas a result of late-arriving discovery.\"         United States v.\nSepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1178 (1st Cir. 1993); see also United\nStates v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90, 102 (1st Cir. 2002). Otoniel asserts\nhe preserved his claim by requesting a mistrial. Otoniel's motion\nfor a mistrial was predicated on what he perceived as the\nGovernment's bad faith in delaying disclosure, not the need for\nadditional time to incorporate the newly disclosed evidence. The\ndistrict court found no impropriety on the part of the Government.\nBecause Otoniel never asserted the need for time to incorporate the\nevidence, it is very doubtful that he properly preserved the\n\n                                -5-\n\fF.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing United States v. Catano, 65 F.3d\n\n219, 227 (1st Cir. 1995)).       To establish an abuse of discretion, a\n\ndefendant must establish both that the information was material and\n\nthat the \"defendant was prevented by the delay from using the\n\ndisclosed material effectively in preparing and presenting the\n\ndefendant's case.\"        Id.    The primary inquiry is whether the\n\nGovernment's failure to provide the information in a timely manner\n\n\"caused the defense to change its trial strategy.\"             United States\n\nv. Joslyn, 99 F.3d 1182, 1196 (1st Cir. 1996).            Defendant must make\n\nsome showing of prejudice beyond mere assertions that he would have\n\nconducted cross-examination differently.             Villarman-Oviedo, 325\n\nF.3d at 14 (citing United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 290 (1st\n\nCir. 1990)).\n\n                                      A.\n\n            During cross examination by José's counsel, Giargiari\n\nrevealed    that   he   had   asked   his   father   to    participate   in   a\n\nbankruptcy fraud scheme by hiding funds Giargiari received while in\n\nprison.     Giargiari also stated that he had discussed the scheme\n\nwith a DEA agent three days before trial.            José and Otoniel both\n\nobjected,    arguing    the   Government    should   have    disclosed   that\n\nGiargiari had talked with the Government about the fraud scheme.\n\nOtoniel also objected that he knew nothing about the fraud scheme.\n\n            The Government responded that it had learned of the\n\n\ncurrent claim.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fscheme   three     days   earlier     when   it     received    copies    of   tapes\n\nsubpoenaed    by    José.      José   subpoenaed       the   tapes   as   part     of\n\ndiscovery, received the tapes on the same date the Government\n\nreceived them, and was aware of the fraud scheme.                  The Government\n\nacknowledged that it had not provided copies of the tapes to\n\nOtoniel, stating it had assumed José would share the information\n\nwith Otoniel as part of their joint defense.                 The Government also\n\nstated that Giargiari's conversations with a DEA agent did not\n\nreveal any additional impeachment material.                  Otoniel requested a\n\nmistrial based on the Government's failure to produce the tapes,\n\narguing that he had not heard the tapes and would not be able to\n\nuse   the   tapes    on   cross-examination.           He    did   not   request    a\n\ncontinuance.        The court denied the mistrial motion finding no\n\nimpropriety on the part of the Government and stating that, in its\n\nview, Otoniel had not been prejudiced by the Government's action.\n\nThe court did order the Government to produce the tapes to Otoniel.\n\nOtoniel was able to review the tapes overnight prior to conducting\n\nhis cross-examination.\n\n             On appeal, Otoniel provides no evidence of prejudice\n\nresulting from the Government's delayed disclosure of the tapes.\n\nJosé was aware of Giargiari's fraud scheme prior to trial and fully\n\nincorporated        the     information      into     his      cross-examination,\n\nquestioning Giargiari at length on the scheme and the substance of\n\nhis conversations with his father.                Otoniel not only benefitted\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\ffrom this cross-examination, which put the impeachment evidence\n\nbefore the jury, but also was able to incorporate the information\n\ninto    his   own    cross-examination.         Defendants     also   impeached\n\nGiargiari with numerous other examples of Giargiari's willingness\n\nto break the law.        In response to cross-examination, Giargiari\n\nadmitted he had an extensive criminal history and that he had\n\nviolated the provisions of his cooperation agreement with the\n\nGovernment      by   continuing   to     buy,    sell    and   use    narcotics.\n\nDefendants also questioned Giargiari extensively on the benefits he\n\nhoped   to    receive   in   exchange    for    his   testimony.      Given   the\n\nextensive impeachment material available on this witness, it is not\n\nclear the Government's failure to disclose the tapes to Otoniel was\n\nmaterial.     Even if material, Otoniel has not offered any evidence\n\nof prejudice.\n\n                                        B.\n\n              On the fifth day of trial, the Government called José\n\nOrtiz who testified that he had delivered cocaine for both José and\n\nOtoniel.      On cross-examination, he stated he was testifying in\n\nexchange for immunity from prosecution.               Otoniel objected that he\n\nhad not expected Ortiz to testify because Ortiz had asserted his\n\nFifth Amendment rights before the grand jury.                   Both José and\n\nOtoniel asserted they had not received a copy of the Government's\n\nproffer letter to Ortiz.        The Government stated it had provided a\n\ncopy of the proffer letter to both Defendants and further noted\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fthat it had included Ortiz on its witness list, thereby giving\n\nnotice that Ortiz would testify.           Otoniel moved for a mistrial\n\nbased    on    the   Government's   \"continuing\"   failure   to   provide\n\nimpeachment evidence.       The court denied the motion, noting that\n\nthere was no prejudice from the delayed disclosure.\n\n              Ortiz' testimony on direct examination was limited and\n\nserved largely to corroborate other witnesses' testimony.              On\n\ncross-examination, Defendants elicited the full details of Ortiz'\n\ncooperation with the Government including the fact that he was not\n\nto be prosecuted for his cocaine distribution or for his continuing\n\nuse of marijuana. Otoniel does not offer a single concrete example\n\nof how his defense strategy would have changed given more timely\n\ndisclosure of the proffer letter and has not established that he\n\nwas prejudiced by the delayed disclosure of the evidence.4\n\n                                    III.\n\n              Otoniel also asserts he was denied his due process right\n\nto a timely appeal because of the court reporter's delay in\n\nproducing the final portion of the trial transcript.              Otoniel\n\n\n\n     4\n      Otoniel also asserts that the Court should use its\n\"supervisory power\" to reverse his conviction based on the\nGovernment's delayed disclosure of impeachment evidence. There is\nno basis for this Court's use of its supervisory power.         The\ndistrict court found no evidence the Government acted in bad faith\nand Otoniel has not provided any evidence he suffered prejudice as\na result of the Government's act. See United States v. Houlihan,\n92 F.3d 1271, 1291 (1st Cir. 1996) (use of supervisory power\nappropriate only if \"plain prosecutorial misconduct is coupled with\ncognizable prejudice to a particular defendant.\").\n\n                                    -9-\n\fclaims he suffered prejudice from the delay because he was in\n\nprison pending his appeal.\n\n             This claim has no merit.        \"Although extreme delay in the\n\nprocessing of an appeal may amount to a due process violation, and\n\ndelays caused by court reporters are attributable to the government\n\nfor purposes of determining whether a defendant has been deprived\n\nof due process, mere delay, in and of itself will not give rise to\n\na due process infraction.\"          United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63\n\nF.3d 1142, 1158 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal citations omitted).                       The\n\ndefendant must show prejudice.             Id.    \"Whether an appellate delay\n\nresults in prejudice sufficient to warrant reversing a conviction\n\nrests, most importantly, on a showing that it has impaired the\n\nappeal or the defense in the event of retrial.\"                     Id.\n\n           In this case, Otoniel has failed to show prejudice.\n\nAlthough     there   was    a    significant           delay   in    preparing      the\n\ntranscripts, Otoniel does not claim that the transcripts are\n\nincomplete or unreliable.          This is not a situation in which the\n\ncourt reporter has prepared an unusable transcript. Cf. United\n\nStates v. Wilson, 16 F.3d 1027, 1031 (9th Cir. 1994) (record had\n\nportion missing or was unintelligible so that record was totally\n\nunreliable).     The only prejudice Otoniel asserts is \"oppressive\n\nincarceration     pending       appeal.\"         The    fact   that       Otoniel   was\n\nincarcerated during the delay is not a legally cognizable form of\n\nprejudice.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f                                          IV.\n\n               Both    Defendants     claim      the    district       court    erred   in\n\nrefusing to instruct the jury on entrapment.                      José filed proposed\n\njury       instructions    that     included     a     request    for    an    entrapment\n\ninstruction.          The district court rejected the instruction after\n\nconcluding there was no evidence of entrapment.                               Despite the\n\ncourt's ruling, José argued entrapment in his closing statement to\n\nthe jury.      Upon retiring for deliberations, the jury sent a note to\n\nthe court asking whether it should consider José's entrapment\n\nargument.          Overruling Defendants' objection, the district court\n\nresponded that the issue of entrapment was not before the jury and\n\ninstructed the jurors to continue deliberations based on the\n\ninstructions given.\n\n               We review de novo the district court's decision not to\n\ninstruct the jury on entrapment.5               United States v. Joost, 92 F.3d\n\n7,   12     (1st    Cir.   1996).     A   defendant       is     not    entitled   to   an\n\nentrapment instruction unless the record, when viewed in the light\n\nmost favorable to the defendant, furnishes a reasonable basis for\n\n\n\n       5\n      Otoniel failed to properly preserve this claim by failing to\nrequest an instruction on entrapment, failing to adopt José's\nrequest, and failing to object to the district court's refusal to\ngive the instruction.      Although Otoniel did object when the\ndistrict court refused to give the instruction following the jury's\nrequest, this is insufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.\nEntrapment is an affirmative defense, and the burden is on the\ndefendant to raise and support the defense during trial.        See\nUnited States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir. 1994).\nAccordingly, the court reviews Otoniel's claim for plain error.\n\n                                          -11-\n\fthe defense.     United States v. Rodríguez, 858 F.2d 809, 813 (1st\n\nCir. 1988). To warrant an entrapment instruction, a defendant must\n\npresent some evidence from which a reasonable jury could find: (1)\n\nimproper government inducement to commit the offense and (2) a lack\n\nof predisposition on the part of defendant to commit such an\n\noffense.     United States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955, 960 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).     The district court concluded Defendants had not provided\n\nevidence    of   either    an   improper   inducement   or    a   lack    of\n\npredisposition.\n\n            Improper inducement consists of providing an opportunity\n\nto commit a crime \"plus something else,\" generally excessive\n\npressure by the Government upon the defendant or taking advantage\n\nof   a   non-criminal     motive.    Id.    at   961.   In     determining\n\n\"predisposition,\" the court asks \"how the defendant likely would\n\nhave reacted to an ordinary opportunity to commit the crime.\"            Id.\n\nat 962.    Conclusory, self-serving statements by Defendant that he\n\nwould not have committed the crime are not sufficient.\n\n            The district court did not err in refusing to instruct\n\nthe jury on entrapment.         Giargiari and several other witnesses\n\ntestified that both Defendants were actively engaged in the sale of\n\ncocaine for several years prior to their arrest.             Although José\n\nasserts he was trying to get involved in legal enterprises, the\n\nevidence of narcotics distribution found in his home, as well as\n\nthe testimony of his years of dealing narcotics indicates he was\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fpredisposed to commit the crime.               In addition, neither Defendant\n\nprovided any evidence of excessive pressure by the Government.\n\n                                         V.\n\n            Finally, José asserts the sentencing court committed\n\nclear error in calculating the drug quantity attributable to him.\n\nThe Sentencing Guidelines provide: \"[W]here there is no drug\n\nseizure amount or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of\n\nthe offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of controlled\n\nsubstance.\"       U.S.S.G. § 2D.1.1, cmmt n.1.           The PSR concluded José\n\nwas responsible for 1,252 grams of cocaine, representing the\n\nquarter kilogram Giargiari purchased from José on December 23,\n\n1998, and the one kilogram Giargiari purchased from Otoniel and\n\nJosé on March 30, 1999.         The PSR thus assigned a base offense level\n\nof 26 (the offense level representing 500 grams to 2 kilograms of\n\ncocaine).        The Government objected to probation's calculation,\n\narguing that a preponderance of the trial evidence, as well as\n\nGiargiari's debriefing report, indicated that José \"reasonably\n\nforesaw\" the distribution of at least 4 kilograms of cocaine during\n\nthe   course     of   the    conspiracy.       The     Government's   calculation\n\nresulted    in    a   base    offense   level     of    30   (the   offense   level\n\nrepresenting 3.5 to 4.0 kilograms of cocaine).\n\n            At the sentencing hearing, the Government offered to call\n\nGiargiari and Vázquez to testify about the quantity of drugs sold\n\nduring the conspiracy, and entered the debriefing report into\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fevidence.     According to the debriefing report, Giargiari stated\n\nthat he began buying cocaine from José in 1996 in gram and 2 gram\n\nquantities.     By September 1998, he began buying larger amounts,\n\nbuying quarter and half kilogram quantities on seven to nine\n\noccasions.     The Government noted that Giargiari had not testified\n\nabout his prior purchases of cocaine during trial because the\n\nGovernment's focus had been on the two controlled buys.         José\n\nstated that he did not doubt the Government's proffer of proof,\n\ni.e. that Giargiari would testify consistently with the statements\n\nin the report,6 but objected that he had been in Florida for some\n\nof the relevant period and that Giargiari's statements in the\n\ndebriefing report were inconsistent with his trial testimony.\n\n             The district court sustained the Government's objection,\n\n\n\n     6\n      José also asserts counsel at sentencing provided ineffective\nassistance by failing to object to the Government's proffer, thus\ngiving counsel the opportunity to cross-examine Giargiari and\nVázquez. This claim is not properly before us. This Court has\nrepeatedly emphasized that fact-specific ineffective assistance\nclaims cannot be raised on direct review of a criminal conviction,\nbut must first be presented, and ruled upon, by the district court.\nUnited States v. Campbell, 268 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2001); see also\nMassaro v. United States, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694 (2003)(noting that\na motion brought under § 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for\ndeciding ineffective assistance claims because the record on direct\nappeal often will be incomplete or inadequate).\n          José also asserts the district court's sentence violated\nApprendi.   Other than the citation to Apprendi, José does not\nexpand on this argument.     Accordingly, José waived the claim.\nUnited States v. Berrio-Callejas, 219 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(claim presented without argument or case citations deemed waived\non appeal). Regardless, José's sentence was well within the\nstatutory maximum of twenty years imprisonment. Thus, the district\ncourt's calculation of drug quantity did not violate Apprendi.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fconcluding    that      the   Government      had    proposed    an    accurate    and\n\nconservative       calculation      of     drug    quantity    and    finding    ample\n\nevidence in the record to support the amount based on Giargiari's\n\ntestimony    of     the    significant       increase     in   the    quantities     he\n\npurchased from José over the course of their dealings.                             José\n\nasserts     the    district       court     erred    in   relying      partially    on\n\nGiargiari's       debriefing      report    in    determining    the    quantity     of\n\ncocaine.\n\n             We review the district court's factual findings for clear\n\nerror.     United States v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 102 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nThe district court's approximation of drug quantity should be\n\nupheld \"as long as it represents a reasoned estimate of quantity.\"\n\nUnited States v. Santas Batista, 229 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nA reasoned estimate must be based on an adequate indicia of\n\nreliability and support in the record.                \"Where there is more than\n\none plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's\n\nchoice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous.\"\n\nId.\n\n            The    district       court    based    its   determination     of     drug\n\nquantity    on    the     trial    testimony       describing   José's     extensive\n\ninvolvement in the narcotics trade as well as on the Government's\n\nproffer at sentencing.            In light of the evidence before it, the\n\ndistrict court did not commit clear error in calculating drug\n\nquantity.\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f                               VI.\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM Defendants'\n\nconvictions. We also AFFIRM the sentence imposed on Defendant José\n\nMedina.\n\n\n\n\n                              -16-\n\f",

Defendant Otoniel Medina\n\nand Defendant José Medina each appeal their convictions, following\n\na joint jury trial, on conspiracy and drug charges.1                José Medina\n\nalso       appeals   his   sentence.         This   Court   has   jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.                We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n              Defendants      José   and     Otoniel   Medina     are   brothers.\n\nEvidence at trial indicated José was the leader of a cocaine\n\ndistribution conspiracy.             Otoniel lived with his brother and\n\nassisted in the sale of cocaine; making deliveries, accepting\n\npayments, and taking orders when José was not available.\n\n              In December 1999, Edward Giargiari arranged to purchase\n\none half kilogram of cocaine from José.                   On December 9, José\n\ndelivered a quarter kilogram and arranged to deliver the remaining\n\namount      the   following   evening.        Following     the   initial   sale,\n\nGiargiari was arrested by members of the local police.                  The police\n\nsearched his hotel room and discovered the cocaine and $8,000 in\n\n\n\n       1\n      The jury convicted Defendant Otoniel Medina on one count of\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846,\nand one count of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).        The district court\nsentenced Otoniel to 63 months imprisonment. The jury convicted\nDefendant José Medina on one count of conspiracy to distribute\ncocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, two counts of possession\nwith intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine in violation\nof 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and two counts of unlawful use of a\ncommunication facility in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 843(b). The\ndistrict court sentenced José to 121 months imprisonment.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fcash. Following his arrest, Giargiari agreed to work with the Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration as a cooperating witness. Giargiari\n\nnamed José as his supplier and confessed to the planned purchase of\n\nadditional cocaine.\n\n            Over the next three months, Giargiari, at the direction\n\nof DEA agents, contacted José and arranged to purchase additional\n\nquantities of cocaine. On December 23, 1998, Giargiari arranged to\n\npurchase a quarter kilogram of cocaine. José sent an intermediary,\n\nco-defendant Josué Vázquez, to deliver the cocaine and accept\n\npayment.     In   March    1999,   Giargiari       arranged   to   purchase   one\n\nkilogram of cocaine. José conducted the sale. Otoniel and Vázquez\n\neach were    present      and   assisted    with    the   transaction.    After\n\nGiargiari confirmed the presence of one kilogram of cocaine, law\n\nenforcement agents interrupted the sale and arrested José, Otoniel,\n\nand Vázquez.       The agents recovered a paper bag containing 1.2\n\nkilograms of cocaine.\n\n            Following his arrest, José consented to a search of the\n\nresidence he shared with Otoniel.                During the search, officers\n\nrecovered a scale, cash, cocaine, and other evidence of narcotics\n\npossession and distribution.\n\n            At    trial,    Giargiari      and     several    other   Government\n\nwitnesses testified that they had purchased significant amounts of\n\ncocaine from José on a regular basis.              Vázquez and José's cousin,\n\nJosé Ortiz, both testified that they had sold or delivered cocaine\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fon José's behalf.         Most witnesses also testified that Otoniel\n\nassisted his brother in selling cocaine.\n\n            A key component of Defendants' trial strategy was to\n\ndiscredit the Government's witnesses, most of whom were admitted\n\ndrug dealers that had received immunity or a reduced sentence in\n\nexchange for their testimony.         During trial, cross-examination of\n\na   key   Government      witness   revealed   impeachment   evidence   the\n\nGovernment    had   not    previously   disclosed   to   Otoniel.   Cross-\n\nexamination of a later Government witness revealed impeachment\n\nevidence the Government did not disclose to either Defendant.\n\nOtoniel twice moved for a mistrial based on the Government's\n\nfailure to disclose evidence.           The district court denied both\n\nmotions.     Neither Defendant sought a continuance.\n\n             José also attempted to argue that the DEA's use of\n\nGiargiari to arrange controlled buys was a form of entrapment, but\n\nthe district court refused José's requests to instruct the jury on\n\nentrapment.     During deliberations, the jury sent a note to the\n\ncourt asking whether it should consider José's entrapment defense.\n\nThe district court responded that the issue of entrapment was not\n\nbefore the jury and instructed the jurors to continue deliberations\n\nbased on the instructions given.        The jury subsequently returned a\n\nguilty verdict on each charged count.\n\n             On appeal, Otoniel asserts 1) the district court abused\n\nits discretion in failing to grant a continuance following the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fGovernment's delayed disclosure of impeachment evidence; and 2) the\n\ncourt reporter's delay in providing a complete transcript delayed\n\nhis appeal and thereby deprived him of his due process rights.2\n\nJosé asserts 1) the district court erred in refusing to instruct\n\nthe jury on entrapment; and 2) the district court committed clear\n\nerror in calculating the quantity of drugs attributable to him for\n\nsentencing.\n\n                                II.\n\n          Otoniel first asserts the district court erred in failing\n\nto, sua sponte, grant a continuance after the Government failed to\n\ndisclose impeachment evidence. Assuming Otoniel properly preserved\n\nthis claim, this Court reviews for an abuse of discretion the\n\ndistrict court's decision on how to handle a delayed disclosure of\n\nBrady or Giglio material.3   United States v. Villarman-Oviedo, 325\n\n\n     2\n      In a pro se supplemental brief, Otoniel also raises a number\nof additional claims that counsel declined to raise on his behalf.\nThis Court did not enter an order requiring the Government to\nrespond and the Government did not respond.      Otoniel's pro se\nclaims are without merit.\n     3\n      Otoniel arguably did not properly preserve the claim. \"As a\ngeneral rule, a defendant who does not request a continuance will\nnot be heard to complain on appeal that he has suffered prejudice\nas a result of late-arriving discovery.\"         United States v.\nSepúlveda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1178 (1st Cir. 1993); see also United\nStates v.

Otoniel asserts\nhe preserved his claim by requesting a mistrial. Otoniel's motion\nfor a mistrial was predicated on what he perceived as the\nGovernment's bad faith in delaying disclosure, not the need for\nadditional time to incorporate the newly disclosed evidence. The\ndistrict court found no impropriety on the part of the Government.\nBecause Otoniel never asserted the need for time to incorporate the\nevidence, it is very doubtful that he properly preserved the\n\n                                -5-\n\fF.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing United States v.

Giargiari also stated that he had discussed the scheme\n\nwith a DEA agent three days before trial.            José and Otoniel both\n\nobjected,    arguing    the   Government    should   have    disclosed   that\n\nGiargiari had talked with the Government about the fraud scheme.\n\nOtoniel also objected that he knew nothing about the fraud scheme.\n\n            The Government responded that it had learned of the\n\n\ncurrent claim.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fscheme   three     days   earlier     when   it     received    copies    of   tapes\n\nsubpoenaed    by    José.      José   subpoenaed       the   tapes   as   part     of\n\ndiscovery, received the tapes on the same date the Government\n\nreceived them, and was aware of the fraud scheme.                  The Government\n\nacknowledged that it had not provided copies of the tapes to\n\nOtoniel, stating it had assumed José would share the information\n\nwith Otoniel as part of their joint defense.                 The Government also\n\nstated that Giargiari's conversations with a DEA agent did not\n\nreveal any additional impeachment material.                  Otoniel requested a\n\nmistrial based on the Government's failure to produce the tapes,\n\narguing that he had not heard the tapes and would not be able to\n\nuse   the   tapes    on   cross-examination.           He    did   not   request    a\n\ncontinuance.        The court denied the mistrial motion finding no\n\nimpropriety on the part of the Government and stating that, in its\n\nview, Otoniel had not been prejudiced by the Government's action.\n\nThe court did order the Government to produce the tapes to Otoniel.\n\nOtoniel was able to review the tapes overnight prior to conducting\n\nhis cross-examination.\n\n             On appeal, Otoniel provides no evidence of prejudice\n\nresulting from the Government's delayed disclosure of the tapes.\n\nJosé was aware of Giargiari's fraud scheme prior to trial and fully\n\nincorporated        the     information      into     his      cross-examination,\n\nquestioning Giargiari at length on the scheme and the substance of\n\nhis conversations with his father.                Otoniel not only benefitted\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\ffrom this cross-examination, which put the impeachment evidence\n\nbefore the jury, but also was able to incorporate the information\n\ninto    his   own    cross-examination.         Defendants     also   impeached\n\nGiargiari with numerous other examples of Giargiari's willingness\n\nto break the law.        In response to cross-examination, Giargiari\n\nadmitted he had an extensive criminal history and that he had\n\nviolated the provisions of his cooperation agreement with the\n\nGovernment      by   continuing   to     buy,    sell    and   use    narcotics.\n\nDefendants also questioned Giargiari extensively on the benefits he\n\nhoped   to    receive   in   exchange    for    his   testimony.      Given   the\n\nextensive impeachment material available on this witness, it is not\n\nclear the Government's failure to disclose the tapes to Otoniel was\n\nmaterial.     Even if material, Otoniel has not offered any evidence\n\nof prejudice.\n\n                                        B.\n\n              On the fifth day of trial, the Government called José\n\nOrtiz who testified that he had delivered cocaine for both José and\n\nOtoniel.      On cross-examination, he stated he was testifying in\n\nexchange for immunity from prosecution.               Otoniel objected that he\n\nhad not expected Ortiz to testify because Ortiz had asserted his\n\nFifth Amendment rights before the grand jury.                   Both José and\n\nOtoniel asserted they had not received a copy of the Government's\n\nproffer letter to Ortiz.        The Government stated it had provided a\n\ncopy of the proffer letter to both Defendants and further noted\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fthat it had included Ortiz on its witness list, thereby giving\n\nnotice that Ortiz would testify.           Otoniel moved for a mistrial\n\nbased    on    the   Government's   \"continuing\"   failure   to   provide\n\nimpeachment evidence.       The court denied the motion, noting that\n\nthere was no prejudice from the delayed disclosure.\n\n              Ortiz' testimony on direct examination was limited and\n\nserved largely to corroborate other witnesses' testimony.              On\n\ncross-examination, Defendants elicited the full details of Ortiz'\n\ncooperation with the Government including the fact that he was not\n\nto be prosecuted for his cocaine distribution or for his continuing\n\nuse of marijuana. Otoniel does not offer a single concrete example\n\nof how his defense strategy would have changed given more timely\n\ndisclosure of the proffer letter and has not established that he\n\nwas prejudiced by the delayed disclosure of the evidence.4\n\n                                    III.\n\n              Otoniel also asserts he was denied his due process right\n\nto a timely appeal because of the court reporter's delay in\n\nproducing the final portion of the trial transcript.              Otoniel\n\n\n\n     4\n      Otoniel also asserts that the Court should use its\n\"supervisory power\" to reverse his conviction based on the\nGovernment's delayed disclosure of impeachment evidence. There is\nno basis for this Court's use of its supervisory power.         The\ndistrict court found no evidence the Government acted in bad faith\nand Otoniel has not provided any evidence he suffered prejudice as\na result of the Government's act. See United States v.

The district court rejected the instruction after\n\nconcluding there was no evidence of entrapment.                               Despite the\n\ncourt's ruling, José argued entrapment in his closing statement to\n\nthe jury.      Upon retiring for deliberations, the jury sent a note to\n\nthe court asking whether it should consider José's entrapment\n\nargument.          Overruling Defendants' objection, the district court\n\nresponded that the issue of entrapment was not before the jury and\n\ninstructed the jurors to continue deliberations based on the\n\ninstructions given.\n\n               We review de novo the district court's decision not to\n\ninstruct the jury on entrapment.5               United States v.

Although Otoniel did object when the\ndistrict court refused to give the instruction following the jury's\nrequest, this is insufficient to preserve the issue for appeal.\nEntrapment is an affirmative defense, and the burden is on the\ndefendant to raise and support the defense during trial.        See\nUnited States v. Gifford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195222\"><a href=\"/opinion/195222/united-states-v-gifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (1st Cir. 1994).\nAccordingly, the court reviews Otoniel's claim for plain error.\n\n                                          -11-\n\fthe defense.

To warrant an entrapment instruction, a defendant must\n\npresent some evidence from which a reasonable jury could find: (1)\n\nimproper government inducement to commit the offense and (2) a lack\n\nof predisposition on the part of defendant to commit such an\n\noffense.     United States v. Gendron, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195225\"><a href=\"/opinion/195225/united-states-v-gendron/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 960 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).     The district court concluded Defendants had not provided\n\nevidence    of   either    an   improper   inducement   or    a   lack    of\n\npredisposition.\n\n            Improper inducement consists of providing an opportunity\n\nto commit a crime \"plus something else,\" generally excessive\n\npressure by the Government upon the defendant or taking advantage\n\nof   a   non-criminal     motive.    Id.    at   961.   In     determining\n\n\"predisposition,\" the court asks \"how the defendant likely would\n\nhave reacted to an ordinary opportunity to commit the crime.\"            Id.\n\nat 962.    Conclusory, self-serving statements by Defendant that he\n\nwould not have committed the crime are not sufficient.\n\n            The district court did not err in refusing to instruct\n\nthe jury on entrapment.         Giargiari and several other witnesses\n\ntestified that both Defendants were actively engaged in the sale of\n\ncocaine for several years prior to their arrest.             Although José\n\nasserts he was trying to get involved in legal enterprises, the\n\nevidence of narcotics distribution found in his home, as well as\n\nthe testimony of his years of dealing narcotics indicates he was\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fpredisposed to commit the crime.               In addition, neither Defendant\n\nprovided any evidence of excessive pressure by the Government.\n\n                                         V.\n\n            Finally, José asserts the sentencing court committed\n\nclear error in calculating the drug quantity attributable to him.\n\nThe Sentencing Guidelines provide: \"[W]here there is no drug\n\nseizure amount or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of\n\nthe offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of controlled\n\nsubstance.\"       U.S.S.G. § 2D.1.1, cmmt n.1.           The PSR concluded José\n\nwas responsible for 1,252 grams of cocaine, representing the\n\nquarter kilogram Giargiari purchased from José on December 23,\n\n1998, and the one kilogram Giargiari purchased from Otoniel and\n\nJosé on March 30, 1999.         The PSR thus assigned a base offense level\n\nof 26 (the offense level representing 500 grams to 2 kilograms of\n\ncocaine).        The Government objected to probation's calculation,\n\narguing that a preponderance of the trial evidence, as well as\n\nGiargiari's debriefing report, indicated that José \"reasonably\n\nforesaw\" the distribution of at least 4 kilograms of cocaine during\n\nthe   course     of   the    conspiracy.       The     Government's   calculation\n\nresulted    in    a   base    offense   level     of    30   (the   offense   level\n\nrepresenting 3.5 to 4.0 kilograms of cocaine).\n\n            At the sentencing hearing, the Government offered to call\n\nGiargiari and Vázquez to testify about the quantity of drugs sold\n\nduring the conspiracy, and entered the debriefing report into\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fevidence.     According to the debriefing report, Giargiari stated\n\nthat he began buying cocaine from José in 1996 in gram and 2 gram\n\nquantities.     By September 1998, he began buying larger amounts,\n\nbuying quarter and half kilogram quantities on seven to nine\n\noccasions.     The Government noted that Giargiari had not testified\n\nabout his prior purchases of cocaine during trial because the\n\nGovernment's focus had been on the two controlled buys.         José\n\nstated that he did not doubt the Government's proffer of proof,\n\ni.e. that Giargiari would testify consistently with the statements\n\nin the report,6 but objected that he had been in Florida for some\n\nof the relevant period and that Giargiari's statements in the\n\ndebriefing report were inconsistent with his trial testimony.\n\n             The district court sustained the Government's objection,\n\n\n\n     6\n      José also asserts counsel at sentencing provided ineffective\nassistance by failing to object to the Government's proffer, thus\ngiving counsel the opportunity to cross-examine Giargiari and\nVázquez. This claim is not properly before us. This Court has\nrepeatedly emphasized that fact-specific ineffective assistance\nclaims cannot be raised on direct review of a criminal conviction,\nbut must first be presented, and ruled upon, by the district court.\nUnited States v. Campbell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199629\"><a href=\"/opinion/199629/united-states-v-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 2001); see also\nMassaro v.

Other than the citation to Apprendi, José does not\nexpand on this argument.     Accordingly, José waived the claim.\nUnited States v. Berrio-Callejas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198999\"><a href=\"/opinion/198999/berrio-callejas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(claim presented without argument or case citations deemed waived\non appeal). Regardless, José's sentence was well within the\nstatutory maximum of twenty years imprisonment.

José\n\nasserts     the    district       court     erred    in   relying      partially    on\n\nGiargiari's       debriefing      report    in    determining    the    quantity     of\n\ncocaine.\n\n             We review the district court's factual findings for clear\n\nerror.
