Seeking monetary damages and\n\nprospective injunctive relief, several landowners brought a federal\n\nlawsuit against the mayor of Naranjito, Puerto Rico, for alleged\n\nviolations of rights secured under the federal Constitution and\n\ncommonwealth law.       See 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).       The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for the mayor on all\n\nfederal   claims   and    dismissed   the   commonwealth   claims   without\n\nprejudice,   see   28    U.S.C.   §   1367(c),   upon   finding   that   the\n\nlandowners had failed to comply with Local Rule 311.12 and had\n\ntherefore admitted the veracity of the mayor's version of material\n\nfacts.    The landowners now challenge the court's application of\n\nRule 311.12.   We affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           We sketch the procedural history, reserving for later a\n\nmore detailed recitation of the pertinent facts.\n\n           On May 5, 1998, plaintiffs-appellants Pedro Cosme-Rosado,\n\nLydia Esther Rosado-Figueroa, Maria Teresa-Cosme, Pedro Orlando\n\nCosme-Rodriguez, and Yaritza Cosme-Rodriguez (\"Plaintiffs\") –- all\n\nlandowners and members of the New Progressive Party in Puerto\n\nRico –- filed a complaint in federal court against defendant-\n\nappellee Alfredo Serrano-Rodriguez (\"Serrano\") -- the president of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fthe local chapter of the Popular Democratic Party and the mayor of\n\nNaranjito, Puerto Rico.1    The complaint alleged, inter alia, that:\n\n          [S]ince 1992 and up until 1998, defendant\n          Alfredo Serrano2 has hostigated [sic] and\n          threatened Plaintiffs that he would destroy\n          all the belongings, home, and peace of\n          Plaintiffs [and that] he would throw them out\n          of their house and would appropriate [sic]\n          their land with the excuse of building a\n          parking lot because they were and are members\n          of the New Progressive Party and have so\n          expressed publicly[;] . . .\n\n             [Serrano   and    others]   entered    in    a\n             conspiracy . . . and began using heavy\n             machinery   and  destroyed   the  access   of\n             Plaintiffs to their home and property[; and]\n\n             [Serrano's] actions under color of law were\n             arbitrary, capricious, politically motivated,\n             and without due process . . . [in violation\n             of] the First, Fifth and/or Fourteen[th]\n             Amendments of the Constitution . . . .\n\nOn these bases, the plaintiffs sought, inter alia, (1) a permanent\n\ninjunction restraining Serrano from \"further violating the rights,\n\nprivileges    and   immunities   guaranteed   to   Plaintiffs   under   the\n\nConstitution\"; (2) \"compensatory damages to each plaintiff in the\n\namount of one million dollars\"; and (3) \"punitive and exemplary\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although the complaint named several defendants, Serrano was\nthe only defendant who answered. Because the remaining defendants\nfailed to respond, the district court entered a default judgment\nagainst them on September 30, 1999.     This appeal involves only\nSerrano.\n     2\n      Although the complaint originally named Serrano in both his\nofficial and personal capacities, the plaintiffs later voluntarily\ndismissed their claims against Serrano in his official capacity.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fdamages to each plaintiff in the amount of two hundred and fifty\n\nthousand dollars.\"\n\n           On March 24, 2000, Serrano filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment and a separate statement of uncontested facts complete\n\nwith several citations to the record.       On April 14, 2000, the\n\nplaintiffs responded by filing an opposition to Serrano's motion\n\ntogether with a sparsely cited statement of material facts and a\n\nsworn statement in support thereof.\n\n           On March 22, 2002, the district court granted Serrano's\n\nmotion.3   The court's decision was based on an application of Local\n\nRule 311.12,4 which required both the moving and nonmoving parties\n\nto file a separate statement of material facts \"properly supported\n\nby specific references to the record.\" D.P.L.R. 311.12. See Pedro\n\nCosme-Rosado v. Alfredo Serrano-Rodriguez, 196 F. Supp. 2d 117, 119\n\n(D.P.R. March 22, 2002).     Because the court determined that the\n\nplaintiffs had failed to provide a supported factual basis for\n\ntheir claims against Serrano, it deemed admitted the properly\n\n\n     3\n      Although the court's memorandum of decision refers to\nmultiple defendants, see Pedro Cosme-Rosado v. Alfredo Serrano-\nRodriguez, 196 F. Supp. 2d 117, 125 (D.P.R. March 22, 2002)\n(listing the various defendants and later noting that, \"[f]or the\nforegoing reasons, the Court grants defendants' motion for summary\njudgment\" (emphasis added)), there is no indication in the record\nthat the court ever lifted the default judgment against the\nremaining defendants. See supra n.1.\n     4\n      The District of Puerto Rico amended its local rules in\nSeptember 2003. However, because this lawsuit was brought prior to\nthe effective date of those amendments, we refer throughout to the\npre-amended version.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fsupported facts set forth in Serrano's statement.               See id. at 120\n\nn.1.   Based on those facts, it discerned no genuine issue as to (1)\n\nthe    due   process   claim,   see    id.   at   122;    (2)   the    political\n\ndiscrimination claim, see id. at 123; or (3) Serrano's entitlement\n\nto absolute immunity, or, alternatively, qualified immunity, see\n\nid. at 124-25.\n\n                                      II.\n\n             The   plaintiffs   now    challenge    the    entry      of   summary\n\njudgment on their due process and political discrimination claims.\n\nIn so doing, they argue that the district court erred in concluding\n\nthat they had failed to comply with Local Rule 311.12.                Because we\n\ndiscern no error either in the court's application of the Rule or\n\nin its conclusion that there existed no genuine issue for trial on\n\nthe merits as to either claim, we affirm without addressing the\n\nimmunity issue.\n\n             A.    Local Rule 311.12\n\n             The District of Puerto Rico has adopted a local rule\n\nrequiring a party who moves for summary judgment to submit, in\n\nsupport of the motion, a \"separate, short, and concise statement of\n\nthe material facts as to which the moving party contends there is\n\nno genuine issue to be tried and the basis of such contention as to\n\neach material fact, properly supported by specific reference to the\n\nrecord.\"      D.P.L.R. 311.12.        Once a movant complies with this\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fdirective -- as Serrano did here5 – the same rule then obligates\n\nthe plaintiffs, as the opposing party, to submit a \"separate,\n\nshort, and concise statement of the material facts as to which it\n\nis contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried,\n\nproperly supported by specific reference to the record.\"                          Id.\n\n(emphases added); accord Corrada Betances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc.,\n\n248 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n               We have consistently upheld the enforcement of this rule,\n\nnoting repeatedly that \"parties ignore [it] at their peril\" and\n\nthat \"failure to present a statement of disputed facts, embroidered\n\nwith specific citations to the record, justifies the court's\n\ndeeming the facts presented in the movant's statement of undisputed\n\nfacts admitted.\"         Ruiz Rivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (citing prior cases); accord Morales v. A.C. Orssleff's EFTF,\n\n246 F.3d 32, 33 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n               As noted above, the plaintiffs argue that the district\n\ncourt erred in concluding that they had not complied with Local\n\nRule       311.12.     For   support,   they       point   to   (1)   the   \"Factual\n\nBackground\" section contained within their opposition memorandum\n\nand    (2)    the    separate   statement     of    material    facts   (and   sworn\n\nstatement in support thereof) filed along with it.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      The district court's           conclusion       in   this   regard     is   not\nchallenged on appeal.\n\n                                        -6-\n\f             Because the plaintiffs invite us to look to the \"Factual\n\nBackground\" section contained within their opposition memorandum as\n\nproof that the district court erred in applying Local Rule 311.12,\n\nwe note at the outset that the rule has been interpreted as a\n\nrequirement that the nonmovant file a statement of material facts\n\nseparate from -- and annexed to –- the opposition memorandum.            See\n\nVargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc., 283 F. Supp. 2d 450, 458\n\n(D.P.R. June 30, 2003) (\"[A] party opposing a motion for summary\n\njudgment is . . . required to file as an annex to the opposition\n\nmotion: a separate, short, and concise statement of the material\n\nfacts . . . .\" (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis\n\nretained)); accord Tavarez v. Champion Prods., Inc., 903 F. Supp.\n\n268, 270 (D.P.R. Nov. 1, 1995).             In any event, the plaintiffs'\n\n\"Factual Background\" section fails to provide the allegations and\n\ncitations necessary to controvert the dispositive facts set forth\n\nin Serrano's statement.6      We thus turn to the plaintiffs' statement\n\nof material facts.\n\n             The   district   court    correctly    determined   that    the\n\nplaintiffs' statement of material facts failed to comply with Local\n\nRule 311.12:       Out of twelve paragraphs of allegations, only two\n\ncite to the record.7     Moreover, within these two paragraphs, there\n\n\n     6\n         See infra nn. 9 & 11 and accompanying text.\n     7\n      Citations to the record (in the form              of   exhibits)   are\nprovided for the following \"material facts\":\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fexists   only    one   (arguably)   material    allegation    –-   and    the\n\naccompanying citation merely points the court generally to a\n\nthirty-page deposition without providing any page numbers. This is\n\nnot enough.     See Morales, 246 F.3d at 35 (\"[I]n his submissions to\n\nthe district court, plaintiff made only a general reference to [a\n\nwitness's] testimony without pinpointing where in that 89-page\n\ndeposition support for that reference could be found.              This is\n\nprecisely the situation that Local Rule 311.12 seeks to avoid.\").8\n\nAccordingly,     the   \"uncontested\"   facts   pleaded   by   Serrano    were\n\nproperly deemed admitted, see D.P.L.R. 311.12 (\"All material facts\n\nset forth in the statement required to be served by the moving\n\nparty shall be deemed to be admitted unless controverted by the\n\nstatement required to be served by the opposing party.\"), and\n\nsummary judgment rightly followed.        See Tavarez, 903 F. Supp. at\n\n\n     [1] After taking office in 1993, [Serrano] made good on\n     his word. Harassing increased. On January 17, 1995,\n     Plaintiffs filed a complaint in [a Puerto Rico court] as\n     to destroying access to their property by defendant\n     Serrano. Serrano complied partially. Exhibit 3.\n\n     [2] By August 10, 1998, Serrano had not placed [the\n     Puerto Rico court] in a position to adjudicate [the\n     plaintiffs'] just compensation. Exhibit 7. Finally, on\n     February 17, 1999, Serrano stipulated a just compensation\n     to [the plaintiffs], Exhibit 8, and on February 26,\n     Serrano's attorney filed a stipulation. Exhibit 9. A\n     year after the filing of the instant case.\n     8\n      Given the purposes behind Rule 311.12, we reject the\nassertion that a plaintiff's sworn statement (attesting to the\naccuracy of the facts alleged in the proffered Rule 311.12\ndocument) can serve as an adequate substitute for the requisite\ncitations to the record.\n\n                                    -8-\n\f270 (\"Although [failure to comply with Local Rule 311.12] does not\n\nsignify an automatic defeat, it launches the nonmovant's case down\n\nthe road toward an easy dismissal.\").   We briefly explain, in the\n\ncontext of each claim.\n\n          B.   The Procedural Due Process Claim\n\n          In order to establish a procedural due process claim\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the plaintiffs must show that (1) they have\n\na property interest as defined by state law; and (2) Serrano,\n\nacting under color of state law, deprived them of that property\n\ninterest without constitutionally adequate process.   See Logan v.\n\nZimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 428 (1982); see also Mimiya\n\nHosp., Inc. v. U.S. Dept. Of Health and Human Services, 331 F.3d\n\n178, 181 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"It is well established that 'individuals\n\nwhose property interests are at stake are entitled to notice and an\n\nopportunity to be heard.'\" (quoting Dusenbery v. United States, 534\n\nU.S. 161, 167 (2002))).\n\n          Here, no such claim was established.     Nowhere do the\n\nplaintiffs even allege that they were deprived of process due them\n\nunder the Constitution.9\n\n\n     9\n      The closest that the plaintiffs come to creating such an\nissue is the following allegation (and accompanying citation) in\nthe \"Factual Background\" section of the opposition memorandum:\n\n     By March 20, 1997, Serrano had been ordered by a [Puerto\n     Rico court] to comply with [the] court's order and that\n     municipality could not evict Plaintiffs from their\n     property. Exhibit 5. Court admonished Serrano that a\n     year had elapsed and that Serrano had not placed Court in\n\n                               -9-\n\f          The summary judgment papers indicate that there was\n\nsufficient process: in February 1993, the plaintiffs received a\n\nletter from Serrano in which the City stated an interest in\n\nexpropriating their properties;10 on July 21, 1994, the Municipal\n\nAssembly notified the plaintiffs that the City was interested in\n\nexpropriating their property and summoned them to voice their\n\nconcerns at a public hearing to be held the next day; a public\n\nhearing was, in fact, held, and Cosme-Rosado was in attendance; on\n\nAugust 10, 1994, the Municipal Assembly approved an ordinance\n\nauthorizing the Municipality to begin expropriation proceedings;\n\nthe Puerto Rico Planning Board also approved the expropriation; on\n\nJune 6, 1996, a Puerto Rico court determined that the defendants\n\nhad complied with all the legal requirements needed to expropriate\n\ntheir properties and ordered the expropriation; and, on February\n\n17, 1999, the plaintiffs finally recovered their properties' value\n\npursuant to a settlement agreement. Given these uncontested facts,\n\n\n\n     a condition to allow Plaintiffs to recover their\n     properties' value. By that time, Serrano [and another\n     defendant] had produced intense damage and irreparable\n     [sic] to Plaintiffs.\n\n     At most, this allegation establishes that Serrano may have\nbeen in contempt for failure to comply with a scheduling order -–\na failure that, given the uncontested facts set forth in the text,\nis inadequate to establish a genuine issue as to the due process\nclaim that ultimately was filed in federal court.\n     10\n      The plaintiffs admitted the preceding fact in their own\npapers.   All others are derived from Serrano's \"Statement of\nUncontested Facts.\"\n\n                              -10-\n\fwe cannot conclude that the district court erroneously granted\n\nsummary judgment for Serrano on the due process claim.\n\n          C.   The Political Discrimination Claim\n\n          In   order   to   establish    a      claim   of   political\n\ndiscrimination, the plaintiffs initially bear the burden of showing\n\nthat (1) they engaged in constitutionally protected conduct; and\n\n(2) this conduct was a \"substantial\" or \"motivating\" factor behind\n\nSerrano's decision to expropriate their properties.           See Mt.\n\nHealthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287\n\n(1977); see also Collins v. Nuzzo, 244 F.3d 246, 252 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   If the plaintiffs had met that burden –- which they did\n\nnot -- Serrano would then have been obligated to demonstrate by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the expropriation would have\n\noccurred even in the absence of the plaintiffs' protected conduct.\n\nSee Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287.\n\n          The district court's \"review of the record reveal[ed]\n\nthat the plaintiffs' . . . case [was] very weak.\"        Pedro Cosme-\n\nRosado, 196 F. Supp. 2d at 119.     We agree.    While the plaintiffs\n\nestablished that they are members of and active participants in the\n\nNew Progressive Party -- the rival of the Popular Democratic Party\n\nto which Serrano belonged –- they failed to establish a genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to whether their party membership was a\n\nsubstantial factor behind the expropriation of their properties.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f               As the district court observed, \"the only piece of\n\nevidence that the plaintiffs proffer[ed] in support of the alleged\n\npolitical discrimination is Pedro Cosme's deposition, which states\n\nthat Mayor Serrano voiced his intention to rid the town of NPP\n\nactivists.\"         Id. at 123.      Presented with a similar situation in\n\nFigueroa-Serrano v. Ramos Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2000),11\n\nwe held that such a \"meager showing is patently insufficient to\n\ngenerate a genuine issue of material fact on a causal connection\n\nbetween    the      political   affiliation      of    the    plaintiffs    and    the\n\nadverse    .    .   .   actions      alleged.\"        So   too,    here,   where   the\n\nplaintiffs' noncompliance with Local Rule 311.12 and the admitted\n\nfacts -– most notably, the approval of the expropriation by both\n\nthe Puerto Rico Planning Board and the Municipal Assembly together\n\nwith the state court order of expropriation –- has resulted in\n\ntheir     patent     failure    to   establish    that       the   properties      were\n\nexpropriated for other than lawful purposes.\n\n                                        III.\n\n               For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n\n     11\n      In Figueroa-Serrano, the plaintiffs claimed that the mayor's\nalleged statement that he intended to rid the Municipality of NPP\nemployees, coupled with the competing political persuasions of the\nplaintiffs and defendants, constituted enough evidence of a First\nAmendment violation to withstand a motion for summary judgment.\nSee 221 F.3d at 8. The district court rejected the plaintiffs'\npolitical discrimination claim because it was based solely upon\nconclusory statements and lacked any specific evidence, and we\nupheld this analysis.

Seeking monetary damages and\n\nprospective injunctive relief, several landowners brought a federal\n\nlawsuit against the mayor of Naranjito, Puerto Rico, for alleged\n\nviolations of rights secured under the federal Constitution and\n\ncommonwealth law.       See 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).       The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for the mayor on all\n\nfederal   claims   and    dismissed   the   commonwealth   claims   without\n\nprejudice,   see   28    U.S.C.   §   1367(c),   upon   finding   that   the\n\nlandowners had failed to comply with Local Rule 311.12 and had\n\ntherefore admitted the veracity of the mayor's version of material\n\nfacts.    The landowners now challenge the court's application of\n\nRule 311.12.

This appeal involves only\nSerrano.\n     2\n      Although the complaint originally named Serrano in both his\nofficial and personal capacities, the plaintiffs later voluntarily\ndismissed their claims against Serrano in his official capacity.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fdamages to each plaintiff in the amount of two hundred and fifty\n\nthousand dollars.\"\n\n           On March 24, 2000, Serrano filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment and a separate statement of uncontested facts complete\n\nwith several citations to the record.       On April 14, 2000, the\n\nplaintiffs responded by filing an opposition to Serrano's motion\n\ntogether with a sparsely cited statement of material facts and a\n\nsworn statement in support thereof.\n\n           On March 22, 2002, the district court granted Serrano's\n\nmotion.3   The court's decision was based on an application of Local\n\nRule 311.12,4 which required both the moving and nonmoving parties\n\nto file a separate statement of material facts \"properly supported\n\nby specific references to the record.\" D.P.L.R. 311.12.

In any event, the plaintiffs'\n\n\"Factual Background\" section fails to provide the allegations and\n\ncitations necessary to controvert the dispositive facts set forth\n\nin Serrano's statement.6      We thus turn to the plaintiffs' statement\n\nof material facts.\n\n             The   district   court    correctly    determined   that    the\n\nplaintiffs' statement of material facts failed to comply with Local\n\nRule 311.12:       Out of twelve paragraphs of allegations, only two\n\ncite to the record.7     Moreover, within these two paragraphs, there\n\n\n     6\n         See infra nn. 9 & 11 and accompanying text.\n     7\n      Citations to the record (in the form              of   exhibits)   are\nprovided for the following \"material facts\":\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fexists   only    one   (arguably)   material    allegation    –-   and    the\n\naccompanying citation merely points the court generally to a\n\nthirty-page deposition without providing any page numbers. This is\n\nnot enough.     See Morales, 246 F.3d at 35 (\"[I]n his submissions to\n\nthe district court, plaintiff made only a general reference to [a\n\nwitness's] testimony without pinpointing where in that 89-page\n\ndeposition support for that reference could be found.              This is\n\nprecisely the situation that Local Rule 311.12 seeks to avoid.\").8\n\nAccordingly,     the   \"uncontested\"   facts   pleaded   by   Serrano    were\n\nproperly deemed admitted, see D.P.L.R. 311.12 (\"All material facts\n\nset forth in the statement required to be served by the moving\n\nparty shall be deemed to be admitted unless controverted by the\n\nstatement required to be served by the opposing party.\"), and\n\nsummary judgment rightly followed.        See Tavarez, 903 F. Supp. at\n\n\n     [1] After taking office in 1993, [Serrano] made good on\n     his word. Harassing increased. On January 17, 1995,\n     Plaintiffs filed a complaint in [a Puerto Rico court] as\n     to destroying access to their property by defendant\n     Serrano. Serrano complied partially. Exhibit 3.\n\n     [2] By August 10, 1998, Serrano had not placed [the\n     Puerto Rico court] in a position to adjudicate [the\n     plaintiffs'] just compensation. Exhibit 7.

The Procedural Due Process Claim\n\n          In order to establish a procedural due process claim\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the plaintiffs must show that (1) they have\n\na property interest as defined by state law; and (2) Serrano,\n\nacting under color of state law, deprived them of that property\n\ninterest without constitutionally adequate process.

Nowhere do the\n\nplaintiffs even allege that they were deprived of process due them\n\nunder the Constitution.9\n\n\n     9\n      The closest that the plaintiffs come to creating such an\nissue is the following allegation (and accompanying citation) in\nthe \"Factual Background\" section of the opposition memorandum:\n\n     By March 20, 1997, Serrano had been ordered by a [Puerto\n     Rico court] to comply with [the] court's order and that\n     municipality could not evict Plaintiffs from their\n     property. Exhibit 5. Court admonished Serrano that a\n     year had elapsed and that Serrano had not placed Court in\n\n                               -9-\n\f          The summary judgment papers indicate that there was\n\nsufficient process: in February 1993, the plaintiffs received a\n\nletter from Serrano in which the City stated an interest in\n\nexpropriating their properties;10 on July 21, 1994, the Municipal\n\nAssembly notified the plaintiffs that the City was interested in\n\nexpropriating their property and summoned them to voice their\n\nconcerns at a public hearing to be held the next day; a public\n\nhearing was, in fact, held, and Cosme-Rosado was in attendance; on\n\nAugust 10, 1994, the Municipal Assembly approved an ordinance\n\nauthorizing the Municipality to begin expropriation proceedings;\n\nthe Puerto Rico Planning Board also approved the expropriation; on\n\nJune 6, 1996, a Puerto Rico court determined that the defendants\n\nhad complied with all the legal requirements needed to expropriate\n\ntheir properties and ordered the expropriation; and, on February\n\n17, 1999, the plaintiffs finally recovered their properties' value\n\npursuant to a settlement agreement. Given these uncontested facts,\n\n\n\n     a condition to allow Plaintiffs to recover their\n     properties' value. By that time, Serrano [and another\n     defendant] had produced intense damage and irreparable\n     [sic] to Plaintiffs.\n\n     At most, this allegation establishes that Serrano may have\nbeen in contempt for failure to comply with a scheduling order -–\na failure that, given the uncontested facts set forth in the text,\nis inadequate to establish a genuine issue as to the due process\nclaim that ultimately was filed in federal court.\n     10\n      The plaintiffs admitted the preceding fact in their own\npapers.   All others are derived from Serrano's \"Statement of\nUncontested Facts.\"\n\n                              -10-\n\fwe cannot conclude that the district court erroneously granted\n\nsummary judgment for Serrano on the due process claim.\n\n          C.   The Political Discrimination Claim\n\n          In   order   to   establish    a      claim   of   political\n\ndiscrimination, the plaintiffs initially bear the burden of showing\n\nthat (1) they engaged in constitutionally protected conduct; and\n\n(2) this conduct was a \"substantial\" or \"motivating\" factor behind\n\nSerrano's decision to expropriate their properties.

If the plaintiffs had met that burden –- which they did\n\nnot -- Serrano would then have been obligated to demonstrate by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the expropriation would have\n\noccurred even in the absence of the plaintiffs' protected conduct.\n\nSee Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287.\n\n          The district court's \"review of the record reveal[ed]\n\nthat the plaintiffs' . . . case [was] very weak.\"        Pedro Cosme-\n\nRosado, 196 F.

While the plaintiffs\n\nestablished that they are members of and active participants in the\n\nNew Progressive Party -- the rival of the Popular Democratic Party\n\nto which Serrano belonged –- they failed to establish a genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to whether their party membership was a\n\nsubstantial factor behind the expropriation of their properties.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f               As the district court observed, \"the only piece of\n\nevidence that the plaintiffs proffer[ed] in support of the alleged\n\npolitical discrimination is Pedro Cosme's deposition, which states\n\nthat Mayor Serrano voiced his intention to rid the town of NPP\n\nactivists.\"         Id. at 123.

Ramos Alverio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199013\"><a href=\"/opinion/199013/figueroa-serrano-v-ramos-alverio/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 2000),11\n\nwe held that such a \"meager showing is patently insufficient to\n\ngenerate a genuine issue of material fact on a causal connection\n\nbetween    the      political   affiliation      of    the    plaintiffs    and    the\n\nadverse    .    .   .   actions      alleged.\"        So   too,    here,   where   the\n\nplaintiffs' noncompliance with Local Rule 311.12 and the admitted\n\nfacts -– most notably, the approval of the expropriation by both\n\nthe Puerto Rico Planning Board and the Municipal Assembly together\n\nwith the state court order of expropriation –- has resulted in\n\ntheir     patent     failure    to   establish    that       the   properties      were\n\nexpropriated for other than lawful purposes.\n\n                                        III.\n\n               For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n\n     11\n      In Figueroa-Serrano, the plaintiffs claimed that the mayor's\nalleged statement that he intended to rid the Municipality of NPP\nemployees, coupled with the competing political persuasions of the\nplaintiffs and defendants, constituted enough evidence of a First\nAmendment violation to withstand a motion for summary judgment.\nSee 221 F.3d at 8. The district court rejected the plaintiffs'\npolitical discrimination claim because it was based solely upon\nconclusory statements and lacked any specific evidence, and we\nupheld this analysis.
