Joyce and Joyce & Zerola, P.C. on brief for\npetitioner.\n     Thankful T. Vanderstar, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nDepartment of Justice, Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Civil Division, and Linda S. Wernery, Senior Litigation\nCounsel, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                        September 22, 2005\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge. Ali Abdul Karim, petitioner in this\n\ncourt, is a native of Lebanon.         He was admitted to the United\n\nStates on April 16, 1993, as a tourist authorized to stay for one\n\nmonth, but he did not depart or secure any change of status and\n\nremains in the United States today.     In January 2003, he was called\n\nfor an interview with the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\")\n\npursuant to its \"special registration\" program for nationals of\n\ncertain designated countries.     Thereafter, the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\") began removal proceedings against\n\nKarim.\n\n          At the initial hearing in April 2003, Karim appeared with\n\ncounsel, which he had not had at the DHS meeting, and conceded\n\nremovability.    At the next hearing in June 2003, his new counsel,\n\nfrom the same law firm, asked for a postponement so he could\n\nexplore whether Karim was perhaps a citizen of Liberia, where he\n\nhad lived for a time with his family.\n\n          At the deferred hearing held in July 2003, his counsel\n\nfirst said that he would like to file and brief a motion to\n\nsuppress on the ground that the DHS interview had \"tainted\" the\n\nprocess; to this the judge replied that removability had already\n\nbeen conceded at the initial hearing.     Counsel then asked to amend\n\nthe earlier answer by denying removability, but he gave no clear\n\nbasis for his motion nor any basis for establishing that Karim was\n\nnot removable.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f            The immigration judge denied the request to amend, noting\n\nthat removability had been conceded, and found that Karim was\n\nremovable. The judge also denied a request for voluntary departure\n\nbecause Karim had no valid travel document, as his passport had\n\nexpired.     Karim appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\"), arguing that he should have been given leave to amend his\n\npleadings and more time to develop an asylum claim, that the\n\nspecial    registration    program   was   unconstitutional,   and--as   to\n\nvoluntary departure--that he had no travel document because DHS had\n\nseized his passport.\n\n            In a brief per curiam order, the BIA rejected the appeal.\n\nIt said that Karim had had over three months between his notice to\n\nappear in the removal proceeding and the filing of his original\n\npleadings, which was time enough to develop his objections to\n\nremoval; that he had furnished no reason for the later request to\n\namend his admission of removability; that his passport had expired\n\nso voluntary departure was not permitted; and that the INS had no\n\nauthority     over   the     special       registration   program   whose\n\nconstitutionality was being challenged.            Karim has now sought\n\nreview in this court.\n\n            Much of Karim's brief on appeal is general rhetoric about\n\nthe need for reasoned agency decisionmaking. In fact, it is fairly\n\neasy to follow the reasoning of both the immigration judge and the\n\nBIA.   That both decisions were short is largely a result of the\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\ffact that Karim admitted removability at the outset and gave the\n\nimmigration judge no good reason for allowing Karim to revisit that\n\nconcession (which was made through counsel).               As to voluntary\n\ndeparture, the main argument now pressed was not made to the\n\nimmigration judge.\n\n           Turning to substance, Karim argues that the immigration\n\njudge failed to articulate and then apply the various factors that\n\nbear on whether to allow an amendment of the pleading.                     The\n\nobligation to explain and articulate depends importantly on the\n\nstrength of the position being urged. Where no plausible reason is\n\noffered for a request, the word \"no\" is plainly sufficient.           Even\n\nnow, the brief provides no adequate explanation as to why Karim\n\nshould have been allowed to withdraw his concession nor any reason\n\nto doubt that the concession was correct.\n\n           Karim says that the immigration judge and the BIA failed\n\nto   consider   an    (alleged)   lack    of   prejudice   in   granting    a\n\npostponement.        There is obvious prejudice to the hard-pressed\n\nimmigration process in deferring for yet a third time an already\n\ntwice-postponed proceeding and then using resources to conduct a\n\nfull-fledged proceeding in the absence of any indication that the\n\nadmission was mistaken.       In any event, the failure to give an\n\nadequate reason for a postponement or amendment dooms it regardless\n\nof whether allowance would cause prejudice to the adversary.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f           Karim says that he did explain to the immigration judge\n\nthat he wanted more time to investigate whether he was a citizen of\n\nLebanon or Liberia.        That is not accurate.           Counsel told the\n\nimmigration judge at the July hearing that the earlier postponement\n\nhad been secured to investigate that issue and continued: \"And, as\n\nI looked into that further, there is an association with Lebanon,\n\nso that this whole Liberia theory went out the door.\"\n\n           Next,    Karim's    brief    criticizes   the    BIA   because,    in\n\nreviewing the denial of the request for voluntary departure, it\n\nignored the fact that DHS had seized Karim's passport.                       The\n\nimmigration judge was indeed told about the seizure but was also\n\ntold that the passport had expired in 1994.          Karim did not, so far\n\nas we can tell, urge the immigration judge to give him time to\n\nsecure and renew the passport.           In any event, by statute, this\n\ncourt lacks authority to review a refusal to allow voluntary\n\ndeparture.      8 U.S.C. § 1229c(f) (2000).\n\n           Finally, Karim says that the immigration judge failed to\n\naddress   his    claim,   by   motion   to   suppress,     that   the   removal\n\nproceeding was tainted by the fact that DHS had conducted an\n\ninterview with Karim and secured admissions from him in the absence\n\nof counsel.      A reading of the transcript raises doubts whether\n\ncounsel properly preserved the claim at all, but that is beside the\n\npoint.    Any attack on the DHS interview was mooted by Karim's\n\ndecision at the initial proceeding to concede removability.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f          Conceivably, although there is no proof or proffer to\n\nthat effect, that concession may have been prompted by admissions\n\nmade in the DHS interview; if so, the time to raise the issue (by\n\nmotion to suppress or otherwise) was before making the concession.\n\nOtherwise, Karim's position is no better than that of a defendant\n\nwho pleads guilty without reserving a Fourth Amendment claim and\n\nthen argues that his plea was prompted by an unlawful seizure of\n\nevidence. The law is well settled that the unqualified guilty plea\n\nwaives such objections to antecedent events.     United States v.\n\nCordero, 42 F.3d 697, 699 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          We add, merely to avoid unwarranted assumptions, that it\n\nis far from clear that any flaws in the DHS interview would have\n\nprecluded use of the information there obtained. See INS v. Lopez-\n\nMendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1050 (1984) (holding that the exclusionary\n\nrule does not typically apply in deportation proceedings).   Nor is\n\nit clear why any admissions made there mattered:    Karim does not\n\nclaim to have American citizenship or any authorization to remain\n\nin this country past 1994, and one would expect that untainted\n\ngovernment records could easily establish both points--the first by\n\nreference to his admission to the country as a visitor and the\n\nsecond by the usual \"negative\" search.\n\n          In closing, we add that there is no indication in this\n\nrecord that Karim ever had any valid defense to removability. This\n\nis not a case where obviously promising objections were forfeit or\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fwaived or where there is any indication of a miscarriage of\n\njustice.\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

The immigration judge was indeed told about the seizure but was also told that the passport had expired in 1994. Karim did not, so far as we can tell, urge the immigration judge to give him time to secure and renew the passport. In any event, by statute, this court lacks authority to review a refusal to allow voluntary departure. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229c(f) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Karim says that the immigration judge failed to address his claim, by motion to suppress, that the removal proceeding was tainted by the fact that DHS had conducted an interview with Karim and secured admissions from him in the absence of counsel. A reading of the transcript raises doubts whether counsel properly preserved the claim at all, but that is beside the point. Any attack on the DHS interview was mooted by Karim's decision at the initial proceeding to concede removability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably, although there is no proof or proffer to that effect, that concession may have been prompted by admissions made in the DHS interview; if so, the time to raise the issue (by motion to suppress or otherwise) was before making the concession. Otherwise, Karim's position is no better than that of a defendant who pleads guilty without reserving a Fourth Amendment claim and then argues that his plea was prompted by an unlawful seizure of evidence. The law is well settled that the unqualified guilty plea waives such objections to antecedent events. <i>United States v.

Nor is it clear why any admissions made there mattered: Karim does not claim to have American citizenship or any authorization to remain in this country past 1994, and one would expect that untainted government records could easily establish both points &#8212; the first by reference to his admission to the country as a visitor and the second by the usual \"negative\" search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, we add that there is no indication in this record that Karim ever had any valid defense to removability.
