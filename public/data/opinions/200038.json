William A. Barresi, II, was\n\nconvicted in Massachusetts of raping a child under sixteen years of\n\nage, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 22A, and committing an indecent\n\nassault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age (the\n\nsame child), id. § 13B.        The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed\n\nhis convictions,       Commonwealth v. Barresi, 46 Mass. App. Ct. 907,\n\n705 N.E.2d 639 (1999), and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\n\n(\"SJC\") denied, without opinion, his Application for Leave to\n\nObtain    Further    Appellate       Review   (commonly   referred   to    as   an\n\n\"ALOFAR\"). Commonwealth v. Barresi, 429 Mass. 1106, 710 N.E.2d 604\n(1999).    Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254, Barresi then petitioned the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts for\nhabeas corpus relief.         The district court dismissed the petition,\nholding    that     Barresi    had    not     fairly   presented   his    federal\n\nconstitutional claims to the SJC and, therefore, had not exhausted\navailable state court remedies.               Although the issue is open to\nreasonable debate, because we conclude that Barresi did adequately\n\npresent his federal claims, we reverse and remand the habeas\npetition for consideration on its merits.\n                                         I.\n\n            Prior to his criminal trial, Barresi filed a motion under\nthe Commonwealth's Rape Shield Law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, §21B,\nseeking leave to introduce evidence that his alleged sexual assault\n\nvictim had tested positive for chlamydia, a sexually transmitted\ndisease.    Based upon those positive test results, as well as his\n\nown test results, which revealed that he had never been infected\n\n                                        -2-\n\fwith any chlamydia organism, Barresi hoped to persuade the jury\n\nthat he could not have repeatedly raped the complainant and,\n\nconsequently, that her accusations against him were false.\n             Barresi also wanted to show that the complainant made up\n\nthe rape     and   assault    charges    to    deflect   her   mother's   scorn.\n\nAccording to Barresi, when the young complainant realized her\nmother was about to discover that she had been sexually active (for\n\nperhaps as long as a year) with at least one, and possibly two or\n\nmore, teenage boys, she fabricated the charges against Barresi to\n\ncreate   a   plausible   diversionary         explanation   for   her   sexually\n\ntransmitted disease.         To support that theory of defense, Barresi\n\nsought to introduce evidence that the complainant reported the\n\nalleged sexual assaults to the police after she had had an argument\nwith her mother, and then ran off to meet with one of the boys with\n\nwhom she allegedly had an ongoing sexual relationship.                    Barresi\n\nimplicitly suggested that at that meeting the two concocted the\nfalse rape charges against him, after which the complainant was\n\ntaken to the police station where she reported the fabricated story\n\nto law enforcement officers.\n\n             A pretrial hearing was held on Barresi's motion for leave\n\nto introduce evidence related to the complainant's sexual history.\n\nAt that hearing, Barresi presented a physician he intended to call\n\nas a medical expert at trial.       Although the doctor was able to give\n\na general explanation of chlamydia and its mode of transmission, he\n\nconceded that he had never actually treated patients with the\n\ndisease, and that his understanding of it was based largely upon\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\finformation he had gleaned from medical text books. In ruling that\n\nBarresi could not introduce the medical expert's testimony at\n\ntrial,   the   presiding   judge   concluded    that   the   doctor       lacked\nsufficient knowledge to give an expert opinion about the incubation\n\nperiod of chlamydia, or the likelihood that a person who had\n\nintercourse with an infected partner might contract the disease.\nThe trial judge also concluded that the Massachusetts Rape Shield\n\nLaw precluded introduction of evidence concerning the complainant's\n\nprior sexual conduct with the teenage boy(s), notwithstanding\n\nBarresi's asserted intent to introduce that evidence solely to\n\nimpeach her testimony, and not merely to establish that she was\n\nsexually promiscuous.      Finally, the trial judge precluded Barresi\n\nfrom   introducing   testimony     from   two   boys   concerning     a    false\naccusation of rape the complainant had allegedly leveled against\n\none of them.\n\n           Following a three day trial, the jury convicted Barresi\non both counts.      His appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals Court\n\nunambiguously asserted, among other things, that the trial court's\n\nrefusal to allow him to introduce evidence of the complainant's\n\nprior sexual relationship with the teenage boy(s), as well as its\n\nrefusal to allow testimony from his medical expert, violated his\n\nright to confront adverse witnesses, as guaranteed by the Sixth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.            While it\n\ndid not directly address Barresi's federal constitutional claims,\n\nthe Commonwealth's intermediate appellate court ruled that the\n\ntrial judge neither abused his discretion nor committed an error of\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\flaw in excluding the challenged evidence.           Barresi, 705 N.E.2d at\n\n641.   Accordingly, Barresi's convictions were affirmed.\n\n           Barresi filed a timely ALOFAR with the SJC, the essential\nthrust   of   which   was    that    the   trial    court        erred   in   its\n\ninterpretation and application of the Massachusetts Rape Shield\n\nLaw.     Barresi   did,   however,   at    least   allude    to    the   federal\nconstitutional issues he had pressed more forcefully before the\n\nintermediate appellate court.         The SJC denied Barresi's ALOFAR\n\nwithout opinion.\n\n           Barresi then filed a petition for federal habeas corpus\n\nrelief, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254, reiterating his claims that\n\nthe trial court's evidentiary rulings violated his rights under the\n\nSixth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Commonwealth moved to dismiss\nthe    petition,   arguing    that     with    regard       to    his    federal\n\nconstitutional claims, Barresi had failed to exhaust the remedies\n\navailable to him in state court.              The district court agreed,\nholding that because Barresi's ALOFAR did not fairly present his\n\nconstitutional claims to the SJC, those claims were not exhausted.\n\nTherefore,    Barresi's     habeas    petition     was      dismissed.         We\n\nsubsequently granted Barresi's application for a certificate of\n\nappealability, see generally Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473\n\n(2000), and this appeal followed.\n\n                                     II.\n\n           The merits of Barresi's habeas petition are not at issue,\n\nso we make no comment in that regard.         The sole question presented\n\nhere is a procedural one: whether the federal constitutional claims\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fBarresi   advances      in   his      habeas   petition   were   fairly   and\n\nrecognizably presented in his appeal to the SJC.           That is, we must\n\ndecide whether Barresi exhausted available state remedies as to\nthose issues.     Our review is de novo.        See Adelson v. DiPaola, 131\n\nF.3d 259, 262 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n              Barring certain exceptional circumstances not present\nhere, a habeas petitioner in state custody may not advance his or\n\nher constitutional claims in a federal forum unless and until the\n\nsubstance of those claims has been fairly presented to the state's\n\nhighest court.     This exhaustion requirement, codified at 28 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2254(b) and (c), embodies principles of federal-state comity and\n\nis designed to provide state courts with an initial \"opportunity to\n\npass upon and correct alleged violations of [their] prisoners'\nfederal rights.\"        Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971)\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).             The petitioner\n\nbears   the    heavy   burden    of   demonstrating   satisfaction   of   the\nexhaustion requirement.         See Adelson, 131 F.3d at 262; Nadworny v.\n\nFair, 872 F.2d 1093, 1098 (1st Cir. 1989).            To carry that burden,\n\nthe petitioner must show that \"he tendered his federal claim [to\n\nthe state's highest court] in such a way as to make it probable\n\nthat a reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence\n\nof the federal question.\"        Casella v. Clemons, 207 F.3d 18, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n              The Supreme Court has made it clear that a federal claim\n\nis not exhausted merely because the facts that underlie it have\n\nbeen previously placed before the state's highest court.                  See\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fPicard, 404 U.S. at 277.        Importantly, however, a petitioner need\n\nnot express his federal claims in precisely the same terms in both\n\nthe state and federal courts.         See, e.g., id. at 277-78 (holding\nthat the claims advanced by a habeas petitioner before the state's\n\nhighest court must be the \"substantial equivalent\" of those raised\n\nin his or her federal habeas petition).\n            We have noted that there are myriad ways in which a\n\npetitioner might satisfy his or her obligation to fairly present a\n\nfederal constitutional issue to a state's highest court.                        They\n\ninclude:\n\n            (1) citing a specific provision of the\n            Constitution; (2) presenting the substance of\n            a federal constitutional claim in such manner\n            that it likely alerted the state court to the\n            claim's federal nature; (3) reliance on\n            federal constitutional precedents; and (4)\n            claiming a particular right specifically\n            guaranteed by the Constitution.\nGagne v. Fair, 835 F.2d 6, 7 (1st Cir. 1987) (citations omitted).\n\nBut the list developed in Gagne is merely illustrative; it does not\n\npurport to be exhaustive.            So, for example, in Nadworny, we\n\nrecognized that there \"is yet another species of exhaustion which\n\nmerits    attention.     An     individual's    claim,       arising    under    and\n\nasserted in terms of state law, may, as a practical matter, be\n\nindistinguishable from one arising under federal law.\" 872 F.2d at\n\n1099.\n\n            It    necessarily    follows     that     each   case   in       which   a\n\npetitioner is alleged to have inadequately presented his or her\n\nfederal constitutional claims to the state's highest court is both\n\nsui     generis   and   fact-driven,        turning     on    its      own    unique\n\n                                      -7-\n\fcircumstances. See, e.g., Adelson, 131 F.3d at 262 (observing that\n\n\"our de novo appellate review of a district court's dismissal of a\n\nhabeas   petition     for   want   of   exhaustion      is     necessarily   case-\nspecific\").    In determining whether a petitioner presented his or\n\nher federal claims to the state's highest court \"face-up and\n\nsquarely,\" Martens v. Shannon, 836 F.2d 715, 717 (1st Cir. 1988),\n\nwe consider issues of probability - whether it is more likely than\n\nnot that a reasonable jurist would recognize the constitutional\n\ndimensions of the petitioner's claims, given the manner in which\n\nthose claims were presented.             See Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1101.\n\n             To resolve the question before us, then, we must direct\n\nour attention primarily to Barresi's ALOFAR.              See Adelson 131 F.3d\n\nat 263 (\"[T]he decisive pleading [under Massachusetts practice] is\nthe application for further appellate review, and we must determine\n\nwhether the petitioner fairly presented the federal claim to the\n\nSJC within 'the four corners' of that application.\") (quoting Mele\n\nv. Fitchburg Dist. Court, 850 F.2d 817, 823 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n\nNevertheless, while our inquiry must focus on the \"four corners\" of\n\nthe ALOFAR, we have never held that appellate review is confined to\n\nan examination of that pleading in isolation.                    Rather, we have\n\nacknowledged that, under certain circumstances, the pleadings and\n\nfilings submitted by a habeas petitioner to lower state courts\n\n(e.g.,   a   motion   for    new   trial      or   a   brief    submitted    to   an\n\nintermediate appellate court) provide \"a backdrop against which his\n\nlater filings [must] be viewed.\"              Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1, 7\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).      In fact, in Scarpa, we explicitly rejected the\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fproposition that prior circuit precedent restricts the exhaustion\n\ninquiry exclusively to an examination of the petitioner's ALOFAR.\n\nId. at 8 n.3.1\n                                  III.\n\n           Turning to the facts of this case, we are persuaded that,\n\nwhile    petitioner   certainly   could    have      raised   his   federal\nconstitutional issues in a more plain and direct manner, his\n\nALOFAR, particularly when read against the \"backdrop\" of his\n\nearlier filings in the intermediate appellate court, was minimally\n\nsufficient   to   apprise   the   SJC     of   the    continuing    federal\n\nconstitutional dimension of his appeal.\n\n     1\n          At first glance, it might appear that Mele and Scarpa are\nat odds.   In Mele, for example, we observed that, \"[u]nder the\nSJC's practice as we understand it, the court receives the papers\nand briefs from the lower court only if - and after - it grants an\nALOFAR.\" 850 F.2d at 822. That observation led us to conclude\nthat, at least when the SJC denies an ALOFAR, federal exhaustion\nreview should be limited to the \"four corners\" of that pleading.\nId. at 823.       More recently, however, we determined that,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the SJC denied a petitioner's ALOFAR,\nthe federal exhaustion inquiry must not be limited exclusively to\nan examination of the petitioner's ALOFAR. Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 7.\nDespite the apparent conflict, Mele and Scarpa are not\ninconsistent.    In cases like Mele, where it is clear that a\npetitioner has, on appeal to the SJC, abandoned federal\nconstitutional claims advanced before the lower courts, it is\nentirely appropriate to limit the exhaustion inquiry to the \"four\ncorners\" of the ALOFAR. If, however, it cannot be said that the\npetitioner abandoned his or her federal claims on appeal to the\nSJC, federal exhaustion review includes consideration of the\npetitioner's lower court filings as a \"backdrop\" to his or her\nALOFAR. Compare Mele, 850 F.2d at 822 (concluding that because the\npetitioner's ALOFAR did not even mention federal constitutional\nissues, the \"SJC cannot be presumed to have a duty to look for a\nneedle in a paper haystack - let alone a haystack located in\nsomeone else's barn\"), with Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 7 n.3 (rejecting the\nState's \"crabbed reading\" of Mele and its assertion that the\ncourt's review must necessarily be limited to the \"four corners\" of\nthe ALOFAR, since the record revealed that the petitioner had\n\"consistently asserted\" his federal constitutional claims).\n\n                                  -9-\n\f            We begin with Barresi's intermediate appellate brief. In\n\nthat pleading, Barresi unmistakably argued that the trial court's\n\nevidentiary rulings deprived him of rights guaranteed by the Sixth\nand Fourteenth Amendments. For example, Barresi asserted that \"[a]\n\ncriminal defendant possesses a constitutional right under the Sixth\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as well\nas under Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to\n\n'confront' adverse witnesses, even where it reveals confidential or\n\nprivileged information.\"           In support of that proposition, Barresi\n\ncited both federal and state precedent.             Later in that same brief,\n\nhe asserted that the trial court's rulings \"undermined [his] due\n\nprocess    guarantees       and    destroyed     [his]    right    to     present   a\n\nmeaningful defense to these charges.             Such a denial of the right of\n'confrontation'       as     guaranteed    by     the    Sixth    and     Fourteenth\n\nAmendments and Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of\n\nRights had a significant impact on the outcome of the trial and\nconstitutes reversible error.\"            Given those direct invocations of\n\nrights    protected    by    the   federal      Constitution,     Barresi's    case\n\npresents a situation not unlike the one we confronted in Scarpa,\n\nwhere we observed that \"by identifying the Sixth Amendment in his\n\nmotion for a new trial, petitioner cites a specific provision of\n\nthe Constitution, and, at the same time, provided a backdrop\n\nagainst which his later filings had to be viewed.\"                   38 F.3d at 7\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Unlike     his     intermediate       appellate      brief,     however,\n\nBarresi's ALOFAR is far less direct in describing his federal\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fclaims. Facially, it seems primarily devoted to his claim that the\n\ntrial court misconstrued and misapplied the Massachusetts Rape\n\nShield Law.      Consequently, much of that pleading is dedicated to\ndiscussing principles of statutory construction under applicable\n\nstate law.       Nevertheless, the ALOFAR also discloses that Barresi\n\ncontinued to seek vindication of rights protected by the United\nStates Constitution.        Barresi alleged, for example, that the trial\n\ncourt's refusal to allow him to introduce expert medical testimony\n\ndeprived him of \"an opportunity to present an effective challenge\n\nto the complainant's credibility.\" He also asserted that the trial\n\ncourt's rulings amounted to \"an impermissible infringement on [his]\n\nright to cross-examine [the complainant],\" and, as a consequence,\n\nhe claimed that his \"due process guarantees [were] undermined\" by\nthe disputed trial court rulings.\n\n            To    support    his   ALOFAR   arguments,    Barresi   provided\n\ncitations to state judicial opinions in which the SJC directly\naddressed the same federal constitutional rights he was invoking.\n\nFor example, to support his assertion that the trial court's\n\nrepeated denial of his requests to inquire into the complainant's\n\nrecent sexual conduct with one of her contemporaries amounted to an\n\n\"impermissible infringement of the right to cross-examine her,\"\n\nBarresi relied upon Commonwealth v. Elliot, 393 Mass. 824, 473\n\nN.E.2d 1121 (1985).         In Elliot, the SJC addressed the federal\n\nconstitutional issues implicated when a criminal defendant is\n\nprecluded    from    introducing    evidence   aimed     at   impeaching   or\n\notherwise cross-examining a victim of sexual assault:\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f           We are aware of the ordeal rape complainants\n           must undergo in assisting the prosecution of\n           their attackers.    The Legislature has shown\n           sensitivity to a complainant's plight. G.L.\n           c. 233, § 21B.    At the same time we cannot\n           lose   sight   of   the   defendant's   right,\n           guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth\n           Amendments to the United States Constitution\n           and   by  art.   12   of  the   Commonwealth's\n           Declaration of Rights, to confront adverse\n           witnesses \"by means of cross-examination\n           directed toward revealing possible biases,\n           prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness\n           as they may relate directly to issues or\n           personalities in the case at hand.\"\n\n473 N.E.2d at 1123-24 (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316\n\n(1974)).      Barresi's    ALOFAR   also   relied   upon   Commonwealth   v.\n\nStockhammer, 409 Mass. 867, 570 N.E.2d 992 (1991), to support his\n\nclaim that the trial court's application of the Massachusetts Rape\n\nShield Law deprived him of federally protected due process rights.\nStockhammer, in turn, relied upon Elliot in pointing out that \"rape\n\nconvictions have been reversed on a number of occasions because of\n\nrulings by trial judges prejudicially infringing on the right to\ncross-examine the complainant.\"         570 N.E. 2d at 998.\n\n           Without question, it would be better, and far less risky,\nfor habeas petitioners to highlight the federal nature of claims\n\npresented to a state's highest court by plainly describing them in\n\nfederal terms and by citing federal precedent. Nevertheless, there\n\nare circumstances under which a habeas petitioner, like Barresi,\n\nmay   still    fairly     present   a   federal     constitutional   claim,\n\nnotwithstanding his or her exclusive reliance upon state court\n\nprecedent:\n\n           It is true, of course, that deployment of\n           federal  authority sometimes  is   not  a\n\n                                    -12-\n\f            prerequisite to adequate presentation of a\n            federal   claim    to   the    state   courts.\n            Nevertheless, such occasions will be few and\n            far between, and they invariably will involve\n            some suitable surrogate for explicit reference\n            to federal authorities, say, an emphasis on\n            federal due process rights in the petitioner's\n            cited state cases or an analysis of state law\n            that    adopts     or    parallels     federal\n            constitutional analysis.\n\nAdelson, 131 F.3d at 263 (citations omitted); see also Scarpa, 38\n\nF.3d at 8 (\"Although [citation to federal authorities] is strongly\n\nrecommended if only to avoid controversies of this nature, we have\n\nspecifically declined to adopt a bright-line rule.           The guidelines\n\nwe have promulgated in respect to exhaustion are intended to be\n\ninstructive, rather than to comprise the sole corridors through\nwhich the actual embodiment of fair presentation may pass.\")\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted);             Nadworny, 872\n\nF.2d at 1099 (\"[A] wooden rule which unfailingly denies exhaustion\nif   no   federal   cases   were   cited   stateside   seems    to    us   too\n\nrestrictive.\").\n\n            Although Barresi's ALOFAR relies almost entirely upon\n\nstate precedent to support his federal constitutional claims, the\ndecisions he cites do directly address the federal constitutional\n\nissues central to his effort to obtain a new trial.             And, those\n\ndecisions recognize and discuss the federal constitutional issues\n\nplainly    implicated   when   a   state's   rape   shield    law    arguably\n\nconflicts with a criminal defendant's constitutionally protected\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fright to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses — the very\n\npoint Barresi has argued all along.1\n\n              In summary, then, several factors, considered in light of\nthe entire record, persuade us that Barresi met, albeit minimally,\n\nthe exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. § 2254.           First, his ALOFAR\n\nalleges that the trial court's adverse evidentiary rulings deprived\nhim    of   the   right   to   present   an   effective   challenge   to   the\n\ncomplainant's credibility and infringed his right to cross-examine\n\nher.       When a state rape shield statute operates to \"prevent a\n\ncriminal      defendant     from   presenting    relevant    evidence\"     and\n\ndiminishes his or her \"ability to confront adverse witnesses and\n\npresent a defense,\" the statute \"unquestionably implicates the\n\nSixth Amendment.\"         Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U.S. 145, 149 (1991).\n\nSecond, the ALOFAR specifically asserts that, as a consequence of\n\nthe challenged trial court rulings, Barresi's right to due process\n\n       1\n          That a criminal defendant has a constitutionally\nprotected right to cross-examine adverse witnesses is well\nestablished and widely recognized. In Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S.\n400 (1965), for example, the Supreme Court observed:\n\n              There are few subjects, perhaps, upon which\n              this Court and other courts have been more\n              nearly unanimous than in their expressions of\n              belief that the right of confrontation and\n              cross-examination   is   an    essential   and\n              fundamental requirement for the kind of fair\n              trial which is this country's constitutional\n              goal. Indeed, we have expressly declared that\n              to deprive an accused of the right to cross-\n              examine the witnesses against him is a denial\n              of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due\n              process of law.\n\nId. at 405. More recently, in Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. at 320,\nthe Court called the ability to effectively cross-examine adverse\nwitnesses in a criminal case a \"vital constitutional right.\"\n\n                                     -14-\n\fwas infringed.    Third, Barresi's ALOFAR invokes state decisional\n\nauthority that specifically addresses the federal constitutional\n\ncharacter of issues he sought to litigate.           Finally, the ALOFAR's\n\"backdrop\" -- Barresi's intermediate appellate brief -- plainly and\n\nunequivocally    raised   the    same   federal     constitutional        issues\n\npresented in the ALOFAR, and relied upon citations to appropriate\nfederal authority.\n\n            So, notwithstanding the lack of citation to any federal\n\nauthority in the ALOFAR itself, when viewed against the \"backdrop\"\n\nof Barresi's lower court pleadings, the ALOFAR was minimally\n\nsufficient to alert a reasonable jurist to the fact that Barresi\n\nwas seeking review of alleged trial court errors that had a decided\n\nfederal constitutional dimension.          And, unlike the petitioner in\nMele, nothing in the record suggests that Barresi abandoned the\n\nfederal constitutional claims he advanced before the intermediate\n\nappellate   court.    That      conclusion   is   compelled       by    Barresi's\nreferences in the ALOFAR to his \"due process guarantees,\" his right\n\nto    \"present   an   effective     challenge       to    the    complainant's\ncredibility,\" the trial court's alleged \"impermissible infringement\n\non [his] right to cross-examine her,\" as well as his reliance on\n\nstate court precedent that unambiguously considered and addressed\n\nthe    federal    constitutional        dimension        of     those     issues.\n\nConsequently, while it is rare that a petitioner will be found to\n\nhave successfully presented a federal constitutional claim to a\n\nstate's highest court without referring to federal precedent, see\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fAdelson, 131 F.3d at 263, in our judgment, this case manages to\n\nfall across the line separating exhausted from unexhausted claims.\n\n                                       IV.\n              As noted earlier, resolving cases like this requires an\n\nindividualized,        case-specific,      factual     inquiry.        Whether    a\n\npetitioner's enigmatic state pleadings were sufficient, alone or in\ncombination,     to    apprise    a   reasonable     jurist      of   the   federal\n\nconstitutional dimensions of his or her claims will often prove\n\ndifficult to determine.          Reasonable minds can, of course, fairly\n\ndebate   the    ultimate    resolution     of   such      fact-specific     issues.\n\nNevertheless, rather than impose \"bright line\" rules likely to\n\nprove overly restrictive, we think it appropriate to continue to\n\nfocus primarily on the claims actually presented in the pleadings\nfiled    in    the    state's    highest     court   --    the   ALOFAR     in   the\n\nCommonwealth -- but also to consider the \"backdrop,\" comprised of\n\nearlier filed pleadings. Here, although Barresi's ALOFAR is hardly\na model worthy of emulation, it was, in our judgment, minimally\n\nsufficient to apprise a reasonable jurist that Barresi was seeking\n\nto   vindicate       federally     protected     constitutional        rights     of\n\nconfrontation and cross-examination.\n\n              The district court's order dismissing Barresi's habeas\n\ncorpus petition for want of exhaustion is vacated and the petition\n\nreinstated.      The matter is remanded to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f",

Barresi, II, was convicted in Massachusetts of raping a child under sixteen years of age, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, &#167; 22A, and committing an indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age (the same child), <i>id.</i> &#167; 13B. The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed his convictions, <i>Commonwealth v. Barresi,</i> 46 Mass.App.Ct. 907, 705 N.E.2d 639 (1999), and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") denied, without opinion, his Application for Leave to Obtain Further Appellate Review (commonly referred to as an \"ALOFAR\"). <i>Commonwealth v. Barresi,</i> 429 Mass. 1106, 710 N.E.2d 604 (1999). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, Barresi then petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts for habeas corpus relief. The district court dismissed the petition, holding that Barresi had not fairly presented his federal constitutional claims to the SJC and, therefore, had not exhausted available state court remedies. Although the issue is open to reasonable debate, because we conclude that Barresi did adequately present his federal claims, we reverse and remand the habeas petition for consideration on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to his criminal trial, Barresi filed a motion under the Commonwealth's Rape Shield Law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &#167; 21B, seeking leave to introduce evidence that his alleged sexual assault victim had tested positive for chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease. Based upon those positive test results, as well as his own test results, which revealed that he had never been infected with any chlamydia organism, Barresi hoped to persuade the jury that he could not have repeatedly raped the complainant and, consequently, that her accusations against him were false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barresi also wanted to show that the complainant made up the rape and assault charges to deflect her mother's scorn. According to Barresi, when the young complainant realized her mother was about to discover that she had been sexually active (for perhaps as long as a year) with at least one, and possibly two or more, teenage boys, she fabricated the charges against Barresi to create a plausible diversionary explanation for her sexually transmitted disease. To support that theory of defense, Barresi sought to introduce evidence that the complainant reported the alleged sexual assaults to the police after she had had an argument with her mother, and then ran off to meet with one of the boys with whom she allegedly had an ongoing sexual relationship. Barresi implicitly suggested that at that meeting the two concocted the false rape charges against him, after which the complainant was taken to the police station where she reported the fabricated story to law enforcement officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A pretrial hearing was held on Barresi's motion for leave to introduce evidence related to the complainant's sexual history. At that hearing, Barresi presented a physician he intended to call as a medical expert at trial. Although the doctor was able to give a general explanation of chlamydia and its mode of transmission, he conceded that he had never actually treated patients with the disease, and that his understanding of it was based largely upon information he had gleaned from medical text books. In ruling that Barresi could not introduce the medical expert's testimony at trial, the presiding judge concluded that the doctor lacked sufficient knowledge to give an expert opinion about the incubation period of chlamydia, or the likelihood that a person who had intercourse with an infected partner might contract the disease. The trial judge also concluded that the Massachusetts Rape Shield Law precluded introduction of evidence concerning the complainant's prior sexual conduct with the teenage boy(s), notwithstanding Barresi's asserted intent to introduce that evidence solely to impeach her testimony, and not merely to establish that she was sexually promiscuous. Finally, the trial judge precluded Barresi from introducing testimony from two boys concerning a false accusation of rape the complainant had allegedly leveled against one of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a three day trial, the jury convicted Barresi on both counts. His appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals Court unambiguously asserted, among other things, that the trial court's refusal to allow him to introduce evidence of the complainant's prior sexual relationship with the teenage boy(s), as well as its refusal to allow testimony from his medical expert, violated his right to confront adverse witnesses, as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. While it did not directly address Barresi's federal constitutional claims, the Commonwealth's intermediate appellate court ruled that the trial judge neither abused his discretion nor committed an error of law in excluding the challenged evidence. <i>Barresi,</i> 705 N.E.2d at 641. Accordingly, Barresi's convictions were affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barresi filed a timely ALOFAR with the SJC, the essential thrust of which was that the trial court erred in its interpretation and application of the Massachusetts Rape Shield Law. Barresi did, however, at least allude to the federal constitutional issues he had pressed more forcefully before the intermediate appellate court. The SJC denied Barresi's ALOFAR without opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barresi then filed a petition for federal habeas corpus relief, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, reiterating his claims that the trial court's evidentiary rulings violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that with regard to his federal constitutional claims, Barresi had failed to exhaust the remedies available to him in state court. The district court agreed, holding that because Barresi's ALOFAR did not fairly present his constitutional claims to the SJC, those claims were not exhausted. Therefore, Barresi's habeas petition was dismissed. We subsequently granted Barresi's application for a certificate of appealability, <i>see generally Slack v. McDaniel,</i> 529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of Barresi's habeas petition are not at issue, so we make no comment in that regard. The sole question presented here is a procedural one: whether the federal constitutional claims Barresi advances in his habeas petition were fairly and recognizably presented in his appeal to the SJC. That is, we must decide whether Barresi exhausted available state remedies as to those issues. Our review is de novo. <i>See Adelson v. DiPaola,</i> 131 F.3d 259, 262 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barring certain exceptional circumstances not present here, a habeas petitioner in state custody may not advance his or her constitutional claims in a federal forum unless and until the substance of those claims has been fairly presented to the state's highest court. This exhaustion requirement, codified at 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2254(b) and (c), embodies principles of federal-state comity and is designed to provide state courts with an initial \"opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of [their] prisoners' federal rights.\" <i>Picard v. Connor,</i> 404 U.S. 270, 275, 92 S.Ct. 509, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The petitioner bears the heavy burden of demonstrating satisfaction of the exhaustion requirement. <i>See Adelson,</i> 131 F.3d at 262; <i>Nadworny v. Fair,</i> 872 F.2d 1093, 1098 (1st Cir.1989). To carry that burden, the petitioner must show that \"he tendered his federal claim [to the state's highest court] in such a way as to make it probable that a reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the federal question.\" <i>Casella v. Clemons,</i> 207 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir.2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has made it clear that a federal claim is not exhausted merely because the facts that underlie it have been previously placed before the state's highest court. <i>See Picard,</i> 404 U.S. at 277, 92 S.Ct. 509. Importantly, however, a petitioner need not express his federal claims in precisely the same terms in both the state and federal courts. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 277-78, 92 S.Ct. 509 (holding that the claims advanced by a habeas petitioner before the state's highest court must be the \"substantial equivalent\" of those raised in his or her federal habeas petition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted that there are myriad ways in which a petitioner might satisfy his or her obligation to fairly present a federal constitutional issue to a state's highest court. They include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) citing a specific provision of the Constitution; (2) presenting the substance of a federal constitutional claim in such manner that it likely alerted the state court to the claim's federal nature; (3) reliance on federal constitutional precedents; and (4) claiming a particular right specifically guaranteed by the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gagne v. Fair,</i> 835 F.2d 6, 7 (1st Cir.1987) (citations omitted). But the list developed in <i>Gagne</i> is merely illustrative; it does not purport to be exhaustive. So, for example, in <i>Nadworny,</i> we recognized that there \"is yet another species of exhaustion which merits attention. An individual's claim, arising under and asserted in terms of state law, may, as a practical matter, be indistinguishable from one arising under federal law.\" 872 F.2d at 1099.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It necessarily follows that each case in which a petitioner is alleged to have inadequately presented his or her federal constitutional claims to the state's highest court is both sui generis and fact-driven, turning on its own unique circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Adelson,</i> 131 F.3d at 262 (observing that \"our de novo appellate review of a district court's dismissal of a habeas petition for want of exhaustion is necessarily case-specific\"). In determining whether a petitioner presented his or her federal claims to the state's highest court \"face-up and squarely,\" <i>Martens v. Shannon,</i> 836 F.2d 715, 717 (1st Cir.1988), we consider issues of probability &#8212; whether it is more likely than not that a reasonable jurist would recognize the constitutional dimensions of the petitioner's claims, given the manner in which those claims were presented. <i>See Nadworny,</i> 872 F.2d at 1101.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To resolve the question before us, then, we must direct our attention primarily to Barresi's ALOFAR. <i>See Adelson</i> 131 F.3d at 263 (\"[T]he decisive pleading [under Massachusetts practice] is the application for further appellate review, and we must determine whether the petitioner fairly presented the federal claim to the SJC within `the four corners' of that application.\") (quoting <i>Mele v. Fitchburg Dist. Court,</i> 850 F.2d 817, 823 (1st Cir.1988)). Nevertheless, while our inquiry must focus on the \"four corners\" of the ALOFAR, we have never held that appellate review is confined to an examination of that pleading in isolation. Rather, we have acknowledged that, under certain circumstances, the pleadings and filings submitted by a habeas petitioner to lower state courts (e.g., a motion for new trial or a brief submitted to an intermediate appellate court) provide \"a backdrop against which his later filings [must] be viewed.\" <i>Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> 38 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1994). In fact, in <i>Scarpa,</i> we explicitly rejected the proposition that prior circuit precedent restricts the exhaustion inquiry exclusively to an examination of the petitioner's ALOFAR. <i>Id.</i> at 8 n. 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the facts of this case, we are persuaded that, while petitioner certainly could have raised his federal constitutional issues in a more plain and direct manner, his ALOFAR, particularly when read against the \"backdrop\" of his earlier filings in the intermediate appellate court, was minimally sufficient to apprise the SJC of the continuing federal constitutional dimension of his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Barresi's intermediate appellate brief. In that pleading, Barresi unmistakably argued that the trial court's evidentiary rulings deprived him of rights guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. For example, Barresi asserted that \"[a] criminal defendant possesses a constitutional right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as well as under Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to `confront' adverse witnesses, even where it reveals confidential or privileged information.\" In support of that proposition, Barresi cited both federal and state precedent. Later in that same brief, he asserted that the trial court's rulings \"undermined [his] due process guarantees and destroyed [his] right to present a meaningful defense to these charges. Such a denial of the right of `confrontation' as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights had a significant impact on the outcome of the trial and constitutes reversible error.\" Given those direct invocations of rights protected by the federal Constitution, Barresi's case presents a situation not unlike the one we confronted in Scarpa, where we observed that \"by identifying the Sixth Amendment in his motion for a new trial, petitioner cites a specific provision of the Constitution, and, at the same time, provided a backdrop against which his later filings had to be viewed.\" 38 F.3d at 7 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike his intermediate appellate brief, however, Barresi's ALOFAR is far less direct in describing his federal claims. Facially, it seems primarily devoted to his claim that the trial court misconstrued and misapplied the Massachusetts Rape Shield Law. Consequently, much of that pleading is dedicated to discussing principles of statutory construction under applicable state law. Nevertheless, the ALOFAR also discloses that Barresi continued to seek vindication of rights protected by the United States Constitution. Barresi alleged, for example, that the trial court's refusal to allow him to introduce expert medical testimony deprived him of \"an opportunity to present an effective challenge to the complainant's credibility.\" He also asserted that the trial court's rulings amounted to \"an impermissible infringement on [his] right to cross-examine [the complainant],\" and, as a consequence, he claimed that his \"due process guarantees [were] undermined\" by the disputed trial court rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his ALOFAR arguments, Barresi provided citations to state judicial opinions in which the SJC directly addressed the same federal constitutional rights he was invoking. For example, to support his assertion that the trial court's repeated denial of his requests to inquire into the complainant's recent sexual conduct with one of her contemporaries amounted to an \"impermissible infringement of the right to cross-examine her,\" Barresi relied upon <i>Commonwealth v. Elliot,</i> 393 Mass. 824, 473 N.E.2d 1121 (1985). In <i>Elliot,</i> the SJC addressed the federal constitutional issues implicated when a criminal defendant is precluded from introducing evidence aimed at impeaching or otherwise cross-examining a victim of sexual assault:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are aware of the ordeal rape complainants must undergo in assisting the prosecution of their attackers. The Legislature has shown sensitivity to a complainant's plight. G.L. c. 233, &#167; 21B. At the same time we cannot lose sight of the defendant's right, guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by art. 12 of the Commonwealth's Declaration of Rights, to confront adverse witnesses \"by means of cross-examination directed toward revealing possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at hand.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">473 N.E.2d at 1123-24 (quoting <i>Davis v. Alaska,</i> 415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974)). Barresi's ALOFAR also relied upon <i>Commonwealth v. Stockhammer,</i> 409 Mass. 867, 570 N.E.2d 992 (1991), to support his claim that the trial court's application of the Massachusetts Rape Shield Law deprived him of federally protected due process rights. <i>Stockhammer,</i> in turn, relied upon <i>Elliot</i> in pointing out that \"rape convictions have been reversed on a number of occasions because of rulings by trial judges prejudicially infringing on the right to cross-examine the complainant.\" 570 N.E.2d at 998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without question, it would be better, and far less risky, for habeas petitioners to highlight the federal nature of claims presented to a state's highest court by plainly describing them in federal terms and by citing federal precedent. Nevertheless, there are circumstances under which a habeas petitioner, like Barresi, may still fairly present a federal constitutional claim, notwithstanding his or her exclusive reliance upon state court precedent:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, of course, that deployment of federal authority sometimes is not a prerequisite to adequate presentation of a federal claim to the state courts. Nevertheless, such occasions will be few and far between, and they invariably will involve some suitable surrogate for explicit reference to federal authorities, say, an emphasis on federal due process rights in the petitioner's cited state cases or an analysis of state law that adopts or parallels federal constitutional analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Adelson,</i> 131 F.3d at 263 (citations omitted); <i>see also Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 8 (\"Although [citation to federal authorities] is strongly recommended if only to avoid controversies of this nature, we have specifically declined to adopt a bright-line rule. The guidelines we have promulgated in respect to exhaustion are intended to be instructive, rather than to comprise the sole corridors through which the actual embodiment of fair presentation may pass.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Nadworny,</i> 872 F.2d at 1099 (\"[A] wooden rule which unfailingly denies exhaustion if no federal cases were cited stateside seems to us too restrictive.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Barresi's ALOFAR relies almost entirely upon state precedent to support his federal constitutional claims, the decisions he cites do directly address the federal constitutional issues central to his effort to obtain a new trial. And, those decisions recognize and discuss the federal constitutional issues plainly implicated when a state's rape shield law arguably conflicts with a criminal defendant's constitutionally protected right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses &#8212; the very point Barresi has argued all along.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, then, several factors, considered in light of the entire record, persuade us that Barresi met, albeit minimally, the exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. First, his ALOFAR alleges that the trial court's adverse evidentiary rulings deprived him of the right to present an effective challenge to the complainant's credibility and infringed his right to cross-examine her. When a state rape shield statute operates to \"prevent a criminal defendant from presenting relevant evidence\" and diminishes his or her \"ability to confront adverse witnesses and present a defense,\" the statute \"unquestionably implicates the Sixth Amendment.\" <i>Michigan v. Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. 145, 149, 111 S.Ct. 1743, 114 L.Ed.2d 205 (1991). Second, the ALOFAR specifically asserts that, as a consequence of the challenged trial court rulings, Barresi's right to due process was infringed. Third, Barresi's ALOFAR invokes state decisional authority that specifically addresses the federal constitutional character of issues he sought to litigate. Finally, the ALOFAR's \"backdrop\" &#8212; Barresi's intermediate appellate brief &#8212; plainly and unequivocally raised the same federal constitutional issues presented in the ALOFAR, and relied upon citations to appropriate federal authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, notwithstanding the lack of citation to any federal authority in the ALOFAR itself, when viewed against the \"backdrop\" of Barresi's lower court pleadings, the ALOFAR was minimally sufficient to alert a reasonable jurist to the fact that Barresi was seeking review of alleged trial court errors that had a decided federal constitutional dimension. And, unlike the petitioner in <i>Mele,</i> nothing in the record suggests that Barresi abandoned the federal constitutional claims he advanced before the intermediate appellate court. That conclusion is compelled by Barresi's references in the ALOFAR to his \"due process guarantees,\" his right to \"present an effective challenge to the complainant's credibility,\" the trial court's alleged \"impermissible infringement on [his] right to cross-examine her,\" as well as his reliance on state court precedent that unambiguously considered and addressed the federal constitutional dimension of those issues. Consequently, while it is rare that a petitioner will be found to have successfully presented a federal constitutional claim to a state's highest court without referring to federal precedent, <i>see Adelson,</i> 131 F.3d at 263, in our judgment, this case manages to fall across the line separating exhausted from unexhausted claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, resolving cases like this requires an individualized, case-specific, factual inquiry. Whether a petitioner's enigmatic state pleadings were sufficient, alone or in combination, to apprise a reasonable jurist of the federal constitutional dimensions of his or her claims will often prove difficult to determine. Reasonable minds can, of course, fairly debate the ultimate resolution of such fact-specific issues. Nevertheless, rather than impose \"bright line\" rules likely to prove overly restrictive, we think it appropriate to continue to focus primarily on the claims actually presented in the pleadings filed in the state's highest court &#8212; the ALOFAR in the Commonwealth &#8212; but also to consider the \"backdrop,\" comprised of earlier filed pleadings. Here, although Barresi's ALOFAR is hardly a model worthy of emulation, it was, in our judgment, minimally sufficient to apprise a reasonable jurist that Barresi was seeking to vindicate federally protected constitutional rights of confrontation and cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order dismissing Barresi's habeas corpus petition for want of exhaustion is vacated and the petition reinstated. The matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At first glance, it might appear that<i>Mele</i> and <i>Scarpa</i> are at odds. In <i>Mele,</i> for example, we observed that, \"[u]nder the SJC's practice as we understand it, the court receives the papers and briefs from the lower court only if &#8212; and <i>after</i> &#8212; it grants an ALOFAR.\" 850 F.2d at 822. That observation led us to conclude that, at least when the SJC denies an ALOFAR, federal exhaustion review should be limited to the \"four corners\" of that pleading. <i>Id.</i> at 823. More recently, however, we determined that, notwithstanding the fact that the SJC denied a petitioner's ALOFAR, the federal exhaustion inquiry must not be limited exclusively to an examination of the petitioner's ALOFAR. <i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 7. Despite the apparent conflict, <i>Mele</i> and <i>Scarpa</i> are not inconsistent. In cases like <i>Mele,</i> where it is clear that a petitioner has, on appeal to the SJC, abandoned federal constitutional claims advanced before the lower courts, it is entirely appropriate to limit the exhaustion inquiry to the \"four corners\" of the ALOFAR. If, however, it cannot be said that the petitioner abandoned his or her federal claims on appeal to the SJC, federal exhaustion review includes consideration of the petitioner's lower court filings as a \"backdrop\" to his or her ALOFAR. <i>Compare Mele,</i> 850 F.2d at 822 (concluding that because the petitioner's ALOFAR did not even mention federal constitutional issues, the \"SJC cannot be presumed to have a duty to look for a needle in a paper haystack &#8212; let alone a haystack located in someone else's barn\"), <i>with Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 7 n. 3 (rejecting the State's \"crabbed reading\" of <i>Mele</i> and its assertion that the court's review must necessarily be limited to the \"four corners\" of the ALOFAR, since the record revealed that the petitioner had \"consistently asserted\" his federal constitutional claims).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> That a criminal defendant has a constitutionally protected right to cross-examine adverse witnesses is well established and widely recognized.

Laws ch. 265, &#167; 22A, and committing an indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age (the same child), <i>id.</i> &#167; 13B. The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed his convictions, <i>Commonwealth v.

Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, Barresi then petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts for habeas corpus relief. The district court dismissed the petition, holding that Barresi had not fairly presented his federal constitutional claims to the SJC and, therefore, had not exhausted available state court remedies. Although the issue is open to reasonable debate, because we conclude that Barresi did adequately present his federal claims, we reverse and remand the habeas petition for consideration on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to his criminal trial, Barresi filed a motion under the Commonwealth's Rape Shield Law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, &#167; 21B, seeking leave to introduce evidence that his alleged sexual assault victim had tested positive for chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease. Based upon those positive test results, as well as his own test results, which revealed that he had never been infected with any chlamydia organism, Barresi hoped to persuade the jury that he could not have repeatedly raped the complainant and, consequently, that her accusations against him were false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barresi also wanted to show that the complainant made up the rape and assault charges to deflect her mother's scorn. According to Barresi, when the young complainant realized her mother was about to discover that she had been sexually active (for perhaps as long as a year) with at least one, and possibly two or more, teenage boys, she fabricated the charges against Barresi to create a plausible diversionary explanation for her sexually transmitted disease. To support that theory of defense, Barresi sought to introduce evidence that the complainant reported the alleged sexual assaults to the police after she had had an argument with her mother, and then ran off to meet with one of the boys with whom she allegedly had an ongoing sexual relationship. Barresi implicitly suggested that at that meeting the two concocted the false rape charges against him, after which the complainant was taken to the police station where she reported the fabricated story to law enforcement officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A pretrial hearing was held on Barresi's motion for leave to introduce evidence related to the complainant's sexual history. At that hearing, Barresi presented a physician he intended to call as a medical expert at trial. Although the doctor was able to give a general explanation of chlamydia and its mode of transmission, he conceded that he had never actually treated patients with the disease, and that his understanding of it was based largely upon information he had gleaned from medical text books. In ruling that Barresi could not introduce the medical expert's testimony at trial, the presiding judge concluded that the doctor lacked sufficient knowledge to give an expert opinion about the incubation period of chlamydia, or the likelihood that a person who had intercourse with an infected partner might contract the disease. The trial judge also concluded that the Massachusetts Rape Shield Law precluded introduction of evidence concerning the complainant's prior sexual conduct with the teenage boy(s), notwithstanding Barresi's asserted intent to introduce that evidence solely to impeach her testimony, and not merely to establish that she was sexually promiscuous. Finally, the trial judge precluded Barresi from introducing testimony from two boys concerning a false accusation of rape the complainant had allegedly leveled against one of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a three day trial, the jury convicted Barresi on both counts. His appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals Court unambiguously asserted, among other things, that the trial court's refusal to allow him to introduce evidence of the complainant's prior sexual relationship with the teenage boy(s), as well as its refusal to allow testimony from his medical expert, violated his right to confront adverse witnesses, as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. While it did not directly address Barresi's federal constitutional claims, the Commonwealth's intermediate appellate court ruled that the trial judge neither abused his discretion nor committed an error of law in excluding the challenged evidence. <i>Barresi,</i> 705 N.E.2d at 641. Accordingly, Barresi's convictions were affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barresi filed a timely ALOFAR with the SJC, the essential thrust of which was that the trial court erred in its interpretation and application of the Massachusetts Rape Shield Law. Barresi did, however, at least allude to the federal constitutional issues he had pressed more forcefully before the intermediate appellate court. The SJC denied Barresi's ALOFAR without opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barresi then filed a petition for federal habeas corpus relief, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, reiterating his claims that the trial court's evidentiary rulings violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that with regard to his federal constitutional claims, Barresi had failed to exhaust the remedies available to him in state court. The district court agreed, holding that because Barresi's ALOFAR did not fairly present his constitutional claims to the SJC, those claims were not exhausted. Therefore, Barresi's habeas petition was dismissed. We subsequently granted Barresi's application for a certificate of appealability, <i>see generally Slack v.

Nevertheless, while our inquiry must focus on the \"four corners\" of the ALOFAR, we have never held that appellate review is confined to an examination of that pleading in isolation. Rather, we have acknowledged that, under certain circumstances, the pleadings and filings submitted by a habeas petitioner to lower state courts (e.g., a motion for new trial or a brief submitted to an intermediate appellate court) provide \"a backdrop against which his later filings [must] be viewed.\" <i>Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680706\"><a href=\"/opinion/680706/nazzaro-scarpa-v-larry-e-dubois-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1994). In fact, in <i>Scarpa,</i> we explicitly rejected the proposition that prior circuit precedent restricts the exhaustion inquiry exclusively to an examination of the petitioner's ALOFAR. <i>Id.</i> at 8 n. 3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the facts of this case, we are persuaded that, while petitioner certainly could have raised his federal constitutional issues in a more plain and direct manner, his ALOFAR, particularly when read against the \"backdrop\" of his earlier filings in the intermediate appellate court, was minimally sufficient to apprise the SJC of the continuing federal constitutional dimension of his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Barresi's intermediate appellate brief. In that pleading, Barresi unmistakably argued that the trial court's evidentiary rulings deprived him of rights guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. For example, Barresi asserted that \"[a] criminal defendant possesses a constitutional right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as well as under Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to `confront' adverse witnesses, even where it reveals confidential or privileged information.\" In support of that proposition, Barresi cited both federal and state precedent. Later in that same brief, he asserted that the trial court's rulings \"undermined [his] due process guarantees and destroyed [his] right to present a meaningful defense to these charges. Such a denial of the right of `confrontation' as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights had a significant impact on the outcome of the trial and constitutes reversible error.\" Given those direct invocations of rights protected by the federal Constitution, Barresi's case presents a situation not unlike the one we confronted in Scarpa, where we observed that \"by identifying the Sixth Amendment in his motion for a new trial, petitioner cites a specific provision of the Constitution, and, at the same time, provided a backdrop against which his later filings had to be viewed.\" 38 F.3d at 7 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike his intermediate appellate brief, however, Barresi's ALOFAR is far less direct in describing his federal claims. Facially, it seems primarily devoted to his claim that the trial court misconstrued and misapplied the Massachusetts Rape Shield Law. Consequently, much of that pleading is dedicated to discussing principles of statutory construction under applicable state law. Nevertheless, the ALOFAR also discloses that Barresi continued to seek vindication of rights protected by the United States Constitution. Barresi alleged, for example, that the trial court's refusal to allow him to introduce expert medical testimony deprived him of \"an opportunity to present an effective challenge to the complainant's credibility.\" He also asserted that the trial court's rulings amounted to \"an impermissible infringement on [his] right to cross-examine [the complainant],\" and, as a consequence, he claimed that his \"due process guarantees [were] undermined\" by the disputed trial court rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his ALOFAR arguments, Barresi provided citations to state judicial opinions in which the SJC directly addressed the same federal constitutional rights he was invoking. For example, to support his assertion that the trial court's repeated denial of his requests to inquire into the complainant's recent sexual conduct with one of her contemporaries amounted to an \"impermissible infringement of the right to cross-examine her,\" Barresi relied upon <i>Commonwealth v. Elliot,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2032044\"><a href=\"/opinion/2032044/commonwealth-v-elliot/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2032044\"><a href=\"/opinion/2032044/commonwealth-v-elliot/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></a></span> (1985).

At the same time we cannot lose sight of the defendant's right, guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by art. 12 of the Commonwealth's Declaration of Rights, to confront adverse witnesses \"by means of cross-examination directed toward revealing possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at hand.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">473 N.E.2d at 1123-24 (quoting <i>Davis v.

Nevertheless, there are circumstances under which a habeas petitioner, like Barresi, may still fairly present a federal constitutional claim, notwithstanding his or her exclusive reliance upon state court precedent:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, of course, that deployment of federal authority sometimes is not a prerequisite to adequate presentation of a federal claim to the state courts. Nevertheless, such occasions will be few and far between, and they invariably will involve some suitable surrogate for explicit reference to federal authorities, say, an emphasis on federal due process rights in the petitioner's cited state cases or an analysis of state law that adopts or parallels federal constitutional analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Adelson,</i> 131 F.3d at 263 (citations omitted); <i>see also Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 8 (\"Although [citation to federal authorities] is strongly recommended if only to avoid controversies of this nature, we have specifically declined to adopt a bright-line rule. The guidelines we have promulgated in respect to exhaustion are intended to be instructive, rather than to comprise the sole corridors through which the actual embodiment of fair presentation may pass.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Nadworny,</i> 872 F.2d at 1099 (\"[A] wooden rule which unfailingly denies exhaustion if no federal cases were cited stateside seems to us too restrictive.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Barresi's ALOFAR relies almost entirely upon state precedent to support his federal constitutional claims, the decisions he cites do directly address the federal constitutional issues central to his effort to obtain a new trial. And, those decisions recognize and discuss the federal constitutional issues plainly implicated when a state's rape shield law arguably conflicts with a criminal defendant's constitutionally protected right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses &#8212; the very point Barresi has argued all along.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, then, several factors, considered in light of the entire record, persuade us that Barresi met, albeit minimally, the exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. First, his ALOFAR alleges that the trial court's adverse evidentiary rulings deprived him of the right to present an effective challenge to the complainant's credibility and infringed his right to cross-examine her. When a state rape shield statute operates to \"prevent a criminal defendant from presenting relevant evidence\" and diminishes his or her \"ability to confront adverse witnesses and present a defense,\" the statute \"unquestionably implicates the Sixth Amendment.\" <i>Michigan v. Lucas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1743</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span> (1991). Second, the ALOFAR specifically asserts that, as a consequence of the challenged trial court rulings, Barresi's right to due process was infringed. Third, Barresi's ALOFAR invokes state decisional authority that specifically addresses the federal constitutional character of issues he sought to litigate. Finally, the ALOFAR's \"backdrop\" &#8212; Barresi's intermediate appellate brief &#8212; plainly and unequivocally raised the same federal constitutional issues presented in the ALOFAR, and relied upon citations to appropriate federal authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, notwithstanding the lack of citation to any federal authority in the ALOFAR itself, when viewed against the \"backdrop\" of Barresi's lower court pleadings, the ALOFAR was minimally sufficient to alert a reasonable jurist to the fact that Barresi was seeking review of alleged trial court errors that had a decided federal constitutional dimension. And, unlike the petitioner in <i>Mele,</i> nothing in the record suggests that Barresi abandoned the federal constitutional claims he advanced before the intermediate appellate court. That conclusion is compelled by Barresi's references in the ALOFAR to his \"due process guarantees,\" his right to \"present an effective challenge to the complainant's credibility,\" the trial court's alleged \"impermissible infringement on [his] right to cross-examine her,\" as well as his reliance on state court precedent that unambiguously considered and addressed the federal constitutional dimension of those issues. Consequently, while it is rare that a petitioner will be found to have successfully presented a federal constitutional claim to a state's highest court without referring to federal precedent, <i>see Adelson,</i> 131 F.3d at 263, in our judgment, this case manages to fall across the line separating exhausted from unexhausted claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted earlier, resolving cases like this requires an individualized, case-specific, factual inquiry. Whether a petitioner's enigmatic state pleadings were sufficient, alone or in combination, to apprise a reasonable jurist of the federal constitutional dimensions of his or her claims will often prove difficult to determine. Reasonable minds can, of course, fairly debate the ultimate resolution of such fact-specific issues. Nevertheless, rather than impose \"bright line\" rules likely to prove overly restrictive, we think it appropriate to continue to focus primarily on the claims actually presented in the pleadings filed in the state's highest court &#8212; the ALOFAR in the Commonwealth &#8212; but also to consider the \"backdrop,\" comprised of earlier filed pleadings. Here, although Barresi's ALOFAR is hardly a model worthy of emulation, it was, in our judgment, minimally sufficient to apprise a reasonable jurist that Barresi was seeking to vindicate federally protected constitutional rights of confrontation and cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order dismissing Barresi's habeas corpus petition for want of exhaustion is vacated and the petition reinstated. The matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At first glance, it might appear that<i>Mele</i> and <i>Scarpa</i> are at odds. In <i>Mele,</i> for example, we observed that, \"[u]nder the SJC's practice as we understand it, the court receives the papers and briefs from the lower court only if &#8212; and <i>after</i> &#8212; it grants an ALOFAR.\" 850 F.2d at 822. That observation led us to conclude that, at least when the SJC denies an ALOFAR, federal exhaustion review should be limited to the \"four corners\" of that pleading. <i>Id.</i> at 823. More recently, however, we determined that, notwithstanding the fact that the SJC denied a petitioner's ALOFAR, the federal exhaustion inquiry must not be limited exclusively to an examination of the petitioner's ALOFAR. <i>Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 7. Despite the apparent conflict, <i>Mele</i> and <i>Scarpa</i> are not inconsistent. In cases like <i>Mele,</i> where it is clear that a petitioner has, on appeal to the SJC, abandoned federal constitutional claims advanced before the lower courts, it is entirely appropriate to limit the exhaustion inquiry to the \"four corners\" of the ALOFAR. If, however, it cannot be said that the petitioner abandoned his or her federal claims on appeal to the SJC, federal exhaustion review includes consideration of the petitioner's lower court filings as a \"backdrop\" to his or her ALOFAR. <i>Compare Mele,</i> 850 F.2d at 822 (concluding that because the petitioner's ALOFAR did not even mention federal constitutional issues, the \"SJC cannot be presumed to have a duty to look for a needle in a paper haystack &#8212; let alone a haystack located in someone else's barn\"), <i>with Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 7 n. 3 (rejecting the State's \"crabbed reading\" of <i>Mele</i> and its assertion that the court's review must necessarily be limited to the \"four corners\" of the ALOFAR, since the record revealed that the petitioner had \"consistently asserted\" his federal constitutional claims).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> That a criminal defendant has a constitutionally protected right to cross-examine adverse witnesses is well established and widely recognized.
