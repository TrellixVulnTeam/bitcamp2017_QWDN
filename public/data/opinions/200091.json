D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n         Gibson* and Greenberg,** Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     William D.

Weill and Preti, Flaherty, Beliveau, Pachios &\nHaley, LLC on brief for National Union Fire Insurance Company,\namicus curiae.\n\n\n\n                           August 20, 2002\n\n\n\n____________\n*Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n**Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            Selya, Circuit Judge.         This appeal arises out of an\n\nautomobile accident in which a vehicle operated by an uninsured\n\nmotorist collided with a vehicle driven by Lorraine Wark.            The\n\nnegligence of the uninsured motorist was the principal cause of the\n\naccident.    A passenger in Wark's vehicle, appellant Laura Davis-\n\nIrish, sustained serious injuries.           At the time of the crash,\n\nDavis-Irish was in the course of her employment with Garrand &\n\nCompany (Garrand).\n\n            Garrand owned a vehicle, not involved in the accident,1\n\nfor which it had purchased a business auto policy underwritten by\n\nSeaco Insurance Company (Seaco).          That policy contained uninsured\n\nmotorist (UM) coverage.         The UM endorsement delineated who was\n\ninsured for purposes of that coverage.         It read in pertinent part:\n\n            B.   Who Is An Insured\n\n                    1.   You.\n\n                    2. If you are an individual, any\n                    \"family member\".\n\n                    3.   Anyone else \"occupying\" a\n                    covered \"auto\" or a temporary\n                    substitute for a covered \"auto\".\n                    The covered \"auto\" must be out\n                    of   service  because   of   its\n                    breakdown, repair, servicing,\n                    loss or destruction.\n\n                    4. Anyone for damages he or she\n                    is entitled to recover because\n\n\n\n     1\n      Despite the fact that it owned a vehicle, Garrand generally\nrequired its employees to use their own cars for business travel.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                     of \"bodily injury\" sustained by\n                     another \"insured\".\n\nThe policy's declaration page lists the named insured as \"Garrand\n\n& Company, Inc.\" and the form of business as \"Corporation\".              The\n\nfirst page of the policy form explains that, throughout the policy,\n\nthe   word   \"you\"    refers   to   the   named   insured   shown   in   the\n\ndeclarations.\n\n             Undeterred by the seemingly clear definition of the key\n\npronoun (\"you\"), the appellant sought compensation for her injuries\n\nunder paragraph 1 of the UM endorsement.          She posited that \"you,\"\n\nas used in this endorsement, reasonably could be understood to\n\ninclude Garrand's employees while acting in the course of their\n\nemployment.    Seaco disagreed.     It not only disclaimed coverage for\n\nthe appellant's injuries but also brought a diversity action in\n\nMaine's federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment as to\n\nwhether the appellant was an insured for purposes of the UM\n\nendorsement. The parties stipulated to the critical facts and then\n\ncross-moved for summary judgment.         See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.        The\n\ndistrict court granted Seaco's motion and denied the appellant's.2\n\nSeaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish, 180 F. Supp. 2d 235 (D. Me. 2002).\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      The court also denied the appellant's request to certify the\ncoverage question to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. That order\nis not challenged on appeal.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            We need not tarry. The district court's opinion rests on\n\nits conclusion that \"you,\" as used in the UM endorsement, is\n\nunambiguous and reasonably can be understood to refer only to\n\nGarrand.    See id. at 236-37.         Having carefully considered the\n\nrecord,    the   policy   language,    the   briefs,   and   the   parties'\n\narguments, we conclude, without serious question, that the district\n\ncourt was correct.    We have said before, and today reaffirm, that\n\nwhen a lower court accurately takes the measure of a case and\n\narticulates a cogent rationale, it serves no useful purpose for a\n\nreviewing court to write at length.          See, e.g., Maurice v. State\n\nFarm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. 235 F.3d 7, 9-10 (1st Cir. 2000); Chico-\n\nVelez v. Roche Prods., Inc., 139 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 1995);\n\nLawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir.\n\n1996); Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas de P.R., 74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st\n\nCir. 1996); In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 989 F.2d\n\n36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).     Because this is such a case, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's judgment for substantially the reasons elucidated\n\nin that court's thoughtful opinion.            We add only three brief\n\ncomments.\n\n            First:   The appellant alleges that the policy provision\n\nquoted above is ambiguous and should therefore be construed against\n\nSeaco. The appellant's premise is correct in the sense that, under\n\nMaine law, ambiguous language in an insurance policy ordinarily is\n\nconstrued against the insurer.         E.g., Pine Ridge Realty, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fMass. Bay Ins. Co., 752 A.2d 595, 600-01 (Me. 2000); Union Mut.\n\nFire Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 521 A.2d 308, 310 (Me.\n\n1987).   But that premise has no application here.              The policy\n\nlanguage to which the appellant adverts simply is not ambiguous.\n\nSee Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co.,\n\n267 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"A contract need not negate every\n\npossible construction of its terms in order to be unambiguous.\")\n\n(citation omitted); see also Colford v. Chubb Ins Co., 687 A.2d\n\n609, 614 (Me. 1996) (holding that the contra proferentem principle\n\ndoes not mean that the insured must prevail every time that the\n\ninsured and the insurer \"disagree on the meaning of the contract\").\n\nAmbiguity, like beauty, may lie solely in the eye of the beholder\n\n– and so it is here.\n\n            Second:    The appellant also asservates that Seaco's\n\ndefinition of \"you\" renders the disputed provision – specifically,\n\nnumbered paragraphs 1 and 2 of that provision – superfluous.           That\n\nasserveration erroneously assumes that this type of policy is\n\nissued exclusively to corporations.        The contrary is true.        The\n\ninsurance   industry   often   uses   standard   forms,   and   this   is   a\n\nstandard form, multi-purpose business auto policy designed for\n\nissuance to a variety of insurable entities.        The purchaser (and,\n\nthus, the named insured) may be a corporation, a partnership, or an\n\nindividual doing business as a sole proprietor.           There is nothing\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fsinister about an insurer's use of such a \"one size fits all\"\n\npolicy form.\n\n           Not    surprisingly,      the    provisions   of   such   a     policy\n\nfunction somewhat differently depending upon the identity and\n\nstatus of the named insured.               When the named insured is an\n\nindividual, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the UM endorsement are fully\n\noperative.       The   fact   that   those    paragraphs,     by   their    plain\n\nlanguage, are not apposite when the named insured is a corporation\n\ndoes not afford us license to stretch the words of the policy and\n\ngive them an unintended effect.            See Langer v. U.S. Fid. & Guar.\n\nCo., 552 A.2d 20, 22 (Me. 1988) (declining to give a \"strained and\n\nunnatural construction\" to a provision in a standard business auto\n\npolicy).   In short, the appellant's position confuses superfluity\n\nwith inapplicability.\n\n           Third:      The appellant relies heavily on the Ohio Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co.,\n\n710 N.E. 2d 1116 (Ohio 1999).        That court examined the language of\n\na substantially similar UM endorsement and determined that the term\n\n\"you\" was ambiguous.       Id. at 1119.      The court stated:\n\n           It would be nonsensical to limit protection\n           solely to a corporate entity, since a\n           corporation,   itself,   cannot   occupy   an\n           automobile, suffer bodily injury or death, or\n           operate a motor vehicle.    Here, naming the\n           corporation as the insured is meaningless\n           unless the coverage extends to some person or\n           persons – including to the corporation's\n           employees.\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fId.\n\n          We consider Scott-Pontzer an anomaly and we therefore\n\ndecline to follow it.   We have two main reasons for this view.   We\n\nlist them in ascending order of importance.\n\n          First, the Scott-Pontzer court was sharply divided (this\n\nwas a 4-3 decision), and the majority opinion has had a rude\n\nreception in its birthplace. The Ohio legislature lost little time\n\nin superseding it due to its destabilizing effect on the automobile\n\ninsurance market.   See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 3937.18 (Anderson\n\n2002).   Moreover, the majority opinion has come under fire in the\n\nOhio courts.   See, e.g., Bianchi v. Moore, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS\n\n2105, at *20-21 (May 11, 2001).\n\n          Second, the majority opinion in Scott-Pontzer appears to\n\ndeviate from well-established tenets of contract interpretation.\n\nThe Maine courts have held, with a regularity bordering on the\n\nmonotonous, that contracts of insurance ought to be construed in a\n\nmanner consistent with the intent of the parties.   See, e.g., Pine\n\nRidge, 752 A.2d at 601 (explaining that \"[t]he touchstone of\n\ncontract interpretation is the intent of the parties\").   The Ohio\n\nSupreme Court consciously departed from this tenet.     See Scott-\n\nPontzer, 710 N.E. 2d at 1120 (conceding that the conclusion reached\n\nby the majority \"may be viewed by some as a result that was not\n\nintended by the parities to the insurance contract\").   Inasmuch as\n\nMaine law controls in this diversity case, see Crellin Tech., Inc.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fv. Equipmentlease Corp., 18 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994), adherence to\n\nScott-Pontzer would be improvident.     See    Daigle v. Maine Med.\n\nCtr., 14 F.3d 684, 689 (1st Cir. 1994) (describing the proper role\n\nof a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction).\n\n          We need go no further.   For the reasons stated both here\n\nand in the opinion below, we reject the appellant's suggested\n\ninterpretation of the UM endorsement.         As the district court\n\nexplained, that interpretation \"is not a reasonable reading of the\n\n[policy] language, and runs contrary to the thrust of Maine . . .\n\nprecedent.\"   Seaco Ins., 180 F. Supp. 2d at 237.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

The negligence of the uninsured motorist was the principal cause of the accident. A passenger in Wark's vehicle, appellant Laura Davis-Irish, sustained serious injuries. At the time of the crash, Davis-Irish was in the course of her employment with Garrand &amp; Company (Garrand).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garrand owned a vehicle, not involved in the accident,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for which it had purchased a business auto policy underwritten by Seaco Insurance Company (Seaco). That policy contained uninsured motorist (UM) coverage. The UM endorsement delineated who was insured for purposes of that coverage. It read in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Who Is An Insured</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. You.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. If you are an individual, any \"family member\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Anyone else \"occupying\" a covered \"auto\" or a temporary substitute for a covered \"auto\". The covered \"auto\" must be out of service because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Anyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of \"bodily injury\" sustained by another \"insured\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy's declaration page lists the named insured as \"Garrand &amp; Company, Inc.\" and the form of business as \"Corporation\". The first page of the policy form explains that, throughout the policy, the word \"you\" refers to the named insured shown in the declarations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undeterred by the seemingly clear definition of the key pronoun (\"you\"), the appellant sought compensation for her injuries under paragraph 1 of the UM endorsement. She posited that \"you,\" as used in this endorsement, reasonably could be understood to include Garrand's employees while acting in the course of their employment. Seaco disagreed. It not only disclaimed coverage for the appellant's injuries but also brought a diversity action in Maine's federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment as to whether the appellant was an insured for purposes of the UM endorsement. The parties stipulated to the critical facts and then cross-moved for summary judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The district court granted Seaco's motion and denied the appellant's.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Seaco Ins. Co. v.

The district court's opinion rests on its conclusion that \"you,\" as used in the UM endorsement, is unambiguous and reasonably can be understood to refer only to Garrand. <i>See id.</i> at 236-37. Having carefully considered the record, the policy language, the briefs, and the parties' arguments, we conclude, without serious question, that the district court was correct. We have said before, and today reaffirm, that when a lower court accurately takes the measure of a case and articulates a cogent rationale, it serves no useful purpose for a reviewing court to write at length. <i>See, e.g., Maurice v.

Because this is such a case, we affirm the district court's judgment for substantially the reasons elucidated in that court's thoughtful opinion. We add only three brief comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>First:</i> The appellant alleges that the policy provision quoted above is ambiguous and should therefore be construed against Seaco. The appellant's premise is correct in the sense that, under Maine law, ambiguous language in an insurance policy ordinarily is construed against the insurer. <i>E.g., Pine Ridge Realty, Inc. v. Mass. Bay Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></span>, 600-01 (Me.2000); <i>Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></span>, 310 (Me. 1987). But that premise has no application here. The policy language to which the appellant adverts simply is not ambiguous. <i>See Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199631\"><a href=\"/opinion/199631/alternative-energy-v-st-paul-fire-and-ma/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2001) (\"A contract need not negate every possible construction of its terms in order to be unambiguous.\") (citation omitted); <i>see also Colford v. Chubb Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">687</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></span>, 614 (Me.1996) (holding that the <i>contra proferentem</i> principle does not mean that the insured must prevail every time that the insured and the insurer \"disagree on the meaning of the contract\"). Ambiguity, like beauty, may lie solely in the eye of the beholder &#8212; and so it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Second:</i> The appellant also asservates that Seaco's definition of \"you\" renders the disputed provision &#8212; specifically, numbered paragraphs 1 and 2 of that provision &#8212; superfluous. That asserveration erroneously assumes that this type of policy is issued exclusively to corporations. The contrary is true. The insurance industry often uses standard forms, and this is a standard form, multi-purpose business auto policy designed for issuance to a variety of insurable entities. The purchaser (and, thus, the named insured) may be a corporation, a partnership, or an individual doing business as a sole proprietor. There is nothing sinister about an insurer's use of such a \"one size fits all\" policy form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, the provisions of such a policy function somewhat differently depending upon the identity and status of the named insured. When the named insured is an individual, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the UM endorsement are fully operative. The fact that those paragraphs, by their plain language, are not apposite when the named insured is a corporation does not afford us license to stretch the words of the policy and give them an unintended effect. <i>See Langer v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span>, 22 (Me.1988) (declining to give a \"strained and unnatural construction\" to a provision in a standard business auto policy). In short, the appellant's position confuses superfluity with inapplicability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Third:</i> The appellant relies heavily on the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in <i>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1116</span></span> (1999). That court examined the language of a substantially similar UM endorsement and determined that the term \"you\" was ambiguous. <i>Id.</i> at 1119. The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be nonsensical to limit protection solely to a corporate entity, since a corporation, itself, cannot occupy an automobile, suffer bodily injury or death, or operate a motor vehicle.

We have two main reasons for this view. We list them in ascending order of importance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the <i>Scott-Pontzer</i> court was sharply divided (this was a 4-3 decision), and the majority opinion has had a rude reception in its birthplace.
