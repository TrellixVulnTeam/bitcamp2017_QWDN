Osvaldo Rosado-Ortiz and\n\nAna O. Santos-Ortiz (“debtors”) appeal from a decision of the\n\ndistrict court denying reconsideration of its decision affirming\n\nthe judgment of the bankruptcy court. Because debtors’ argument is\n\nwithout merit, we affirm.\n\n          On October 12, 2000, debtors sought Chapter 13 bankruptcy\n\nprotection.   Appellee Beal Bank filed claims against the estate\n\nbased on a loan for which it was the servicing agent.           The\n\nunderlying loan had been made to debtors by First Bank Puerto Rico\n\nand was secured by debtors’ residential property.      The loan was\n\nguaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”), which\n\nsold the loan to LPP Mortgage, Ltd. (“LPP”), which in turn hired\n\nBeal Bank as its servicing agent.    Debtors challenged Beal Bank’s\n\nclaims on several different grounds, but after a thorough review of\n\nthe loan documents and the servicing agreement, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt ruled that Beal Bank was a secured creditor with standing to\n\nmake a claim against the estate.    Debtors appealed to the district\n\ncourt, and now to us.\n\n          Debtors make one argument on appeal: that, as to third\n\nparties, the assignment of the loan from SBA to LPP did not\n\nautomatically transfer the security interest in the collateral\n\nwithout registration; and that debtors should be considered third\n\nparties in their capacity as debtors-in-possession.       They rely\n\nexclusively on Crefisa, Inc. v. Washington Mutual Bank, F.A. (In re\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fColonial Mortgage Bankers Corp.), 186 F.3d 46 (1st Cir. 1999), in\n\nwhich we held, under the facts of that case, that a bankruptcy\n\ntrustee was a third party vis-à-vis the assignment of a note and\n\nsecured interest, and thus, under Puerto Rico law, the secured\n\nclaim was not valid against the estate without registration.\n\n            Crefisa is distinguishable from this case.             The district\n\ncourt’s opinion makes this abundantly clear, so we will only\n\nbriefly discuss the reasons.        Under the unusual facts of Crefisa,\n\nthe trustee in bankruptcy was treated as a third party, not because\n\nof his trustee status, but because the estate he represented was\n\nnot   a   party   to   the   instrument    in   question,   even    though   the\n\nunderlying collateral ended up in the estate; here, the debtors\n\nwere parties to and signatories of the underlying instruments that\n\nallowed the transfer.        Furthermore, even if this were an advantage\n\nthat all trustees had, we will not automatically give a debtor-in-\n\npossession the same rights as a trustee when to do so would destroy\n\nthe rights of secured creditors under contracts that the debtors-\n\nin-possession have themselves executed.            Finally, the instruments\n\nthemselves are distinguishable, since those in Crefisa did not make\n\nany reference to the underlying security interest, and thus would\n\nnot have given a third-party transferee notice; here, the notes\n\nclearly referenced the security interest and allowed for its\n\ntransfer.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f",
