Federico Villarman-Oviedo\n\n(\"Villarman\") brings this appeal to raise 16 different issues and\n\nerrors that he claims necessitate either a new trial or reversal.\n\nWe deny all of his claims of error, uphold the rulings of the\n\ndistrict court and affirm his conviction and sentencing.\n\n            In a grand jury indictment returned on March 24, 1999,\n\nVillarman together with one or more of his 20 co-defendants were\n\ncharged    in    five   drug-related    counts,     including    one    count     of\n\nconspiracy (1) to possess with intent to distribute and (2) to\n\ndistribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, one kilogram of\n\nheroin and       multi-pound     quantities    of   marijuana.     On     April    4\n\nVillarman was arraigned, entered a not guilty plea and was ordered\n\ndetained    pending     trial.      That     indictment    was   superseded       on\n\nApril 21, and again Villarman was arraigned and ordered detained\n\nwithout bail on April 29.         On May 5 the grand jury returned a two-\n\ncount second superseding indictment against Villarman and 23 co-\n\ndefendants.      Then on May 13 he was again arraigned, again pleaded\n\nnot guilty and continued to be detained.\n\n            On    August   25    Villarman     submitted    an   urgent    motion\n\nrequesting a de novo bail hearing. After conducting such a hearing\n\non September 17, the district court denied Villarman's motion and\n\napproved the order for detention pending trial.\n\n            Ultimately (on April 18, 2000) the grand jury returned a\n\nfour-count third superseding indictment against Villarman and eight\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fco-defendants.    Count One, the only count in which Villarman was\n\nnamed, charged:\n\n     From on or about March, 1998 up to and including the date\n     of this indictment, in the District of Puerto Rico and\n     within the jurisdiction of this Court, [named defendants\n     including Villarman], the defendants herein, and others\n     to the Grand Jury known and unknown, knowingly,\n     willfully, intentionally and unlawfully did conspire,\n     confederate, and agree with each other and with other\n     persons to the Grand Jury known and unknown, to\n     knowingly, intentionally, and unlawfully possess with\n     intent to distribute and distribute:\n\n               a. five (5) kilograms or more, the exact\n          amount being unknown, of a mixture and\n          substance containing a detectable amount of\n          cocaine,   a   Schedule  II   Narcotic   Drug\n          Controlled Substance;\n\n               b. one (1) kilogram or more, the exact\n          amount being unknown, of a mixture and\n          substance containing a detectable amount of\n          heroin, a Schedule I Controlled Substance; and\n\n               c. multi-pound quantities, the exact\n          amount being unknown, of a mixture and\n          substance containing a detectable amount of\n          marijuana, a Schedule I Controlled substance.\n\n          All in violation of Title 21, United States\n          Code, Section 846.1\n\n          Villarman and other co-defendants then filed multiple\n\nmotions to suppress evidence gathered from wiretaps or, in the\n\nalternative, for the conduct of a hearing under Franks v. Delaware,\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         Further statutory citations will simply take the form\n\"Section,\" omitting references to Title 21 and to Title 18, the\ngeneral criminal code. That dual usage should create no confusion,\nbecause the Title 21 references are in the 800 series, far removed\nfrom the Title 18 section numbers.\n\n                                -3-\n\f438 U.S. 154 (1978).     Those motions call for backtracking somewhat\n\nin reviewing the chronology of the case.\n\n            On May 1, 1998, a wiretap application for cellular phones\n\nin Puerto Rico had been authorized by District Judge Daniel R.\n\nDominguez of the District of Puerto Rico, based on the government's\n\napplication    and    supporting   affidavits.      Information      in    the\n\naffidavits originated in a New York investigation into a drug\n\nconspiracy, which expanded to Puerto Rico when the government\n\nlearned of telephone calls to New York narcotics distributors from\n\na Puerto Rican cellular phone.         In the wiretap application the\n\ngovernment cited telephone toll records, criminal history records\n\nof   the   targets,   undercover   purchases   of   heroin   in    New    York,\n\nconversations from wiretaps established in New York and information\n\nthat the cellular phones continued to be operational.             In addition\n\nthe government described how traditional investigative techniques\n\nwould not be effective in investigating the drug conspiracy within\n\nPuerto Rico because the targets tended to be highly suspicious.\n\n            On June 16, 2000 the district court found that there had\n\nbeen sufficient pre-wiretap investigation to justify denial of any\n\nsuppression of the wiretap evidence. After describing some of that\n\ninvestigation, the district court found that the authorization of\n\nthe wiretaps was reasonable because the nature of the conspiracy\n\nmade it likely that routine investigatory techniques would fail.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            In that same opinion the district court also considered\n\nhow   Villarman's   allegations        of    perjury   in   the    government's\n\naffidavit in support of the wiretap could impact the motion to\n\nsuppress the evidence.      According to Villarman, the affidavits had\n\nfailed to disclose that the government had a confidential informant\n\nwho was being debriefed by the government and had provided much of\n\nthe   information   for    the   wiretap      application.        In     addition,\n\nVillarman   contended     that   the   government      should     have    informed\n\nissuing Judge Dominguez about testimony in front of another judge,\n\nJudge Aracelia Acevedo of the Puerto Rico Commonwealth Municipal\n\nCourt. Two Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") Special Agents,\n\nJulie de Mello (\"de Mello\") and Iván Rios Grajales (\"Grajales\"),\n\nhad given oral testimony under oath in connection with their\n\nrequest for an arrest warrant against two co-defendants in this\n\ncase, Carlos Soto del Valle (\"Soto\") and Joaquín Cruz Jiménez\n\n(\"Cruz\").   De Mello and Grajales did not advise Judge Acevedo that\n\nthey were conducting a federal investigation and that they had\n\nwiretap communications.      Villarman cites Judge Acevedo's affidavit\n\n(describing how agents testified that they had received information\n\nabout Soto's and Cruz' activities from a confidential informant) as\n\nevidence of perjury in the affidavit for the wiretap application,\n\nwhich declared there was no confidential informant who could assist\n\nin the investigation of the Puerto Rico conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f           Finding     that   the    alleged   perjury    was   simply   a\n\nmisunderstanding by the state judge of the agents' use of the\n\nSpanish    term      \"confidencia\"     (meaning    only    \"confidential\n\ninformation,\" not a nonexistent Puerto-Rico-based confidential\n\ninformant), a misunderstanding that was the product of a federal\n\ngag order forbidding reference to the wiretap (which had indeed\n\nprovided the \"confidential information\"), the district court held\n\nthat no illegal activity had occurred.         Villarman's request for a\n\nFranks hearing to review the sufficiency of the evidence was also\n\ndenied.\n\n           On October 10, 2000 the United States informed Villarman\n\nthat it anticipated calling DEA Special Agent Reinaldo López\n\n(\"López\") to testify about factual matters and maybe as an expert\n\nwitness.   Villarman was also informed about López' background and\n\nexperience, as well as the general context of his testimony.             On\n\nOctober 12 Villarman submitted a motion to strike expert testimony,\n\nto which the government responded on October 13 and 16.\n\n           On October 15, 2000 the case against Villarman began, and\n\nthe jury trial lasted nearly two weeks.           During the trial the\n\ngovernment presented its case through numerous witnesses, including\n\nLópez and cooperating witness Isaias Valerio (\"Valerio\"), as well\n\nas 16 intercepted phone calls that involved Villarman talking\n\n(1) to co-defendants Cruz and Soto (both individually and together)\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fand (2) to cooperating witness Valerio, using one of co-defendant\n\nSoto's cellular phones.\n\n          López    presented   testimony   about     general   narcotics\n\nactivities in Puerto Rico as well as interpreting coded language in\n\nthe intercepted telephone calls.    López had listened to over 5000\n\nintercepted calls during the course of this investigation, as well\n\nas having many years of experience and training in narcotics\n\ninvestigations.       Villarman    made    motions     and     interposed\n\ncontemporaneous objections asking that López not be allowed to\n\ntestify as to the content of the taped conversations because he was\n\nnot certified as an expert, nor had he been a participant in the\n\nconversations.    Finding that López was testifying to his personal\n\nexperiences in listening to the tapes, the district court ruled\n\nthat the testimony should be considered lay opinion testimony under\n\nFed. R. Evid. (\"Evid. Rule\") 701, not expert testimony governed by\n\nEvid. Rule 702.\n\n          During the course of the trial, cooperating witness\n\nValerio testified for the government about his relationship with\n\nVillarman and their narcotics distribution activity.              Valerio\n\ndiscussed how he and Villarman had transported 300 to 350 kilograms\n\nof cocaine from Puerto Rico to New York between 1998 and 1999.\n\nValerio also testified about how he and Villarman used coded words\n\nto discuss narcotics and also analyzed a taped conversation in\n\nwhich he and Villarman spoke about several kilograms of cocaine\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthat had gotten wet.      Valerio also discussed taped conversations\n\nbetween Villarman and other co-defendants in which wet cocaine was\n\ndiscussed.\n\n            During the trial Villarman moved for a mistrial, arguing\n\nthat Valerio's testimony about the 300 to 350 kilogram cocaine\n\ntransaction violated Evid. Rule 404(b). In denying the motion, the\n\ndistrict court determined that the conduct formed part of the\n\ncharged   conspiracy    and   was   therefore   not    Evid.   Rule   404(b)\n\nmaterial.      Villarman later moved pursuant to Fed. R. Crim P.\n\n(\"Crim. Rule\") 29 for a judgment of acquittal, which the district\n\ncourt also denied.\n\n             Villarman testified at trial over a span of three days.\n\nVillarman admitted that it was his voice in the taped conversations\n\nand that he had spoken to co-defendants Soto and Cruz about\n\nobtaining cocaine for them.     He also admitted to using coded terms\n\nto discuss drug transactions, but he denied that he ever really\n\nagreed or intended to provide narcotics.              After his testimony\n\nVillarman again unsuccessfully argued for a judgment of acquittal.\n\n             On October 27, 2000 the jury returned a verdict of guilty\n\nas to Villarman with respect to Count One of the third superseding\n\nindictment.     By a special jury verdict, the jury found Villarman\n\nguilty of conspiracy to distribute more than one kilogram of\n\nheroin, but it found that he had not engaged in a conspiracy to\n\ndistribute any amounts of cocaine or marijuana.\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           On May 11, 2001 the Presentence Investigative Report\n\n(\"PSI\") was released.     Under Sentencing Guideline (\"U.S.S.G.\")\n\n§2D1.1 the PSI recommended a base offense level of 32, then added\n\na two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, for a total\n\noffense level of 34.    No recommendation for a downward adjustment\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility was included.     Both the United\n\nStates and Villarman submitted motions objecting to the PSI, with\n\nVillarman's objections including (1) a request for a downward\n\ndeparture for his allegedly minor role in the conspiracy, (2) a\n\ndispute over discrepancies between the amount of heroin found by\n\nthe special jury verdict and the testimony presented at trial,\n\n(3) a complaint about the failure to acknowledge Villarman's\n\nacceptance of responsibility and (4) an objection to the inclusion\n\nof a sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice.   Villarman\n\nalso asked that the Court apply the holding in Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) to the indictment and the special jury\n\nverdict.\n\n           On July 17, 2001 the district court adopted the factual\n\nfindings of the PSI, determined a total offense level of 34 and\n\nsentenced Villarman to imprisonment for 151 months, followed by a\n\nfive-year term of supervised release.   Villarman filed motions for\n\nnew trial and judgment of acquittal under Crim. Rule 29 on the same\n\nday, and on July 20 he filed a notice of appeal.   On August 27 the\n\ndistrict court denied Villarman's motions, and on October 18\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fVillarman submitted an urgent motion for new trial that was again\n\ndenied by the district court.\n\n          We turn then to Villarman's numerous issues on appeal.\n\nSome merit only short shrift, while others call for more extended\n\ntreatment.\n\n                   Denial of Bail Pending Trial\n\n          Villarman claims that the district court erred in denying\n\nhim pretrial bail.    We ordinarily apply an \"independent review,\n\ntempered by a degree of deference to the determinations made below\"\n\nto the district court's pretrial detention order under Section 3145\n\n(United States v. Tortora, 922 F.2d 880, 882-83 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\nBut because Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 481-84 (1982)(per curiam)\n\nteaches that a defendant's claim to pretrial bail becomes moot once\n\nhe is convicted, Villarman's like claim is moot.\n\n                        Title III Wiretaps\n\n          Villarman contends that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to suppress all conversations obtained by Title\n\nIII wiretaps and in refusing to conduct a Franks evidentiary\n\nhearing before it denied that motion.   Villarman relies on what he\n\ndescribes as \"perjured statements, omissions, factual inadequacies\n\nand misrepresentations by the government in the applications for\n\nthe   original   electronic   surveillance   and   its   extensions.\"\n\nVillarman claims (1) that it was unnecessary to have a wiretap\n\nbecause of the availability of less intrusive techniques and (2)\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fthat the affidavit in support of the wiretap was tainted by\n\nmisleading and false statements and material omissions.\n\n     On the first issue Villarman disputes that the government\n\nprovided \"a full and complete statement as to whether or not other\n\ninvestigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they\n\nreasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too\n\ndangerous\" (\"Title III,\" Section 2518(1)(c)).        We have interpreted\n\nthat provision to mean that the statement should demonstrate that\n\nthe government has made \"a reasonable, good faith effort to run the\n\ngamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to means\n\nso intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls\" (United\n\nStates v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1306-07 (1st Cir. 1987)). Before\n\ngranting a wiretap authorization the issuing court \"must satisfy\n\nitself that the government has used normal techniques but it has\n\nencountered difficulties in penetrating a criminal enterprise or in\n\ngathering    evidence--to    the   point   where   (given   the   statutory\n\npreference    for   less   intrusive   techniques)   wiretapping    becomes\n\nreasonable\" (United States v. Abou-Saada, 785 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n1986)).     It is not necessary, though, to show that other methods\n\nhave been entirely unsuccessful (id.).\n\n            Decisions to grant wiretap orders are subject to review\n\nin two different contexts.         First the trial judge may consider a\n\nmotion to suppress the evidence gathered by the wiretap that the\n\nissuing judge authorized, while later an appellate court may review\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthe trial judge's suppression ruling (see United States v. Ashley,\n\n876 F.2d 1069, 1074 (1st Cir. 1989), most recently followed in\n\nUnited States v. Nelson, 319 F.3d 12, 32 (1st Cir. 2002)).              In both\n\ninstances the reviewing court examines the face of the affidavit and\n\n\"decide[s] if the facts set forth in the application were minimally\n\nadequate to support the determination that was made\" (Ashley, 876\n\nF.2d at 1074).\n\n            Here the affidavit provided to issuing Judge Dominguez\n\ncontained a detailed description of the evidence the investigation\n\nhad collected to date, including telephone toll records, background\n\nand criminal history of targets, undercover purchases of heroin in\n\nNew York, telephone conversations from wiretaps in New York and\n\ninformation   from    the   Puerto    Rico    telephone   company   that   the\n\ntelephones were operational.         In addition, the affidavit explained\n\nwhy the continued use of traditional investigative techniques (such\n\nas confidential sources, grand jury subpoenas, search warrants,\n\nsurveillance and consensual monitoring) would be ineffective in\n\nuncovering    the    full   scope     of     the   potential   crimes    under\n\ninvestigation, as well as the identities of those responsible for\n\nthe unlawful manufacture, possession, sale and distribution of\n\nnarcotics in Puerto Rico.            And the affidavit also included a\n\ndescription of the investigation's goal of obtaining evidence of the\n\ntotality of offenses in which the targets of the investigation were\n\ninvolved.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f          Against all of that, Villarman claims that the government\n\nhad failed to investigate thoroughly in Puerto Rico, so there were\n\nother methods of investigation that should have been pursued before\n\nresorting to the wiretap under Section 2518(1)(c).            Moreover, he\n\nplumps for suppression because of nondisclosure to the issuing judge\n\nabout how far the New York investigation had proceeded and about the\n\nfact that a confidential informant was the source of much of the\n\ninformation presented in the application.         According to Villarman,\n\nif the issuing judge had been told how far the government had\n\nprogressed without the wiretap, he would not have given his approval\n\nfor the wiretap.\n\n          Title    III   does   require   that   the   affidavit   show   why\n\nwiretapping is necessary in place of less intrusive investigative\n\ntechniques.    From the facts provided to him in the affidavit, the\n\ndistrict court here found that normal investigative techniques had\n\nbeen tried in Puerto Rico, but had failed.             Separate electronic\n\nsurveillance had been authorized by a New York court and had\n\nresulted in traced calls to and from three telephones owned by a co-\n\ndefendant.     Additionally, another co-defendant was under physical\n\nsurveillance in Puerto Rico, and agents had attempted surveillance\n\nin the vicinity of the homes of two co-defendants.\n\n             According to the affidavit, the surveillance and other\n\ntechniques failed because the co-defendants were very suspicious of\n\npotential surveillance and the surveillance would be easily detected\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fin    the   co-defendants'    neighborhood.        Moreover,   such   typical\n\ninvestigatory methods as grand jury subpoenas, search warrants and\n\npen   registers were insufficient to gather information without\n\nalerting the co-conspirators to the surveillance and potential\n\ncriminal liability.\n\n             Finally, the affidavit also asserted an inability to\n\ninfiltrate the drug trafficking organization because there were no\n\nconfidential informants who had knowledge of the organization or who\n\ncould introduce agents to members of the organization.           Even though\n\na New York confidential informant had enabled the agents to identify\n\nsome of the main co-conspirators, that informant lacked sufficient\n\ncontacts     to    develop   information   about    the   structure   of   the\n\norganization in Puerto Rico.       Moreover, the lack of a confidential\n\nsource in Puerto Rico made it difficult to establish consensual\n\nmonitoring.       In light of that detailed explanation, the affidavit's\n\ndiscussion of alternate methods plainly does not fall below the\n\nstandard of adequacy for a wiretap (see United States v. Rivera-\n\nRosario, 300 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2002)). With the government still\n\nunaware of the identity of many of the conspiracy's members as well\n\nas the organizational structure of the conspiracy, the district\n\ncourt could permissibly allow the government to employ electronic\n\nsurveillance to uncover the complete range of operations of the\n\ntarget conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f           Villarman     seeks to undercut that conclusion by also\n\narguing that the affidavit was tainted by misleading and false\n\nstatements and material omissions in violation of the government's\n\nresponsibility under Section 2518(1)(c).               Villarman claims that\n\nthose omissions amount to perjury, especially in the area of whether\n\nor not the government had a confidential informant in Puerto Rico\n\nable to assist in investigating the drug conspiracy.\n\n             We   need   not    lengthen    this    opinion    by   addressing\n\nVillarman's numerous theories of how the government assertedly\n\nfailed to make a complete and honest statement of facts.              We have\n\nexamined them carefully just as the district judge did (United\n\nStates v. Soto-Del Valle, 102 F. Supp. 2d 57 (D. P.R. 2000)), and\n\nwe too find them         without merit.         Moreover, they are totally\n\ninadequate to have required a Franks hearing under the standards we\n\nhave announced in such cases as United States v. Alicea, 205 F.3d\n\n480, 487 (1st Cir. 2000) and United States v. Adams, 305 F.3d 30,\n\n36 n.1 (1st Cir. 2002).         It is an understatement to say that the\n\ndistrict court's rejection of the need for a Franks hearing was not\n\nclearly erroneous, the standard announced in such cases as United\n\nStates v. Ranney, 298 F.3d 74, 77-78 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           In sum, the district court's allowance of the Article III\n\nwiretaps   was    entirely     proper.     We   turn   to   Villarman's   other\n\narguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f                         Evid. Rule 404(b)\n\n           We review a district court's admission of evidence that\n\nis allegedly Evid. Rule 404(b) material under an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard (United States v. Manning, 79 F.3d 212, 217-18 (1st Cir.\n\n1996)).    Because here the challenged evidence is not of \"other\n\ncrimes, wrongs, or acts\" (the language of the Rule), but is rather\n\nintrinsic to the crime charged in the indictment (id. at 218), the\n\nstandard of review becomes irrelevant:   Evid. Rule 404(b) is really\n\nnot implicated at all (United States v. Shea, 159 F.3d 37, 39 (1st\n\nCir. 1998)).\n\n           Thus Villarman complains of the testimony of cooperating\n\nwitness Valerio about his alleged involvement with Villarman in\n\nseveral cocaine distribution transactions involving 300 to 350\n\nkilograms of cocaine between 1998 and 1999. Although other evidence\n\nat trial as well as the eventual verdict against Villarman focused\n\non heroin transactions, the district court found that the evidence\n\nas to cocaine was not Evid. Rule 404(b) material because it formed\n\npart of the charged indictment, in addition to which there was no\n\ncontemporaneous objection by Villarman's counsel.\n\n           Count One, on which Villarman was convicted, charged him\n\nand his co-defendants with conspiracy to distribute and possess\n\ncocaine, heroin and marijuana from on or about March 1998 up to and\n\nincluding the date of the third superseding indictment (April 18,\n\n2000).    In addition to the challenged testimony, the jury heard\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\ftaped conversations in which Valerio and Villarman discussed still\n\nanother cocaine transaction.   We cannot say that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in finding that Valerio's testimony at issue\n\nwas direct evidence of the conspiracy charged, rather than evidence\n\nof other bad acts subject to Evid. Rule 404(b).2\n\n            Villarman also argues that the \"District Court failed to\n\ncarefully balance the probative value, if any of the proffered\n\ntestimony\" under Evid. Rule 403.    But \"[b]alancing these concerns\n\nlies within the broad discretion of the trial Judge and will only\n\nbe reversed upon a showing that the Judge abused his discretion\"\n\n(United States v. Andiarena, 823 F.2d 673, 677-78 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\nAgain no abuse of discretion has been shown here.\n\n             Single Conspiracy v. Multiple Conspiracies\n\n            Villarman also complains that a variance exists between\n\nthe single conspiracy charged and multiple conspiracies presented\n\nat trial.     That poses the issue succinctly described in United\n\nStates v. Escobar-de Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 172 (1st Cir. 1999):\n\n     A variance arises when the proof at trial depicts a\n     scenario that differs materially from the scenario limned\n     in the indictment.\n\nSuch a variance requires reversal only if it \"is both material and\n\nprejudicial, for example, if the variance works a substantial\n\ninterference with the defendant's right to be informed of the\n\n\n     2\n       That being so, we need not determine whether Villarman made\na contemporaneous objection to Valerio's testimony so as to impose\na more demanding standard on Villarman's current contention.\n\n                                -17-\n\fcharges laid at his doorstep\" (id.).               Here Villarman argues that\n\neven though the indictment charged only a single conspiracy, the\n\nproofs at trial focused on multiple conspiracies that were different\n\nwith respect to the co-conspirators, the time frame of alleged\n\nactivity and the transactions themselves.\n\n           That issue of single conspiracy v. multiple conspiracies\n\nis a question of fact for the jury (United States v. LiCausi, 167\n\nF.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir. 1999)). As United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d\n\n687, 696 (1st Cir. 1999) has reiterated:\n\n     The question whether a given body of evidence is\n     indicative of a single conspiracy, multiple conspiracies,\n     or no conspiracy at all is ordinarily a matter of fact;\n     a jury's determination in that regard is subject to\n     review only for evidentiary sufficiency.\n\n           Throughout        trial    the   government       presented        evidence\n\nsupporting the theory of a single conspiracy as described in the\n\nindictment.    There were telephone calls between Villarman and co-\n\ndefendants    Soto     and   Cruz     discussing    both    heroin      and    cocaine\n\ntransactions. Valerio also explained a drug transaction that he had\n\ndiscussed with Villarman, once when Villarman was using co-defendant\n\nSoto's cellular phone.          Villarman himself testified at trial and\n\nadmitted   that   he    spoke    to    co-defendants       Soto   and    Cruz    about\n\nproviding cocaine, occasionally in coded language.                      All of that\n\nevidence would suffice for a jury determination that Villarman was\n\ninvolved in a single conspiracy, including among its members Valerio\n\nand co-defendants Soto and Cruz, to distribute narcotics.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f            Indeed, even if there had been a variance (as there was\n\nnot), Villarman would still have to show that it had produced unfair\n\nprejudice and that it was not \"harmless error\" (United States v.\n\nCandelaria-Silva, 166 F.3d 19, 39 (1st Cir. 1999)).                Because the\n\njury found Villarman guilty only of heroin involvement and not of\n\ncocaine dealing, it apparently did not rely on Valerio's testimony\n\nas to 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine, looking instead to the tape-\n\nrecorded conversations of Villarman discussing heroin transactions.\n\nSo even at worst, Villarman's contention of a variance would\n\nconstitute harmless error and would thus be insufficient to warrant\n\nreversal.\n\n                   Testimony by Special Agent López\n\n            Next Villarman argues that the district court erred in\n\nallowing Special Agent López to provide expert testimony without\n\nprior notice, assertedly depriving Villarman of the opportunity to\n\nretain his own experts to refute the testimony.             Looking to Evid.\n\nRule 701 as the predicate for doing so, the district court allowed\n\nLópez to testify about the conspirators' use of coded terms to\n\ndenote drugs and about the meaning of those terms.           Then Villarman,\n\nelecting to testify during the week following López' testimony, took\n\nthat opportunity by acknowledging the use of code words but by\n\nstating   that   \"bread\"   denoted    cocaine   and   not    (as    López   had\n\ntestified) heroin.   That of course presented a classic occasion for\n\nthe jury's determination of credibility, which the jury permissibly\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fresolved when it found Villarman guilty of participation in a heroin\n\nconspiracy but not a cocaine conspiracy.\n\n      Under the circumstances here, it is unnecessary for us to\n\ndecide   whether   the    district   court   was    or   was   not   right   in\n\ncharacterizing López' testimony as lay testimony under Evid. Rule\n\n701 rather than as expert testimony under Evid. Rule 702 (in the\n\nlatter respect, see, e.g., Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S.\n\n137 (1999) and the implementing December 1, 2000 amendments to Evid.\n\nRules 701 and 702).      That is so because López was clearly qualified\n\nby experience and the \"specialized knowledge\" that he had acquired\n\nover the years to opine on the meaning of the code words that had\n\nadmittedly been used by Villarman and others (see, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Tejada, 886 F.2d 483, 485-86 (1st Cir. 1989), and because\n\nthe government's October 11, 2000 discovery letter gave ample notice\n\nof that specialized knowledge to Villarman.              In short, Villarman\n\nloses this argument too.\n\n                     Brady, Giglio and the Jencks Act\n\n           Villarman further charges that the district court erred\n\nin allowing Valerio to testify because the government assertedly did\n\nnot comply with its discovery obligations.         According to Villarman,\n\nthe   government's    asserted   failures    to    disclose    (1)   Valerio's\n\nidentity as a witness, (2) his plea and cooperation agreement,\n\n(3) reports of his debriefings, (4) his criminal history and (5) any\n\nother impeachment material violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f(1963), Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972) and Section\n\n3500 (the Jencks Act). Villarman claims that he was deprived of the\n\nopportunity     to   use    the    withheld   evidence     (a)     to     conduct\n\ninvestigation and obtain further discovery, (b) to aid adequately\n\nin the formulation of his defense and (c) to impeach the witnesses\n\nagainst him during trial.\n\n            As to those claims, the issue is one of assertedly delayed\n\ndisclosure rather than nondisclosure.         Villarman received a copy of\n\nValerio's     plea   and    cooperation     agreement,     with    nonmaterial\n\nredactions, four days before trial.         And for Brady-Giglio purposes,\n\nUnited States v. Catano, 65 F.3d 219, 227 (1st Cir. 1995) teaches\n\nthe application of an abuse of discretion standard, for purposes of\n\nwhich Catano, id. repeats \"the test is whether defendant's counsel\n\nwas prevented by the delay from using the disclosed material\n\neffectively in preparing and presenting the defendant's case.\"\n\nRelatedly, Congress has prescribed the             defendant's ability to\n\nconduct effective cross-examination as the Jencks Act standard.\n\n            Here Villarman did employ the relevant material--whether\n\nassertedly exculpatory as to Villarman or impeaching as to Valerio\n\nor both--during the Valerio cross-examination (as was done in United\n\nStates v. Valencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d 506, 514 (1st Cir. 1991)).                  And\n\nas to the claimed inadequacy of that use, another branch                        of\n\nVillarman's complaints, he has not pointed credibly to specific\n\nobjections    that   he    might   have   lodged   (but   let    pass),    or   to\n\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fparticular arguments that he might have advanced (but did not), if\n\nhe had received the information earlier. As United States v. Devin,\n\n918 F.2d 280, 290 (1st Cir. 1990) says:\n\n     A defendant who claims that his hand was prematurely\n     forced by delayed disclosure cannot rely on wholly\n     conclusory assertions but must bear the burden of\n     producing, at the very least, a prima facie showing of a\n     plausible strategic option which the delay foreclosed.\n\nIndeed, no better demonstration of the adequacy of the use of the\n\nmaterial provided to Villarman could be made than the actual result\n\nat trial:    Valerio testified only about cocaine transactions with\n\nVillarman, and by special verdict the jury found Villarman not\n\nguilty of cocaine distribution.\n\n                        Right of Confrontation\n\n            Again dwelling on the Valerio testimony, Villarman claims\n\nthat the district court prevented him, in violation of his Sixth\n\nAmendment    rights,   from      cross-examining    Valerio   effectively.\n\nAlthough that added contention could also be dispatched swiftly in\n\nterms of the result reached at the end of the preceding section,\n\nVillarman also loses that claim analytically.\n\n            Confrontation Clause challenges are reviewed de novo to\n\ndetermine   whether    defense    counsel   was    afforded   a   reasonable\n\nopportunity to impeach adverse witnesses.          But when that threshold\n\nis reached, any constraints imposed by the trial court on the extent\n\nand manner of cross-examination are reviewed only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion (United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 219 F.3d 37, 45 (1st\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fCir. 2000)). On that score Stephens v. Hall, 294 F.3d 210, 226 (1st\n\nCir. 2002)(citations and quotation           marks omitted, emphasis in\n\noriginal) sets forth the relevant standard:\n\n     In order to safeguard the defendant's rights under the\n     Confrontation Clause, we have held that the trial judge\n     may not so restrict cross-examination as to deprive the\n     defendant of the constitutionally required threshold\n     level of inquiry, and must give the accused sufficient\n     leeway to establish a reasonably complete picture of the\n     witness's veracity, bias, and motivation.\n\n                        *        *        *\n     [T]he Confrontation Clause guarantees an opportunity for\n     effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that\n     is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the\n     defense might wish.\n\n            In this instance the district court curbed Villarman's\n\ncross-examination   of     Valerio    as    inappropriate   on   just   three\n\noccasions: (1) when Villarman attempted to use a version of facts\n\nattached to Valerio's plea and cooperation agreement when that\n\nguilty plea was unrelated to this case, (2) when Villarman accused\n\nValerio   of   violating    his   cooperation    agreement   by   allegedly\n\nsoliciting information from other defendants and (3) when Villarman\n\nasked Valerio about his citizenship and place of birth.           Before us\n\nVillarman has failed to address any of those instances, but in any\n\nevent our reading of the trial transcript discloses that the\n\ndistrict court    did    not abuse its discretion in any of those\n\nrespects.\n\n            Instead Villarman simply repeats his nondisclosure (or\n\ndelayed disclosure) contention that we have just rejected in terms\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fof Brady-Giglio and the Jencks Act, attempting to transmute that\n\ninto a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses.\n\nBecause the argument does not gain force either through repetition\n\nor by wrapping it in a new garment, we reject it again for the same\n\nreasons.\n\n                        Motion for Mistrial\n\n           In still another effort to ring changes on the same bells\n\nof Valerio's testimony, Villarman urges that allowing that witness\n\nto testify about 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine deprived Villarman\n\nof an opportunity to investigate the veracity and nature of--and\n\nthus to defend against--that testimony, so that a mistrial should\n\nbe declared for the asserted violation of Evid. Rule 404(b).    Any\n\nrefusal to declare a mistrial is measured against a manifest abuse\n\nof discretion yardstick, so that we will uphold the court's ruling\n\nunless the movant demonstrates a clear showing of prejudice (United\n\nStates v. Rullan-Rivera, 60 F.3d 16, 18 (1st   Cir. 1995)).\n\n           What we have said earlier on the subject of Evid. Rule\n\n404(b) defeats Villarman on this score as well.   Every step in that\n\nanalysis applies here with equal force, and the standard of review\n\nhere is even more demanding.\n\n                        Motion for New Trial\n\n           We deal next with Villarman's assertion that the district\n\ncourt erred in denying his motion for new trial because the evidence\n\npresented at trial by the government did not justify the jury's\n\n\n\n                                -24-\n\fspecial verdict finding him responsible for more than one kilogram\n\nof   heroin.   That   decision   is   reviewed   in   manifest-abuse-of-\n\ndiscretion terms (United States v. Rodriguez-DeJesus, 202 F.3d 482,\n\n485 (1st Cir. 2000)) in light of Crim. Rule 33, which authorizes the\n\ngrant of a new trial if required in the interests of justice and\n\n\"where the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict\"\n\n(United States v. Andrade, 94 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n      During the trial Special Agent López testified about two\n\nspecific transactions, each involving one-eighth kilogram of heroin.\n\nAs Villarman would have it, the jury could look only to that\n\nevidence and therefore convict him for no more than that quantity.\n\nBut that contention glosses over the fact that López also testified\n\nabout another attempted transaction that involved two kilograms of\n\nheroin (with the drug reference sought to be disguised by the use\n\nof coded words). Because that evidence too could be credited by the\n\njury to support its special verdict of more than one kilogram of\n\nheroin, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nVillarman's Crim. Rule 33 motion.\n\n           Villarman next argues that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his Crim. Rule 29 motion for a new trial because the\n\nevidence did not support the special verdict in which the jury found\n\nhim guilty of conspiracy with intent to distribute more than one\n\nkilogram of heroin.   Denial of a Crim. Rule 29 motion for judgment\n\nof acquittal is reviewed de novo, and we will affirm Villarman's\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fconviction if after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the prosecution, \"any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\" (United\n\nStates v. Donnat, 311 F.3d 99, 103 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\n            As we have just said in the preceding section, López\n\ntestified about transactions totaling 2-2/8 kilograms of heroin.\n\nAll credibility determinations are left for resolution by the jury\n\nfor Crim. Rule 29 purposes (United States v. Hernandez, 146 F.3d 30,\n\n32 (1st Cir. 1998)).         And that scotches Villarman's claim to a\n\njudgment    of   acquittal   for   any   asserted   insufficiency   of   the\n\nevidence.\n\n         Calculation of Drug Quantity for Sentencing Purposes\n\n            Just as the jury's determination of the quantity of heroin\n\ninvolved has withstood attack, so too does the district judge's\n\nsentencing determination of Villarman's U.S.S.G. base offense level\n\nas 34.     U.S.S.G. findings of the sentencing court are overturned\n\nonly for clear error (United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33,\n\n37 (1st Cir. 1990)), and that cannot be said as to the offense level\n\nin this case, based as it was on at least one but not more than\n\nthree kilograms of heroin.\n\n                        Other Sentencing Issues\n\n     Villarman advances three other sentencing issues: (1) that the\n\ndistrict court erred in granting a two-level increase under U.S.S.G.\n\n§3C1.1 for obstruction of justice because, he says, there was no\n\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\fspecific reliable evidence that Villarman gave material false\n\ntestimony at trial; (2) that the district court erred in not\n\ngranting his motion for a two-level downward departure based on his\n\nminor role in the conspiracy; and (3) that the district court\n\nengaged in a lack of parity in sentencing Villarman to a longer term\n\nthan other co-defendants.3   We deal with those contentions in turn.\n\n            As to the first of those issues, whether Villarman's\n\nconduct is within the scope of U.S.S.G. §3C1.1 is subject to de novo\n\nreview, but fact-bound determinations are reviewed for clear error\n\n(United States v. Thomas, 86 F.3d 263, 263 (1st Cir. 1996)(per\n\ncuriam)).    In the latter respect, if the record supports at least\n\ntwo permissible inferences, the factfinder's choice between or among\n\nthem cannot be clearly erroneous (United States v. Veilleux, 949\n\nF.2d 522, 525 (1st Cir. 1991)).\n\n            U.S.S.G. §3C1.1 requires the imposition of a two-level\n\nincrease in offense level if a defendant \"willfully obstructed or\n\nimpeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of\n\njustice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or\n\nsentencing of [an] offense.\"   For a defendant's perjury to support\n\n\n     3\n        Although Villarman's initial brief also indicates, in the\ntitle to the subsection discussing these issues, that the district\ncourt erred in \"failing to grant a downward departure for\nacceptance of responsibility,\" there is no discussion of any such\ncontention in the text of that brief or of his reply brief. Even\nif that argument had been presented, however, Villarman's continued\ndenial that he conspired to distribute narcotics justifies the\ndistrict court's refusal to grant him credit for acceptance of\nresponsibility.\n\n                                -27-\n\fsuch an enhancement, he or she must have provided \"false testimony\n\nconcerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide\n\nfalse testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or\n\nfaulty memory\" (United States v. Rowe, 202 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir.\n\n2000)).\n\n             At    trial   Villarman    acknowledged   numerous   telephone\n\nconversations with co-defendants about providing drugs, but he\n\nclaimed that he never agreed to provide or intended to provide them\n\nwith any type of drug.        Instead Villarman said that he spoke with\n\nthe co-defendants only because he was owed money and feared for his\n\nlife.     If that testimony        had been believed, the jury would\n\nconsequently have concluded that he did not intend to distribute\n\ndrugs, rendering him guiltless of any conspiracy to distribute\n\nnarcotics.        In reaching the opposite conclusion as to his guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt regarding a heroin conspiracy, the jury\n\nmust    perforce    have   determined    that   Villarman's   testimony   was\n\nfalse--not the product of mistake, confusion or faulty memory, but\n\nrather stemming from Villarman's desire to convince the jury of a\n\nfabricated theory to excuse himself from liability.            In turn, the\n\ndistrict court could not have been clearly erroneous in deciding\n\nthat Villarman had provided materially false information, thus\n\njustifying the two-level increase for obstruction of justice.\n\n             As for Villarman's role in the conspiracy, U.S.S.G.\n\n§3B1.2(b)'s cmt. 5 identifies a minor participant as one \"who is\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fless culpable than most other defendants, but whose role could not\n\nbe described as minimal.\"       We will reverse a sentencing court's\n\nfinding that a defendant is not a minor participant only if it is\n\nclearly erroneous (United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146,\n\n148-49 (1st Cir. 2000)), so that the defendant bears a substantial\n\nburden of proving entitlement to such a downward adjustment for his\n\nor her role in the offense (id. at 148).            As United States v.\n\nBrandon, 17 F.3d 409, 460 (1st Cir. 1994) has put it:\n\n     The sentencing court has broad discretion in determining\n     whether this downward departure is appropriate and we\n     will reverse only if the evidence overwhelmingly\n     demonstrates that the defendant played a part that makes\n     him substantially less culpable than the average\n     participant such that the court's decision was clearly\n     erroneous.\n\n           Villarman fails that test.         He discussed with his co-\n\nconspirators not only the sale of drugs but also the need to find\n\npeople to transport those drugs.          Importantly, Villarman also\n\nsupplied co-defendant Cruz with heroin and expressed worry about the\n\nloss of two kilograms of heroin transported by the conspiracy. Even\n\nwithout regard to Valerio's testimony about Villarman's asserted\n\nrole in transporting 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine, Villarman\n\nplainly   has   not   shown   clear   error   in   the   district   court's\n\ndetermination that he was not a minor participant in the conspiracy\n\nto distribute more than one kilogram of heroin.\n\n           Finally as to the comparative length of Villarman's\n\ncustodial sentence, the district judge imposed a term of 151 months'\n\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\fimprisonment, longer than the 121-month term imposed on each of co-\n\ndefendants Soto and Cruz.         But Villarman cannot complain on that\n\nground, because a court cannot depart from the U.S.S.G. just to\n\ncorrect an asserted disparity in the sentencing of co-conspirators\n\n(Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 150).\n\n           In    this   case    Villarman's      U.S.S.G.    calculation   was\n\npredicated on a very different situation from that of his co-\n\ndefendants.      Both Soto and Cruz pleaded guilty and otherwise\n\nqualified for a three level reduction in their offense levels under\n\nU.S.S.G.   §3E1.1.      By     contrast,   the    district    court    properly\n\ndetermined that Villarman was not entitled to a like reduction for\n\nacceptance of responsibility. And relatedly (for the U.S.S.G. teach\n\na customary linkage between these factors, see U.S.S.G. §3E1.1's\n\ncmt. 4), we have already upheld the district court's appraisal of\n\nVillarman's testimony as justifying an enhancement for obstruction\n\nof justice.     In sum, the asserted disparity in sentencing vanishes\n\nbecause it was entirely the product of appropriate applications of\n\nthe U.S.S.G.\n\n                         Apprendi Considerations\n\n           Villarman's penultimate objections stem from his counsel's\n\nview of the fallout from the Supreme Court's decision in              Apprendi.\n\nNeither of those objections withstands analysis.\n\n           For one thing, Villarman contends that clear error was\n\ninvolved in sentencing Villarman without having the jury specify the\n\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\ftype and quantity of drug, the enhancement for obstruction of\n\njustice and Villarman's role in the offense.        Villarman seeks to\n\ninvoke Apprendi to urge that those factors must be determined by a\n\njury and not by the sentencing judge.\n\n          Apprendi's applicability as a question of law is reviewed\n\nde novo (United States v. Chemetco, Inc., 274 F.3d 1154, 1158 (7th\n\nCir. 2001); United States v. Candelario, 240 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th\n\nCir. 2000)).   This Circuit has already addressed and rejected this\n\nfirst Apprendi argument in United States v. Collazo-Aponte, 281 F.3d\n\n320, 324 (1st Cir. 2002)(citations and quotation marks omitted):\n\n     We have consistently held that the Apprendi doctrine does\n     not apply to defendants who are sentenced to terms less\n     than the otherwise applicable statutory maximum. Most\n     succinctly, Apprendi does not require that all sentencing\n     factors be submitted to the jury and proven beyond a\n     reasonable doubt, rather only those that increase the\n     penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\n     maximum.\n\n          In   this   instance   the    combined   effect   of   Sections\n\n841(a)(1), 841 (b)(1)(C) and 846 is that Villarman's adjudicated\n\nguilt of a conspiracy to distribute heroin sets a maximum statutory\n\npenalty of 20 years' imprisonment (it will be recalled that the\n\njury's special verdict found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nof a drug conspiracy involving more than one kilogram of heroin).\n\nVillarman's actual custodial sentence of 151 months is more than\n\nseven years below the 20-year statutory maximum that would apply if\n\nthe jury had failed to identify any specific amount of heroin.\n\nEnough said.\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\f           Villarman's other Apprendi-premised argument is that his\n\nconviction should be vacated because the statute under which he was\n\nconvicted (Section 846), when combined with the sentencing factors\n\nunder Section 841, is unconstitutional in light of Apprendi.     But\n\nhere too this Circuit has found that same argument wanting, this\n\ntime in Collazo-Aponte, 281 F.3d at 325.    We adhere of course to\n\nthat decision.\n\n           Villarman concludes with the kitchen-sink contention that\n\nthe cumulative effect of the putative errors already discussed in\n\nthis opinion operated to violate his constitutional right to a fair\n\ntrial.    We have already shown that few of the matters to which\n\nVillarman points may fairly be labeled as errors--even harmless\n\nones.    And even as to those, the familiar teaching of Delaware v.\n\nVan Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 681 (1986) is that \"the Constitution\n\nentitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one.\"\n\nUnited States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1196 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\nconcluded a like review of a laundry list of purported trial court\n\nerrors with this explanation:\n\n     Of necessity, claims under the cumulative error doctrine\n     are sui generis. A reviewing tribunal must consider each\n     such claim against the background of the case as whole,\n     paying particular weight to factors such as the nature\n     and number of errors committed; their interrelationship,\n     if any, and combined effect; how the district court dealt\n     with the errors as they arose (including the efficacy--or\n     lack of efficacy--of any remedial efforts); and the\n     strength of the government's case.\n\n\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fWe have engaged in just such a review, and it mandates the denial\n\nof Villarman's claim of cumulative error as well.\n\n                           Conclusion\n\n    We AFFIRM Villarman's conviction and sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                              -33-\n\f",

On April 4 Villarman was arraigned, entered a not guilty plea and was ordered detained pending trial. That indictment was superseded on April 21, and again Villarman was arraigned and ordered detained without bail on April 29. On May 5 the grand jury returned a two-count second superseding indictment against Villarman and 23 co-defendants. Then on May 13 he was again arraigned, again pleaded not guilty and continued to be detained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 25 Villarman submitted an urgent motion requesting a de novo bail hearing.

Count One, the only count in which Villarman was named, charged:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From on or about March, 1998 up to and including the date of this indictment, in the District of Puerto Rico and within the jurisdiction of this Court, [named defendants including Villarman], the defendants herein, and others to the Grand Jury known and unknown, knowingly, willfully, intentionally and unlawfully did conspire, confederate, and agree with each other and with other persons to the Grand Jury known and unknown, to knowingly, intentionally, and unlawfully possess with intent to distribute and distribute:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. five (5) kilograms or more, the exact amount being unknown, of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, a Schedule II Narcotic Drug Controlled Substance;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. one (1) kilogram or more, the exact amount being unknown, of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of heroin, a Schedule I Controlled Substance; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. multi-pound quantities, the exact amount being unknown, of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana, a Schedule I Controlled substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All in violation of Title 21, <i>United States Code,</i> Section 846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman and other co-defendants then filed multiple motions to suppress evidence gathered from wiretaps or, in the alternative, for the conduct of a hearing under <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). Those motions call for backtracking somewhat in reviewing the chronology of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 1998, a wiretap application for cellular phones in Puerto Rico had been authorized by District Judge Daniel R. Dominguez of the District of Puerto Rico, based on the government's application and supporting affidavits. Information in the affidavits originated in a New York investigation into a drug conspiracy, which expanded to Puerto Rico when the government learned of telephone calls to New York narcotics distributors from a Puerto Rican cellular phone. In the wire-tap application the government cited telephone toll records, criminal history records of the targets, undercover purchases of heroin in New York, conversations from wiretaps established in New York and information that the cellular phones continued to be operational. In addition the government described how traditional investigative techniques would not be effective in investigating the drug conspiracy within Puerto Rico because the targets tended to be highly suspicious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 16, 2000 the district court found that there had been sufficient pre-wiretap investigation to justify denial of any suppression of the wiretap evidence. After describing some of that investigation, the district court found that the authorization of the wiretaps was reasonable because the nature of the conspiracy made it likely that routine investigatory techniques would fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that same opinion the district court also considered how Villarman's allegations of perjury in the government's affidavit in support of the wiretap could impact the motion to suppress the evidence. According to Villarman, the affidavits had failed to disclose that the government had a confidential informant who was being debriefed by the government and had provided much of the information for the wiretap application. In addition, Villarman contended that the government should have informed issuing Judge Dominguez about testimony in front of another judge, Judge Aracelia Acevedo of the Puerto Rico Commonwealth Municipal Court. Two Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") Special Agents, Julie de Mello (\"de Mello\") and Iv&#225;n Rios Grajales (\"Grajales\"), had given oral testimony under oath in connection with their request for an arrest warrant against two co-defendants in this case, Carlos Soto del Valle (\"Soto\") and Joaqu&#237;n Cruz Jim&#233;nez (\"Cruz\"). De Mello and Grajales did not advise Judge Acevedo that they were conducting a federal investigation and that they had wiretap communications. Villarman cites Judge Acevedo's affidavit (describing how agents testified that they had received information about Soto's and Cruz' activities from a confidential informant) as evidence of perjury in the affidavit for the wiretap application, which declared there was no confidential informant who could assist in the investigation of the Puerto Rico conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding that the alleged perjury was simply a misunderstanding by the state judge of the agents' use of the Spanish term \"confidencia\" (meaning only \"confidential information,\" not a nonexistent Puerto-Rico-based confidential informant), a misunderstanding that was the product of a federal gag order forbidding reference to the wiretap (which had indeed provided the \"confidential information\"), the district court held that no illegal activity had occurred. Villarman's request for a <i>Franks</i> hearing to review the sufficiency of the evidence was also denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 10, 2000 the United States informed Villarman that it anticipated calling DEA Special Agent Reinaldo L&#243;pez (\"L&#243;pez\") to testify about factual matters and maybe as an expert witness. Villarman was also informed about L&#243;pez' background and experience, as well as the general context of his testimony. On October 12 Villarman submitted a motion to strike expert testimony, to which the government responded on October 13 and 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 15, 2000 the case against Villarman began, and the jury trial lasted nearly two weeks. During the trial the government presented its case through numerous witnesses, including L&#243;pez and cooperating witness Isaias Valerio (\"Valerio\"), as well as 16 intercepted phone calls that involved Villarman talking (1) to co-defendants Cruz and Soto (both individually and together) and (2) to cooperating witness Valerio, using one of co-defendant Soto's cellular phones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez presented testimony about general narcotics activities in Puerto Rico as well as interpreting coded language in the intercepted telephone calls. L&#243;pez had listened to over 5000 intercepted calls during the course of this investigation, as well as having many years of experience and training in narcotics investigations. Villarman made motions and interposed contemporaneous objections asking that L&#243;pez not be allowed to testify as to the content of the taped conversations because he was not certified as an expert, nor had he been a participant in the conversations. Finding that L&#243;pez was testifying to his personal experiences in listening to the tapes, the district court ruled that the testimony should be considered lay opinion testimony under Fed.R.Evid. (\"Evid.Rule\") 701, not expert testimony governed by Evid. Rule 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of the trial, cooperating witness Valerio testified for the government about his relationship with Villarman and their narcotics distribution activity. Valerio discussed how he and Villarman had transported 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine from Puerto Rico to New York between 1998 and 1999. Valerio also testified about how he and Villarman used coded words to discuss narcotics and also analyzed a taped conversation in which he and Villarman spoke about several kilograms of cocaine that had gotten wet. Valerio also discussed taped conversations between Villarman and other co-defendants in which wet cocaine was discussed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial Villarman moved for a mistrial, arguing that Valerio's testimony about the 300 to 350 kilogram cocaine transaction violated Evid. Rule 404(b). In denying the motion, the district court determined that the conduct formed part of the charged conspiracy and was therefore not Evid. Rule 404(b) material. Villarman later moved pursuant to Fed. R. Crim P. (\"Crim.Rule\") 29 for a judgment of acquittal, which the district court also denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman testified at trial over a span of three days. Villarman admitted that it was his voice in the taped conversations and that he had spoken to co-defendants Soto and Cruz about obtaining cocaine for them. He also admitted to using coded terms to discuss drug transactions, but he denied that he ever really agreed or intended to provide narcotics. After his testimony Villarman again unsuccessfully argued for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 27, 2000 the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to Villarman with respect to Count One of the third superseding indictment. By a special jury verdict, the jury found Villarman guilty of conspiracy to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin, but it found that he had not engaged in a conspiracy to distribute any amounts of cocaine or marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 2001 the Presentence Investigative Report (\"PSI\") was released. Under Sentencing Guideline (\"U.S.S.G.\") &#167; 2D1.1 the PSI recommended a base offense level of 32, then added a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, for a total offense level of 34. No recommendation for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was included. Both the United States and Villarman submitted motions objecting to the PSI, with Villarman's objections including (1) a request for a downward departure for his allegedly minor role in the conspiracy, (2) a dispute over discrepancies between the amount of heroin found by the special jury verdict and the testimony presented at trial, (3) a complaint about the failure to acknowledge Villarman's acceptance of responsibility and (4) an objection to the inclusion of a sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice. Villarman also asked that the Court apply the holding in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) to the indictment and the special jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 2001 the district court adopted the factual findings of the PSI, determined a total offense level of 34 and sentenced Villarman to imprisonment for 151 months, followed by a five-year term of supervised release. Villarman filed motions for new trial and judgment of acquittal under Crim. Rule 29 on the same day, and on July 20 he filed a notice of appeal. On August 27 the district court denied Villarman's motions, and on October 18 Villarman submitted an urgent motion for new trial that was again denied by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn then to Villarman's numerous issues on appeal. Some merit only short shrift, while others call for more extended treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Denial of Bail Pending Trial</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman claims that the district court erred in denying him pretrial bail. We ordinarily apply an \"independent review, tempered by a degree of deference to the determinations made below\" to the district court's pretrial detention order under Section 3145 (<i>United States v. Tortora,</i> 922 F.2d 880, 882-83 (1st Cir.1990)). But because <i>Murphy v. Hunt,</i> 455 U.S. 478, 481-84, 102 S.Ct. 1181, 71 L.Ed.2d 353 (1982)(per curiam) teaches that a defendant's claim to pretrial bail becomes moot once he is convicted, Villarman's like claim is moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Title III Wiretaps</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress all conversations obtained by Title III wiretaps and in refusing to conduct a <i>Franks</i> evidentiary hearing before it denied that motion. Villarman relies on what he describes as \"perjured statements, omissions, factual inadequacies and misrepresentations by the government in the applications for the original electronic surveillance and its extensions.\" Villarman claims (1) that it was unnecessary to have a wiretap because of the availability of less intrusive techniques and (2) that the affidavit in support of the wiretap was tainted by misleading and false statements and material omissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first issue Villarman disputes that the government provided \"a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous\" (\"Title III,\" Section 2518(1)(c)). We have interpreted that provision to mean that the statement should demonstrate that the government has made \"a reasonable, good faith effort to run the gamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls\" (<i>United States v. Hoffman,</i> 832 F.2d 1299, 1306-07 (1st Cir.1987)). Before granting a wiretap authorization the issuing court \"must satisfy itself that the government has used normal techniques but it has encountered difficulties in penetrating a criminal enterprise or in gathering evidence &#8212; to the point where (given the statutory preference for less intrusive techniques) wiretapping becomes reasonable\" (<i>United States v. Abou-Saada,</i> 785 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir.1986)). It is not necessary, though, to show that other methods have been entirely unsuccessful (<i>id.</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions to grant wiretap orders are subject to review in two different contexts. First the trial judge may consider a motion to suppress the evidence gathered by the wiretap that the issuing judge authorized, while later an appellate court may review the trial judge's suppression ruling (<i>see United States v. Ashley,</i> 876 F.2d 1069, 1074 (1st Cir.1989), most recently followed in <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> 319 F.3d 12, 32 (1st Cir. 2002)). In both instances the reviewing court examines the face of the affidavit and \"decide[s] if the facts set forth in the application were minimally adequate to support the determination that was made\" (<i>Ashley,</i> 876 F.2d at 1074).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the affidavit provided to issuing Judge Dominguez contained a detailed description of the evidence the investigation had collected to date, including telephone toll records, background and criminal history of targets, undercover purchases of heroin in New York, telephone conversations from wiretaps in New York and information from the Puerto Rico telephone company that the telephones were operational. In addition, the affidavit explained why the continued use of traditional investigative techniques (such as confidential sources, grand jury subpoenas, search warrants, surveillance and consensual monitoring) would be ineffective in uncovering the full scope of the potential crimes under investigation, as well as the identities of those responsible for the unlawful manufacture, possession, sale and distribution of narcotics in Puerto Rico. And the affidavit also included a description of the investigation's goal of obtaining evidence of the totality of offenses in which the targets of the investigation were involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against all of that, Villarman claims that the government had failed to investigate thoroughly in Puerto Rico, so there were other methods of investigation that should have been pursued before resorting to the wiretap under Section 2518(1)(c). Moreover, he plumps for suppression because of nondisclosure to the issuing judge about how far the New York investigation had proceeded and about the fact that a confidential informant was the source of much of the information presented in the application. According to Villarman, if the issuing judge had been told how far the government had progressed without the wiretap, he would not have given his approval for the wiretap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title III does require that the affidavit show why wiretapping is necessary in place of less intrusive investigative techniques. From the facts provided to him in the affidavit, the district court here found that normal investigative techniques had been tried in Puerto Rico, but had failed. Separate electronic surveillance had been authorized by a New York court and had resulted in traced calls to and from three telephones owned by a co-defendant. Additionally, another co-defendant was under physical surveillance in Puerto Rico, and agents had attempted surveillance in the vicinity of the homes of two co-defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the affidavit, the surveillance and other techniques failed because the co-defendants were very suspicious of potential surveillance and the surveillance would be easily detected in the co-defendants' neighborhood. Moreover, such typical investigatory methods as grand jury subpoenas, search warrants and pen registers were insufficient to gather information without alerting the co-conspirators to the surveillance and potential criminal liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the affidavit also asserted an inability to infiltrate the drug trafficking organization because there were no confidential informants who had knowledge of the organization or who could introduce agents to members of the organization. Even though a New York confidential informant had enabled the agents to identify some of the main co-conspirators, that informant lacked sufficient contacts to develop information about the structure of the organization in Puerto Rico. Moreover, the lack of a confidential source in Puerto Rico made it difficult to establish consensual monitoring. In light of that detailed explanation, the affidavit's discussion of alternate methods plainly does not fall below the standard of adequacy for a wiretap (<i>see United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2002)). With the government still unaware of the identity of many of the conspiracy's members as well as the organizational structure of the conspiracy, the district court could permissibly allow the government to employ electronic surveillance to uncover the complete range of operations of the target conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman seeks to undercut that conclusion by also arguing that the affidavit was tainted by misleading and false statements and material omissions in violation of the government's responsibility under Section 2518(1)(c). Villarman claims that those omissions amount to perjury, especially in the area of whether or not the government had a confidential informant in Puerto Rico able to assist in investigating the drug conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not lengthen this opinion by addressing Villarman's numerous theories of how the government assertedly failed to make a complete and honest statement of facts. We have examined them carefully just as the district judge did (<i>United States v. Soto-Del Valle,</i> 102 F.Supp.2d 57 (D.P.R.2000)), and we too find them without merit. Moreover, they are totally inadequate to have required a <i>Franks</i> hearing under the standards we have announced in such cases as <i>United States v. Alicea,</i> 205 F.3d 480, 487 (1st Cir.2000) and <i>United States v. Adams,</i> 305 F.3d 30, 36 n. 1 (1st Cir.2002). It is an understatement to say that the district court's rejection of the need for a <i>Franks</i> hearing was not clearly erroneous, the standard announced in such cases as <i>United States v. Ranney,</i> 298 F.3d 74, 77-78 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the district court's allowance of the Title III wiretaps was entirely proper. We turn to Villarman's other arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Evid. Rule 404(b)</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's admission of evidence that is allegedly Evid. Rule 404(b) material under an abuse of discretion standard (<i>United States v. Manning,</i> 79 F.3d 212, 217-18 (1st Cir.1996)). Because here the challenged evidence is not of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" (the language of the Rule), but is rather intrinsic to the crime charged in the indictment (<i>id.</i> at 218), the standard of review becomes irrelevant: Evid. Rule 404(b) is really not implicated at all (<i>United States v. Shea,</i> 159 F.3d 37, 39 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus Villarman complains of the testimony of cooperating witness Valerio about his alleged involvement with Villarman in several cocaine distribution transactions involving 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine between 1998 and 1999. Although other evidence at trial as well as the eventual verdict against Villarman focused on heroin transactions, the district court found that the evidence as to cocaine was not Evid. Rule 404(b) material because it formed part of the charged indictment, in addition to which there was no contemporaneous objection by Villarman's counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count One, on which Villarman was convicted, charged him and his co-defendants with conspiracy to distribute and possess cocaine, heroin and marijuana from on or about March 1998 up to and including the date of the third superseding indictment (April 18, 2000). In addition to the challenged testimony, the jury heard taped conversations in which Valerio and Villarman discussed still another cocaine transaction. We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in finding that Valerio's testimony at issue was direct evidence of the conspiracy charged, rather than evidence of other bad acts subject to Evid. Rule 404(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman also argues that the \"District Court failed to carefully balance the probative value, if any of the proffered testimony\" under Evid. Rule 403. But \"[b]alancing these concerns lies within the broad discretion of the trial Judge and will only be reversed upon a showing that the Judge abused his discretion\" (<i>United States v. Andiarena,</i> 823 F.2d 673, 677-78 (1st Cir.1987)). Again no abuse of discretion has been shown here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Single Conspiracy v. Multiple Conspiracies</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman also complains that a variance exists between the single conspiracy charged and multiple conspiracies presented at trial. That poses the issue succinctly described in <i>United States v. Escobar-de Jesus,</i> 187 F.3d 148, 172 (1st Cir.1999):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A variance arises when the proof at trial depicts a scenario that differs materially from the scenario limned in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a variance requires reversal only if it \"is both material and prejudicial, for example, if the variance works a substantial interference with the defendant's right to be informed of the charges laid at his doorstep\" (<i>id.</i>). Here Villarman argues that even though the indictment charged only a single conspiracy, the proofs at trial focused on multiple conspiracies that were different with respect to the co-conspirators, the time frame of alleged activity and the transactions themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That issue of single conspiracy v. multiple conspiracies is a question of fact for the jury (<i>United States v. LiCausi,</i> 167 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir.1999)). As <i>United States v. Portela,</i> 167 F.3d 687, 696 (1st Cir.1999) has reiterated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question whether a given body of evidence is indicative of a single conspiracy, multiple conspiracies, or no conspiracy at all is ordinarily a matter of fact; a jury's determination in that regard is subject to review only for evidentiary sufficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout trial the government presented evidence supporting the theory of a single conspiracy as described in the indictment. There were telephone calls between Villarman and co-defendants Soto and Cruz discussing both heroin and cocaine transactions. Valerio also explained a drug transaction that he had discussed with Villarman, once when Villarman was using co-defendant Soto's cellular phone. Villarman himself testified at trial and admitted that he spoke to co-defendants Soto and Cruz about providing cocaine, occasionally in coded language. All of that evidence would suffice for a jury determination that Villarman was involved in a single conspiracy, including among its members Valerio and co-defendants Soto and Cruz, to distribute narcotics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, even if there had been a variance (as there was not), Villarman would still have to show that it had produced unfair prejudice and that it was not \"harmless error\" (<i>United States v. Candelaria-Silva,</i> 166 F.3d 19, 39 (1st Cir.1999)). Because the jury found Villarman guilty only of heroin involvement and not of cocaine dealing, it apparently did not rely on Valerio's testimony as to 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine, looking instead to the tape-recorded conversations of Villarman discussing heroin transactions. So even at worst, Villarman's contention of a variance would constitute harmless error and would thus be insufficient to warrant reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Testimony by Special Agent L&#243;pez</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next Villarman argues that the district court erred in allowing Special Agent L&#243;pez to provide expert testimony without prior notice, assertedly depriving Villarman of the opportunity to retain his own experts to refute the testimony. Looking to Evid. Rule 701 as the predicate for doing so, the district court allowed L&#243;pez to testify about the conspirators' use of coded terms to denote drugs and about the meaning of those terms. Then Villarman, electing to testify during the week following L&#243;pez' testimony, took that opportunity by acknowledging the use of code words but by stating that \"bread\" denoted cocaine and not (as L&#243;pez had testified) heroin. That of course presented a classic occasion for the jury's determination of credibility, which the jury permissibly resolved when it found Villarman guilty of participation in a heroin conspiracy but not a cocaine conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances here, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the district court was or was not right in characterizing L&#243;pez' testimony as lay testimony under Evid. Rule 701 rather than as expert testimony under Evid. Rule 702 (in the latter respect, see, e.g., <i>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael,</i> 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999) and the implementing December 1, 2000 amendments to Evid. Rules 701 and 702). That is so because L&#243;pez was clearly qualified by experience and the \"specialized knowledge\" that he had acquired over the years to opine on the meaning of the code words that had admittedly been used by Villarman and others (see, e.g., <i>United States v. Tejada,</i> 886 F.2d 483, 485-86 (1st Cir. 1989)), and because the government's October 11, 2000 discovery letter gave ample notice of that specialized knowledge to Villarman. In short, Villarman loses this argument too.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Brady, Giglio and the Jencks Act</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman further charges that the district court erred in allowing Valerio to testify because the government assertedly did not comply with its discovery obligations. According to Villarman, the government's asserted failures to disclose (1) Valerio's identity as a witness, (2) his plea and cooperation agreement, (3) reports of his debriefings, (4) his criminal history and (5) any other impeachment material violated <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), <i>Giglio v. United States,</i> 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) and Section 3500 (the Jencks Act). Villarman claims that he was deprived of the opportunity to use the withheld evidence (a) to conduct investigation and obtain further discovery, (b) to aid adequately in the formulation of his defense and (c) to impeach the witnesses against him during trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to those claims, the issue is one of assertedly delayed disclosure rather than nondisclosure. Villarman received a copy of Valerio's plea and cooperation agreement, with nonmaterial redactions, four days before trial. And for <i>Brady-Giglio</i> purposes, <i>United States v. Catano,</i> 65 F.3d 219, 227 (1st Cir.1995) teaches the application of an abuse of discretion standard, for purposes of which <i>Catano, id.</i> repeats \"the test is whether defendant's counsel was prevented by the delay from using the disclosed material effectively in preparing and presenting the defendant's case.\" Relatedly, Congress has prescribed the defendant's ability to conduct effective cross-examination as the Jencks Act standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here Villarman did employ the relevant material &#8212; whether assertedly exculpatory as to Villarman or impeaching as to Valerio or both &#8212; during the Valerio cross-examination (as was done in <i>United States v. Valencia-Lucena,</i> 925 F.2d 506, 514 (1st Cir.1991)). And as to the claimed inadequacy of that use, another branch of Villarman's complaints, he has not pointed credibly to specific objections that he might have lodged (but let pass), or to particular arguments that he might have advanced (but did not), if he had received the information earlier. As <i>United States v. Devin,</i> 918 F.2d 280, 290 (1st Cir.1990) says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant who claims that his hand was prematurely forced by delayed disclosure cannot rely on wholly conclusory assertions but must bear the burden of producing, at the very least, a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> showing of a plausible strategic option which the delay foreclosed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, no better demonstration of the adequacy of the use of the material provided to Villarman could be made than the actual result at trial: Valerio testified only about cocaine transactions with Villarman, and by special verdict the jury found Villarman not guilty of cocaine distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Right of Confrontation</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again dwelling on the Valerio testimony, Villarman claims that the district court prevented him, in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights, from cross-examining Valerio effectively. Although that added contention could also be dispatched swiftly in terms of the result reached at the end of the preceding section, Villarman also loses that claim analytically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confrontation Clause challenges are reviewed de novo to determine whether defense counsel was afforded a reasonable opportunity to impeach adverse witnesses. But when that threshold is reached, any constraints imposed by the trial court on the extent and manner of cross-examination are reviewed only for abuse of discretion (<i>United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,</i> 219 F.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir. 2000)). On that score <i>Stephens v. Hall,</i> 294 F.3d 210, 226 (1st Cir.2002) (citations and quotation marks omitted, emphasis in original) sets forth the relevant standard:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to safeguard the defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause, we have held that the trial judge may not so restrict cross-examination as to deprive the defendant of the constitutionally required threshold level of inquiry, and must give the accused sufficient leeway to establish a reasonably complete picture of the witness's veracity, bias, and motivation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Confrontation Clause guarantees an <i>opportunity</i> for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance the district court curbed Villarman's cross-examination of Valerio as inappropriate on just three occasions: (1) when Villarman attempted to use a version of facts attached to Valerio's plea and cooperation agreement when that guilty plea was unrelated to this case, (2) when Villarman accused Valerio of violating his cooperation agreement by allegedly soliciting information from other defendants and (3) when Villarman asked Valerio about his citizenship and place of birth. Before us Villarman has failed to address any of those instances, but in any event our reading of the trial transcript discloses that the district court did not abuse its discretion in any of those respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead Villarman simply repeats his nondisclosure (or delayed disclosure) contention that we have just rejected in terms of <i>Brady-Giglio</i> and the Jencks Act, attempting to transmute that into a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses. Because the argument does not gain force either through repetition or by wrapping it in a new garment, we reject it again for the same reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Motion for Mistrial</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In still another effort to ring changes on the same bells of Valerio's testimony, Villarman urges that allowing that witness to testify about 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine deprived Villarman of an opportunity to investigate the veracity and nature of &#8212; and thus to defend against &#8212; that testimony, so that a mistrial should be declared for the asserted violation of Evid. Rule 404(b). Any refusal to declare a mistrial is measured against a manifest abuse of discretion yardstick, so that we will uphold the court's ruling unless the movant demonstrates a clear showing of prejudice (<i>United States v. Rullan-Rivera,</i> 60 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1995)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have said earlier on the subject of Evid. Rule 404(b) defeats Villarman on this score as well. Every step in that analysis applies here with equal force, and the standard of review here is even more demanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Motion for New Trial</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal next with Villarman's assertion that the district court erred in denying his motion for new trial because the evidence presented at trial by the government did not justify the jury's special verdict finding him responsible for more than one kilogram of heroin. That decision is reviewed in manifest-abuse-of-discretion terms (<i>United States v. Rodriguez-DeJesus,</i> 202 F.3d 482, 485 (1st Cir.2000)) in light of Crim. Rule 33, which authorizes the grant of a new trial if required in the interests of justice and \"where the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict\" (<i>United States v. Andrade,</i> 94 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial Special Agent L&#243;pez testified about two specific transactions, each involving one-eighth kilogram of heroin. As Villarman would have it, the jury could look only to that evidence and therefore convict him for no more than that quantity. But that contention glosses over the fact that L&#243;pez also testified about another attempted transaction that involved two kilograms of heroin (with the drug reference sought to be disguised by the use of coded words). Because that evidence too could be credited by the jury to support its special verdict of more than one kilogram of heroin, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Villarman's Crim. Rule 33 motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman next argues that the district court erred in denying his Crim. Rule 29 motion for a new trial because the evidence did not support the special verdict in which the jury found him guilty of conspiracy with intent to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin. Denial of a Crim. Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal is reviewed de novo, and we will affirm Villarman's conviction if after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, \"any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\" (<i>United States v. Donnat,</i> 311 F.3d 99, 103 (1st Cir.2002)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have just said in the preceding section, L&#243;pez testified about transactions totaling 2-2/8 kilograms of heroin. All credibility determinations are left for resolution by the jury for Crim. Rule 29 purposes (<i>United States v. Hernandez,</i> 146 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir.1998)). And that scotches Villarman's claim to a judgment of acquittal for any asserted insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Calculation of Drug Quantity for Sentencing Purposes</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as the jury's determination of the quantity of heroin involved has withstood attack, so too does the district judge's sentencing determination of Villarman's U.S.S.G. base offense level as 34. U.S.S.G. findings of the sentencing court are overturned only for clear error (<i>United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez,</i> 922 F.2d 33, 37 (1st Cir.1990)), and that cannot be said as to the offense level in this case, based as it was on at least one but not more than three kilograms of heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Other Sentencing Issues</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman advances three other sentencing issues: (1) that the district court erred in granting a two-level increase under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice because, he says, there was no specific reliable evidence that Villarman gave material false testimony at trial; (2) that the district court erred in not granting his motion for a two-level downward departure based on his minor role in the conspiracy; and (3) that the district court engaged in a lack of parity in sentencing Villarman to a longer term than other co-defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We deal with those contentions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first of those issues, whether Villarman's conduct is within the scope of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 is subject to de novo review, but fact-bound determinations are reviewed for clear error (<i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 86 F.3d 263, 263 (1st Cir.1996)(per curiam)). In the latter respect, if the record supports at least two permissible inferences, the factfinder's choice between or among them cannot be clearly erroneous (<i>United States v. Veilleux,</i> 949 F.2d 522, 525 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 requires the imposition of a two-level increase in offense level if a defendant \"willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of [an] offense.\" For a defendant's perjury to support such an enhancement, he or she must have provided \"false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory\" (<i>United States v. Rowe,</i> 202 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir.2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Villarman acknowledged numerous telephone conversations with co-defendants about providing drugs, but he claimed that he never agreed to provide or intended to provide them with any type of drug. Instead Villarman said that he spoke with the co-defendants only because he was owed money and feared for his life. If that testimony had been believed, the jury would consequently have concluded that he did not intend to distribute drugs, rendering him guiltless of any conspiracy to distribute narcotics. In reaching the opposite conclusion as to his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt regarding a heroin conspiracy, the jury must perforce have determined that Villarman's testimony was false &#8212; not the product of mistake, confusion or faulty memory, but rather stemming from Villarman's desire to convince the jury of a fabricated theory to excuse himself from liability. In turn, the district court could not have been clearly erroneous in deciding that Villarman had provided materially false information, thus justifying the two-level increase for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Villarman's role in the conspiracy, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b)'s cmt. 5 identifies a minor participant as one \"who is less culpable than most other defendants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\" We will reverse a sentencing court's finding that a defendant is not a minor participant only if it is clearly erroneous (<i>United States v. Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d 146, 148-49 (1st Cir. 2000)), so that the defendant bears a substantial burden of proving entitlement to such a downward adjustment for his or her role in the offense (<i>id.</i> at 148). As <i>United States v. Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d 409, 460 (1st Cir.1994) has put it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court has broad discretion in determining whether this downward departure is appropriate and we will reverse only if the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the defendant played a part that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant such that the court's decision was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman fails that test. He discussed with his co-conspirators not only the sale of drugs but also the need to find people to transport those drugs. Importantly, Villarman also supplied co-defendant Cruz with heroin and expressed worry about the loss of two kilograms of heroin transported by the conspiracy. Even without regard to Valerio's testimony about Villarman's asserted role in transporting 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine, Villarman plainly has not shown clear error in the district court's determination that he was not a minor participant in the conspiracy to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally as to the comparative length of Villarman's custodial sentence, the district judge imposed a term of 151 months' imprisonment, longer than the 121-month term imposed on each of co-defendants Soto and Cruz. But Villarman cannot complain on that ground, because a court cannot depart from the U.S.S.G. just to correct an asserted disparity in the sentencing of co-conspirators (<i>Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d at 150).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case Villarman's U.S.S.G. calculation was predicated on a very different situation from that of his co-defendants. Both Soto and Cruz pleaded guilty and otherwise qualified for a three level reduction in their offense levels under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1. By contrast, the district court properly determined that Villarman was not entitled to a like reduction for acceptance of responsibility. And relatedly (for the U.S.S.G. teach a customary linkage between these factors, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1's cmt. 4), we have already upheld the district court's appraisal of Villarman's testimony as justifying an enhancement for obstruction of justice. In sum, the asserted disparity in sentencing vanishes because it was entirely the product of appropriate applications of the U.S.S.G.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Apprendi Considerations</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman's penultimate objections stem from his counsel's view of the fallout from the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Apprendi.</i> Neither of those objections withstands analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, Villarman contends that clear error was involved in sentencing Villarman without having the jury specify the type and quantity of drug, the enhancement for obstruction of justice and Villarman's role in the offense. Villarman seeks to invoke <i>Apprendi</i> to urge that those factors must be determined by a jury and not by the sentencing judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Apprendi's</i> applicability as a question of law is reviewed de novo (<i>United States v. Chemetco, Inc.,</i> 274 F.3d 1154, 1158 (7th Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Candelario,</i> 240 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir. 2001)). This Circuit has already addressed and rejected this first <i>Apprendi</i> argument in <i>United States v. Collazo-Aponte,</i> 281 F.3d 320, 324 (1st Cir.2002) (citations and quotation marks omitted):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have consistently held that the <i>Apprendi</i> doctrine does not apply to defendants who are sentenced to terms less than the otherwise applicable statutory maximum. Most succinctly, <i>Apprendi</i> does not require that all sentencing factors be submitted to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt, rather only those that increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance the combined effect of Sections 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C) and 846 is that Villarman's adjudicated guilt of a conspiracy to distribute heroin sets a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years' imprisonment (it will be recalled that the jury's special verdict found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of a drug conspiracy involving more than one kilogram of heroin). Villarman's actual custodial sentence of 151 months is more than seven years below the 20-year statutory maximum that would apply if the jury had failed to identify any specific amount of heroin. Enough said.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman's other <i>Apprendi</i>-premised argument is that his conviction should be vacated because the statute under which he was convicted (Section 846), when combined with the sentencing factors under Section 841, is unconstitutional in light of <i>Apprendi.</i> But here too this Circuit has found that same argument wanting, this time in <i>Collazo-Aponte,</i> 281 F.3d at 325. We adhere of course to that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman concludes with the kitchen-sink contention that the cumulative effect of the putative errors already discussed in this opinion operated to violate his constitutional right to a fair trial. We have already shown that few of the matters to which Villarman points may fairly be labeled as errors &#8212; even harmless ones. And even as to those, the familiar teaching of <i>Delaware v. Van Arsdall,</i> 475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) is that \"the Constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one.\" <i>United States v.

Those motions call for backtracking somewhat in reviewing the chronology of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 1998, a wiretap application for cellular phones in Puerto Rico had been authorized by District Judge Daniel R. Dominguez of the District of Puerto Rico, based on the government's application and supporting affidavits. Information in the affidavits originated in a New York investigation into a drug conspiracy, which expanded to Puerto Rico when the government learned of telephone calls to New York narcotics distributors from a Puerto Rican cellular phone. In the wire-tap application the government cited telephone toll records, criminal history records of the targets, undercover purchases of heroin in New York, conversations from wiretaps established in New York and information that the cellular phones continued to be operational. In addition the government described how traditional investigative techniques would not be effective in investigating the drug conspiracy within Puerto Rico because the targets tended to be highly suspicious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 16, 2000 the district court found that there had been sufficient pre-wiretap investigation to justify denial of any suppression of the wiretap evidence. After describing some of that investigation, the district court found that the authorization of the wiretaps was reasonable because the nature of the conspiracy made it likely that routine investigatory techniques would fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that same opinion the district court also considered how Villarman's allegations of perjury in the government's affidavit in support of the wiretap could impact the motion to suppress the evidence. According to Villarman, the affidavits had failed to disclose that the government had a confidential informant who was being debriefed by the government and had provided much of the information for the wiretap application. In addition, Villarman contended that the government should have informed issuing Judge Dominguez about testimony in front of another judge, Judge Aracelia Acevedo of the Puerto Rico Commonwealth Municipal Court. Two Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") Special Agents, Julie de Mello (\"de Mello\") and Iv&#225;n Rios Grajales (\"Grajales\"), had given oral testimony under oath in connection with their request for an arrest warrant against two co-defendants in this case, Carlos Soto del Valle (\"Soto\") and Joaqu&#237;n Cruz Jim&#233;nez (\"Cruz\"). De Mello and Grajales did not advise Judge Acevedo that they were conducting a federal investigation and that they had wiretap communications. Villarman cites Judge Acevedo's affidavit (describing how agents testified that they had received information about Soto's and Cruz' activities from a confidential informant) as evidence of perjury in the affidavit for the wiretap application, which declared there was no confidential informant who could assist in the investigation of the Puerto Rico conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding that the alleged perjury was simply a misunderstanding by the state judge of the agents' use of the Spanish term \"confidencia\" (meaning only \"confidential information,\" not a nonexistent Puerto-Rico-based confidential informant), a misunderstanding that was the product of a federal gag order forbidding reference to the wiretap (which had indeed provided the \"confidential information\"), the district court held that no illegal activity had occurred. Villarman's request for a <i>Franks</i> hearing to review the sufficiency of the evidence was also denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 10, 2000 the United States informed Villarman that it anticipated calling DEA Special Agent Reinaldo L&#243;pez (\"L&#243;pez\") to testify about factual matters and maybe as an expert witness. Villarman was also informed about L&#243;pez' background and experience, as well as the general context of his testimony. On October 12 Villarman submitted a motion to strike expert testimony, to which the government responded on October 13 and 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 15, 2000 the case against Villarman began, and the jury trial lasted nearly two weeks. During the trial the government presented its case through numerous witnesses, including L&#243;pez and cooperating witness Isaias Valerio (\"Valerio\"), as well as 16 intercepted phone calls that involved Villarman talking (1) to co-defendants Cruz and Soto (both individually and together) and (2) to cooperating witness Valerio, using one of co-defendant Soto's cellular phones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L&#243;pez presented testimony about general narcotics activities in Puerto Rico as well as interpreting coded language in the intercepted telephone calls. L&#243;pez had listened to over 5000 intercepted calls during the course of this investigation, as well as having many years of experience and training in narcotics investigations. Villarman made motions and interposed contemporaneous objections asking that L&#243;pez not be allowed to testify as to the content of the taped conversations because he was not certified as an expert, nor had he been a participant in the conversations. Finding that L&#243;pez was testifying to his personal experiences in listening to the tapes, the district court ruled that the testimony should be considered lay opinion testimony under Fed.R.Evid. (\"Evid.Rule\") 701, not expert testimony governed by Evid. Rule 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of the trial, cooperating witness Valerio testified for the government about his relationship with Villarman and their narcotics distribution activity. Valerio discussed how he and Villarman had transported 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine from Puerto Rico to New York between 1998 and 1999. Valerio also testified about how he and Villarman used coded words to discuss narcotics and also analyzed a taped conversation in which he and Villarman spoke about several kilograms of cocaine that had gotten wet. Valerio also discussed taped conversations between Villarman and other co-defendants in which wet cocaine was discussed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial Villarman moved for a mistrial, arguing that Valerio's testimony about the 300 to 350 kilogram cocaine transaction violated Evid. Rule 404(b). In denying the motion, the district court determined that the conduct formed part of the charged conspiracy and was therefore not Evid. Rule 404(b) material. Villarman later moved pursuant to Fed. R. Crim P.

Villarman relies on what he describes as \"perjured statements, omissions, factual inadequacies and misrepresentations by the government in the applications for the original electronic surveillance and its extensions.\" Villarman claims (1) that it was unnecessary to have a wiretap because of the availability of less intrusive techniques and (2) that the affidavit in support of the wiretap was tainted by misleading and false statements and material omissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first issue Villarman disputes that the government provided \"a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous\" (\"Title III,\" Section 2518(1)(c)). We have interpreted that provision to mean that the statement should demonstrate that the government has made \"a reasonable, good faith effort to run the gamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls\" (<i>United States v. Hoffman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496986\"><a href=\"/opinion/496986/united-states-v-barry-hoffman/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1306-07 (1st Cir.1987)). Before granting a wiretap authorization the issuing court \"must satisfy itself that the government has used normal techniques but it has encountered difficulties in penetrating a criminal enterprise or in gathering evidence &#8212; to the point where (given the statutory preference for less intrusive techniques) wiretapping becomes reasonable\" (<i>United States v. Abou-Saada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465443\"><a href=\"/opinion/465443/united-states-v-assada-abou-saada-united-states-of-america-v-milad-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1986)). It is not necessary, though, to show that other methods have been entirely unsuccessful (<i>id.</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions to grant wiretap orders are subject to review in two different contexts. First the trial judge may consider a motion to suppress the evidence gathered by the wiretap that the issuing judge authorized, while later an appellate court may review the trial judge's suppression ruling (<i>see United States v. Ashley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524627\"><a href=\"/opinion/524627/united-states-v-melvin-ashley/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1069</span></a></span>, 1074 (1st Cir.1989), most recently followed in <i>United States v.

In both instances the reviewing court examines the face of the affidavit and \"decide[s] if the facts set forth in the application were minimally adequate to support the determination that was made\" (<i>Ashley,</i> 876 F.2d at 1074).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the affidavit provided to issuing Judge Dominguez contained a detailed description of the evidence the investigation had collected to date, including telephone toll records, background and criminal history of targets, undercover purchases of heroin in New York, telephone conversations from wiretaps in New York and information from the Puerto Rico telephone company that the telephones were operational. In addition, the affidavit explained why the continued use of traditional investigative techniques (such as confidential sources, grand jury subpoenas, search warrants, surveillance and consensual monitoring) would be ineffective in uncovering the full scope of the potential crimes under investigation, as well as the identities of those responsible for the unlawful manufacture, possession, sale and distribution of narcotics in Puerto Rico. And the affidavit also included a description of the investigation's goal of obtaining evidence of the totality of offenses in which the targets of the investigation were involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against all of that, Villarman claims that the government had failed to investigate thoroughly in Puerto Rico, so there were other methods of investigation that should have been pursued before resorting to the wiretap under Section 2518(1)(c). Moreover, he plumps for suppression because of nondisclosure to the issuing judge about how far the New York investigation had proceeded and about the fact that a confidential informant was the source of much of the information presented in the application. According to Villarman, if the issuing judge had been told how far the government had progressed without the wiretap, he would not have given his approval for the wiretap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title III does require that the affidavit show why wiretapping is necessary in place of less intrusive investigative techniques. From the facts provided to him in the affidavit, the district court here found that normal investigative techniques had been tried in Puerto Rico, but had failed. Separate electronic surveillance had been authorized by a New York court and had resulted in traced calls to and from three telephones owned by a co-defendant. Additionally, another co-defendant was under physical surveillance in Puerto Rico, and agents had attempted surveillance in the vicinity of the homes of two co-defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the affidavit, the surveillance and other techniques failed because the co-defendants were very suspicious of potential surveillance and the surveillance would be easily detected in the co-defendants' neighborhood. Moreover, such typical investigatory methods as grand jury subpoenas, search warrants and pen registers were insufficient to gather information without alerting the co-conspirators to the surveillance and potential criminal liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the affidavit also asserted an inability to infiltrate the drug trafficking organization because there were no confidential informants who had knowledge of the organization or who could introduce agents to members of the organization. Even though a New York confidential informant had enabled the agents to identify some of the main co-conspirators, that informant lacked sufficient contacts to develop information about the structure of the organization in Puerto Rico. Moreover, the lack of a confidential source in Puerto Rico made it difficult to establish consensual monitoring. In light of that detailed explanation, the affidavit's discussion of alternate methods plainly does not fall below the standard of adequacy for a wiretap (<i>see United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2002)). With the government still unaware of the identity of many of the conspiracy's members as well as the organizational structure of the conspiracy, the district court could permissibly allow the government to employ electronic surveillance to uncover the complete range of operations of the target conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman seeks to undercut that conclusion by also arguing that the affidavit was tainted by misleading and false statements and material omissions in violation of the government's responsibility under Section 2518(1)(c). Villarman claims that those omissions amount to perjury, especially in the area of whether or not the government had a confidential informant in Puerto Rico able to assist in investigating the drug conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not lengthen this opinion by addressing Villarman's numerous theories of how the government assertedly failed to make a complete and honest statement of facts. We have examined them carefully just as the district judge did (<i>United States v. Soto-Del Valle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419587\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419587/united-states-v-soto-del-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span> (D.P.R.2000)), and we too find them without merit. Moreover, they are totally inadequate to have required a <i>Franks</i> hearing under the standards we have announced in such cases as <i>United States v. Alicea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198845\"><a href=\"/opinion/198845/united-states-v-rivera-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 487 (1st Cir.2000) and <i>United States v.

It is an understatement to say that the district court's rejection of the need for a <i>Franks</i> hearing was not clearly erroneous, the standard announced in such cases as <i>United States v. Ranney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200051\"><a href=\"/opinion/200051/united-states-v-ranney/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 77-78 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the district court's allowance of the Title III wiretaps was entirely proper. We turn to Villarman's other arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Evid. Rule 404(b)</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's admission of evidence that is allegedly Evid.

Because here the challenged evidence is not of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" (the language of the Rule), but is rather intrinsic to the crime charged in the indictment (<i>id.</i> at 218), the standard of review becomes irrelevant: Evid. Rule 404(b) is really not implicated at all (<i>United States v. Shea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198187\"><a href=\"/opinion/198187/united-states-v-shea/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus Villarman complains of the testimony of cooperating witness Valerio about his alleged involvement with Villarman in several cocaine distribution transactions involving 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine between 1998 and 1999. Although other evidence at trial as well as the eventual verdict against Villarman focused on heroin transactions, the district court found that the evidence as to cocaine was not Evid. Rule 404(b) material because it formed part of the charged indictment, in addition to which there was no contemporaneous objection by Villarman's counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count One, on which Villarman was convicted, charged him and his co-defendants with conspiracy to distribute and possess cocaine, heroin and marijuana from on or about March 1998 up to and including the date of the third superseding indictment (April 18, 2000). In addition to the challenged testimony, the jury heard taped conversations in which Valerio and Villarman discussed still another cocaine transaction. We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in finding that Valerio's testimony at issue was direct evidence of the conspiracy charged, rather than evidence of other bad acts subject to Evid. Rule 404(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman also argues that the \"District Court failed to carefully balance the probative value, if any of the proffered testimony\" under Evid. Rule 403. But \"[b]alancing these concerns lies within the broad discretion of the trial Judge and will only be reversed upon a showing that the Judge abused his discretion\" (<i>United States v. Andiarena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491458\"><a href=\"/opinion/491458/united-states-v-oscar-andiarena/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span>, 677-78 (1st Cir.1987)).

Multiple Conspiracies</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman also complains that a variance exists between the single conspiracy charged and multiple conspiracies presented at trial. That poses the issue succinctly described in <i>United States v. Escobar-de Jesus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765611\"><a href=\"/opinion/765611/united-states-v-eusebio-escobar-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 172 (1st Cir.1999):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A variance arises when the proof at trial depicts a scenario that differs materially from the scenario limned in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a variance requires reversal only if it \"is both material and prejudicial, for example, if the variance works a substantial interference with the defendant's right to be informed of the charges laid at his doorstep\" (<i>id.</i>). Here Villarman argues that even though the indictment charged only a single conspiracy, the proofs at trial focused on multiple conspiracies that were different with respect to the co-conspirators, the time frame of alleged activity and the transactions themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That issue of single conspiracy v. multiple conspiracies is a question of fact for the jury (<i>United States v.

As <i>United States v.

There were telephone calls between Villarman and co-defendants Soto and Cruz discussing both heroin and cocaine transactions. Valerio also explained a drug transaction that he had discussed with Villarman, once when Villarman was using co-defendant Soto's cellular phone. Villarman himself testified at trial and admitted that he spoke to co-defendants Soto and Cruz about providing cocaine, occasionally in coded language. All of that evidence would suffice for a jury determination that Villarman was involved in a single conspiracy, including among its members Valerio and co-defendants Soto and Cruz, to distribute narcotics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, even if there had been a variance (as there was not), Villarman would still have to show that it had produced unfair prejudice and that it was not \"harmless error\" (<i>United States v. Candelaria-Silva,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198309\"><a href=\"/opinion/198309/united-states-v-candelaria-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.1999)). Because the jury found Villarman guilty only of heroin involvement and not of cocaine dealing, it apparently did not rely on Valerio's testimony as to 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine, looking instead to the tape-recorded conversations of Villarman discussing heroin transactions. So even at worst, Villarman's contention of a variance would constitute harmless error and would thus be insufficient to warrant reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Testimony by Special Agent L&#243;pez</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next Villarman argues that the district court erred in allowing Special Agent L&#243;pez to provide expert testimony without prior notice, assertedly depriving Villarman of the opportunity to retain his own experts to refute the testimony. Looking to Evid. Rule 701 as the predicate for doing so, the district court allowed L&#243;pez to testify about the conspirators' use of coded terms to denote drugs and about the meaning of those terms. Then Villarman, electing to testify during the week following L&#243;pez' testimony, took that opportunity by acknowledging the use of code words but by stating that \"bread\" denoted cocaine and not (as L&#243;pez had testified) heroin. That of course presented a classic occasion for the jury's determination of credibility, which the jury permissibly resolved when it found Villarman guilty of participation in a heroin conspiracy but not a cocaine conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances here, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the district court was or was not right in characterizing L&#243;pez' testimony as lay testimony under Evid. Rule 701 rather than as expert testimony under Evid. Rule 702 (in the latter respect, see, e.g., <i>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118271\"><a href=\"/opinion/118271/kumho-tire-co-v-carmichael/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118271\"><a href=\"/opinion/118271/kumho-tire-co-v-carmichael/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That is so because L&#243;pez was clearly qualified by experience and the \"specialized knowledge\" that he had acquired over the years to opine on the meaning of the code words that had admittedly been used by Villarman and others (see, e.g., <i>United States v. Tejada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529942\"><a href=\"/opinion/529942/united-states-v-alberto-tejada-united-states-of-america-v-juan-ignacio/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 485-86 (1st Cir. 1989)), and because the government's October 11, 2000 discovery letter gave ample notice of that specialized knowledge to Villarman.

Rule 404(b). Any refusal to declare a mistrial is measured against a manifest abuse of discretion yardstick, so that we will uphold the court's ruling unless the movant demonstrates a clear showing of prejudice (<i>United States v.

As Villarman would have it, the jury could look only to that evidence and therefore convict him for no more than that quantity. But that contention glosses over the fact that L&#243;pez also testified about another attempted transaction that involved two kilograms of heroin (with the drug reference sought to be disguised by the use of coded words). Because that evidence too could be credited by the jury to support its special verdict of more than one kilogram of heroin, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Villarman's Crim.

Denial of a Crim. Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal is reviewed de novo, and we will affirm Villarman's conviction if after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, \"any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\" (<i>United States v.

In the latter respect, if the record supports at least two permissible inferences, the factfinder's choice between or among them cannot be clearly erroneous (<i>United States v.

Instead Villarman said that he spoke with the co-defendants only because he was owed money and feared for his life. If that testimony had been believed, the jury would consequently have concluded that he did not intend to distribute drugs, rendering him guiltless of any conspiracy to distribute narcotics. In reaching the opposite conclusion as to his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt regarding a heroin conspiracy, the jury must perforce have determined that Villarman's testimony was false &#8212; not the product of mistake, confusion or faulty memory, but rather stemming from Villarman's desire to convince the jury of a fabricated theory to excuse himself from liability. In turn, the district court could not have been clearly erroneous in deciding that Villarman had provided materially false information, thus justifying the two-level increase for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Villarman's role in the conspiracy, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b)'s cmt. 5 identifies a minor participant as one \"who is less culpable than most other defendants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\" We will reverse a sentencing court's finding that a defendant is not a minor participant only if it is clearly erroneous (<i>United States v.

As <i>United States v. Brandon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 460 (1st Cir.1994) has put it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court has broad discretion in determining whether this downward departure is appropriate and we will reverse only if the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the defendant played a part that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant such that the court's decision was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman fails that test. He discussed with his co-conspirators not only the sale of drugs but also the need to find people to transport those drugs. Importantly, Villarman also supplied co-defendant Cruz with heroin and expressed worry about the loss of two kilograms of heroin transported by the conspiracy. Even without regard to Valerio's testimony about Villarman's asserted role in transporting 300 to 350 kilograms of cocaine, Villarman plainly has not shown clear error in the district court's determination that he was not a minor participant in the conspiracy to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally as to the comparative length of Villarman's custodial sentence, the district judge imposed a term of 151 months' imprisonment, longer than the 121-month term imposed on each of co-defendants Soto and Cruz. But Villarman cannot complain on that ground, because a court cannot depart from the U.S.S.G. just to correct an asserted disparity in the sentencing of co-conspirators (<i>Ortiz-Santiago,</i> 211 F.3d at 150).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case Villarman's U.S.S.G. calculation was predicated on a very different situation from that of his co-defendants. Both Soto and Cruz pleaded guilty and otherwise qualified for a three level reduction in their offense levels under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1. By contrast, the district court properly determined that Villarman was not entitled to a like reduction for acceptance of responsibility. And relatedly (for the U.S.S.G. teach a customary linkage between these factors, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1's cmt. 4), we have already upheld the district court's appraisal of Villarman's testimony as justifying an enhancement for obstruction of justice. In sum, the asserted disparity in sentencing vanishes because it was entirely the product of appropriate applications of the U.S.S.G.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Apprendi Considerations</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman's penultimate objections stem from his counsel's view of the fallout from the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Apprendi.</i> Neither of those objections withstands analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, Villarman contends that clear error was involved in sentencing Villarman without having the jury specify the type and quantity of drug, the enhancement for obstruction of justice and Villarman's role in the offense.

We adhere of course to that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarman concludes with the kitchen-sink contention that the cumulative effect of the putative errors already discussed in this opinion operated to violate his constitutional right to a fair trial. We have already shown that few of the matters to which Villarman points may fairly be labeled as errors &#8212; even harmless ones. And even as to those, the familiar teaching of <i>Delaware v. Van Arsdall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span>, 681, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1986) is that \"the Constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one.\" <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1196 (1st Cir.1993) concluded a like review of a laundry list of purported trial court errors with this explanation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of necessity, claims under the cumulative error doctrine are <i>sui generis.</i> A reviewing tribunal must consider each such claim against the background of the case as whole, paying particular weight to factors such as the nature and number of errors committed; their interrelationship, if any, and combined effect; how the district court dealt with the errors as they arose (including the efficacy &#8212; or lack of efficacy &#8212; of any remedial efforts); and the strength of the government's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have engaged in just such a review, and it mandates the denial of Villarman's claim of cumulative error as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We AFFIRM Villarman's conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Further statutory citations will simply take the form \"Section,\" omitting references to Title 21 and to Title 18, the general criminal code. That dual usage should create no confusion, because the Title 21 references are in the 800 series, far removed from the Title 18 section numbers</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> That being so, we need not determine whether Villarman made a contemporaneous objection to Valerio's testimony so as to impose a more demanding standard on Villarman's current contention</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although Villarman's initial brief also indicates, in the title to the subsection discussing these issues, that the district court erred in \"failing to grant a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility,\" there is no discussion of any such contention in the text of that brief or of his reply brief. Even if that argument had been presented, however, Villarman's continued denial that he conspired to distribute narcotics justifies the district court's refusal to grant him credit for acceptance of responsibility</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
