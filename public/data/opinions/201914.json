CARTER,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Mark W. Batten, with whom Proskauer Rose LLP was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     James W. Simpson, Jr., with whom Douglas I. Louison and\nMerrick, Louison & Costello, LLP, were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                         November 4, 2005\n\f     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.      Appellant Joseph C. Carter is\n\nchief of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) police\n\ndepartment.   Two officers (plaintiffs-appellees) sued Carter in\n\nboth his individual and official capacities, alleging, inter alia,\n\nthat he violated their First Amendment rights by disciplining them\n\nfor comments they made to each other and to other officers about\n\nvarious police department matters.       As part of a motion seeking\n\njudgment on the pleadings, Carter moved to dismiss the individual\n\nclaims on the ground that he was immune from suit under the\n\ndoctrine of qualified immunity.        The district court’s denial of\n\nthat motion, in a ruling from the bench following oral argument, is\n\nthe sole subject of this interlocutory appeal.1\n\n     In reviewing the disposition of a motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), we may consider only the\n\nfacts as alleged in the complaint, viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the appellees.    Pasdon v. City of Peabody, 417 F.3d\n\n225, 226 (lst Cir. 2005).   With that constraint on our analysis, we\n\nconclude that the district court reached the correct result.\n\n\n\n1\n  The two officers, along with the MBTA Police Patrolman’s Union,\nsued the MBTA as well as Carter, and also alleged violations of the\nofficers’ rights to due process and freedom of association under\nstate and federal law, and additionally asserted state law claims\nfor intentional infliction of emotional distress.         The MBTA\nvoluntarily dismissed all of its claims, and the individual\nplaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their due process claims.      The\ndistrict court dismissed the freedom of association claims and\ngranted judgment for defendant on the emotional distress claims.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f                                I. Background\n\n     The    pertinent   facts      are   few,   as   we    are   limited   to   the\n\nallegations in the complaint and the complaint is sparsely drafted.\n\nIt states that the plaintiffs, Ronald Jordan and Robert McKay, were\n\nsuspended with pay in the spring of 2004 after the defendants\n\n“illegally      search[ed]      and      analyz[ed]        recorded    telephone\n\nconversations      between    other      officers    and    superiors.”2        The\n\nconversations at issue, which were recorded on the MBTA’s telephone\n\nsystem, pertained to four matters:\n\n     (1) requesting criminal offender record information\n     (“CORI”) about several individuals;\n     (2) criticizing the deputy chief and other department\n     management;\n     (3) discussing the chief’s absenteeism and referring to\n     him as “No Show Joe”;\n     (4) discussing safety issues concerning the Dudley\n     Station of the MBTA.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that appellant Carter “personally disciplined\n\nand caused damages to the plaintiffs because of their criticism of\n\nhis job performance and the job performance of his deputies,” in\n\nviolation of their First Amendment right to free speech.\n\n     As    noted   above,    the   district     court      rejected   appellant’s\n\nqualified immunity defense, which shields government actors from\n\ndamages based on their conduct unless a reasonable official would\n\nhave known, in light of clearly established law, that he was acting\n\n\n2\n Defendants submitted transcripts of the recorded conversations to\nthe district court for possible consideration in connection with\ntheir motion, but both sides on appeal treat the transcripts as\noutside the record, and thus so do we.\n\n                                         -3-\n\funconstitutionally. See, e.g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,\n\n818 (1982); Wagner v. City of Holyoke, 404 F.3d 504, 509 (lst Cir.\n\n2005) (per curiam), petition for cert. filed, 74 U.S.L.W. 3121\n\n(U.S. Aug. 17, 2005) (No. 05-234); Dirrane v. Brookline Police\n\nDep’t, 315 F.3d 65, 69 (lst Cir. 2002).       On appeal, appellant\n\ncontinues to pursue such protection, emphasizing that immunity is\n\nthe norm in public employee First Amendment cases because the\n\nconstitutional question requires fact-intensive balancing – making\n\nit unlikely that a reasonable official “must have known that he was\n\nacting unconstitutionally,” Dirrane, 315 F.3d at 71 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n     Although appellant is correct that the relevant qualified\n\nimmunity case law is generally in his favor, his argument fails to\n\nappreciate that, because this case comes before us at such a\n\npreliminary stage, the immunity analysis is weighted toward the\n\nplaintiffs’ version of events, as depicted by the allegations in\n\nthe complaint.   See Pasdon, 417 F.3d at 226 (motion for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings should not be granted “‘unless it appears beyond\n\ndoubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of\n\nhis claim which would entitle him to relief’”) (citation omitted).\n\nAs we review below the legal frameworks that govern our decision,\n\nit will become apparent why appellant’s immunity defense must at\n\nthis point be rejected.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f                                 II. Discussion\n\n       A. Qualified Immunity\n\n       In deference to the sensitive discretionary judgments that\n\ngovernment    officials    are    obliged   to    make,   qualified    immunity\n\nsafeguards even unconstitutional conduct if a reasonable officer at\n\nthe time and under the circumstances surrounding the action could\n\nhave viewed it as lawful.         See Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341\n\n(1986); Wagner, 404 F.3d at 508-09.          The ultimate question before\n\nus,    therefore,   is   not   whether   appellant    Carter    committed      an\n\nunconstitutional act, but whether his disciplinary action against\n\nthe plaintiffs is entitled to immunity from liability even if that\n\naction violated plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights.\n\n       To answer the immunity question, we employ a three-part test\n\nthat examines both the state of the relevant law and the nature of\n\nthe alleged conduct.       Mihos v. Swift, 358 F.3d 91, 102 (lst Cir.\n\n2004).      First, we consider whether plaintiffs' allegations, if\n\ntrue, establish a constitutional violation.               Second, we look at\n\nwhether the right allegedly violated was clearly established at the\n\ntime   of   the   challenged     conduct.    Finally,     if   the    prior   two\n\nquestions are answered affirmatively, we determine “whether a\n\nsimilarly situated reasonable official would have understood that\n\nthe challenged action violated the constitutional right at issue.”\n\nId.    If the final answer is “no,” a defendant will be entitled to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fqualified immunity notwithstanding constitutional injury to the\n\nplaintiff.\n\n     The Supreme Court has directed us, in the absence of special\n\ncircumstances, to take up these questions in order, even though it\n\nmight be easier at times to bypass the substantive constitutional\n\nquestion and conclude that, at a minimum, the law was not clearly\n\nestablished when the challenged conduct occurred.    See Saucier v.\n\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 200-01 (2001); Fabiano v. Hopkins, 352 F.3d\n\n447, 453 (lst Cir. 2003).   With such a sequential approach, the law\n\ncontinues to develop and become more “clearly established” over\n\ntime.   Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201 (“This is the process for the law’s\n\nelaboration from case to case, and it is one reason for our\n\ninsisting upon turning to the existence or nonexistence of a\n\nconstitutional right as the first inquiry.        The law might be\n\ndeprived of this explanation were a court simply to skip ahead [to\n\nthe other questions].”).\n\n     Thus, we turn first to the first question: do plaintiffs’\n\nallegations establish a constitutional violation? Our review is de\n\nnovo.   See Mihos, 358 F.3d at 102.\n\n     B. First Amendment\n\n     To determine whether the facts as alleged state a violation of\n\nthe plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, we confront a second three-\n\npart inquiry:\n\n     (1) whether the speech involves a matter of public\n     concern; (2) whether, when balanced against each other,\n\n                                 -6-\n\f       the First Amendment interests of the plaintiff and the\n       public outweigh the government’s interest in functioning\n       efficiently; and (3) whether the protected speech was a\n       substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action\n       against the plaintiff.\n\nId.(noting that these inquiries derive, respectively, from the\n\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983);\n\nPickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563 (1968); and Mt. Healthy\n\nCity Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977)); see\n\nalso Fabiano, 352 F.3d at 453; Mullin v. Town of Fairhaven, 284\n\nF.3d 31, 37-38 (lst Cir. 2002).   We need address only the first two\n\nquestions, as appellant acknowledges that the complaint satisfies\n\nthe third element by alleging that appellant disciplined plaintiffs\n\nin retaliation for protected speech.\n\n       (1) Matter of Public Concern\n\n       Our first step is to determine, based on “‘the content, form,\n\nand context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record,’\n\nwhether the employee was speaking ‘as a citizen upon matters of\n\npublic concern,’ or, alternatively, ‘as an employee upon matters\n\nonly of personal interest,’” O’Connor v. Steeves, 994 F.2d 905, 912\n\n(lst Cir. 1993) (quoting Connick, 461 U.S. at 147-48).    See also,\n\nTripp v. Cole, 425 F.3d 5, 11 (lst Cir. 2005); Mihos, 358 F.3d at\n\n102.     If only personal speech is involved, “‘then its First\n\nAmendment value is low, and a “federal court is not the appropriate\n\nforum in which to review the wisdom” of internal decisions arising\n\ntherefrom.’”    Fabiano, 352 F.3d at 453 (citations omitted).\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f     In some instances, the subject matter of the speech, alone,\n\nmay resolve the “public concern” question, as when the employee\n\n“expresses himself on a subject that is ‘clearly a legitimate\n\nmatter of inherent concern to the electorate,’” id. at 454 (quoting\n\nO’Connor, 994 F.2d at 913-14).     In other instances,\n\n     public-employee speech on a topic which would not\n     necessarily qualify, on the basis of its content alone .\n     . . (e.g., internal working conditions, affecting only\n     the speaker and co-workers), may require a more complete\n     Connick analysis into the form and context of the public-\n     employee expression . . . .\n\nO’Connor, 994 F.2d at 914 (emphasis in original).\n\n     The terseness of the instant complaint precludes us from\n\nperforming a close analysis of the targeted speech.                 We have\n\navailable only the general subject matter of the statements at\n\nissue, plus the fact that they were made in conversations with\n\n“other officers and superiors” on a police department telephone\n\nline.   Nonetheless, working with what we have, our task is to\n\nconsider   whether   the   categories   of    statements   listed   in   the\n\ncomplaint qualify as addressing matters of public concern.\n\n     Drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, we cannot\n\nreject the possibility that at least some of the speech would fall\n\nwithin an area of public concern.            Indeed, appellant admits as\n\nmuch.   Criticism of the chief and other management, as well as\n\nexpressions of concern about safety at one of the MBTA passenger\n\nstations, could – depending upon the particulars of content, form\n\nand context – constitute “a matter of legitimate public concern,”\n\n                                  -8-\n\fO’Connor,    994   F.2d   at   915.3     Certainly,      if   either    official\n\nmisconduct or neglect of duties was asserted to be responsible for\n\nunsafe conditions for the general public, this would be a matter of\n\npublic    importance.      If,   however,      the     performance     critiques\n\nconcerned only matters of internal working conditions, and the\n\ndiscussion of “safety issues” at the Dudley Station likewise\n\nreflected an employee workplace concern rather than the public\n\ninterest, plaintiffs’ constitutional claim would falter at the\n\nthreshold inquiry. With the record undeveloped, and the facts thus\n\nstill capable of tilting in either direction, we accept for present\n\npurposes that the public concern prong is satisfied.\n\n     (2) Balancing the Interests\n\n     The second step in determining whether appellant committed a\n\nFirst    Amendment   violation    is    to   balance    the   plaintiffs’    and\n\npublic’s interests in the plaintiffs’ speech against the “‘interest\n\nof the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the\n\npublic services it performs through its employees . . . ,’”\n\nPickering, 391 U.S. at 568.            Although this is intended to be a\n\n“particularized” inquiry, see Fabiano, 352 F.3d at 455 (“[I]f the\n\n\n\n3\n  We do not address the first category of conversations –\n“[r]equesting CORI records.” Putting aside the question whether\nsuch requests would constitute relevant “speech,” plaintiffs appear\nto acknowledge that they would not implicate a matter of public\nconcern.   In addition, the complaint explicitly attributes the\ndiscipline imposed by appellant Carter to plaintiffs’ criticism of\nappellant’s job performance and the job performance of his\ndeputies, and not to the records requests.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fplaintiff’s constitutional claim is relatively weak, . . . the\n\ngovernment need show less to counter it.”), we have little to\n\nassess at this point on either side of the scale.\n\n     On plaintiffs’ side, our inquiry considers their interests in\n\ncommunicating the safety concerns and performance criticism that we\n\nhave deemed potentially of public concern, as well as the interests\n\nof the public in receiving such information.       See Mihos, 358 F.3d\n\nat 107.   While our starting point is that such information about\n\npublic welfare and public officials is of significant weight, we\n\nmust factor in particulars such as the nature of the comments and\n\nthe motivation behind the speech.          For example, when public-\n\nemployee expression is done in a “‘vulgar, insulting, and defiant’\n\nmanner,” Stanley v. City of Dalton, Ga., 219 F.3d 1280, 1290 (llth\n\nCir. 2000), or is motivated by self-interest rather than by a\n\ndesire to serve the public interest, see O’Connor, 994 F.2d at 915,\n\nit is entitled to less weight in the Pickering balance.             On the\n\nother   hand,   the   fact   that   statements   are   made    in   private\n\nconversations and not disseminated to the public at large does not\n\nnecessarily weigh against them.       See id. at 916-17.      Here, we have\n\nno information about the particulars of plaintiffs’ comments, other\n\nthan that they were made on MBTA phone lines; we thus have no basis\n\nfor discounting plaintiffs’ and the public’s interests.\n\n     Meanwhile, in examining appellant’s side of the balance, we\n\nacknowledge that the government’s interest “is particularly acute\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fin the context of law enforcement, where there is a ‘heightened\n\ninterest    .   .    .   in   maintaining     discipline   and   harmony      among\n\nemployees,’” Moore v. Wynnewood, 57 F.3d 924, 934 (l0th Cir. 1995)\n\n(citation omitted); see also, Oladeinde v. City of Birmingham, 230\n\nF.3d 1275, 1293 (llth Cir. 2000); Kokkinis v. Ivkovich, 185 F.3d\n\n840, 845 (7th Cir. 1999); O’Donnell v. Barry, 148 F.3d 1126, 1135\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1998).        But motivation is important here, too, and the\n\nallegations of the complaint tell us that appellant retaliated\n\nbecause of plaintiffs’ criticism of his and his deputies’ job\n\nperformance.        If appellant did so entirely out of self-interest to\n\nsilence legitimate criticism, the government interest would be\n\nweakened.\n\n     We believe our discussion makes it evident that, without the\n\nparticulars relevant to both sides of the balance, we cannot\n\ndefinitively resolve the constitutional question.                  Still, given\n\nthat we must at this juncture indulge all inferences in favor of\n\nthe plaintiffs, we conclude that, on the record before us, the\n\ncomplaint sufficiently states a constitutional violation.                  Having\n\nso resolved, and with appellant’s concession that plaintiffs’\n\nallegations     satisfy       the   “substantial    factor”      prong   of     the\n\nconstitutional inquiry, we now return to the qualified immunity\n\ninquiry and the question whether plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights\n\nwere clearly established at the time appellant disciplined them for\n\ntheir speech.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f     C. Clearly Established Right\n\n     The second stage of the qualified immunity inquiry requires us\n\nto determine whether the right we have identified was “‘reasonably\n\nwell settled at the time of the challenged conduct,’” Mihos, 358\n\nF.3d at 109 (quoting Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 988 (lst Cir.\n\n1995)). Because that analysis “‘must be undertaken in light of the\n\nspecific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition,’”\n\nSuboh v. Dist. Attorney’s Office of Suffolk Dist., 298 F.3d 81, 93\n\n(lst Cir. 2002) (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201), we again\n\nencounter the undeveloped state of the record as an obstacle.   If\n\nwe simply considered whether the law clearly established that a\n\npublic employer may not penalize an employee for speech about a\n\nmatter of public concern, it would be beyond debate that ample\n\nlegal precedent existed to guide appellant’s conduct.    But using\n\nsuch a broad formulation to deny immunity is precisely what we have\n\nbeen told not to do.    See, e.g., Wagner, 404 F.3d at 509 (“The\n\ngeneral right invoked by Wagner – to engage in speech on matters of\n\npublic concern without retaliation – was clearly established prior\n\nto 1994. But qualified immunity requires that the general right be\n\nplaced in a reasonably specific context . . . .”).\n\n     Appellant, however, urges us to award him immunity based on a\n\nsimilarly generic argument.   He emphasizes the abundant case law\n\nrecognizing that it is rare for immunity to be denied when the\n\nconstitutional right at issue involves weighing various factors.\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fWe and other circuits have noted that the Pickering balancing is\n\n“‘subtle, yet difficult to apply, and not yet well defined,’” Pike\n\nv. Osborne, 301 F.3d 182, 185 (4th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted),\n\nand that, consequently, only in the extraordinary case will it have\n\nbeen clearly established that a public employee’s speech merited\n\nconstitutional protection.   See, e.g., Fabiano, 352 F.3d at 457;\n\nChesser v. Sparks, 248 F.3d 1117, 1124 (llth Cir. 2001); Bartlett\n\nv. Fisher, 972 F.2d 911, 916-17 (8th Cir. 1992) (citing similar\n\ncases); O’Connor, 994 F.2d at 917 n.11.\n\n     Appellant claims that this cannot be the rare case because the\n\ncomplaint depicts disciplinary conduct imposed for a mixture of\n\nprotected and unprotected speech, a combination that would engender\n\nuncertainty in any attempt to balance interests.    In support, he\n\ncites our decision in Dirrane, 315 F.3d at 70-71, and asserts that\n\nit similarly involved “arguably protected statements ‘nestled in a\n\nmorass of complaints’ that were not protected speech.” In Dirrane,\n\nthe plaintiff had complained over a number of years about abuses in\n\nthe Brookline police force, ranging from minor issues to serious\n\ncharges of falsification and destruction of evidence.   He alleged\n\nthat his supervisors had failed to seriously investigate his\n\ncomplaints and transferred him in retaliation for making them.   We\n\nheld that the plaintiff had made out “a colorable First Amendment\n\nviolation,” id. at 70, but because his years of petty complaints\n\ngave his superiors a basis for distrusting his judgment – and in\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fthe absence of equivalent precedent – we found the individual\n\ndefendants entitled to qualified immunity.                 See id. at 71.\n\n     Although Dirrane also presented an appeal of a motion to\n\ndismiss, it provides limited support for appellant’s immunity\n\nrequest.       We described the complaint there as “very lengthy,” id.\n\nat 70, and we noted allegations detailing the statements that\n\nplaintiff made, to whom, and, at least to some extent, their\n\ntiming.    We have none of those particulars here.                Appellant could\n\nhave, but did not, move for a more definite statement.                 See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(e); Educadores Puertorriqueños En Acción v. Hernández,\n\n367 F.3d 61, 67 (lst Cir. 2004).            We therefore cannot eliminate the\n\npossibility that the facts once developed will show a violation of\n\nclearly    established        law.     As    we    have    intimated      above,   if\n\nplaintiffs’ criticism consisted of serious expressions of concern,\n\nvoiced    in    an   appropriate     manner,      about    the   effect    of    their\n\nsupervisors’ poor performance on public safety or other public\n\nmatters,       and   appellant’s     retaliation     was    primarily      aimed   at\n\nsilencing their criticism for his own advantage, precedent would\n\nhave clearly established that the balance of interests tipped\n\ndecisively in plaintiffs’ favor. Appellant is thus not entitled to\n\nimmunity based on prong two.\n\n     (3) The Understanding of a Reasonable Official\n\n     In the third step of the qualified immunity analysis, we\n\nconsider       whether   an    objectively        reasonable     officer    in     the\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fdefendant’s position would have understood his action to violate\n\nthe plaintiff’s rights.      Mihos, 358 F.3d at 110; Suboh, 298 F.3d at\n\n95.    At this stage, as we have noted, the record requires us to\n\nlook upon plaintiffs’ speech as significantly involving matters of\n\npublic   concern.       Similarly,       we    must    assess      and    balance      the\n\ninterests of the parties, favoring plaintiffs in our reading of the\n\nallegations.       And, since appellant concedes that the allegations\n\nestablish that plaintiffs’ speech was the motivating factor for\n\nimposing sanctions, the required inquiry leads to but one result.\n\nWe    cannot   award    immunity   to    appellant         on   the      basis   that    a\n\nreasonable officer would not have realized the impropriety of his\n\nconduct.\n\n                              III. Conclusion\n\n       We are fully aware that the doctrine of qualified immunity is\n\nintended to protect government officials not only from personal\n\nliability but also from the burdens of litigation, see Saucier, 533\n\nU.S. at 200-01, and that immunity is often appropriate in cases\n\ninvolving      public   employee   speech.            It   is   not      an    automatic\n\nentitlement, however, and a court may not cut off a plaintiff’s\n\nclaims     based    simply   on    the    odds.            Here,    the       record    is\n\ninsufficiently developed to permit a reasoned assessment of either\n\nthe speech or conduct at issue, and we accordingly must draw all\n\ninferences in the plaintiffs’ favor.                  From that perspective, we\n\nconclude that the district court properly denied appellant’s motion\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\ffor dismissal of the individual claims based on the defense of\n\nqualified immunity.   We do not mean to imply any likely outcome as\n\nthis case further proceeds.4\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n4\n As we noted in Mihos, denial of immunity at the motion-to-dismiss\nstage does not preclude renewal of the defense in a subsequent\nmotion for summary judgment or at trial. See 358 F.3d at 110 n.16.\nIf, however, “the trial court denies the request for summary\njudgment because of a genuine issue as to any material fact,\nincluding motive, that ruling would not permit an interlocutory\nappeal.” Id.\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

Carter is\n\nchief of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) police\n\ndepartment.   Two officers (plaintiffs-appellees) sued Carter in\n\nboth his individual and official capacities, alleging, inter alia,\n\nthat he violated their First Amendment rights by disciplining them\n\nfor comments they made to each other and to other officers about\n\nvarious police department matters.       As part of a motion seeking\n\njudgment on the pleadings, Carter moved to dismiss the individual\n\nclaims on the ground that he was immune from suit under the\n\ndoctrine of qualified immunity.        The district court’s denial of\n\nthat motion, in a ruling from the bench following oral argument, is\n\nthe sole subject of this interlocutory appeal.1\n\n     In reviewing the disposition of a motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings under Fed.

With that constraint on our analysis, we\n\nconclude that the district court reached the correct result.\n\n\n\n1\n  The two officers, along with the MBTA Police Patrolman’s Union,\nsued the MBTA as well as Carter, and also alleged violations of the\nofficers’ rights to due process and freedom of association under\nstate and federal law, and additionally asserted state law claims\nfor intentional infliction of emotional distress.         The MBTA\nvoluntarily dismissed all of its claims, and the individual\nplaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their due process claims.      The\ndistrict court dismissed the freedom of association claims and\ngranted judgment for defendant on the emotional distress claims.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f                                I. Background\n\n     The    pertinent   facts      are   few,   as   we    are   limited   to   the\n\nallegations in the complaint and the complaint is sparsely drafted.\n\nIt states that the plaintiffs, Ronald Jordan and Robert McKay, were\n\nsuspended with pay in the spring of 2004 after the defendants\n\n“illegally      search[ed]      and      analyz[ed]        recorded    telephone\n\nconversations      between    other      officers    and    superiors.”2        The\n\nconversations at issue, which were recorded on the MBTA’s telephone\n\nsystem, pertained to four matters:\n\n     (1) requesting criminal offender record information\n     (“CORI”) about several individuals;\n     (2) criticizing the deputy chief and other department\n     management;\n     (3) discussing the chief’s absenteeism and referring to\n     him as “No Show Joe”;\n     (4) discussing safety issues concerning the Dudley\n     Station of the MBTA.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that appellant Carter “personally disciplined\n\nand caused damages to the plaintiffs because of their criticism of\n\nhis job performance and the job performance of his deputies,” in\n\nviolation of their First Amendment right to free speech.\n\n     As    noted   above,    the   district     court      rejected   appellant’s\n\nqualified immunity defense, which shields government actors from\n\ndamages based on their conduct unless a reasonable official would\n\nhave known, in light of clearly established law, that he was acting\n\n\n2\n Defendants submitted transcripts of the recorded conversations to\nthe district court for possible consideration in connection with\ntheir motion, but both sides on appeal treat the transcripts as\noutside the record, and thus so do we.\n\n                                         -3-\n\funconstitutionally.

On appeal, appellant\n\ncontinues to pursue such protection, emphasizing that immunity is\n\nthe norm in public employee First Amendment cases because the\n\nconstitutional question requires fact-intensive balancing – making\n\nit unlikely that a reasonable official “must have known that he was\n\nacting unconstitutionally,” Dirrane, 315 F.3d at 71 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n     Although appellant is correct that the relevant qualified\n\nimmunity case law is generally in his favor, his argument fails to\n\nappreciate that, because this case comes before us at such a\n\npreliminary stage, the immunity analysis is weighted toward the\n\nplaintiffs’ version of events, as depicted by the allegations in\n\nthe complaint.   See Pasdon, 417 F.3d at 226 (motion for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings should not be granted “‘unless it appears beyond\n\ndoubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of\n\nhis claim which would entitle him to relief’”) (citation omitted).\n\nAs we review below the legal frameworks that govern our decision,\n\nit will become apparent why appellant’s immunity defense must at\n\nthis point be rejected.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f                                 II.

Qualified Immunity\n\n       In deference to the sensitive discretionary judgments that\n\ngovernment    officials    are    obliged   to    make,   qualified    immunity\n\nsafeguards even unconstitutional conduct if a reasonable officer at\n\nthe time and under the circumstances surrounding the action could\n\nhave viewed it as lawful.         See Malley v.

The ultimate question before\n\nus,    therefore,   is   not   whether   appellant    Carter    committed      an\n\nunconstitutional act, but whether his disciplinary action against\n\nthe plaintiffs is entitled to immunity from liability even if that\n\naction violated plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights.\n\n       To answer the immunity question, we employ a three-part test\n\nthat examines both the state of the relevant law and the nature of\n\nthe alleged conduct.       Mihos v. Swift, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785090\"><a href=\"/opinion/785090/christy-peter-mihos-appelleecross-appellant-v-jane-swift-individually/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 (lst Cir.\n\n2004).      First, we consider whether plaintiffs' allegations, if\n\ntrue, establish a constitutional violation.               Second, we look at\n\nwhether the right allegedly violated was clearly established at the\n\ntime   of   the   challenged     conduct.    Finally,     if   the    prior   two\n\nquestions are answered affirmatively, we determine “whether a\n\nsimilarly situated reasonable official would have understood that\n\nthe challenged action violated the constitutional right at issue.”\n\nId.    If the final answer is “no,” a defendant will be entitled to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fqualified immunity notwithstanding constitutional injury to the\n\nplaintiff.\n\n     The Supreme Court has directed us, in the absence of special\n\ncircumstances, to take up these questions in order, even though it\n\nmight be easier at times to bypass the substantive constitutional\n\nquestion and conclude that, at a minimum, the law was not clearly\n\nestablished when the challenged conduct occurred.    See Saucier v.\n\nKatz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200-01 (2001); Fabiano v.

With such a sequential approach, the law\n\ncontinues to develop and become more “clearly established” over\n\ntime.   Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201 (“This is the process for the law’s\n\nelaboration from case to case, and it is one reason for our\n\ninsisting upon turning to the existence or nonexistence of a\n\nconstitutional right as the first inquiry.        The law might be\n\ndeprived of this explanation were a court simply to skip ahead [to\n\nthe other questions].”).\n\n     Thus, we turn first to the first question: do plaintiffs’\n\nallegations establish a constitutional violation? Our review is de\n\nnovo.   See Mihos, 358 F.3d at 102.\n\n     B. First Amendment\n\n     To determine whether the facts as alleged state a violation of\n\nthe plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, we confront a second three-\n\npart inquiry:\n\n     (1) whether the speech involves a matter of public\n     concern; (2) whether, when balanced against each other,\n\n                                 -6-\n\f       the First Amendment interests of the plaintiff and the\n       public outweigh the government’s interest in functioning\n       efficiently; and (3) whether the protected speech was a\n       substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action\n       against the plaintiff.\n\nId.(noting that these inquiries derive, respectively, from the\n\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Connick v.

We need address only the first two\n\nquestions, as appellant acknowledges that the complaint satisfies\n\nthe third element by alleging that appellant disciplined plaintiffs\n\nin retaliation for protected speech.\n\n       (1) Matter of Public Concern\n\n       Our first step is to determine, based on “‘the content, form,\n\nand context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record,’\n\nwhether the employee was speaking ‘as a citizen upon matters of\n\npublic concern,’ or, alternatively, ‘as an employee upon matters\n\nonly of personal interest,’” O’Connor v.

If only personal speech is involved, “‘then its First\n\nAmendment value is low, and a “federal court is not the appropriate\n\nforum in which to review the wisdom” of internal decisions arising\n\ntherefrom.’”    Fabiano, 352 F.3d at 453 (citations omitted).\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f     In some instances, the subject matter of the speech, alone,\n\nmay resolve the “public concern” question, as when the employee\n\n“expresses himself on a subject that is ‘clearly a legitimate\n\nmatter of inherent concern to the electorate,’” id. at 454 (quoting\n\nO’Connor, 994 F.2d at 913-14).     In other instances,\n\n     public-employee speech on a topic which would not\n     necessarily qualify, on the basis of its content alone .\n     . . (e.g., internal working conditions, affecting only\n     the speaker and co-workers), may require a more complete\n     Connick analysis into the form and context of the public-\n     employee expression . . . .\n\nO’Connor, 994 F.2d at 914 (emphasis in original).\n\n     The terseness of the instant complaint precludes us from\n\nperforming a close analysis of the targeted speech.                 We have\n\navailable only the general subject matter of the statements at\n\nissue, plus the fact that they were made in conversations with\n\n“other officers and superiors” on a police department telephone\n\nline.   Nonetheless, working with what we have, our task is to\n\nconsider   whether   the   categories   of    statements   listed   in   the\n\ncomplaint qualify as addressing matters of public concern.\n\n     Drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, we cannot\n\nreject the possibility that at least some of the speech would fall\n\nwithin an area of public concern.            Indeed, appellant admits as\n\nmuch.   Criticism of the chief and other management, as well as\n\nexpressions of concern about safety at one of the MBTA passenger\n\nstations, could – depending upon the particulars of content, form\n\nand context – constitute “a matter of legitimate public concern,”\n\n                                  -8-\n\fO’Connor,    994   F.2d   at   915.3     Certainly,      if   either    official\n\nmisconduct or neglect of duties was asserted to be responsible for\n\nunsafe conditions for the general public, this would be a matter of\n\npublic    importance.      If,   however,      the     performance     critiques\n\nconcerned only matters of internal working conditions, and the\n\ndiscussion of “safety issues” at the Dudley Station likewise\n\nreflected an employee workplace concern rather than the public\n\ninterest, plaintiffs’ constitutional claim would falter at the\n\nthreshold inquiry. With the record undeveloped, and the facts thus\n\nstill capable of tilting in either direction, we accept for present\n\npurposes that the public concern prong is satisfied.\n\n     (2) Balancing the Interests\n\n     The second step in determining whether appellant committed a\n\nFirst    Amendment   violation    is    to   balance    the   plaintiffs’    and\n\npublic’s interests in the plaintiffs’ speech against the “‘interest\n\nof the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the\n\npublic services it performs through its employees . . . ,’”\n\nPickering, 391 U.S. at 568.            Although this is intended to be a\n\n“particularized” inquiry, see Fabiano, 352 F.3d at 455 (“[I]f the\n\n\n\n3\n  We do not address the first category of conversations –\n“[r]equesting CORI records.” Putting aside the question whether\nsuch requests would constitute relevant “speech,” plaintiffs appear\nto acknowledge that they would not implicate a matter of public\nconcern.   In addition, the complaint explicitly attributes the\ndiscipline imposed by appellant Carter to plaintiffs’ criticism of\nappellant’s job performance and the job performance of his\ndeputies, and not to the records requests.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fplaintiff’s constitutional claim is relatively weak, . . . the\n\ngovernment need show less to counter it.”), we have little to\n\nassess at this point on either side of the scale.\n\n     On plaintiffs’ side, our inquiry considers their interests in\n\ncommunicating the safety concerns and performance criticism that we\n\nhave deemed potentially of public concern, as well as the interests\n\nof the public in receiving such information.       See Mihos, 358 F.3d\n\nat 107.   While our starting point is that such information about\n\npublic welfare and public officials is of significant weight, we\n\nmust factor in particulars such as the nature of the comments and\n\nthe motivation behind the speech.          For example, when public-\n\nemployee expression is done in a “‘vulgar, insulting, and defiant’\n\nmanner,” Stanley v. City of Dalton, Ga., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74654\"><a href=\"/opinion/74654/jerry-m-stanley-v-city-of-dalton-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1290 (llth\n\nCir. 2000), or is motivated by self-interest rather than by a\n\ndesire to serve the public interest, see O’Connor, 994 F.2d at 915,\n\nit is entitled to less weight in the Pickering balance.             On the\n\nother   hand,   the   fact   that   statements   are   made    in   private\n\nconversations and not disseminated to the public at large does not\n\nnecessarily weigh against them.       See id. at 916-17.      Here, we have\n\nno information about the particulars of plaintiffs’ comments, other\n\nthan that they were made on MBTA phone lines; we thus have no basis\n\nfor discounting plaintiffs’ and the public’s interests.\n\n     Meanwhile, in examining appellant’s side of the balance, we\n\nacknowledge that the government’s interest “is particularly acute\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fin the context of law enforcement, where there is a ‘heightened\n\ninterest    .   .    .   in   maintaining     discipline   and   harmony      among\n\nemployees,’” Moore v.

Cir. 1998).        But motivation is important here, too, and the\n\nallegations of the complaint tell us that appellant retaliated\n\nbecause of plaintiffs’ criticism of his and his deputies’ job\n\nperformance.        If appellant did so entirely out of self-interest to\n\nsilence legitimate criticism, the government interest would be\n\nweakened.\n\n     We believe our discussion makes it evident that, without the\n\nparticulars relevant to both sides of the balance, we cannot\n\ndefinitively resolve the constitutional question.                  Still, given\n\nthat we must at this juncture indulge all inferences in favor of\n\nthe plaintiffs, we conclude that, on the record before us, the\n\ncomplaint sufficiently states a constitutional violation.                  Having\n\nso resolved, and with appellant’s concession that plaintiffs’\n\nallegations     satisfy       the   “substantial    factor”      prong   of     the\n\nconstitutional inquiry, we now return to the qualified immunity\n\ninquiry and the question whether plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights\n\nwere clearly established at the time appellant disciplined them for\n\ntheir speech.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f     C. Clearly Established Right\n\n     The second stage of the qualified immunity inquiry requires us\n\nto determine whether the right we have identified was “‘reasonably\n\nwell settled at the time of the challenged conduct,’” Mihos, 358\n\nF.3d at 109 (quoting Martinez v. Colon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696203\"><a href=\"/opinion/696203/wilfredo-martinez-aka-wilfredo-martinez-rodriguez-v-rafael-colon-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 988 (lst Cir.\n\n1995)). Because that analysis “‘must be undertaken in light of the\n\nspecific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition,’”\n\nSuboh v. Dist. Attorney’s Office of Suffolk Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93\n\n(lst Cir. 2002) (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201), we again\n\nencounter the undeveloped state of the record as an obstacle.   If\n\nwe simply considered whether the law clearly established that a\n\npublic employer may not penalize an employee for speech about a\n\nmatter of public concern, it would be beyond debate that ample\n\nlegal precedent existed to guide appellant’s conduct.    But using\n\nsuch a broad formulation to deny immunity is precisely what we have\n\nbeen told not to do.    See, e.g., Wagner, 404 F.3d at 509 (“The\n\ngeneral right invoked by Wagner – to engage in speech on matters of\n\npublic concern without retaliation – was clearly established prior\n\nto 1994. But qualified immunity requires that the general right be\n\nplaced in a reasonably specific context . . . .”).\n\n     Appellant, however, urges us to award him immunity based on a\n\nsimilarly generic argument.   He emphasizes the abundant case law\n\nrecognizing that it is rare for immunity to be denied when the\n\nconstitutional right at issue involves weighing various factors.\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fWe and other circuits have noted that the Pickering balancing is\n\n“‘subtle, yet difficult to apply, and not yet well defined,’” Pike\n\nv. Osborne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778870\"><a href=\"/opinion/778870/martha-l-pike-cynthia-j-kincer-v-kermit-l-osborne-individually-and-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 185 (4th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted),\n\nand that, consequently, only in the extraordinary case will it have\n\nbeen clearly established that a public employee’s speech merited\n\nconstitutional protection.   See, e.g., Fabiano, 352 F.3d at 457;\n\nChesser v. Sparks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1124 (llth Cir. 2001); Bartlett\n\nv.

In support, he\n\ncites our decision in Dirrane, 315 F.3d at 70-71, and asserts that\n\nit similarly involved “arguably protected statements ‘nestled in a\n\nmorass of complaints’ that were not protected speech.” In Dirrane,\n\nthe plaintiff had complained over a number of years about abuses in\n\nthe Brookline police force, ranging from minor issues to serious\n\ncharges of falsification and destruction of evidence.   He alleged\n\nthat his supervisors had failed to seriously investigate his\n\ncomplaints and transferred him in retaliation for making them.   We\n\nheld that the plaintiff had made out “a colorable First Amendment\n\nviolation,” id. at 70, but because his years of petty complaints\n\ngave his superiors a basis for distrusting his judgment – and in\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fthe absence of equivalent precedent – we found the individual\n\ndefendants entitled to qualified immunity.                 See id. at 71.\n\n     Although Dirrane also presented an appeal of a motion to\n\ndismiss, it provides limited support for appellant’s immunity\n\nrequest.       We described the complaint there as “very lengthy,” id.\n\nat 70, and we noted allegations detailing the statements that\n\nplaintiff made, to whom, and, at least to some extent, their\n\ntiming.    We have none of those particulars here.                Appellant could\n\nhave, but did not, move for a more definite statement.                 See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(e); Educadores Puertorriqueños En Acción v. Hernández,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200999\"><a href=\"/opinion/200999/epa-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (lst Cir. 2004).            We therefore cannot eliminate the\n\npossibility that the facts once developed will show a violation of\n\nclearly    established        law.     As    we    have    intimated      above,   if\n\nplaintiffs’ criticism consisted of serious expressions of concern,\n\nvoiced    in    an   appropriate     manner,      about    the   effect    of    their\n\nsupervisors’ poor performance on public safety or other public\n\nmatters,       and   appellant’s     retaliation     was    primarily      aimed   at\n\nsilencing their criticism for his own advantage, precedent would\n\nhave clearly established that the balance of interests tipped\n\ndecisively in plaintiffs’ favor. Appellant is thus not entitled to\n\nimmunity based on prong two.\n\n     (3) The Understanding of a Reasonable Official\n\n     In the third step of the qualified immunity analysis, we\n\nconsider       whether   an    objectively        reasonable     officer    in     the\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fdefendant’s position would have understood his action to violate\n\nthe plaintiff’s rights.      Mihos, 358 F.3d at 110; Suboh, 298 F.3d at\n\n95.    At this stage, as we have noted, the record requires us to\n\nlook upon plaintiffs’ speech as significantly involving matters of\n\npublic   concern.       Similarly,       we    must    assess      and    balance      the\n\ninterests of the parties, favoring plaintiffs in our reading of the\n\nallegations.       And, since appellant concedes that the allegations\n\nestablish that plaintiffs’ speech was the motivating factor for\n\nimposing sanctions, the required inquiry leads to but one result.\n\nWe    cannot   award    immunity   to    appellant         on   the      basis   that    a\n\nreasonable officer would not have realized the impropriety of his\n\nconduct.\n\n                              III. Conclusion\n\n       We are fully aware that the doctrine of qualified immunity is\n\nintended to protect government officials not only from personal\n\nliability but also from the burdens of litigation, see Saucier, 533\n\nU.S. at 200-01, and that immunity is often appropriate in cases\n\ninvolving      public   employee   speech.            It   is   not      an    automatic\n\nentitlement, however, and a court may not cut off a plaintiff’s\n\nclaims     based    simply   on    the    odds.            Here,    the       record    is\n\ninsufficiently developed to permit a reasoned assessment of either\n\nthe speech or conduct at issue, and we accordingly must draw all\n\ninferences in the plaintiffs’ favor.                  From that perspective, we\n\nconclude that the district court properly denied appellant’s motion\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\ffor dismissal of the individual claims based on the defense of\n\nqualified immunity.   We do not mean to imply any likely outcome as\n\nthis case further proceeds.4\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n4\n As we noted in Mihos, denial of immunity at the motion-to-dismiss\nstage does not preclude renewal of the defense in a subsequent\nmotion for summary judgment or at trial. See 358 F.3d at 110 n.16.\nIf, however, “the trial court denies the request for summary\njudgment because of a genuine issue as to any material fact,\nincluding motive, that ruling would not permit an interlocutory\nappeal.” Id.\n\n                               -16-\n\f</pre>",
