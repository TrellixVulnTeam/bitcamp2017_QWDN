We have not previously addressed\n\nthe issue raised in this ERISA appeal, which comes to us from the\n\ndistrict court's entry of summary judgment concluding that a claims\n\nadministrator's denial of long-term disability benefits was not\n\narbitrary and capricious.           The plaintiff appeals and asserts that\n\nhis ERISA rights were violated because the administrator relied on\n\nmaterial mischaracterizations of the medical record.\n\n              The claims administrator, Prudential Insurance Company of\n\nAmerica, and co-appellee Getronics Wang Co., LLC, the employer,\n\nstated   that    they   based    their     denial    of   long-term   disability\n\nbenefits to former Wang employee Thomas Buffonge on four pieces of\n\nevidence.      The denial rested heavily, but not exclusively, on the\n\nopinion of Dr. Jonathan Rutchik, a consultant hired by Prudential\n\nwho did not examine Buffonge but who reviewed Buffonge's medical\n\nhistory and concluded that there was a \"consensus\" that Buffonge\n\ncould perform sedentary duties, such as keyboard work.                 In fact,\n\nthe medical records showed that no such consensus existed, and, in\n\nother    ways,   Dr.    Rutchik's     report    materially    mischaracterized\n\nBuffonge's medical history.           Prudential also rested its benefits\n\ndenial   on    the   report    of   another     physician,    but   that   report\n\nsupported     the    grant,   not   the    denial,   of   benefits.    Further,\n\nBuffonge's medical records, on which Prudential also purportedly\n\nrelied, demonstrated the two points made above.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f            We conclude that the process used was materially tainted,\n\nand the taint was sufficiently prejudicial, so as to render the\n\nprocess arbitrary.     We remand to the district court to remand to\n\nthe claims administrator for a new review of Buffonge's claim.                 We\n\nemphasize that we do not reach the issue of whether Buffonge was\n\ndisabled.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            We   recount   the    record     which   was   before    the   claims\n\nadministrator.     See Liston v. Unum Corp. Officer Severance Plan,\n\n330 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"Where . . . review is under the\n\narbitrariness    standard,       the   ordinary    question   is    whether   the\n\nadministrator's      action       on    the     record     before     him     was\n\nunreasonable.\").\n\nA.          Buffonge's Medical History\n\n            Buffonge began working for Wang1 in 1983.              At that time,\n\nhe became a participant in Wang's employee benefits plan, which\n\nincluded a long-term disability benefits program; Wang contracted\n\nwith Prudential to provide the program, and Prudential serves as\n\nthe program's claims administrator.               The plan provides that an\n\nemployee is eligible for long-term disability benefits after he or\n\nshe has been \"totally disabled\" for 26 weeks.              \"Total disability\"\n\nexists when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n1\n  At that time, the employer was Wang Laboratories Inc. Getronics\nWang Co., LLC has since acquired the business in relevant part.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we refer to the employer as \"Wang.\"\n\n                                       -3-\n\f            (1) Due to Sickness or accidental injury, both\n            of these are true:\n\n                 (a) You are not able to perform, for\n                 wage or profit, the material and\n                 substantial    duties     of    your\n                 occupation.\n                 (b) After the Initial Duration of a\n                 period of Total Disability, you are\n                 not able to perform for wage or\n                 profit the material and substantial\n                 duties of any job for which you are\n                 reasonably fitted by your education,\n                 training or experience. . . .\n\n            (2) You are not working at any job for wage or\n            profit.\n\n            (3) You   are   under   the   regular   care   of   a\n            Doctor.\n\n            In 1993, Buffonge was a \"field logistics coordinator\" at\n\nWang.     The job involved helping track and ship computer parts to\n\ndifferent offices across the country; it required some lifting as\n\nwell as computer and other desk work.           In June 1993, Buffonge\n\ninjured his neck and back while moving computer parts at the\n\noffice. His discomfort worsened as the weeks passed, and, by July,\n\nBuffonge was reporting severe pain in his chest, radiating into his\n\nleft arm and elbow.      On July 28, 1993, examining physician Dr.\n\nWendell    Pierce   diagnosed   \"cervical    disc    disease    with   left\n\nradiculitis\" and wrote that Buffonge was \"in a great degree of\n\ndiscomfort.\"\n\n            Buffonge took leave from work on temporary disability\n\nfrom August 1993 until April 1994.        He then returned to work for\n\none week, but suffered pain while driving to and from the office,\n\n                                    -4-\n\fand so took leave again until early November 1994.                        Buffonge was\n\ntreated repeatedly during this period for continuing pain in his\n\nneck, back, and chest. In August 1994, Dr. Stephen Lipson examined\n\nBuffonge on referral from Dr. James Bayley, one of Buffonge's\n\nregular physicians.           Dr. Lipson diagnosed Buffonge as suffering\n\nfrom at least one and possibly two herniated discs; he described\n\nBuffonge's pain as \"worse with sitting, standing, and lifting,\n\nbetter with walking and better with bedrest.\"\n\n            Buffonge also saw Dr. David Duhme, a specialist in\n\ninternal medicine at Harvard University Health Services, who had\n\nserved as Buffonge's main treating physician since soon after his\n\ninitial injury.       In a report dated July 20, 1994, Dr. Duhme stated\n\nthat he \"ha[d] been seeing [Buffonge] frequently\" and had referred\n\nhim   for   orthopedic    evaluation.             He   stated     that    Buffonge   was\n\n\"frustrated at his repeated failures to return to work without\n\naggravating the pain.\"\n\n            Buffonge's personnel records show that he had been placed\n\non    modified   duty    perhaps       as    early     as   the    summer     of   1993:\n\nthereafter, while he still had the mostly desk-bound duties of a\n\n\"field logistics coordinator,\" those duties were altered to avoid\n\nregular     lifting     and    other    physical        labor.2          Despite   these\n\n\n2\n  Several of Prudential's letters denying Buffonge benefits stated\nthat he had been placed on \"light duty\" after his initial injury;\none stated that he was \"answering the telephones\" at a desk job.\nThese accommodations are confirmed in an August 1993 report by Dr.\nDuhme stating that Buffonge had told him he \"now can do [his job]\n\n                                            -5-\n\faccommodations, Buffonge's November 1994 return to Wang lasted less\n\nthan one month.   On December 5, 1994, Buffonge visited Dr. Duhme\n\nfor a follow-up examination.      Dr. Duhme's report stated that\n\nBuffonge \"tried to return to work but now is out of work again due\n\nto neck pain radiating to the [left] arm with numbness in the\n\n[left] fingers . . . . [H]e would stand all day at work because the\n\npain was worse sitting.\"   He diagnosed Buffonge as suffering from\n\nboth cervical and lumbar disc disease.\n\n          In January 1995, Buffonge attempted another return to\n\nwork, but his attendance during the months that followed was\n\nsporadic at best: he was unable to work a full week, and even when\n\nhe was at work he reported an intermittent inability to concentrate\n\ndue to episodes of severe pain.   In September 1995, Buffonge was\n\nexamined by Dr. John F. Duff at the request of Wang's lawyers; Duff\n\nreported that Buffonge \"has headaches . . . and he says that he has\n\ntrouble driving and by the end of the day, his low back gets sore\n\nand he moves from different positions but apparently continues to\n\nhave the complaints.\"   Buffonge also told Dr. Duff that he \"has\n\nchest pains when he sits too long and now gets low back pain.\"   Dr.\n\nDuff concluded that despite his pain, Buffonge should have been\n\n\n\n\nwithout any lifting.\" Buffonge's job involved \"occasional bending,\nsquatting, or reaching\" and \"very infrequent lifting of packages\nthat are less than 10 pounds,\" according to the 1997 letter in\nwhich Prudential denied Buffonge's final administrative appeal.\n\n                                -6-\n\fable to perform a full day's work so long as he shifted positions\n\nduring the work day and avoided heavy lifting.\n\n              By October 6, 1995, when he saw Dr. Duhme again, Buffonge\n\nwas reporting serious pain, especially late in the day and late in\n\nthe week.       Dr. Duhme examined him that day; in the diagnosis\n\nsection of his report he again wrote \"cervical disc disease\" and\n\n\"lumbar disc disease,\" and this time added that the latter was\n\n\"becoming chronic pain.\"      Dr. Duhme concluded that Buffonge needed\n\nto take some time off of work.       Later in October, Buffonge tried to\n\ngo to work once again, but he experienced such intense pain that he\n\n\"had to get down on his hands and knees\" to control it.          He visited\n\nDuhme's office that afternoon; Duhme examined Buffonge and observed\n\nin his report that \"[w]hen he straightens up [from a bent-over\n\nposition] his whole right side of the back is bulging with muscle\n\nspasm.\" He diagnosed \"[e]xacerbation of lumbar intervertebral disc\n\ndisease with objective signs of pain and spasm.\"\n\n              On November 9, 1995, Buffonge again visited Dr. Duhme,\n\nwho reported that Buffonge \"[u]sually . . . goes into work, tries\n\nto work, and may have to stop and lie down.           He does not think he\n\ncan   carry    on.\"    Dr.   Duhme   assessed   him    as   suffering   from\n\n\"[i]ncreasing pain from cervical disc disease\" and gave him a\n\nletter authorizing \"a medical leave of absence for a few weeks.\"\n\nIt is not clear precisely when Buffonge's leave began; however, the\n\nrecord indicates that he missed work for five consecutive weeks in\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fDecember   1995   and   January   1996   while   receiving   treatment.\n\n           On January 18, 1996, a report by Dr. Frederick Mansfield\n\n-- a spinal surgeon who examined Buffonge on referral from Dr.\n\nDuhme -- noted that Buffonge had \"developed worse pain in his head\n\nand neck\" two months earlier.       Dr. Mansfield's report diagnosed\n\nBuffonge with \"[c]ervical and lumbar disc degeneration\" and stated\n\nthat \"[a]ny exercise or increased bending or twisting increases his\n\npain.\"\n\n           Buffonge returned to work yet again in late January 1996.\n\nHe had been attending physical therapy for some time as part of his\n\ntreatment, and on February 5, 1996, he was discharged from the\n\nphysical therapy program; the therapist wrote in his discharge\n\nstatement that he was \"pain-free and [symptom]-free when last\n\nseen.\"   On February 15, however, Buffonge visited Dr. Duhme again\n\nand reported that he had been suffering \"severe pain.\"         Dr. Duhme\n\nassessed Buffonge as having \"chronic neck pain due to cervical disc\n\ndisease\" and reported that Buffonge was undergoing acupuncture and\n\nwould be in for follow-up evaluations. Six days later, on February\n\n21, 1996, Buffonge left work because of the pain; it would prove to\n\nbe his last day on the job.\n\n           On June 5, 1996, Buffonge applied to Prudential for long-\n\nterm disability benefits.    In the \"Attending Physician\" section of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fthe application,3 Dr. Duhme reported his diagnosis that Buffonge\n\nsuffered from \"chronic neck, shoulder and chest pain aggravated by\n\nwork,\" and that \"Chronic Intervertebral Disc disease\" resulted in\n\nBuffonge's \"long term disability.\"      He reported that Buffonge had\n\ntried many times to return to work and failed because \"pain returns\n\nwhenever he returns to work for more than 2 wks.\"         Asked whether\n\nBuffonge could work part-time or in another type of job, Dr. Duhme\n\nwrote, \"don't know but probably not.\"          Asked what work duties\n\nBuffonge could perform, he wrote, \"none.\"\n\n           Thereafter, Dr. Duhme saw Buffonge several times during\n\nthe spring and early summer.     He reported each time that Buffonge\n\nwas in pain and was still disabled from working.\n\n           On June 27, 1996, another doctor examined Buffonge at\n\nPrudential's request.      Dr. William Kermond found that Buffonge\n\nsuffered   from   disc   herniation   and   that   physical   examination\n\nsubstantiated Buffonge's complaints of neck, arm, and chest pain.\n\nDr. Kermond also stated that Buffonge's injuries appeared causally\n\nrelated to his 1993 accident at work.       However, he concluded that\n\nBuffonge could perform a desk job with phone and computer duties,\n\nso long as he did not engage in heavy lifting or frequent overhead\n\nwork.   As the record shows, Buffonge had been placed in exactly\n\n\n\n3\n   This document is dated May 16, 1996, not June 5. However, from\nthe context it appears to be part of Buffonge's application for\nlong-term benefits, filled out by Dr. Duhme days in advance of the\napplication's submission.\n\n                                  -9-\n\fsuch     a   desk   job   as   early   as   1993,   and   his   medical   history\n\nthereafter was described above.\n\nB.             The Denial of Benefits and Subsequent Appeals\n\n               Prudential examined Buffonge's medical records and denied\n\nhis claim for long-term disability benefits on September 20, 1996.\n\nIt noted that (1) the February 1996 physical therapy discharge\n\nsummary had deemed Buffonge pain-free, (2) Dr. Kermond had opined\n\nthat Buffonge could perform a desk job, and (3) Wang had made\n\nphysician-requested accommodations for Buffonge, including placing\n\nhim on light duty and permitting him to get up and walk around\n\nevery hour.         It therefore concluded that there was \"no objective\n\nmedical evidence in our file to support Total Disability.\"\n\n               Buffonge's      employment   was   terminated    on   October   21,\n\n1996.4       A month later, he administratively appealed Prudential's\n\nbenefits decision.        Prudential upheld its denial in a letter dated\n\nNovember 26, 1996.          It stated that Buffonge did not qualify for\n\nlong-term disability because (1) according to Dr. Kermond, he could\n\nperform a job involving desk work or light lifting as of June 1996,\n\n\n4\n   The record is quite murky as to how and why this occurred. The\nonly available information (besides the fact of the termination) is\ncontained in an April 16, 1996 report by Dr. Duhme, which states:\n\"[Buffonge's] job at work has been eliminated. He is now out of\nwork on short term disability, but when he returns to work, he will\nbe given 30 days to find a new job in the company or be terminated\n. . . .\" We infer that after months passed and Buffonge did not\nreturn to seek a new position, the company terminated his\nemployment. Whatever the details of the termination, however, they\ndo not affect our disposition of the case.\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fand therefore (2) he had not been \"totally disabled\" for 26 weeks\n\nafter he left work in February 1996, as required under the plan's\n\ndefinition of \"total disability.\"        Buffonge again appealed, and\n\nPrudential affirmed its denial again, on the same grounds, in a\n\nletter dated June 9, 1997.\n\n             On July 25, 1997, Buffonge filed his final administrative\n\nappeal. This time he submitted additional reports and letters from\n\ntwo physicians -- his primary physician, Dr. Duhme, and another\n\nexamining physician, Dr. Emilio Jacques -- in support of his claim.\n\nDr. Jacques, an orthopedist, examined Buffonge on April 9, June 11,\n\nand July 9, 1997, and concluded each time that Buffonge was fully\n\ndisabled.5    His report of June 11, submitted with Buffonge's final\n\nappeal, stated that Buffonge had told him \"his pain is constant and\n\n. . . he is only able to maintain activity for one to two hours.\"\n\nDr. Jacques concluded that Buffonge was \"disabled and unable to\n\nresume his occupation\" and that the disability was causally related\n\nto his 1993 work accident.\n\n             A follow-up examination by Dr. Jacques, conducted on\n\nAugust 27, 1997, produced a report that Buffonge submitted as a\n\nsupplement to the appeal.       In the August 27 report Dr. Jacques\n\ndetailed his findings on examination and then reiterated the\n\nconclusion he had reached in all his earlier reports, stating:\n\n\n\n5\n  Dr. Jacques used phrases ranging from \"disabled\" to \"totally and\npermanently disabled.\"\n\n                                  -11-\n\f\"[I]n my opinion [Buffonge] is disabled from any gainful employment\n\nat the present time.\"    He also added:\n\n           In my opinion he is disabled from repetitive\n           bending,   lifting,   pushing,  pulling   and\n           carrying over fifteen to twenty pounds and he\n           is disabled from any repetitive squatting and\n           crawling positions.\n\n           The letter from Dr. Duhme, dated July 16, 1997, stated\n\nthe   doctor's   conclusion,   based    on   numerous   examinations   of\n\nBuffonge,6 that Buffonge was \"completely disabled by chronic neck\n\npain due to cervical disc disease and low back pain due to lumbar\n\ndisc disease.\"    He wrote that Buffonge was \"unable to perform any\n\njob that I can think of,\" that \"[e]ither sustained activity or\n\nsustained sitting will aggravate these pains,\" and that Buffonge\n\nwas \"unable to devote his attentions to any work.\"\n\n           As part of its handling of Buffonge's appeal, Prudential\n\nhired Dr. Jonathan Rutchik as a consultant.        Rutchik spent a total\n\nof three hours reviewing Buffonge's records and writing a report;\n\nhe did not examine Buffonge personally.           In his report, dated\n\nOctober 31, 1997, Dr. Rutchik wrote that \"a consensus exists about\n\nthe fact that Mr. Boffonge [sic] can perform work tasks such as\n\nsedentary duties and keyboard work.\"         He therefore concluded that\n\n\n\n\n6\n    It is unclear from the record whether           Dr. Duhme examined\nBuffonge on July 16 or, if not, how recently       he had last examined\nhim.   It is clear, however, that he was           Buffonge's treating\nphysician and had examined him on numerous         occasions from 1993\nthrough 1996.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fBuffonge could have performed the largely desk-bound duties of his\n\njob as a field logistics coordinator at Wang.\n\n            Dr. Rutchik reached this conclusion by parsing and in\n\npart disregarding the findings of physicians who had examined\n\nBuffonge.    For example, he quoted Dr. Jacques' assessment that\n\nBuffonge was \"disabled from repetitive bending, lifting, pushing,\n\npulling and carrying over fifteen to twenty pounds\" and followed it\n\nwith this comment: \"Dr. Jacques was specific about the tasks that\n\nMr. Buffonge could not do and thus inferred that there were jobs he\n\ncould do.\"    He thus ignored Dr. Jacques' statement in the same\n\nreport that Buffonge was \"disabled from any gainful employment at\n\nthe present time.\" As to Dr. Duhme's conclusion, based on multiple\n\nphysical examinations and years of handling Buffonge's case, that\n\n\"[e]ither sustained activity or sustained sitting will aggravate\n\nthese   pains,\"   Dr.   Rutchik   wrote:   \"[t]his   letter   provided   no\n\nobjective evidence that he has a condition where he could not do\n\nsustained sitting or sustained activity.\"        He did not address Dr.\n\nDuhme's statements in the same letter that Buffonge was \"unable to\n\nperform any job that I can think of\" and \"unable to devote his\n\nattentions to any work.\"\n\n            Prudential subsequently denied Buffonge's appeal in a\n\nletter dated November 25, 1997.      It stated:\n\n            [B]ased on a review of [Buffonge's] medical\n            file, the restrictions provided by Dr. Kermond\n            on June 26, 1996 and by Dr. Jacques on August\n            27, 1997 and the information provided by Dr.\n\n                                   -13-\n\f             Rutchik, we do not find that Mr. Buffonge's\n             symptoms impaired him from performing the\n             duties of his occupation for the period\n             February 21, 1996 through August 20, 1996.\n             Therefore, we are upholding our decision to\n             deny Mr. Buffonge's claim . . . .\n\nPrudential    thus    identified    four   bases   for   its    denial:   (1)\n\nBuffonge's full medical file, (2) the Kermond report, (3) the\n\nAugust 27 Jacques report, and (4) the Rutchik report.\n\n                                     II.\n\n             Buffonge filed suit on November 21, 2003 for review of\n\nPrudential's denial pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income\n\nSecurity Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.                 Specifically,\n\nBuffonge sought relief under Section 502, ERISA's civil enforcement\n\nprovision, which permits a participant in an ERISA-covered benefit\n\nplan to sue \"to recover benefits due\" and \"to enforce . . . rights\"\n\nunder the plan.      29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B).7     Buffonge argued that\n\nWang and Prudential violated the plan's terms and wrongfully denied\n\nhim long-term disability coverage; he sought a retroactive award of\n\nbenefits.8\n\n             The parties agreed that the Wang benefits plan confers\n\ndiscretionary     authority    to    the   administrator       to   determine\n\n\n\n7\n   Buffonge did not identify in his complaint which subsection of\nSection 502 he was relying on.    However, given his request for\nretroactive benefits, subsection (a)(1)(B) is most directly\napplicable.\n8\n  At oral argument he requested a remand to the plan administrator\nas an alternative remedy.\n\n                                    -14-\n\feligibility for benefits.   As the district court noted, that meant\n\nPrudential's decision to deny Buffonge benefits was subject to\n\ndeference, to be reversed only if \"arbitrary, capricious, or an\n\nabuse of discretion.\"   Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 360 F.3d\n\n211, 212-13 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nUnder the \"arbitrary and capricious\" framework, as applied to ERISA\n\nreview, a decision will be upheld \"if it is reasoned and supported\n\nby substantial evidence.\"     Id. at 213.\n\n          On October 20, 2004, Wang and Prudential moved for\n\nsummary judgment, arguing that their decision to deny benefits was\n\nsupported by substantial evidence and therefore was not arbitrary\n\nor capricious.   Buffonge filed an opposition and cross-motion for\n\nsummary judgment, arguing that Dr. Rutchik's report was skewed,\n\nthat Prudential relied on it in denying him benefits, and that as\n\na result Prudential did not give adequate weight to the conclusions\n\nof his treating physicians.    He did not argue that the conclusions\n\nof his treating physicians deserved special status -- nor could he\n\nhave, given the Supreme Court's holding that \"courts have no\n\nwarrant to require administrators automatically to accord special\n\nweight to the opinions of a claimant's physician.\"   Black & Decker\n\nDisability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S. 822, 834 (2003).\n\n          Applying the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard, the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for Wang and Prudential.\n\nThe court began by finding that, contrary to Buffonge's contention,\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fDr.   Rutchik's    report   did    not   \"ignore\"   or   \"intentionally\n\nmisinterpret\" the conclusions of Dr. Duhme and Dr. Jacques.       This\n\nwas so for two reasons.      First, the court noted, Dr. Rutchik's\n\nreport contained multiple references to and repeated discussion of\n\nthe other doctors' reports.       Second, the court in essence agreed\n\nwith Dr. Rutchik's parsing of the Jacques report.9           Since the\n\nRutchik report was valid, the court reasoned, Prudential had been\n\nfaced with a garden-variety conflicting-evidence situation, and the\n\ncase therefore fit within the rule that the existence of medical\n\nevidence pointing in two directions does not render arbitrary or\n\ncapricious a plan administrator's decision to credit one viewpoint\n\nor the other.     See, e.g., Leahy v. Raytheon Co., 315 F.3d 11, 19\n\n(1st Cir. 2002); Vlass v. Raytheon Employees Disability Trust, 244\n\nF.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2001); Gannon, 360 F.3d at 213.        From this\n\ngrant of summary judgment Buffonge timely appealed.\n\n\n\n\n9\n   It wrote: \"The obvious implication of [Dr. Jacques' statement\nlisting activities Buffonge could not perform] is that plaintiff\ncould perform work so long as it did not involve those specific,\nprohibited activities. Plaintiff attempts to diffuse Dr. Jacques'\nstatement by arguing that it was superceded by the Doctor's\neventual conclusion that Buffonge is 'disabled' but that\nconstruction is unpersuasive because placing emphasis upon only the\nlatter statement would transform the former, more specific,\nstatement into meaningless surplusage.\"\n\n                                  -16-\n\f                                    III.\n\n           Our review of the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment10 on the administrative record is de novo.          Glista v. Unum\n\nLife Ins. Co. of Am., 378 F.3d 113, 125 (1st Cir. 2004).             We, like\n\nthe district court, must defer to the claims administrator's\n\nbenefits   decision,   disturbing    it    only   if   it   was   \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or an abuse of discretion.\"           Gannon, 360 F.3d at 212-\n\n13.11\n\n           Buffonge's argument focuses most heavily on the Rutchik\n\nreport.     Buffonge    argues   that      Dr.    Rutchik    distorted   and\n\nmisrepresented the medical record, discounted conclusions by Dr.\n\nDuhme and Dr. Jacques that Buffonge was fully disabled, and falsely\n\nclaimed a \"consensus\" that Buffonge could perform sedentary work.\n\n\n\n10\n     \"[I]n an ERISA case where review is based only on the\nadministrative record before the plan administrator and is an\nultimate conclusion as to disability to be drawn from the facts,\nsummary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the issue.\"\nOrndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 404 F.3d 510, 517 (1st Cir.\n2005). \"This means the non-moving party is not entitled to the\nusual inferences in its favor.\" Id.\n11\n   This same standard has been described in other language. This\ncourt has said, for example, that to pass \"arbitrary and\ncapricious\" review in the ERISA context a decision must be\n\"reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.\" Glista, 378\nF.3d at 126.    It also has said an administrator's decision is\narbitrary   and   capricious    if   \"the   insurer's   eligibility\ndetermination was unreasonable in light of the information\navailable to it,\" Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life & Accident Ins.\nCo., 230 F.3d 415, 419 (1st Cir. 2000), and that \"the arbitrary and\ncapricious standard is functionally equivalent to the abuse of\ndiscretion standard,\" Wright v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. Group\nBenefits Plan, 402 F.3d 67, 74 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                    -17-\n\fHe argues that Prudential was intimately familiar with Buffonge's\n\nmedical records, and it therefore had to know that Dr. Rutchik was\n\nmisreading the Jacques and Duhme reports.            He says Prudential's\n\nheavy reliance on the Rutchik report, combined with its citation of\n\nthe Jacques report as support for its decision when the report\n\nclearly cut the other way, renders the decision arbitrary and\n\ncapricious.      We agree.\n\nA.          The Evidence\n\n            As previously noted, Prudential cited four pieces of\n\nevidence in support of its final decision: (1) Buffonge's medical\n\nfile as a whole, (2) the Kermond report, (3) the August 27 Jacques\n\nreport, and (4) the Rutchik report.         Of these four, at least two --\n\nthe Rutchik report and the Jacques report -- do not provide\n\nreasoned support for Prudential's decision.               We examine them in\n\nturn.\n\n            1.       The Rutchik report\n\n            Dr. Rutchik's report suffers from fundamental flaws.              As\n\nan initial matter, Dr. Rutchik's conclusion that \"a consensus\n\nexists\"   that    Buffonge   could   perform   a   desk    job   is   far   from\n\naccurate.    Buffonge's medical record as of October 1997, the date\n\nof Rutchik's report, contained at least three recent reports from\n\nDr. Jacques concluding just the opposite.            Dr. Rutchik also had\n\nbefore him the reports of Dr. Duhme, Buffonge's longtime treating\n\nphysician, who had repeatedly examined Buffonge and deemed him\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\ffully disabled, and who had stated that very summer that Buffonge\n\ncould not engage in \"sustained sitting\" or \"devote his attentions\n\nto any work.\"     The Duhme reports alone preclude Dr. Rutchik's\n\nfinding of \"a consensus\" that Buffonge could perform desk work.\n\nSimilarly, his conclusion that there was no \"objective\" evidence to\n\nsupport Dr. Duhme's conclusion is contradicted by Dr. Duhme's\n\npersonal observations on examination of Buffonge.\n\n            Dr. Rutchik's parsing of Dr. Jacques' August 27 report is\n\nalso, we think, not a fair reading.     The Jacques report's explicit\n\nstatement that Buffonge was \"disabled from any gainful employment\"\n\n(emphasis added) does not lend itself to the inference that \"there\n\nwere jobs that [Buffonge] could do.\"        This is especially true\n\nconsidering that Dr. Jacques had filed at least three other reports\n\nconcluding that Buffonge was fully disabled.\n\n            The flaws in the Rutchik report are crucial to our\n\nanalysis for several reasons.     The report's mischaracterizations\n\nare material, and so it does not provide support for Prudential's\n\ndecision.   Further, the fact that Prudential relied on the Rutchik\n\nreport at all brings into question the integrity of Prudential's\n\ndecision-making process in this case. Prudential had before it all\n\nof Buffonge's records, and it had to be aware that the Rutchik\n\nreport misconstrued the conclusions of Buffonge's doctors.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f             2.      The August 27 Jacques report\n\n             Prudential also relied in part on \"the restrictions\n\nprovided by . . . Dr. Jacques on August 27, 1997.\"                    But Dr.\n\nJacques' listing of physical activities Buffonge could not perform\n\ndid not create the inference that any activity not on the list was\n\none Buffonge could perform.       Dr. Jacques began the crucial passage\n\nby stating that Buffonge was \"disabled from any gainful employment\n\nat the present time.\"       In light of that unequivocal statement, the\n\nspecifics that follow -- disabled from bending, lifting, etc. --\n\nappear to us illustrative.       It would make no sense for Dr. Jacques\n\nto   have   stated   that   Buffonge   was   \"disabled   from   any   gainful\n\nemployment\" and then in the very next sentence to have implied that\n\nthere was in fact gainful employment he could perform. Dr. Jacques\n\nhad also deemed Buffonge fully disabled in all of his other\n\nreports; Prudential's reading of the exemplars as refuting Dr.\n\nJacques' consistent conclusion that Buffonge was fully disabled is\n\nsimply unreasonable.        The August 27 report therefore does not\n\nsupport     Prudential's    conclusion     that   Buffonge   could    perform\n\nsedentary work.12\n\n\n12\n    The district court agreed with Prudential's reading of the\nJacques report. However, we owe no deference to the district court\nin this setting, see Glista, 378 F.3d at 125, and we simply\ndisagree with its analysis. In describing the Jacques report, the\ndistrict court wrote that Dr. Jacques first listed Buffonge's\nspecific disabilities and then wrote that he was \"disabled.\" In\nthat context, it wrote, crediting only the latter statement \"would\ntransform the former, more specific, statement into meaningless\nsurplusage.\"   But in fact, Dr. Jacques wrote not simply that\n\n                                    -20-\n\fB.            Analysis\n\n              In sum, we find that two of Prudential's four cited\n\npieces   of    evidence   fail    to   provide   reasoned   support   for   its\n\nconclusion; we also find that Prudential's willingness to rely on\n\na report it knew or should have known to be misleading, and its\n\nmischaracterization of the conclusions of Dr. Jacques, raises\n\nconcerns about the fairness of its decision-making process.                  The\n\nquestion is whether these flaws render the decision \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or an abuse of discretion.\"           Gannon, 360 F.3d at 213.\n\nWe find that they do.\n\n              An administrator's decision must be \"reasoned\" to survive\n\n\"arbitrary and capricious\" review, Gannon, 360 F.3d at 213, and we\n\ncannot say that a decision relying on multiple pieces of faulty\n\nevidence was \"reasoned.\"         See id. at 214-15 (finding that a claims\n\nadministrator \"reasonably relied\" on evidence only after confirming\n\nthat the evidence was \"credible\" and \"reliable\").                Further, in\n\ngiving   content    to    \"arbitrary    and   capricious\"   review    in    this\n\ncontext, we find it useful to consider other ERISA provisions. Cf.\n\nGlobal NAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New England, Inc., 396 F.3d 16, 24\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (noting that statutory subsections must be read in\n\nlight of structure and intent of the larger statute).            Section 503\n\n\nJacques was \"disabled,\" but \"disabled from any gainful employment.\"\nFurther, he made this statement first and followed it with a list\nof specifics, not the other way around.       The passage is most\nreasonably read as a categorical statement of total disability\nfollowed by a list of examples.\n\n                                       -21-\n\fof ERISA, for example, states in relevant part that \"every employee\n\nbenefit plan shall . . . afford a reasonable opportunity to any\n\nparticipant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and\n\nfair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision\n\ndenying the claim.\"      29 U.S.C. § 1133 (emphasis added).          While this\n\nlanguage refers to the benefit plan itself (and to procedural\n\nsafeguards), it also has some substantive content.               One oft-quoted\n\ndecision has held that the \"full and fair review\" verbiage \"must be\n\nconstrued . . . to protect a plan participant from arbitrary or\n\nunprincipled decision-making.\"             Grossmuller v. Int'l Union, UAW,\n\nLocal 813, 715 F.2d 853, 857 (3d Cir. 1983).                     \"Unprincipled\n\ndecision-making\" of the sort forbidden by Section 503 is also\n\n\"arbitrary\" (i.e. not \"reasoned\") within the meaning of our review\n\nunder Section 502.         This does not mean that every perceived\n\nunfairness rises to the level of arbitrariness.\n\n           We address Wang and Prudential's two main arguments to\n\nthe contrary.      First, they argue, the decision was based on\n\nsubstantial   evidence,     and    must     be   upheld,   because   Prudential\n\nconsidered not just the Rutchik report, but Buffonge's entire\n\nmedical record, some of which supports Prudential's decision. This\n\nargument ignores the requirement that the decision must not be\n\narbitrary.    Given the flaws present here, Prudential and Wang's\n\nargument   must   boil    down    to   a    claim   that   an   administrator's\n\narbitrary analysis should be ignored if the end result -- denial of\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fbenefits -- can nonetheless be saved by a single valid piece of\n\nevidence that supports it.          The argument would be stronger if the\n\nevidence here compelled or virtually compelled a conclusion that\n\nBuffonge was not disabled.          That is not the case; Buffonge's claim\n\nof disability is a serious one, and he has been prejudiced by the\n\nprocess.    We   do   not    know    what    the   administrator   would    have\n\ndetermined if the process had been less flawed.\n\n           Second,    Wang    and    Prudential     reiterate   the   district\n\ncourt's analysis, citing Vlass for the proposition that \"[t]he\n\nexistence of contradictory evidence does not, in itself, make the\n\nadministrator's decision arbitrary.\" 244 F.3d at 30. The point is\n\ntrue but not pertinent here.13\n\n                                       IV.\n\n           Having     concluded      that    Prudential's    decision      fails\n\n\"arbitrary and capricious\" review, we are left to consider the\n\nremedy.    There is no question that this court has the power to\n\nremand to the claims administrator; it also has the power, in\n\nappropriate cases, to award benefits to the disability claimant.14\n\n\n13\n     As the Seventh Circuit said in a similar context, \"[w]e\nemphasize . . . that we neither determine whether [Buffonge] is\ndisabled, nor whether [Prudential's] decision was incorrect, rather\nonly that [Prudential] denied [Buffonge's] benefits in an arbitrary\nand capricious manner.\" Quinn v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield Ass'n,\n161 F.3d 472, 476 (7th Cir. 1998).\n14\n     This is true despite the fact that 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B),\nthe subsection most directly relevant to Buffonge's claim, does not\nexplicitly authorize administrative remand as a remedy. Numerous\ndecisions by this court and others have ordered, or approved in\n\n                                      -23-\n\fSee Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320 F.3d 11, 24 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)   (\"Once     a   court   finds    that       an   administrator    has    acted\n\narbitrarily and capriciously . . . the court can either remand the\n\ncase    to   the   administrator       for     a    renewed      evaluation   of   the\n\nclaimant's case, or it can award a retroactive reinstatement of\n\nbenefits.\").\n\n             The question, then, is which of these remedies is more\n\nappropriate here.        Some courts addressing similar fact patterns\n\nhave leaned toward categorical rules.                   See, e.g, Quinn v. Blue\n\nCross & Blue Shield Ass'n, 161 F.3d 472, 477 (7th Cir. 1998)\n\n(holding that retroactive award is usually proper when claimant had\n\nbenefits and lost them because of arbitrary conduct and/or when no\n\nevidence     supported    denial,      while       remand   is    appropriate   where\n\ndecision-maker \"fails to make adequate findings or fails to provide\n\nan adequate reasoning\").            This court, while acknowledging that\n\nframework, see Cook, 320 F.3d at 24, has taken a more flexible\n\napproach: it has held that \"the variety of situations is so great\"\n\nin ERISA review that the court must have \"considerable discretion\"\n\nto craft a remedy after finding a mistake in the denial of\n\nbenefits.     Id.; see also Glista, 378 F.3d at 131-32 (concluding\n\nthat where the administrator attempts to rely on a new rationale on\n\n\n\ntheory, remand to the administrator where arbitrariness is found in\nthe course of 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) review, see, e.g., Cook,\n320 F.3d at 24; Quinn, 161 F.3d at 477, and we have seen none\nholding that remand is impermissible.\n\n                                        -24-\n\fappeal, the court's response and the remedy should be resolved on\n\na case-by-case basis, in light of the facts and equities).\n\n          Here,    the   problem     is   not   that   Buffonge   was   denied\n\nbenefits to which he was clearly entitled; the evidence does not\n\ncompel such an outcome.       The problem is with the integrity of\n\nPrudential's decision-making process.           The appropriate response is\n\nto let Buffonge have the benefit of an untainted process.15                See\n\nQuinn, 161 F.3d at 478 (finding that where administrator's decision\n\nwas faulty but it was not \"clear-cut that it was unreasonable\" to\n\ndeny benefits, remand was appropriate because a benefits award\n\n\"might provide [claimant] with an economic windfall should she be\n\ndetermined   not   disabled   upon    a    proper   reconsideration\");    cf.\n\nDigregorio v.

The plaintiff appeals and asserts that his ERISA rights were violated because the administrator relied on material mischaracterizations of the medical record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claims administrator, Prudential Insurance Company of America, and co-appellee Getronics Wang Co., LLC, the employer, stated that they based their denial of long-term disability benefits to former Wang employee Thomas Buffonge on four pieces of evidence. The denial rested heavily, but not exclusively, on the opinion of Dr. Jonathan Rutchik, a consultant hired by Prudential who did not examine Buffonge but who reviewed Buffonge's medical history and concluded that there was a \"consensus\" that Buffonge could perform sedentary duties, such as keyboard work. In fact, the medical records showed that no such consensus existed, and, in other ways, Dr. Rutchik's report materially mischaracterized Buffonge's medical history. Prudential also rested its benefits denial on the report of another physician, but that report supported the grant, not the denial, of benefits. Further, Buffonge's medical records, on which Prudential also purportedly relied, demonstrated the two points made above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the process used was materially tainted, and the taint was sufficiently prejudicial, so as to render the process arbitrary. We remand to the district court to remand to the claims administrator for a new review of Buffonge's claim. We emphasize that we do not reach the issue of whether Buffonge was disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the record which was before the claims administrator. <i>See Liston v. Unum Corp. Officer Severance Plan,</i> 330 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Where . . . review is under the arbitrariness standard, the ordinary question is whether the administrator's action on the record before him was unreasonable.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Buffonge's Medical History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge began working for Wang<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in 1983. At that time, he became a participant in Wang's employee benefits plan, which included a long-term disability benefits program; Wang contracted with Prudential to provide the program, and Prudential serves as the program's claims administrator. The plan provides that an employee is eligible for long-term disability benefits after he or she has been \"totally disabled\" for 26 weeks. \"Total disability\" exists when the following conditions are met: (1) Due to Sickness or accidental injury, both of these are true:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) You are not able to perform, for wage or profit, the material and substantial duties of your occupation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) After the Initial Duration of a period of Total Disability, you are not able to perform for wage or profit the material and substantial duties of any job for which you are reasonably fitted by your education, training or experience. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) You are not working at any job for wage or profit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) You are under the regular care of a Doctor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Buffonge was a \"field logistics coordinator\" at Wang. The job involved helping track and ship computer parts to different offices across the country; it required some lifting as well as computer and other desk work. In June 1993, Buffonge injured his neck and back while moving computer parts at the office. His discomfort worsened as the weeks passed, and, by July, Buffonge was reporting severe pain in his chest, radiating into his left arm and elbow. On July 28, 1993, examining physician Dr. Wendell Pierce diagnosed \"cervical disc disease with left radiculitis\" and wrote that Buffonge was \"in a great degree of discomfort.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge took leave from work on temporary disability from August 1993 until April 1994. He then returned to work for one week, but suffered pain while driving to and from the office, and so took leave again until early November 1994. Buffonge was treated repeatedly during this period for continuing pain in his neck, back, and chest. In August 1994, Dr. Stephen Lipson examined Buffonge on referral from Dr. James Bayley, one of Buffonge's regular physicians. Dr. Lipson diagnosed Buffonge as suffering from at least one and possibly two herniated discs; he described Buffonge's pain as \"worse with sitting, standing, and lifting, better with walking and better with bedrest.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge also saw Dr. David Duhme, a specialist in internal medicine at Harvard University Health Services, who had served as Buffonge's main treating physician since soon after his initial injury. In a report dated July 20, 1994, Dr. Duhme stated that he \"ha[d] been seeing [Buffonge] frequently\" and had referred him for orthopedic evaluation. He stated that Buffonge was \"frustrated at his repeated failures to return to work without aggravating the pain.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge's personnel records show that he had been placed on modified duty perhaps as early as the summer of 1993: thereafter, while he still had the mostly desk-bound duties of a \"field logistics coordinator,\" those duties were altered to avoid regular lifting and other physical labor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Despite these accommodations, Buffonge's November 1994 return to Wang lasted less than one month. On December 5, 1994, Buffonge visited Dr. Duhme for a follow-up examination. Dr. Duhme's report stated that Buffonge \"tried to return to work but now is out of work again due to neck pain radiating to the [left] arm with numbness in the [left] fingers . . . . [H]e would stand all day at work because the pain was worse sitting.\" He diagnosed Buffonge as suffering from both cervical and lumbar disc disease.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1995, Buffonge attempted another return to work, but his attendance during the months that followed was sporadic at best: he was unable to work a full week, and even when he was at work he reported an intermittent inability to concentrate due to episodes of severe pain. In September 1995, Buffonge was examined by Dr. John F. Duff at the request of Wang's lawyers; Duff reported that Buffonge \"has headaches . . . and he says that he has trouble driving and by the end of the day, his low back gets sore and he moves from different positions but apparently continues to have the complaints.\" Buffonge also told Dr. Duff that he \"has chest pains when he sits too long and now gets low back pain.\" Dr. Duff concluded that despite his pain, Buffonge should have been able to perform a full day's work so long as he shifted positions during the work day and avoided heavy lifting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By October 6, 1995, when he saw Dr. Duhme again, Buffonge was reporting serious pain, especially late in the day and late in the week. Dr. Duhme examined him that day; in the diagnosis section of his report he again wrote \"cervical disc disease\" and \"lumbar disc disease,\" and this time added that the latter was \"becoming chronic pain.\" Dr. Duhme concluded that Buffonge needed to take some time off of work. Later in October, Buffonge tried to go to work once again, but he experienced such intense pain that he \"had to get down on his hands and knees\" to control it. He visited Duhme's office that afternoon; Duhme examined Buffonge and observed in his report that \"[w]hen he straightens up [from a bent-over position] his whole right side of the back is bulging with muscle spasm.\" He diagnosed \"[e]xacerbation of lumbar intervertebral disc disease with objective signs of pain and spasm.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 9, 1995, Buffonge again visited Dr. Duhme, who reported that Buffonge \"[u]sually . . . goes into work, tries to work, and may have to stop and lie down. He does not think he can carry on.\" Dr. Duhme assessed him as suffering from \"[i]ncreasing pain from cervical disc disease\" and gave him a letter authorizing \"a medical leave of absence for a few weeks.\" It is not clear precisely when Buffonge's leave began; however, the record indicates that he missed work for five consecutive weeks in December 1995 and January 1996 while receiving treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 18, 1996, a report by Dr. Frederick Mansfield &#8212; a spinal surgeon who examined Buffonge on referral from Dr. Duhme &#8212; noted that Buffonge had \"developed worse pain in his head and neck\" two months earlier. Dr. Mansfield's report diagnosed Buffonge with \"[c]ervical and lumbar disc degeneration\" and stated that \"[a]ny exercise or increased bending or twisting increases his pain.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge returned to work yet again in late January 1996. He had been attending physical therapy for some time as part of his treatment, and on February 5, 1996, he was discharged from the physical therapy program; the therapist wrote in his discharge statement that he was \"pain-free and [symptom]-free when last seen.\" On February 15, however, Buffonge visited Dr. Duhme again and reported that he had been suffering \"severe pain.\" Dr. Duhme assessed Buffonge as having \"chronic neck pain due to cervical disc disease\" and reported that Buffonge was undergoing acupuncture and would be in for follow-up evaluations. Six days later, on February 21, 1996, Buffonge left work because of the pain; it would prove to be his last day on the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 1996, Buffonge applied to Prudential for long-term disability benefits. In the \"Attending Physician\" section of the application,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Dr. Duhme reported his diagnosis that Buffonge suffered from \"chronic neck, shoulder and chest pain aggravated by work,\" and that \"Chronic Intervertebral Disc disease\" resulted in Buffonge's \"long term disability.\" He reported that Buffonge had tried many times to return to work and failed because \"pain returns whenever he returns to work for more than 2 wks.\" Asked whether Buffonge could work part-time or in another type of job, Dr. Duhme wrote, \"don't know but probably not.\" Asked what work duties Buffonge could perform, he wrote, \"none.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Dr. Duhme saw Buffonge several times during the spring and early summer. He reported each time that Buffonge was in pain and was still disabled from working.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 27, 1996, another doctor examined Buffonge at Prudential's request. Dr. William Kermond found that Buffonge suffered from disc herniation and that physical examination substantiated Buffonge's complaints of neck, arm, and chest pain. Dr. Kermond also stated that Buffonge's injuries appeared causally related to his 1993 accident at work. However, he concluded that Buffonge could perform a desk job with phone and computer duties, so long as he did not engage in heavy lifting or frequent overhead work. As the record shows, Buffonge had been placed in exactly such a desk job as early as 1993, and his medical history thereafter was described above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Denial of Benefits and Subsequent Appeals</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prudential examined Buffonge's medical records and denied his claim for long-term disability benefits on September 20, 1996. It noted that (1) the February 1996 physical therapy discharge summary had deemed Buffonge pain-free, (2) Dr. Kermond had opined that Buffonge could perform a desk job, and (3) Wang had made physician-requested accommodations for Buffonge, including placing him on light duty and permitting him to get up and walk around every hour. It therefore concluded that there was \"no objective medical evidence in our file to support Total Disability.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge's employment was terminated on October 21, 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> A month later, he administratively appealed Prudential's benefits decision. Prudential upheld its denial in a letter dated November 26, 1996. It stated that Buffonge did not qualify for long-term disability because (1) according to Dr. Kermond, he could perform a job involving desk work or light lifting as of June 1996, and therefore (2) he had not been \"totally disabled\" for 26 weeks after he left work in February 1996, as required under the plan's definition of \"total disability.\" Buffonge again appealed, and Prudential affirmed its denial again, on the same grounds, in a letter dated June 9, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 25, 1997, Buffonge filed his final administrative appeal. This time he submitted additional reports and letters from two physicians &#8212; his primary physician, Dr. Duhme, and another examining physician, Dr. Emilio Jacques &#8212; in support of his claim. Dr. Jacques, an orthopedist, examined Buffonge on April 9, June 11, and July 9, 1997, and concluded each time that Buffonge was fully disabled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> His report of June 11, submitted with Buffonge's final appeal, stated that Buffonge had told him \"his pain is constant and . . . he is only able to maintain activity for one to two hours.\" Dr. Jacques concluded that Buffonge was \"disabled and unable to resume his occupation\" and that the disability was causally related to his 1993 work accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A follow-up examination by Dr. Jacques, conducted on August 27, 1997, produced a report that Buffonge submitted as a supplement to the appeal. In the August 27 report Dr. Jacques detailed his findings on examination and then reiterated the conclusion he had reached in all his earlier reports, stating: \"[I]n my opinion [Buffonge] is disabled from any gainful employment at the present time.\" He also added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my opinion he is disabled from repetitive bending, lifting, pushing, pulling and carrying over fifteen to twenty pounds and he is disabled from any repetitive squatting and crawling positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter from Dr. Duhme, dated July 16, 1997, stated the doctor's conclusion, based on numerous examinations of Buffonge,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> that Buffonge was \"completely disabled by chronic neck pain due to cervical disc disease and low back pain due to lumbar disc disease.\" He wrote that Buffonge was \"unable to perform any job that I can think of,\" that \"[e]ither sustained activity or sustained sitting will aggravate these pains,\" and that Buffonge was \"unable to devote his attentions to any work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of its handling of Buffonge's appeal, Prudential hired Dr. Jonathan Rutchik as a consultant. Rutchik spent a total of three hours reviewing Buffonge's records and writing a report; he did not examine Buffonge personally. In his report, dated October 31, 1997, Dr. Rutchik wrote that \"a consensus exists about the fact that Mr. Boffonge [sic] can perform work tasks such as sedentary duties and keyboard work.\" He therefore concluded that Buffonge could have performed the largely desk-bound duties of his job as a field logistics coordinator at Wang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Rutchik reached this conclusion by parsing and in part disregarding the findings of physicians who had examined Buffonge. For example, he quoted Dr. Jacques' assessment that Buffonge was \"disabled from repetitive bending, lifting, pushing, pulling and carrying over fifteen to twenty pounds\" and followed it with this comment: \"Dr. Jacques was specific about the tasks that Mr. Buffonge could not do and thus inferred that there were jobs he could do.\" He thus ignored Dr. Jacques' statement in the same report that Buffonge was \"disabled from any gainful employment at the present time.\" As to Dr. Duhme's conclusion, based on multiple physical examinations and years of handling Buffonge's case, that \"[e]ither sustained activity or sustained sitting will aggravate these pains,\" Dr. Rutchik wrote: \"[t]his letter provided no objective evidence that he has a condition where he could not do sustained sitting or sustained activity.\" He did not address Dr. Duhme's statements in the same letter that Buffonge was \"unable to perform any job that I can think of\" and \"unable to devote his attentions to any work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prudential subsequently denied Buffonge's appeal in a letter dated November 25, 1997. It stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[B]ased on a review of [Buffonge's] medical file, the restrictions provided by Dr. Kermond on June 26, 1996 and by Dr. Jacques on August 27, 1997 and the information provided by Dr. Rutchik, we do not find that Mr. Buffonge's symptoms impaired him from performing the duties of his occupation for the period February 21, 1996 through August 20, 1996. Therefore, we are upholding our decision to deny Mr. Buffonge's claim . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prudential thus identified four bases for its denial: (1) Buffonge's full medical file, (2) the Kermond report, (3) the August 27 Jacques report, and (4) the Rutchik report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge filed suit on November 21, 2003 for review of Prudential's denial pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 et seq. Specifically, Buffonge sought relief under Section 502, ERISA's civil enforcement provision, which permits a participant in an ERISA-covered benefit plan to sue \"to recover benefits due\" and \"to enforce. . . rights\" under the plan. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Buffonge argued that Wang and Prudential violated the plan's terms and wrongfully denied him long-term disability coverage; he sought a retroactive award of benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agreed that the Wang benefits plan confers discretionary authority to the administrator to determine eligibility for benefits. As the district court noted, that meant Prudential's decision to deny Buffonge benefits was subject to deference, to be reversed only if \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 360 F.3d 211, 212-13 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the \"arbitrary and capricious\" framework, as applied to ERISA review, a decision will be upheld \"if it is reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 213.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, 2004, Wang and Prudential moved for summary judgment, arguing that their decision to deny benefits was supported by substantial evidence and therefore was not arbitrary or capricious. Buffonge filed an opposition and cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that Dr. Rutchik's report was skewed, that Prudential relied on it in denying him benefits, and that as a result Prudential did not give adequate weight to the conclusions of his treating physicians. He did not argue that the conclusions of his treating physicians deserved special status &#8212; nor could he have, given the Supreme Court's holding that \"courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant's physician.\" <i>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord,</i> 538 U.S. 822, 834, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard, the district court granted summary judgment for Wang and Prudential. The court began by finding that, contrary to Buffonge's contention, Dr. Rutchik's report did not \"ignore\" or \"intentionally misinterpret\" the conclusions of Dr. Duhme and Dr. Jacques. This was so for two reasons. First, the court noted, Dr. Rutchik's report contained multiple references to and repeated discussion of the other doctors' reports. Second, the court in essence agreed with Dr. Rutchik's parsing of the Jacques report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Since the Rutchik report was valid, the court reasoned, Prudential had been faced with a garden-variety conflicting-evidence situation, and the case therefore fit within the rule that the existence of medical evidence pointing in two directions does not render arbitrary or capricious a plan administrator's decision to credit one viewpoint or the other. <i>See, e.g., Leahy v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 315 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Vlass v. Raytheon Employees Disability Trust,</i> 244 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 213. From this grant of summary judgment Buffonge timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> on the administrative record is de novo. <i>Glista v.

We, like the district court, must defer to the claims administrator's benefits decision, disturbing it only if it was \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 212-13.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge's argument focuses most heavily on the Rutchik report. Buffonge argues that Dr. Rutchik distorted and misrepresented the medical record, discounted conclusions by Dr. Duhme and Dr. Jacques that Buffonge was fully disabled, and falsely claimed a \"consensus\" that Buffonge could perform sedentary work. He argues that Prudential was intimately familiar with Buffonge's medical records, and it therefore had to know that Dr. Rutchik was misreading the Jacques and Duhme reports. He says Prudential's heavy reliance on the Rutchik report, combined with its citation of the Jacques report as support for its decision when the report clearly cut the other way, renders the decision arbitrary and capricious. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously noted, Prudential cited four pieces of evidence in support of its final decision: (1) Buffonge's medical file as a whole, (2) the Kermond report, (3) the August 27 Jacques report, and (4) the Rutchik report. Of these four, at least two &#8212; the Rutchik report and the Jacques report &#8212; do not provide reasoned support for Prudential's decision. We examine them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Rutchik report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Rutchik's report suffers from fundamental flaws. As an initial matter, Dr. Rutchik's conclusion that \"a consensus exists\" that Buffonge could perform a desk job is far from accurate. Buffonge's medical record as of October 1997, the date of Rutchik's report, contained at least three recent reports from Dr. Jacques concluding just the opposite. Dr. Rutchik also had before him the reports of Dr. Duhme, Buffonge's longtime treating physician, who had repeatedly examined Buffonge and deemed him fully disabled, and who had stated that very summer that Buffonge could not engage in \"sustained sitting\" or \"devote his attentions to any work.\" The Duhme reports alone preclude Dr. Rutchik's finding of \"a consensus\" that Buffonge could perform desk work. Similarly, his conclusion that there was no \"objective\" evidence to support Dr. Duhme's conclusion is contradicted by Dr. Duhme's personal observations on examination of Buffonge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Rutchik's parsing of Dr. Jacques' August 27 report is also, we think, not a fair reading. The Jacques report's explicit statement that Buffonge was \"disabled from <i>any gainful employment</i>\" (emphasis added) does not lend itself to the inference that \"there were jobs that [Buffonge] could do.\" This is especially true considering that Dr. Jacques had filed at least three other reports concluding that Buffonge was fully disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaws in the Rutchik report are crucial to our analysis for several reasons. The report's mischaracterizations are material, and so it does not provide support for Prudential's decision. Further, the fact that Prudential relied on the Rutchik report at all brings into question the integrity of Prudential's decision-making process in this case. Prudential had before it all of Buffonge's records, and it had to be aware that the Rutchik report misconstrued the conclusions of Buffonge's doctors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The August 27 Jacques report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prudential also relied in part on \"the restrictions provided by . . . Dr. Jacques on August 27, 1997.\" But Dr. Jacques' listing of physical activities Buffonge could not perform did not create the inference that any activity not on the list was one Buffonge <i>could</i> perform. Dr. Jacques began the crucial passage by stating that Buffonge was \"disabled from any gainful employment at the present time.\" In light of that unequivocal statement, the specifics that follow &#8212; disabled from bending, lifting, etc. &#8212; appear to us illustrative. It would make no sense for Dr. Jacques to have stated that Buffonge was \"disabled from any gainful employment\" and then in the very next sentence to have implied that there was in fact gainful employment he could perform. Dr. Jacques had also deemed Buffonge fully disabled in all of his other reports; Prudential's reading of the exemplars as refuting Dr. Jacques' consistent conclusion that Buffonge was fully disabled is simply unreasonable. The August 27 report therefore does not support Prudential's conclusion that Buffonge could perform sedentary work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find that two of Prudential's four cited pieces of evidence fail to provide reasoned support for its conclusion; we also find that Prudential's willingness to rely on a report it knew or should have known to be misleading, and its mischaracterization of the conclusions of Dr. Jacques, raises concerns about the fairness of its decision-making process. The question is whether these flaws render the decision \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 213. We find that they do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An administrator's decision must be \"reasoned\" to survive \"arbitrary and capricious\" review, <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 213, and we cannot say that a decision relying on multiple pieces of faulty evidence was \"reasoned.\" <i>See id.</i> at 214-15 (finding that a claims administrator \"reasonably relied\" on evidence only after confirming that the evidence was \"credible\" and \"reliable\"). Further, in giving content to \"arbitrary and capricious\" review in this context, we find it useful to consider other ERISA provisions. <i>Cf. Global Naps, Inc. v. Verizon New England, Inc.,</i> 396 F.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that statutory subsections must be read in light of structure and intent of the larger statute). Section 503 of ERISA, for example, states in relevant part that \"every employee benefit plan shall . . . afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for <i>a full and fair review</i> by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1133 (emphasis added). While this language refers to the benefit plan itself (and to procedural safeguards), it also has some substantive content. One oft-quoted decision has held that the \"full and fair review\" verbiage \"must be construed . . . to protect a plan participant from arbitrary or unprincipled decision-making.\" <i>Grossmuller v. Int'l Union, UAW, Local 813,</i> 715 F.2d 853, 857 (3d Cir.1983). \"Unprincipled decision-making\" of the sort forbidden by Section 503 is also \"arbitrary\" (i.e. not \"reasoned\") within the meaning of our review under Section 502. This does not mean that every perceived unfairness rises to the level of arbitrariness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address Wang and Prudential's two main arguments to the contrary. First, they argue, the decision was based on substantial evidence, and must be upheld, because Prudential considered not just the Rutchik report, but Buffonge's entire medical record, some of which supports Prudential's decision. This argument ignores the requirement that the decision must not be arbitrary. Given the flaws present here, Prudential and Wang's argument must boil down to a claim that an administrator's arbitrary analysis should be ignored if the end result &#8212; denial of benefits &#8212; can nonetheless be saved by a single valid piece of evidence that supports it. The argument would be stronger if the evidence here compelled or virtually compelled a conclusion that Buffonge was not disabled. That is not the case; Buffonge's claim of disability is a serious one, and he has been prejudiced by the process. We do not know what the administrator would have determined if the process had been less flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Wang and Prudential reiterate the district court's analysis, citing <i>Vlass</i> for the proposition that \"[t]he existence of contradictory evidence does not, in itself, make the administrator's decision arbitrary.\" 244 F.3d at 30. The point is true but not pertinent here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that Prudential's decision fails \"arbitrary and capricious\" review, we are left to consider the remedy. There is no question that this court has the power to remand to the claims administrator; it also has the power, in appropriate cases, to award benefits to the disability claimant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> <i>See Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> 320 F.3d 11, 24 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Once a court finds that an administrator has acted arbitrarily and capriciously . . . the court can either remand the case to the administrator for a renewed evaluation of the claimant's case, or it can award a retroactive reinstatement of benefits.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is which of these remedies is more appropriate here. Some courts addressing similar fact patterns have leaned toward categorical rules. <i>See, e.g., Quinn v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass'n,</i> 161 F.3d 472, 477 (7th Cir.1998) (holding that retroactive award is usually proper when claimant had benefits and lost them because of arbitrary conduct and/or when no evidence supported denial, while remand is appropriate where decision-maker \"fails to make adequate findings or fails to provide an adequate reasoning\"). This court, while acknowledging that framework, <i>see Cook,</i> 320 F.3d at 24, has taken a more flexible approach: it has held that \"the variety of situations is so great\" in ERISA review that the court must have \"considerable discretion\" to craft a remedy after finding a mistake in the denial of benefits. <i>Id.; see also Glista,</i> 378 F.3d at 131-32 (concluding that where the administrator attempts to rely on a new rationale on appeal, the court's response and the remedy should be resolved on a case-by-case basis, in light of the facts and equities).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the problem is not that Buffonge was denied benefits to which he was clearly entitled; the evidence does not compel such an outcome. The problem is with the integrity of Prudential's decision-making process. The appropriate response is to let Buffonge have the benefit of an untainted process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>See Quinn,</i> 161 F.3d at 478 (finding that where administrator's decision was faulty but it was not \"clear-cut that it was unreasonable\" to deny benefits, remand was appropriate because a benefits award \"might provide [claimant] with an economic windfall should she be determined not disabled upon a proper reconsideration\"); <i>cf.Digregorio v. Hartford Comprehensive Employee Benefit Serv. Co.,</i> 423 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.2005) (stating that in an ERISA Section 503 proceeding, remand is appropriate where administrator's procedural failings prejudiced claimant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the facts of this case, we <i>reverse</i> the grant of summary judgment to Prudential and Wang. We <i>remand</i> to the district court with instructions to enter judgment for Buffonge on his claim that the denial of benefits was arbitrary and, as the appropriate remedy, to remand the case to the plan administrator for proceedings consistent with this opinion. In our view, that includes the plan administrator taking new evidence should any party wish to submit the same. Costs are awarded to Buffonge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Chief Judge of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At that time, the employer was Wang Laboratories Inc.

The denial rested heavily, but not exclusively, on the opinion of Dr. Jonathan Rutchik, a consultant hired by Prudential who did not examine Buffonge but who reviewed Buffonge's medical history and concluded that there was a \"consensus\" that Buffonge could perform sedentary duties, such as keyboard work. In fact, the medical records showed that no such consensus existed, and, in other ways, Dr. Rutchik's report materially mischaracterized Buffonge's medical history. Prudential also rested its benefits denial on the report of another physician, but that report supported the grant, not the denial, of benefits.

The plan provides that an employee is eligible for long-term disability benefits after he or she has been \"totally disabled\" for 26 weeks. \"Total disability\" exists when the following conditions are met: (1) Due to Sickness or accidental injury, both of these are true:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) You are not able to perform, for wage or profit, the material and substantial duties of your occupation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) After the Initial Duration of a period of Total Disability, you are not able to perform for wage or profit the material and substantial duties of any job for which you are reasonably fitted by your education, training or experience. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) You are not working at any job for wage or profit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) You are under the regular care of a Doctor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Buffonge was a \"field logistics coordinator\" at Wang. The job involved helping track and ship computer parts to different offices across the country; it required some lifting as well as computer and other desk work. In June 1993, Buffonge injured his neck and back while moving computer parts at the office. His discomfort worsened as the weeks passed, and, by July, Buffonge was reporting severe pain in his chest, radiating into his left arm and elbow. On July 28, 1993, examining physician Dr. Wendell Pierce diagnosed \"cervical disc disease with left radiculitis\" and wrote that Buffonge was \"in a great degree of discomfort.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge took leave from work on temporary disability from August 1993 until April 1994. He then returned to work for one week, but suffered pain while driving to and from the office, and so took leave again until early November 1994. Buffonge was treated repeatedly during this period for continuing pain in his neck, back, and chest. In August 1994, Dr. Stephen Lipson examined Buffonge on referral from Dr. James Bayley, one of Buffonge's regular physicians. Dr. Lipson diagnosed Buffonge as suffering from at least one and possibly two herniated discs; he described Buffonge's pain as \"worse with sitting, standing, and lifting, better with walking and better with bedrest.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge also saw Dr. David Duhme, a specialist in internal medicine at Harvard University Health Services, who had served as Buffonge's main treating physician since soon after his initial injury. In a report dated July 20, 1994, Dr. Duhme stated that he \"ha[d] been seeing [Buffonge] frequently\" and had referred him for orthopedic evaluation. He stated that Buffonge was \"frustrated at his repeated failures to return to work without aggravating the pain.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge's personnel records show that he had been placed on modified duty perhaps as early as the summer of 1993: thereafter, while he still had the mostly desk-bound duties of a \"field logistics coordinator,\" those duties were altered to avoid regular lifting and other physical labor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Despite these accommodations, Buffonge's November 1994 return to Wang lasted less than one month. On December 5, 1994, Buffonge visited Dr. Duhme for a follow-up examination. Dr. Duhme's report stated that Buffonge \"tried to return to work but now is out of work again due to neck pain radiating to the [left] arm with numbness in the [left] fingers . . . . [H]e would stand all day at work because the pain was worse sitting.\" He diagnosed Buffonge as suffering from both cervical and lumbar disc disease.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1995, Buffonge attempted another return to work, but his attendance during the months that followed was sporadic at best: he was unable to work a full week, and even when he was at work he reported an intermittent inability to concentrate due to episodes of severe pain. In September 1995, Buffonge was examined by Dr. John F. Duff at the request of Wang's lawyers; Duff reported that Buffonge \"has headaches . . . and he says that he has trouble driving and by the end of the day, his low back gets sore and he moves from different positions but apparently continues to have the complaints.\" Buffonge also told Dr. Duff that he \"has chest pains when he sits too long and now gets low back pain.\" Dr. Duff concluded that despite his pain, Buffonge should have been able to perform a full day's work so long as he shifted positions during the work day and avoided heavy lifting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By October 6, 1995, when he saw Dr. Duhme again, Buffonge was reporting serious pain, especially late in the day and late in the week. Dr. Duhme examined him that day; in the diagnosis section of his report he again wrote \"cervical disc disease\" and \"lumbar disc disease,\" and this time added that the latter was \"becoming chronic pain.\" Dr. Duhme concluded that Buffonge needed to take some time off of work. Later in October, Buffonge tried to go to work once again, but he experienced such intense pain that he \"had to get down on his hands and knees\" to control it. He visited Duhme's office that afternoon; Duhme examined Buffonge and observed in his report that \"[w]hen he straightens up [from a bent-over position] his whole right side of the back is bulging with muscle spasm.\" He diagnosed \"[e]xacerbation of lumbar intervertebral disc disease with objective signs of pain and spasm.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 9, 1995, Buffonge again visited Dr. Duhme, who reported that Buffonge \"[u]sually . . . goes into work, tries to work, and may have to stop and lie down. He does not think he can carry on.\" Dr. Duhme assessed him as suffering from \"[i]ncreasing pain from cervical disc disease\" and gave him a letter authorizing \"a medical leave of absence for a few weeks.\" It is not clear precisely when Buffonge's leave began; however, the record indicates that he missed work for five consecutive weeks in December 1995 and January 1996 while receiving treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 18, 1996, a report by Dr. Frederick Mansfield &#8212; a spinal surgeon who examined Buffonge on referral from Dr. Duhme &#8212; noted that Buffonge had \"developed worse pain in his head and neck\" two months earlier. Dr. Mansfield's report diagnosed Buffonge with \"[c]ervical and lumbar disc degeneration\" and stated that \"[a]ny exercise or increased bending or twisting increases his pain.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge returned to work yet again in late January 1996. He had been attending physical therapy for some time as part of his treatment, and on February 5, 1996, he was discharged from the physical therapy program; the therapist wrote in his discharge statement that he was \"pain-free and [symptom]-free when last seen.\" On February 15, however, Buffonge visited Dr. Duhme again and reported that he had been suffering \"severe pain.\" Dr. Duhme assessed Buffonge as having \"chronic neck pain due to cervical disc disease\" and reported that Buffonge was undergoing acupuncture and would be in for follow-up evaluations. Six days later, on February 21, 1996, Buffonge left work because of the pain; it would prove to be his last day on the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 1996, Buffonge applied to Prudential for long-term disability benefits. In the \"Attending Physician\" section of the application,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Dr. Duhme reported his diagnosis that Buffonge suffered from \"chronic neck, shoulder and chest pain aggravated by work,\" and that \"Chronic Intervertebral Disc disease\" resulted in Buffonge's \"long term disability.\" He reported that Buffonge had tried many times to return to work and failed because \"pain returns whenever he returns to work for more than 2 wks.\" Asked whether Buffonge could work part-time or in another type of job, Dr. Duhme wrote, \"don't know but probably not.\" Asked what work duties Buffonge could perform, he wrote, \"none.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Dr. Duhme saw Buffonge several times during the spring and early summer. He reported each time that Buffonge was in pain and was still disabled from working.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 27, 1996, another doctor examined Buffonge at Prudential's request. Dr. William Kermond found that Buffonge suffered from disc herniation and that physical examination substantiated Buffonge's complaints of neck, arm, and chest pain. Dr. Kermond also stated that Buffonge's injuries appeared causally related to his 1993 accident at work. However, he concluded that Buffonge could perform a desk job with phone and computer duties, so long as he did not engage in heavy lifting or frequent overhead work. As the record shows, Buffonge had been placed in exactly such a desk job as early as 1993, and his medical history thereafter was described above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Denial of Benefits and Subsequent Appeals</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prudential examined Buffonge's medical records and denied his claim for long-term disability benefits on September 20, 1996. It noted that (1) the February 1996 physical therapy discharge summary had deemed Buffonge pain-free, (2) Dr. Kermond had opined that Buffonge could perform a desk job, and (3) Wang had made physician-requested accommodations for Buffonge, including placing him on light duty and permitting him to get up and walk around every hour. It therefore concluded that there was \"no objective medical evidence in our file to support Total Disability.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge's employment was terminated on October 21, 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> A month later, he administratively appealed Prudential's benefits decision. Prudential upheld its denial in a letter dated November 26, 1996. It stated that Buffonge did not qualify for long-term disability because (1) according to Dr. Kermond, he could perform a job involving desk work or light lifting as of June 1996, and therefore (2) he had not been \"totally disabled\" for 26 weeks after he left work in February 1996, as required under the plan's definition of \"total disability.\" Buffonge again appealed, and Prudential affirmed its denial again, on the same grounds, in a letter dated June 9, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 25, 1997, Buffonge filed his final administrative appeal. This time he submitted additional reports and letters from two physicians &#8212; his primary physician, Dr. Duhme, and another examining physician, Dr. Emilio Jacques &#8212; in support of his claim. Dr. Jacques, an orthopedist, examined Buffonge on April 9, June 11, and July 9, 1997, and concluded each time that Buffonge was fully disabled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> His report of June 11, submitted with Buffonge's final appeal, stated that Buffonge had told him \"his pain is constant and . . . he is only able to maintain activity for one to two hours.\" Dr. Jacques concluded that Buffonge was \"disabled and unable to resume his occupation\" and that the disability was causally related to his 1993 work accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A follow-up examination by Dr. Jacques, conducted on August 27, 1997, produced a report that Buffonge submitted as a supplement to the appeal. In the August 27 report Dr. Jacques detailed his findings on examination and then reiterated the conclusion he had reached in all his earlier reports, stating: \"[I]n my opinion [Buffonge] is disabled from any gainful employment at the present time.\" He also added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my opinion he is disabled from repetitive bending, lifting, pushing, pulling and carrying over fifteen to twenty pounds and he is disabled from any repetitive squatting and crawling positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter from Dr. Duhme, dated July 16, 1997, stated the doctor's conclusion, based on numerous examinations of Buffonge,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> that Buffonge was \"completely disabled by chronic neck pain due to cervical disc disease and low back pain due to lumbar disc disease.\" He wrote that Buffonge was \"unable to perform any job that I can think of,\" that \"[e]ither sustained activity or sustained sitting will aggravate these pains,\" and that Buffonge was \"unable to devote his attentions to any work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of its handling of Buffonge's appeal, Prudential hired Dr. Jonathan Rutchik as a consultant. Rutchik spent a total of three hours reviewing Buffonge's records and writing a report; he did not examine Buffonge personally. In his report, dated October 31, 1997, Dr. Rutchik wrote that \"a consensus exists about the fact that Mr. Boffonge [sic] can perform work tasks such as sedentary duties and keyboard work.\" He therefore concluded that Buffonge could have performed the largely desk-bound duties of his job as a field logistics coordinator at Wang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Rutchik reached this conclusion by parsing and in part disregarding the findings of physicians who had examined Buffonge. For example, he quoted Dr. Jacques' assessment that Buffonge was \"disabled from repetitive bending, lifting, pushing, pulling and carrying over fifteen to twenty pounds\" and followed it with this comment: \"Dr. Jacques was specific about the tasks that Mr. Buffonge could not do and thus inferred that there were jobs he could do.\" He thus ignored Dr. Jacques' statement in the same report that Buffonge was \"disabled from any gainful employment at the present time.\" As to Dr. Duhme's conclusion, based on multiple physical examinations and years of handling Buffonge's case, that \"[e]ither sustained activity or sustained sitting will aggravate these pains,\" Dr. Rutchik wrote: \"[t]his letter provided no objective evidence that he has a condition where he could not do sustained sitting or sustained activity.\" He did not address Dr. Duhme's statements in the same letter that Buffonge was \"unable to perform any job that I can think of\" and \"unable to devote his attentions to any work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prudential subsequently denied Buffonge's appeal in a letter dated November 25, 1997. It stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[B]ased on a review of [Buffonge's] medical file, the restrictions provided by Dr. Kermond on June 26, 1996 and by Dr. Jacques on August 27, 1997 and the information provided by Dr. Rutchik, we do not find that Mr. Buffonge's symptoms impaired him from performing the duties of his occupation for the period February 21, 1996 through August 20, 1996. Therefore, we are upholding our decision to deny Mr. Buffonge's claim . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prudential thus identified four bases for its denial: (1) Buffonge's full medical file, (2) the Kermond report, (3) the August 27 Jacques report, and (4) the Rutchik report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buffonge filed suit on November 21, 2003 for review of Prudential's denial pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 et seq. Specifically, Buffonge sought relief under Section 502, ERISA's civil enforcement provision, which permits a participant in an ERISA-covered benefit plan to sue \"to recover benefits due\" and \"to enforce. . . rights\" under the plan. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Buffonge argued that Wang and Prudential violated the plan's terms and wrongfully denied him long-term disability coverage; he sought a retroactive award of benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agreed that the Wang benefits plan confers discretionary authority to the administrator to determine eligibility for benefits. As the district court noted, that meant Prudential's decision to deny Buffonge benefits was subject to deference, to be reversed only if \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gannon v. Metro. Life Ins.

Under the \"arbitrary and capricious\" framework, as applied to ERISA review, a decision will be upheld \"if it is reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 213.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, 2004, Wang and Prudential moved for summary judgment, arguing that their decision to deny benefits was supported by substantial evidence and therefore was not arbitrary or capricious. Buffonge filed an opposition and cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that Dr. Rutchik's report was skewed, that Prudential relied on it in denying him benefits, and that as a result Prudential did not give adequate weight to the conclusions of his treating physicians. He did not argue that the conclusions of his treating physicians deserved special status &#8212; nor could he have, given the Supreme Court's holding that \"courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant's physician.\" <i>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v.

The court began by finding that, contrary to Buffonge's contention, Dr. Rutchik's report did not \"ignore\" or \"intentionally misinterpret\" the conclusions of Dr. Duhme and Dr. Jacques. This was so for two reasons. First, the court noted, Dr. Rutchik's report contained multiple references to and repeated discussion of the other doctors' reports. Second, the court in essence agreed with Dr. Rutchik's parsing of the Jacques report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Since the Rutchik report was valid, the court reasoned, Prudential had been faced with a garden-variety conflicting-evidence situation, and the case therefore fit within the rule that the existence of medical evidence pointing in two directions does not render arbitrary or capricious a plan administrator's decision to credit one viewpoint or the other. <i>See, e.g., Leahy v.

Buffonge argues that Dr. Rutchik distorted and misrepresented the medical record, discounted conclusions by Dr. Duhme and Dr. Jacques that Buffonge was fully disabled, and falsely claimed a \"consensus\" that Buffonge could perform sedentary work. He argues that Prudential was intimately familiar with Buffonge's medical records, and it therefore had to know that Dr. Rutchik was misreading the Jacques and Duhme reports. He says Prudential's heavy reliance on the Rutchik report, combined with its citation of the Jacques report as support for its decision when the report clearly cut the other way, renders the decision arbitrary and capricious. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously noted, Prudential cited four pieces of evidence in support of its final decision: (1) Buffonge's medical file as a whole, (2) the Kermond report, (3) the August 27 Jacques report, and (4) the Rutchik report. Of these four, at least two &#8212; the Rutchik report and the Jacques report &#8212; do not provide reasoned support for Prudential's decision. We examine them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Rutchik report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Rutchik's report suffers from fundamental flaws. As an initial matter, Dr. Rutchik's conclusion that \"a consensus exists\" that Buffonge could perform a desk job is far from accurate. Buffonge's medical record as of October 1997, the date of Rutchik's report, contained at least three recent reports from Dr. Jacques concluding just the opposite. Dr. Rutchik also had before him the reports of Dr. Duhme, Buffonge's longtime treating physician, who had repeatedly examined Buffonge and deemed him fully disabled, and who had stated that very summer that Buffonge could not engage in \"sustained sitting\" or \"devote his attentions to any work.\" The Duhme reports alone preclude Dr. Rutchik's finding of \"a consensus\" that Buffonge could perform desk work. Similarly, his conclusion that there was no \"objective\" evidence to support Dr. Duhme's conclusion is contradicted by Dr. Duhme's personal observations on examination of Buffonge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Rutchik's parsing of Dr. Jacques' August 27 report is also, we think, not a fair reading. The Jacques report's explicit statement that Buffonge was \"disabled from <i>any gainful employment</i>\" (emphasis added) does not lend itself to the inference that \"there were jobs that [Buffonge] could do.\" This is especially true considering that Dr. Jacques had filed at least three other reports concluding that Buffonge was fully disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaws in the Rutchik report are crucial to our analysis for several reasons. The report's mischaracterizations are material, and so it does not provide support for Prudential's decision. Further, the fact that Prudential relied on the Rutchik report at all brings into question the integrity of Prudential's decision-making process in this case. Prudential had before it all of Buffonge's records, and it had to be aware that the Rutchik report misconstrued the conclusions of Buffonge's doctors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The August 27 Jacques report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prudential also relied in part on \"the restrictions provided by . . . Dr. Jacques on August 27, 1997.\" But Dr. Jacques' listing of physical activities Buffonge could not perform did not create the inference that any activity not on the list was one Buffonge <i>could</i> perform. Dr. Jacques began the crucial passage by stating that Buffonge was \"disabled from any gainful employment at the present time.\" In light of that unequivocal statement, the specifics that follow &#8212; disabled from bending, lifting, etc. &#8212; appear to us illustrative. It would make no sense for Dr. Jacques to have stated that Buffonge was \"disabled from any gainful employment\" and then in the very next sentence to have implied that there was in fact gainful employment he could perform. Dr. Jacques had also deemed Buffonge fully disabled in all of his other reports; Prudential's reading of the exemplars as refuting Dr. Jacques' consistent conclusion that Buffonge was fully disabled is simply unreasonable. The August 27 report therefore does not support Prudential's conclusion that Buffonge could perform sedentary work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find that two of Prudential's four cited pieces of evidence fail to provide reasoned support for its conclusion; we also find that Prudential's willingness to rely on a report it knew or should have known to be misleading, and its mischaracterization of the conclusions of Dr. Jacques, raises concerns about the fairness of its decision-making process. The question is whether these flaws render the decision \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\" <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 213. We find that they do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An administrator's decision must be \"reasoned\" to survive \"arbitrary and capricious\" review, <i>Gannon,</i> 360 F.3d at 213, and we cannot say that a decision relying on multiple pieces of faulty evidence was \"reasoned.\" <i>See id.</i> at 214-15 (finding that a claims administrator \"reasonably relied\" on evidence only after confirming that the evidence was \"credible\" and \"reliable\"). Further, in giving content to \"arbitrary and capricious\" review in this context, we find it useful to consider other ERISA provisions. <i>Cf. Global Naps, Inc. v. Verizon New England, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201414\"><a href=\"/opinion/201414/global-naps-inc-v-verizon-new-england/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that statutory subsections must be read in light of structure and intent of the larger statute). Section 503 of ERISA, for example, states in relevant part that \"every employee benefit plan shall . . . afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for <i>a full and fair review</i> by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1133 (emphasis added). While this language refers to the benefit plan itself (and to procedural safeguards), it also has some substantive content. One oft-quoted decision has held that the \"full and fair review\" verbiage \"must be construed . . . to protect a plan participant from arbitrary or unprincipled decision-making.\" <i>Grossmuller v. Int'l Union, UAW, Local 813,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"423919\"><a href=\"/opinion/423919/grossmuller-raymond-v-international-union-united-automobile-aerospace/\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span>, 857 (3d Cir.1983). \"Unprincipled decision-making\" of the sort forbidden by Section 503 is also \"arbitrary\" (i.e. not \"reasoned\") within the meaning of our review under Section 502. This does not mean that every perceived unfairness rises to the level of arbitrariness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address Wang and Prudential's two main arguments to the contrary. First, they argue, the decision was based on substantial evidence, and must be upheld, because Prudential considered not just the Rutchik report, but Buffonge's entire medical record, some of which supports Prudential's decision. This argument ignores the requirement that the decision must not be arbitrary. Given the flaws present here, Prudential and Wang's argument must boil down to a claim that an administrator's arbitrary analysis should be ignored if the end result &#8212; denial of benefits &#8212; can nonetheless be saved by a single valid piece of evidence that supports it. The argument would be stronger if the evidence here compelled or virtually compelled a conclusion that Buffonge was not disabled. That is not the case; Buffonge's claim of disability is a serious one, and he has been prejudiced by the process. We do not know what the administrator would have determined if the process had been less flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Wang and Prudential reiterate the district court's analysis, citing <i>Vlass</i> for the proposition that \"[t]he existence of contradictory evidence does not, in itself, make the administrator's decision arbitrary.\" 244 F.3d at 30. The point is true but not pertinent here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that Prudential's decision fails \"arbitrary and capricious\" review, we are left to consider the remedy. There is no question that this court has the power to remand to the claims administrator; it also has the power, in appropriate cases, to award benefits to the disability claimant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> <i>See Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Once a court finds that an administrator has acted arbitrarily and capriciously . . . the court can either remand the case to the administrator for a renewed evaluation of the claimant's case, or it can award a retroactive reinstatement of benefits.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is which of these remedies is more appropriate here. Some courts addressing similar fact patterns have leaned toward categorical rules. <i>See, e.g., Quinn v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759495\"><a href=\"/opinion/759495/consuela-quinn-v-blue-cross-and-blue-shield-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span>, 477 (7th Cir.1998) (holding that retroactive award is usually proper when claimant had benefits and lost them because of arbitrary conduct and/or when no evidence supported denial, while remand is appropriate where decision-maker \"fails to make adequate findings or fails to provide an adequate reasoning\"). This court, while acknowledging that framework, <i>see Cook,</i> 320 F.3d at 24, has taken a more flexible approach: it has held that \"the variety of situations is so great\" in ERISA review that the court must have \"considerable discretion\" to craft a remedy after finding a mistake in the denial of benefits. <i>Id.; see also Glista,</i> 378 F.3d at 131-32 (concluding that where the administrator attempts to rely on a new rationale on appeal, the court's response and the remedy should be resolved on a case-by-case basis, in light of the facts and equities).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the problem is not that Buffonge was denied benefits to which he was clearly entitled; the evidence does not compel such an outcome. The problem is with the integrity of Prudential's decision-making process. The appropriate response is to let Buffonge have the benefit of an untainted process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>See Quinn,</i> 161 F.3d at 478 (finding that where administrator's decision was faulty but it was not \"clear-cut that it was unreasonable\" to deny benefits, remand was appropriate because a benefits award \"might provide [claimant] with an economic windfall should she be determined not disabled upon a proper reconsideration\"); <i>cf.Digregorio v. Hartford Comprehensive Employee Benefit Serv. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201811\"><a href=\"/opinion/201811/digregorio-v-hartford-comprehensi/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2005) (stating that in an ERISA Section 503 proceeding, remand is appropriate where administrator's procedural failings prejudiced claimant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the facts of this case, we <i>reverse</i> the grant of summary judgment to Prudential and Wang. We <i>remand</i> to the district court with instructions to enter judgment for Buffonge on his claim that the denial of benefits was arbitrary and, as the appropriate remedy, to remand the case to the plan administrator for proceedings consistent with this opinion. In our view, that includes the plan administrator taking new evidence should any party wish to submit the same.

He is now out of work on short term disability, but when he returns to work, he will be given 30 days to find a new job in the company or be terminated. . . .\" We infer that after months passed and Buffonge did not return to seek a new position, the company terminated his employment.
