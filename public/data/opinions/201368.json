Emmanuelli-Huertas with whom Law Offices of\nPedro E. Ortiz-Álvarez, PSC was on brief for appellants.\n     Francisco R. González with whom F.R. González Law Office was\non brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                        December 8, 2004\n\f              BOUDIN, Chief Judge.         This appeal involves a federal\n\ncivil       rights   suit   brought   by     Reynaldo   Rodríguez-Rodríguez\n\n(\"Rodríguez\") arising out of an election-week fracas that occurred\n\non November 2, 2000, in the municipality of Sabana Grande, Puerto\n\nRico.       The defendants included Miguel Ortiz-Vélez (\"Ortiz\"), the\n\nmayor of Sabana Grande, and municipal police officer Katia Medina-\n\nPedraza (\"Medina\").         These two defendants now appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's denial of their motion for summary judgment which\n\nrested in part on their qualified immunity defense.\n\n              The underlying facts are far from clear.       About all that\n\nthe two sides agree upon is that on November 2, 2000, Rodríguez was\n\ndriving a sound truck for the NPP (one of Puerto Rico's two main\n\npolitical parties) near a local headquarters of the PDP (the other\n\nmain party); that PDP Mayor Ortiz and multiple persons on the\n\nstreet engaged in a physical confrontation with Rodríguez during\n\nwhich Rodríguez hit Ortiz; and that Officer Medina sought to\n\nintervene.\n\n              Rodríguez' version of events, drawn from his complaint\n\nand two nearly identical sworn statements made by him,1 are that\n\nrocks were thrown at his vehicle; that when he stopped to inspect\n\nthe damage, Medina arrived in her police car and asked why he had\n\n\n        1\n      These sworn statements, as well as those of other individuals\ninvolved, were attached as exhibits to the parties' summary\njudgment filings. Most are sworn witness statements in the related\ncriminal proceedings against Rodríguez; one consists of criminal\ntrial testimony.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fstopped; that while he was answering, Ortiz appeared with a mob of\n\nsupporters, told Medina that he (Ortiz) would handle the matter,\n\nand then struck Rodríguez in the face with a blackjack; that\n\nRodríguez managed to hit back at Ortiz, after which Medina struck\n\nRodríguez with her baton; and that Rodríguez was then attacked by\n\nthe crowd on the street.\n\n           The   aftermath    included     criminal   proceedings   against\n\nRodríguez in state court and fruitless efforts by Rodríguez to have\n\nthe mayor criminally charged.       In the present lawsuit (but not in\n\nthe complaint), Rodríguez asserted that the mayor, while at one of\n\nRodríguez' criminal trials, was greeted by another official of\n\nOrtiz' PDP party who went to the judge's chambers and who then\n\nleft, signaling to the mayor that he (the other official) had \"made\n\nthe necessary arrangements.\"\n\n           Based on these alleged events, Rodríguez brought the\n\npresent action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000) against Ortiz, Medina,\n\nthe municipality of Sabana Grande, the police commissioner and\n\nothers.    The legal claims asserted in the complaint were various\n\nand not well defined. In essence, Rodríguez claimed that Ortiz and\n\nMedina had each wrongfully struck him, that Ortiz and Medina had\n\ntogether    \"initiated,      instigated,    planned,    participated    and\n\ndirected\" the \"multitudinous assault and battery\" and that they had\n\nboth failed to protect Rodríguez when he was being beaten.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            The claim against Medina was framed as one of excessive\n\nforce by a police officer.       Ortiz, according to Rodríguez, was\n\nacting under color of state law when he allegedly told Medina to\n\nstep aside and then struck Rodríguez.       Rodríguez also claimed that\n\nthe defendants wrongfully failed to protect him from the crowd's\n\nattacks. He further alleged that they violated his substantive due\n\nprocess rights and his First Amendment rights; the latter claim is\n\npremised on Rodríguez' view that \"[t]he reason for the assault and\n\nmob beating was that [Rodríguez] was . . . exercising his First\n\nAmendment [rights] of Political Speech and association.\"\n\n            Rodríguez also alleged that the mayor and the municipal\n\ngovernment failed to properly train and supervise the police and\n\nothers and failed to enforce regulations, thereby endangering\n\nindividuals'    constitutional   rights.      Finally,   Rodríguez    has\n\nasserted that Medina and Ortiz obstructed justice by not arresting\n\nOrtiz or prosecuting others who were involved in the incident.\n\n            After   discovery,   the    defendants   moved   for   summary\n\njudgment.    Their version of what happened, backed by their own\n\naffidavits and affidavits from others, was quite different in\n\ncrucial respects.    They claimed that Rodríguez had driven with his\n\nsound truck blaring past the PDP party headquarters and that he had\n\nstopped there, dismounted, and got in an altercation with a 15-\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fyear-old boy      that   ended   with    Rodríguez   striking   the    boy   and\n\nbreaking his glasses.2\n\n              Medina's sworn statement said that she had arrived at the\n\nscene after a fight had broken up and that Ortiz approached her and\n\nasked her to file a complaint against Rodríguez for assaulting the\n\nboy.       According to Medina, Rodríguez responded by striking the\n\nmayor.      She says she tried to arrest Rodríguez, but was unable to\n\ndo so because of the large crowd that then attacked him.              Unable to\n\nbreak up the crowd, Medina said that she radioed for assistance and\n\nreturned to try to protect Rodríguez from the crowd, which finally\n\ndispersed as paramedics arrived.\n\n              In his own sworn statement, the mayor supported Medina's\n\nstory (although he didn't observe what she did after he was hit by\n\nRodríguez). Another witness's story roughly corroborated Medina's-\n\n-although he testified that the first punch was thrown by someone\n\nother than the mayor or Rodríguez and that during the fracas Medina\n\n\"tried in, with her baton, taking . . . the ones who [were]\n\nfighting.\"\n\n              In moving for summary judgment on the merits, Ortiz and\n\nMedina argued that Medina had been acting reasonably, that Ortiz\n\n\n\n       2\n      The evidence about this fight is rather thin; the boy was the\nonly witness whose sworn statement described the incident. Ortiz\nonly said that he heard others complaining that Rodríguez had\nassaulted a minor. Medina arrived at the scene after a fight she\ndid not see, but apparently was told it was between one Julio Ortiz\nand someone else.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fhad not in any event been a state actor in the encounter, that\n\nneither had been acting in concert with the other, and that the\n\ncriminal charges brought thereafter against Rodríguez were filed by\n\nthe   Puerto   Rico   Department     of    Justice     and    not   any   of   the\n\ndefendants.    Medina and the mayor quite briefly invoked qualified\n\nimmunity,   saying    that   neither      had   foreseen     how    events   would\n\ndevelop.\n\n            The   district   judge     denied    the   motions      for   summary\n\njudgment without explanation and this appeal by Ortiz and Medina\n\nfollowed.   Normally the denial of a motion for summary judgment is\n\nnot immediately appealable, but a denial of qualified immunity may\n\nbe appealed to the extent the decision is a \"purely legal\" one,\n\nDwan v. City of Boston, 329 F.3d 275, 278 (1st Cir. 2003); what\n\ncannot be appealed is a district court's denial of qualified\n\nimmunity based on the court's determination that \"the pretrial\n\nrecord sets forth a 'genuine' issue of fact.\"                 Johnson v. Jones,\n\n515 U.S. 304, 320 (1995).\n\n            A denial of summary judgment because of a genuine issue\n\nof material fact is itself a ruling of law and not a finding of\n\nfact; but Johnson makes clear that this class of legal rulings is\n\nnot immediately appealable even if the district court is mistaken\n\nin thinking that there was a genuine issue.                  Still, a denial of\n\nqualified immunity on such a ground can be appealed immediately on\n\nthe issue whether the plaintiffs' own version of events together\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwith uncontested facts entitles the defendant to immunity.             See\n\nBehrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 313 (1996); Camilo-Robles v.\n\nHoyos, 151 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1105\n\n(1999).\n\n          Although    we   could   remand   for   clarification   of   the\n\ndistrict court's reasoning if we thought it necessary, Camilo-\n\nRobles, 151 F.3d at 8 n.5, the district court almost surely thought\n\n(1) that the two sides' stories were in direct conflict on crucial\n\npoints--which they self-evidently are--and (2) that on Rodríguez'\n\nversion qualified immunity would not be available.           The latter\n\nruling is reviewable now under Johnson.           We are constrained to\n\nagree with the district court that Rodríguez' allegations preclude\n\nqualified immunity at the present time, although only barely so as\n\nto Medina.\n\n          Starting with Medina, in principle a constitutional claim\n\ncan be made under the Fourth Amendment against a police officer who\n\nuses excessive force during a \"seizure.\"          Graham v. Connor, 490\n\nU.S. 386, 395-96 (1989).    Even if there is no \"seizure\" for Fourth\n\nAmendment purposes, a constitutional claim of conscience-shocking\n\nforce can be made out against an officer under substantive due\n\nprocess principles.    County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833,\n\n843, 846-47 (1998).    Assuming that Rodríguez could prove at trial\n\nhis own sworn version of events, it is barely possible--even though\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fextremely unlikely--that he could establish a claim against Medina\n\nfor which qualified immunity would not be available.\n\n           The gist of Rodríguez' sworn statement is this: \"After\n\n[Ortiz] attacked me I . . . threw a punch to defend myself, hitting\n\nhim on his face; then the police woman attacked me with the baton\n\nstabbing at my ribs with the tip . . . .\"        Rodríguez also describes\n\nfalling to the ground and the extensive injuries he sustained in\n\nthe melee that followed.           It is this sequence of events that\n\nRodríguez says amounts to deliberate and unjustified use of force\n\nby a police officer.\n\n           This    is   a   very   dubious   claim   of   excessive     force;\n\nRodríguez has admitted striking the mayor and, whether or not the\n\nmayor   struck    first,    Medina   probably   would     have   been   acting\n\nreasonably (and thus lawfully) if she used her baton to prevent a\n\nsecond blow by Rodríguez or hit him by accident in trying to break\n\nup the crowd gathering around him or for any of several other\n\ndefensible reasons.         See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 204-05\n\n(2001) (force incident to arrest); see also Cummings v. McIntire,\n\n271 F.3d 341, 345 (1st Cir. 2001) (force not incident to arrest).\n\nFurthermore, for qualified immunity she would not even need to show\n\nthat her judgment was correct but only that a reasonable police\n\nofficer could in the circumstances have reasonably believed that\n\nthis step was not legally excessive.         See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 205.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f             The difficulty is that Medina has never invoked any set\n\nof circumstances to explain why she, or a reasonable officer in her\n\nplace, would have struck Rodríguez. Without mentioning the alleged\n\nbaton strike, Medina stated in effect that Rodríguez struck the\n\nmayor and \"I proceeded to intervene with the man [Rodríguez] to try\n\nto put him under arrest . . . .\"           Nothing is said, for example,\n\nabout whether she struck him and, if so, why she needed to strike\n\nhim incident to an arrest or otherwise.             There is no indication\n\nthat Rodríguez was poised to strike another blow or to flee or that\n\nthe blow was light and accidental.          In sum, the materials for a\n\nlikely    qualified    immunity   defense     may    be   lying   at    hand,\n\nsee Saucier, 533 U.S. at 204-05, but the construction work has not\n\nbeen done.\n\n           In reaching our conclusions as to Medina, we give no\n\nweight at all to Rodríguez' charges that Medina conspired with\n\nOrtiz, that Medina directed the mob beating Rodríguez or that\n\nMedina wrongfully failed to protect Rodríguez.            These conclusory\n\ncharges in the complaint have been effectively denied by Medina who\n\nhas   furnished   a   sworn   plausible,    non-conspiratorial    and   non-\n\nculpable version of her interactions--apart from the alleged baton\n\nstrike.    By contrast, Rodríguez has not offered any supporting\n\nevidence or detail to buttress most of his claims.           This is not a\n\nmatter of two conflicting factual claims but of conclusory rhetoric\n\nas against sworn, specific statements.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f           This brings us to Ortiz.             To establish a free-speech\n\nviolation, Rodríguez would have to show both that the mayor struck\n\nRodríguez in retaliation for the latter's broadcast of political\n\npropaganda    or   for   some    other    reason     connected     to    Rodríguez'\n\npolitical affiliation, see El Dia, Inc. v. Rossello, 165 F.3d 106,\n\n109 (1st Cir. 1999), and also that he did so in his role as mayor\n\nrather than in his private capacity, see Yeo v. Town of Lexington,\n\n131 F.3d 241, 248-49, 255 (1st Cir. 1997) (en banc), cert. denied\n\n524 U.S. 904 (1998).3           It may be surprising that such a claim\n\nsurvived   summary   judgment,      but    it   is   also   hard    to    see   what\n\nqualified immunity has to do with the matter.\n\n           Qualified immunity applies when an official takes an\n\naction that a reasonable official could believe to be lawful--even\n\nthough it turns out not to be, see Dwan v. City of Boston, 329 F.3d\n\n275, 278 (1st Cir. 2003); the easy example is a close-call case of\n\nprobable cause to arrest, see, e.g., Abreu-Guzman v. Ford, 241 F.3d\n\n69, 73 (1st Cir. 2001).           This qualified immunity protection is\n\navailable in First Amendment cases as well, although less easily\n\ninvoked.     See, e.g., Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't, 315 F.3d\n\n65, 70-71 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Rodríguez also says that the mayor told Medina to strike\nRodríguez; but this charge is not repeated in any sworn statement\nby Rodríguez nor supported in any record evidence submitted by\nRodríguez.\n\n                                     -11-\n\f            Here, if the mayor did without justification strike\n\nRodríguez with a blackjack, as Rodríguez has claimed, no reasonable\n\nmayor could believe that this was lawful or entitled him to\n\nqualified immunity.          Of course, the mayor may not have struck\n\nRodríguez at all; but this is a raw factual dispute.           The district\n\ncourt's failure to resolve it in the mayor's favor on summary\n\njudgment is unreviewable short of a final judgment, whether it is\n\ntreated   as    a   merits   question   or   dubitante   as   pertaining   to\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n            One may well doubt whether, if the mayor did strike\n\nRodríguez, he did so as a state actor.            But if he were a state\n\nactor, he would not enjoy immunity because, as just indicated, the\n\naction would not be even arguably lawful; and if he were not a\n\nstate actor, immunity would again not be available because the\n\npurpose of immunity is to protect persons acting in an official\n\ncapacity.      While the latter conclusion would defeat the federal\n\ncivil rights claim, the issue is not properly before us.\n\n            What Ortiz and Medina have done on this appeal is to\n\nraise very serious questions whether the excessive force and\n\nmayoral assault claims have any likelihood of success as federal\n\ncivil rights claims.     We trust that the district judge will not let\n\nthe case linger or ignore any further well-founded effort to sort\n\nout this kitchen-sink complaint short of trial. If Rodríguez loses\n\nhis case, the defendants are free to apply for attorneys' fees.\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fSee Fid. Guarantee Mortgage Corp. v. Reben, 809 F.2d 931, 935-36\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).\n\n            We have addressed in this decision only the two most\n\nconcrete claims made by Rodríguez:        the charge of excessive force\n\nagainst Medina and the free-speech assault claim against Ortiz.\n\nRodríguez has, as already noted, made other numerous but shadowy\n\ncharges, primarily against Ortiz.        Neither the charges themselves,\n\nnor   any   possible   defense   based    on   qualified   immunity,   are\n\nsufficiently distilled by the parties on appeal to warrant any\n\nfurther comment about them.\n\n            The judgment on appeal is affirmed as to the claim by\n\nappellants that the district court erred on an issue of law\n\nconcerning qualified immunity.      As to whether the district court\n\nmade a mistake in believing that factual disputes barred qualified\n\nimmunity or in denying summary judgment on the merits, we have no\n\nauthority to entertain an interlocutory appeal on either score.\n\nEach side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f",

About all that the two sides agree upon is that on November 2, 2000, Rodr&#237;guez was driving a sound truck for the NPP (one of Puerto Rico's two main political parties) near a local headquarters of the PDP (the other main party); that PDP Mayor Ortiz and multiple persons on the street engaged in a physical confrontation with Rodr&#237;guez during which Rodr&#237;guez hit Ortiz; and that Officer Medina sought to intervene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez' version of events, drawn from his complaint and two nearly identical sworn statements made by him,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> are that rocks were thrown at his vehicle; that when he stopped to inspect the damage, Medina arrived in her police car and asked why he had stopped; that while he was answering, Ortiz appeared with a mob of supporters, told Medina that he (Ortiz) would handle the matter, and then struck Rodr&#237;guez in the face with a blackjack; that Rodr&#237;guez managed to hit back at Ortiz, after which Medina struck Rodr&#237;guez with her baton; and that Rodr&#237;guez was then attacked by the crowd on the street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The aftermath included criminal proceedings against Rodr&#237;guez in state court and fruitless efforts by Rodr&#237;guez to have the mayor criminally charged. In the present lawsuit (but not in the complaint), Rodr&#237;guez asserted that the mayor, while at one of Rodr&#237;guez' criminal trials, was greeted by another official of Ortiz' PDP party who went to the judge's chambers and who then left, signaling to the mayor that he (the other official) had \"made the necessary arrangements.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these alleged events, Rodr&#237;guez brought the present action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000) against Ortiz, Medina, the municipality of Sabana Grande, the police commissioner and others. The legal claims asserted in the complaint were various and not well defined. In essence, Rodr&#237;guez claimed that Ortiz and Medina had each wrongfully struck him, that Ortiz and Medina had together \"initiated, instigated, planned, participated and directed\" the \"multitudinous assault and battery\" and that they had both failed to protect Rodr&#237;guez when he was being beaten.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim against Medina was framed as one of excessive force by a police officer. Ortiz, according to Rodr&#237;guez, was acting under color of state law when he allegedly told Medina to step aside and then struck Rodr&#237;guez. Rodr&#237;guez also claimed that the defendants wrongfully failed to protect him from the crowd's attacks. He further alleged that they violated his substantive due process rights and his First Amendment rights; the latter claim is premised on Rodr&#237;guez' view that \"[t]he reason for the assault and mob beating was that [Rodr&#237;guez] was ... exercising his First Amendment [rights] of Political Speech and association.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez also alleged that the mayor and the municipal government failed to properly train and supervise the police and others and failed to enforce regulations, thereby endangering individuals' constitutional rights. Finally, Rodr&#237;guez has asserted that Medina and Ortiz obstructed justice by not arresting Ortiz or prosecuting others who were involved in the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment. Their version of what happened, backed by their own affidavits and affidavits from others, was quite different in crucial respects. They claimed that Rodr&#237;guez had driven with his sound truck blaring past the PDP party headquarters and that he had stopped there, dismounted, and got in an altercation with a 15-year-old boy that ended with Rodr&#237;guez striking the boy and breaking his glasses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medina's sworn statement said that she had arrived at the scene after a fight had broken up and that Ortiz approached her and asked her to file a complaint against Rodr&#237;guez for assaulting the boy. According to Medina, Rodr&#237;guez responded by striking the mayor. She says she tried to arrest Rodr&#237;guez, but was unable to do so because of the large crowd that then attacked him. Unable to break up the crowd, Medina said that she radioed for assistance and returned to try to protect Rodr&#237;guez from the crowd, which finally dispersed as paramedics arrived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his own sworn statement, the mayor supported Medina's story (although he didn't observe what she did after he was hit by Rodr&#237;guez). Another witness's story roughly corroborated Medina's &#8212; although he testified that the first punch was thrown by someone other than the mayor or Rodr&#237;guez and that during the fracas Medina \"tried in, with her baton, taking ... the ones who [were] fighting.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In moving for summary judgment on the merits, Ortiz and Medina argued that Medina had been acting reasonably, that Ortiz had not in any event been a state actor in the encounter, that neither had been acting in concert with the other, and that the criminal charges brought thereafter against Rodr&#237;guez were filed by the Puerto Rico Department of Justice and not any of the defendants. Medina and the mayor quite briefly invoked qualified immunity, saying that neither had foreseen how events would develop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge denied the motions for summary judgment without explanation and this appeal by Ortiz and Medina followed. Normally the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not immediately appealable, but a denial of qualified immunity may be appealed to the extent the decision is a \"purely legal\" one, <i>Dwan v. City of Boston,</i> 329 F.3d 275, 278 (1st Cir.2003); what cannot be appealed is a district court's denial of qualified immunity based on the court's determination that \"the pretrial record sets forth a `genuine' issue of fact.\" <i>Johnson v. Jones,</i> 515 U.S. 304, 320, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A denial of summary judgment because of a genuine issue of material fact is itself a ruling of law and not a finding of fact; but <i>Johnson</i> makes clear that this class of legal rulings is not immediately appealable even if the district court is mistaken in thinking that there was a genuine issue. Still, a denial of qualified immunity on such a ground can be appealed immediately on the issue whether the plaintiffs' own version of events together with uncontested facts entitles the defendant to immunity. <i>See Behrens v. Pelletier,</i> 516 U.S. 299, 313, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996); <i>Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos,</i> 151 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> 525 U.S. 1105, 119 S.Ct. 872, 142 L.Ed.2d 773 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we could remand for clarification of the district court's reasoning if we thought it necessary, <i>Camilo-Robles,</i> 151 F.3d at 8 n. 5, the district court almost surely thought (1) that the two sides' stories were in direct conflict on crucial points &#8212; which they self-evidently are &#8212; and (2) that on Rodr&#237;guez' version qualified immunity would not be available. The latter ruling is reviewable now under <i>Johnson.</i> We are constrained to agree with the district court that Rodr&#237;guez' allegations preclude qualified immunity at the present time, although only barely so as to Medina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with Medina, in principle a constitutional claim can be made under the Fourth Amendment against a police officer who uses excessive force during a \"seizure.\" <i>Graham v. Connor,</i> 490 U.S. 386, 395-96, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). Even if there is no \"seizure\" for Fourth Amendment purposes, a constitutional claim of conscience-shocking force can be made out against an officer under substantive due process principles. <i>County of Sacramento v. Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. 833, 843, 846-47, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998). Assuming that Rodr&#237;guez could prove at trial his own sworn version of events, it is barely possible &#8212; even though extremely unlikely &#8212; that he could establish a claim against Medina for which qualified immunity would not be available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gist of Rodr&#237;guez' sworn statement is this: \"After [Ortiz] attacked me I ... threw a punch to defend myself, hitting him on his face; then the police woman attacked me with the baton stabbing at my ribs with the tip....\" Rodr&#237;guez also describes falling to the ground and the extensive injuries he sustained in the melee that followed. It is this sequence of events that Rodr&#237;guez says amounts to deliberate and unjustified use of force by a police officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a very dubious claim of excessive force; Rodr&#237;guez has admitted striking the mayor and, whether or not the mayor struck first, Medina probably would have been acting reasonably (and thus lawfully) if she used her baton to prevent a second blow by Rodr&#237;guez or hit him by accident in trying to break up the crowd gathering around him or for any of several other defensible reasons. <i>See Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 204-05, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (force incident to arrest); <i>see also Cummings v. McIntire,</i> 271 F.3d 341, 345 (1st Cir.2001) (force not incident to arrest). Furthermore, for qualified immunity she would not even need to show that her judgment was correct but only that a reasonable police officer could in the circumstances have reasonably believed that this step was not legally excessive. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty is that Medina has never invoked <i>any</i> set of circumstances to explain why she, or a reasonable officer in her place, would have struck Rodr&#237;guez. Without mentioning the alleged baton strike, Medina stated in effect that Rodr&#237;guez struck the mayor and \"I proceeded to intervene with the man [Rodr&#237;guez] to try to put him under arrest....\" Nothing is said, for example, about whether she struck him and, if so, why she needed to strike him incident to an arrest or otherwise. There is no indication that Rodr&#237;guez was poised to strike another blow or to flee or that the blow was light and accidental. In sum, the materials for a likely qualified immunity defense may be lying at hand, <i>see Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 204-05, 121 S.Ct. 2151, but the construction work has not been done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching our conclusions as to Medina, we give no weight at all to Rodr&#237;guez' charges that Medina conspired with Ortiz, that Medina directed the mob beating Rodr&#237;guez or that Medina wrongfully failed to protect Rodr&#237;guez. These conclusory charges in the complaint have been effectively denied by Medina who has furnished a sworn plausible, non-conspiratorial and non-culpable version of her interactions &#8212; apart from the alleged baton strike. By contrast, Rodr&#237;guez has not offered any supporting evidence or detail to buttress most of his claims. This is not a matter of two conflicting factual claims but of conclusory rhetoric as against sworn, specific statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Ortiz. To establish a free-speech violation, Rodr&#237;guez would have to show both that the mayor struck Rodr&#237;guez in retaliation for the latter's broadcast of political propaganda or for some other reason connected to Rodr&#237;guez' political affiliation, <i>see El Dia, Inc. v. Rossello,</i> 165 F.3d 106, 109 (1st Cir.1999), and also that he did so in his role as mayor rather than in his private capacity, <i>see Yeo v. Town of Lexington,</i> 131 F.3d 241, 248-49, 255 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc), <i>cert. denied</i> 524 U.S. 904, 118 S.Ct. 2060, 141 L.Ed.2d 138 (1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It may be surprising that such a claim survived summary judgment, but it is also hard to see what qualified immunity has to do with the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualified immunity applies when an official takes an action that a reasonable official could believe to be lawful &#8212; even though it turns out not to be, <i>see Dwan v. City of Boston,</i> 329 F.3d 275, 278 (1st Cir.2003); the easy example is a close-call case of probable cause to arrest, <i>see, e.g., Abreu-Guzman v. Ford,</i> 241 F.3d 69, 73 (1st Cir.2001). This qualified immunity protection is available in First Amendment cases as well, although less easily invoked. <i>See, e.g., Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't,</i> 315 F.3d 65, 70-71 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, if the mayor did without justification strike Rodr&#237;guez with a blackjack, as Rodr&#237;guez has claimed, no reasonable mayor could believe that this was lawful or entitled him to qualified immunity. Of course, the mayor may not have struck Rodr&#237;guez at all; but this is a raw factual dispute. The district court's failure to resolve it in the mayor's favor on summary judgment is unreviewable short of a final judgment, whether it is treated as a merits question or <i>dubitante</i> as pertaining to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One may well doubt whether, if the mayor did strike Rodr&#237;guez, he did so as a state actor. But if he were a state actor, he would not enjoy immunity because, as just indicated, the action would not be even arguably lawful; and if he were not a state actor, immunity would again not be available because the purpose of immunity is to protect persons acting in an official capacity. While the latter conclusion would defeat the federal civil rights claim, the issue is not properly before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What Ortiz and Medina have done on this appeal is to raise very serious questions whether the excessive force and mayoral assault claims have any likelihood of success as federal civil rights claims. We trust that the district judge will not let the case linger or ignore any further well-founded effort to sort out this kitchen-sink complaint short of trial. If Rodr&#237;guez loses his case, the defendants are free to apply for attorneys' fees. <i>See Fid. Guarantee Mortgage Corp. v. Reben,</i> 809 F.2d 931, 935-36 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have addressed in this decision only the two most concrete claims made by Rodr&#237;guez: the charge of excessive force against Medina and the free-speech assault claim against Ortiz. Rodr&#237;guez has, as already noted, made other numerous but shadowy charges, primarily against Ortiz. Neither the charges themselves, nor any possible defense based on qualified immunity, are sufficiently distilled by the parties on appeal to warrant any further comment about them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment on appeal is <i>affirmed</i> as to the claim by appellants that the district court erred on an issue of law concerning qualified immunity. As to whether the district court made a mistake in believing that factual disputes barred qualified immunity or in denying summary judgment on the merits, we have no authority to entertain an interlocutory appeal on either score. Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> These sworn statements, as well as those of other individuals involved, were attached as exhibits to the parties' summary judgment filings.

According to Medina, Rodr&#237;guez responded by striking the mayor. She says she tried to arrest Rodr&#237;guez, but was unable to do so because of the large crowd that then attacked him. Unable to break up the crowd, Medina said that she radioed for assistance and returned to try to protect Rodr&#237;guez from the crowd, which finally dispersed as paramedics arrived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his own sworn statement, the mayor supported Medina's story (although he didn't observe what she did after he was hit by Rodr&#237;guez). Another witness's story roughly corroborated Medina's &#8212; although he testified that the first punch was thrown by someone other than the mayor or Rodr&#237;guez and that during the fracas Medina \"tried in, with her baton, taking ... the ones who [were] fighting.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In moving for summary judgment on the merits, Ortiz and Medina argued that Medina had been acting reasonably, that Ortiz had not in any event been a state actor in the encounter, that neither had been acting in concert with the other, and that the criminal charges brought thereafter against Rodr&#237;guez were filed by the Puerto Rico Department of Justice and not any of the defendants. Medina and the mayor quite briefly invoked qualified immunity, saying that neither had foreseen how events would develop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge denied the motions for summary judgment without explanation and this appeal by Ortiz and Medina followed. Normally the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not immediately appealable, but a denial of qualified immunity may be appealed to the extent the decision is a \"purely legal\" one, <i>Dwan v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781981\"><a href=\"/opinion/781981/robert-a-dwan-catherine-m-dwan-allyson-m-dwan-by-her-parents-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 278 (1st Cir.2003); what cannot be appealed is a district court's denial of qualified immunity based on the court's determination that \"the pretrial record sets forth a `genuine' issue of fact.\" <i>Johnson v.

Still, a denial of qualified immunity on such a ground can be appealed immediately on the issue whether the plaintiffs' own version of events together with uncontested facts entitles the defendant to immunity. <i>See Behrens v.

The latter ruling is reviewable now under <i>Johnson.</i> We are constrained to agree with the district court that Rodr&#237;guez' allegations preclude qualified immunity at the present time, although only barely so as to Medina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with Medina, in principle a constitutional claim can be made under the Fourth Amendment against a police officer who uses excessive force during a \"seizure.\" <i>Graham v.

Even if there is no \"seizure\" for Fourth Amendment purposes, a constitutional claim of conscience-shocking force can be made out against an officer under substantive due process principles. <i>County of Sacramento v.

Assuming that Rodr&#237;guez could prove at trial his own sworn version of events, it is barely possible &#8212; even though extremely unlikely &#8212; that he could establish a claim against Medina for which qualified immunity would not be available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gist of Rodr&#237;guez' sworn statement is this: \"After [Ortiz] attacked me I ... threw a punch to defend myself, hitting him on his face; then the police woman attacked me with the baton stabbing at my ribs with the tip....\" Rodr&#237;guez also describes falling to the ground and the extensive injuries he sustained in the melee that followed. It is this sequence of events that Rodr&#237;guez says amounts to deliberate and unjustified use of force by a police officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a very dubious claim of excessive force; Rodr&#237;guez has admitted striking the mayor and, whether or not the mayor struck first, Medina probably would have been acting reasonably (and thus lawfully) if she used her baton to prevent a second blow by Rodr&#237;guez or hit him by accident in trying to break up the crowd gathering around him or for any of several other defensible reasons. <i>See Saucier v. Katz,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span>, 204-05, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Furthermore, for qualified immunity she would not even need to show that her judgment was correct but only that a reasonable police officer could in the circumstances have reasonably believed that this step was not legally excessive. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 205, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Without mentioning the alleged baton strike, Medina stated in effect that Rodr&#237;guez struck the mayor and \"I proceeded to intervene with the man [Rodr&#237;guez] to try to put him under arrest....\" Nothing is said, for example, about whether she struck him and, if so, why she needed to strike him incident to an arrest or otherwise. There is no indication that Rodr&#237;guez was poised to strike another blow or to flee or that the blow was light and accidental. In sum, the materials for a likely qualified immunity defense may be lying at hand, <i>see Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 204-05, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></span>, but the construction work has not been done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching our conclusions as to Medina, we give no weight at all to Rodr&#237;guez' charges that Medina conspired with Ortiz, that Medina directed the mob beating Rodr&#237;guez or that Medina wrongfully failed to protect Rodr&#237;guez. These conclusory charges in the complaint have been effectively denied by Medina who has furnished a sworn plausible, non-conspiratorial and non-culpable version of her interactions &#8212; apart from the alleged baton strike. By contrast, Rodr&#237;guez has not offered any supporting evidence or detail to buttress most of his claims. This is not a matter of two conflicting factual claims but of conclusory rhetoric as against sworn, specific statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Ortiz. To establish a free-speech violation, Rodr&#237;guez would have to show both that the mayor struck Rodr&#237;guez in retaliation for the latter's broadcast of political propaganda or for some other reason connected to Rodr&#237;guez' political affiliation, <i>see El Dia, Inc. v. Rossello,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198304\"><a href=\"/opinion/198304/el-dia-inc-v-rossello/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir.1999), and also that he did so in his role as mayor rather than in his private capacity, <i>see Yeo v. Town of Lexington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749302\"><a href=\"/opinion/749302/douglas-e-yeo-individually-and-on-behalf-of-his-children-and-as-chairman/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 248-49, 255 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc), <i>cert. denied</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></span> (1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It may be surprising that such a claim survived summary judgment, but it is also hard to see what qualified immunity has to do with the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualified immunity applies when an official takes an action that a reasonable official could believe to be lawful &#8212; even though it turns out not to be, <i>see Dwan v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781981\"><a href=\"/opinion/781981/robert-a-dwan-catherine-m-dwan-allyson-m-dwan-by-her-parents-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 278 (1st Cir.2003); the easy example is a close-call case of probable cause to arrest, <i>see, e.g., Abreu-Guzman v. Ford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199293\"><a href=\"/opinion/199293/abreu-guzman-v-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2001). This qualified immunity protection is available in First Amendment cases as well, although less easily invoked. <i>See, e.g., Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200266\"><a href=\"/opinion/200266/dirrane-v-brookline-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 70-71 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, if the mayor did without justification strike Rodr&#237;guez with a blackjack, as Rodr&#237;guez has claimed, no reasonable mayor could believe that this was lawful or entitled him to qualified immunity. Of course, the mayor may not have struck Rodr&#237;guez at all; but this is a raw factual dispute. The district court's failure to resolve it in the mayor's favor on summary judgment is unreviewable short of a final judgment, whether it is treated as a merits question or <i>dubitante</i> as pertaining to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One may well doubt whether, if the mayor did strike Rodr&#237;guez, he did so as a state actor. But if he were a state actor, he would not enjoy immunity because, as just indicated, the action would not be even arguably lawful; and if he were not a state actor, immunity would again not be available because the purpose of immunity is to protect persons acting in an official capacity. While the latter conclusion would defeat the federal civil rights claim, the issue is not properly before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What Ortiz and Medina have done on this appeal is to raise very serious questions whether the excessive force and mayoral assault claims have any likelihood of success as federal civil rights claims. We trust that the district judge will not let the case linger or ignore any further well-founded effort to sort out this kitchen-sink complaint short of trial. If Rodr&#237;guez loses his case, the defendants are free to apply for attorneys' fees. <i>See Fid. Guarantee Mortgage Corp. v. Reben,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481994\"><a href=\"/opinion/481994/fidelity-guarantee-mortgage-corporation-v-howard-t-reben/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span>, 935-36 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have addressed in this decision only the two most concrete claims made by Rodr&#237;guez: the charge of excessive force against Medina and the free-speech assault claim against Ortiz. Rodr&#237;guez has, as already noted, made other numerous but shadowy charges, primarily against Ortiz. Neither the charges themselves, nor any possible defense based on qualified immunity, are sufficiently distilled by the parties on appeal to warrant any further comment about them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment on appeal is <i>affirmed</i> as to the claim by appellants that the district court erred on an issue of law concerning qualified immunity. As to whether the district court made a mistake in believing that factual disputes barred qualified immunity or in denying summary judgment on the merits, we have no authority to entertain an interlocutory appeal on either score.
