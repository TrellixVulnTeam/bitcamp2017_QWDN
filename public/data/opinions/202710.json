Michele Freadman brought this\n\naction against her former employer, Metropolitan Property and\n\nCasualty Insurance Company (\"Metropolitan\"), alleging violations of\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-\n\n12213,    and   Rhode   Island    state        law.      Freadman   claimed     that\n\nMetropolitan (1) discriminated against her on the basis of a\n\nprotected disability, (2) failed to reasonably accommodate her\n\ndisability, and (3) retaliated against her for attempting to obtain\n\na reasonable accommodation.\n\n            The   district       court     granted        summary    judgment    to\n\nMetropolitan, holding that Freadman failed to establish a prima\n\nfacie case on her claims.          Freadman v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins.\n\nCo., No. 01-628, 2006 WL 346455, at *2-4, 6-7 (D.R.I. Feb. 14,\n\n2006).    Freadman now appeals the award of summary judgment.\n\n            We affirm summary judgment for Metropolitan on all of\n\nFreadman's claims.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, considering the facts and the reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n\nGuzmán-Rosario v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 397 F.3d 6, 9 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n            Metropolitan hired Freadman in 1993 and promoted her to\n\nmanager   in    1995.    In   March      1999,        Freadman   became   ill   with\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fulcerative colitis, and from March 1999 to July 1999, she took\n\nmedical leave for treatment of this condition.               At the time,\n\nFreadman reported to Assistant Vice President Robert Smith.\n\n            During her convalescence, Smith visited Freadman and\n\nphoned her on several occasions.          During these conversations,\n\nFreadman and Smith discussed Freadman's need for \"reasonable hours,\n\n[fewer] last minute time driven assignments, work/life balance,\n\nbeing able to exercise, [and] having adequate staff.\" Smith agreed\n\nto Freadman's request for a better work/life balance and to make\n\nchanges; indeed, he told Freadman that she worked too hard.\n\n            Freadman   returned   to   work   in   July   1999.   She   was\n\naccommodated by being allowed to work part-time for the first\n\nseveral weeks, even though such part-time work was not normally\n\navailable for managers.\n\n            Upon her return, Smith reassigned Freadman's training,\n\ncompliance, and performance enhancement duties to other employees\n\nin an attempt to reduce her workload, as she had requested.          Smith\n\nalso arranged for Freadman to take over a new project known as\n\n\"Ease of Doing Business\" (EDB), which was headed by Smith's boss,\n\nChris Cawley.     Although Smith did not request that she do so,\n\nFreadman began working long hours again, including nights and\n\nweekends.    According to plaintiff, she needed to work such hours\n\nbecause of the high-pressure assignments she received.            Smith in\n\nfact had previously told her on more than one occasion that \"it\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fwould be okay [for her] to do a B job instead of an A job.\"\n\nFreadman discounted that statement and did not discuss the matter\n\nwith him further.\n\n           Within approximately six months after her return to work,\n\nFreadman received two salary increases in the amounts of $5,000 and\n\n$4,700, for a total salary of $80,000.            She received these raises\n\nat the election of Smith, her supervisor.              In February 2000, Smith\n\ngave Freadman a rating of \"5,\" the highest possible performance\n\nrating, in her review.       This rating was higher than the rating\n\nFreadman had received before the onset of her illness.                   Freadman\n\nwas also selected in 2000 to participate in a program for the\n\ndevelopment of high-performing, non-officer employees.               Smith had\n\nnominated her for the program.\n\n           In   March   2000,   one     of    Freadman's    subordinates     left\n\nMetropolitan.     Freadman      spoke    to    Smith    about   replacing   this\n\nemployee, noting that the subordinate was her \"top performer.\"\n\nFreadman explained that she was already working nights and weekends\n\non EDB, and she expressed her belief that she would not be able to\n\nkeep the project on track without impairing her health, unless she\n\ncould replace the departed employee. Although there was a company-\n\nwide   hiring   freeze,   Smith    arranged      for     Freadman   to    hire   a\n\nreplacement. Freadman hired someone to fill the position, and that\n\nemployee worked for Freadman through June 2000.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f                 In May 2000, Metropolitan's CEO, Catherine Rein, asked\n\nFreadman         to    give    a   high-profile     presentation    on    EDB   to    the\n\nOfficers' Strategic Planning Group on June 9, 2000.                       Freadman was\n\nunder      the    supervision        of   Cawley,     Smith's   superior,     for    this\n\nproject,         and    Cawley      had   authority     to   make   changes     in   her\n\npresentation.            In an e-mail dated May 31, 2000, Freadman asked\n\nCawley for his views on the presentation.\n\n                 Freadman's ulcerative colitis became active again in June\n\n2000.       This led to an important conversation, the significance of\n\nwhich is at issue in this appeal.                  Freadman stated that on June 2,\n\n2000, she advised Smith that she was working too hard, and that she\n\n\"needed to take some time off because [she was] starting not to\n\nfeel well.\"           Freadman also told Smith that \"some of [her] symptoms\n\nmay be returning.\"                 According to Freadman, Smith responded by\n\nsaying, \"Just get through the presentation on June 9.                       Take your\n\ntime off after.           Keep it up.       You're doing great.          Everything is\n\ngoing excellent.\"1\n\n                 It is undisputed that Freadman was not any more explicit\n\nthan       the    words       quoted.     She   did    not   explicitly     request    a\n\npostponement of the June 9 presentation, which the CEO of the\n\n\n       1\n          Smith denies that Freadman ever told him that she was\nsick prior to the June 9 presentation. He does, however, remember\na conversation in early June in which Freadman mentioned that she\nwas nervous about giving the June 9 presentation before CEO Rein\nand the officer group.      Smith says he responded by saying,\n\"Michele, you have been through this before, hang in there, you\nwill do great. Just stay calm; you will get through it.\"\n\n                                             -5-\n\fcompany had requested.          She did not explicitly say that she wanted\n\ntime off before the June 9 presentation.                       She did not explicitly\n\nstate that her ulcerative colitis had returned and that she needed\n\nto be accommodated immediately.\n\n              Further, it is undisputed that when Smith expressed\n\nconfidence in her and suggested she take time off after the\n\npresentation, she did not say to him that she needed time off\n\nbefore the presentation.             Nor did she raise the topic again with\n\nSmith or anyone else.            Nor was there any physical manifestation\n\nobvious to others that Freadman should not have been working\n\nbetween June 2 and June 9.\n\n              After    this    litigation          started,     in   an   answer   to    an\n\ninterrogatory, Freadman explained that she \"believed that [she]\n\ncould not take any time off as a result of this meeting with Mr.\n\nSmith\"      because    she    would     be    \"viewed      as   a    complainer    and    a\n\nliability.\"           She     alleges      that      she   feared      punishment       and\n\nretaliation.          She did not, however, raise these concerns with\n\nanyone at the company at any time.\n\n              On June 7, 2000, Cawley stopped by Freadman's cubicle to\n\nlook   at    Freadman's       work    on     the   June    9    presentation   on   EDB.\n\nFreadman does not allege that her illness impaired her ability to\n\nprepare for this meeting, or that it affected her ability to\n\nrequest an accommodation on June 7.                    During the June 7 meeting,\n\nCawley was critical of the slides Freadman had prepared and told\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\fher to shorten the presentation. Cawley was concerned about making\n\ngood use of the officers' time and wanted to leave half an hour for\n\nthe   officers   to     talk    about   their   products    in   light   of   the\n\npresentation.       Freadman asked Cawley what she should remove from\n\nthe presentation.       Cawley responded that it was her job to decide\n\nwhich slides to cut.2           Smith, who was present at this meeting,\n\ntestified    that      Cawley    had    suggested   to     Freadman   that     the\n\npresentation had too many slides, that the individual slides were\n\ntoo busy, and that Freadman needed to shorten the presentation and\n\nsimplify the slides.       Lyndalu Pieranunzi, a Metropolitan employee\n\nsubordinate to Freadman who was present throughout the meeting,\n\nconfirmed that there had been a discussion about shortening the\n\npresentation     and    streamlining      the   content.      Pieranunzi      also\n\ntestified that there was tension between Freadman and Cawley during\n\nthe meeting.\n\n            After the meeting with Freadman, Cawley reiterated to\n\nSmith that Freadman's presentation was too busy and contained too\n\nmany slides.      Later that night, Freadman telephoned Smith, who\n\nadvised her to shorten the presentation and clean up the slides, as\n\nCawley had suggested.\n\n\n      2\n          The parties dispute whether Freadman, in response to\nCawley's instruction that the presentation be shortened, tossed her\npresentation on the desk in Cawley's direction and demanded that he\ntell her what to remove, as defendant maintains.        It is also\ndisputed whether Cawley specifically told Freadman to remove\nbreakout sessions from the presentation she had planned. We take\nthe evidence in Freadman's favor.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f            On June 9, 2000, Freadman gave her presentation to the\n\nOfficers' Strategic Planning Group.               Freadman had the officers\n\nparticipate in breakout sessions, and the presentation was longer\n\nthan Cawley wanted. Due to time constraints, Cawley intervened and\n\nended the breakout sessions early.            Freadman noted that Cawley was\n\nupset when he shortened the presentation.            Smith, who attended the\n\npresentation, remembered the introduction going longer than he had\n\nexpected it would, based on the instructions Cawley had given\n\nFreadman.     Pieranunzi, who assisted Freadman on the day of the\n\npresentation, testified that they \"ran out of time.\"\n\n            Metropolitan's       CEO,    Rein,    testified     that     she   was\n\nsurprised that Freadman used breakout sessions at the strategic\n\nplanning meeting. Shortly after the presentation, Cawley explained\n\nto   Rein   that   he    had   instructed      Freadman   in   advance    of   the\n\npresentation not to hold breakout sessions.\n\n            On the next business day, June 12, 2000, Freadman went\n\ninto the office.        Smith stopped by her cubicle that day and said,\n\n\"I thought you were going to take some time off.\"                        Freadman\n\nresponded that she was going to take the rest of the week off, and\n\nthat she would use some personal days as she was \"not feeling\n\nwell.\"   Smith agreed to this plan.           Freadman worked at home for the\n\nremainder of that week.\n\n            On June 12, Cawley told Smith that he \"could not rely\n\nupon [Freadman] to do what he told her to do at a high profile\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fenvironment . . . [,] that he didn't want her to be the project\n\nmanager on something that would put her in that position,\" and that\n\nshe should be rotated into another position.            Smith recommended\n\nFreadman for a vacant position in the Desktop Life Cycle Management\n\nProgram, and Cawley accepted this recommendation.\n\n            After June 9, Cawley twice spoke with Metropolitan's Vice\n\nPresident of Human Resources about rotating Freadman into a new\n\nposition.      Cawley   explained     that   Freadman   had   ignored   his\n\ninstructions to alter her presentation and remove breakout sessions\n\nfrom the agenda.\n\n            Freadman worked from home until June 26, 2000, an extra\n\nweek beyond the period upon which she and Smith had agreed.             On\n\nJune 26, Freadman advised her administrative assistant that she\n\nwould again work from home that day, due to her illness.            Later\n\nthat day, Smith called Freadman and told her she needed to come\n\ninto the office.     Freadman responded that she was still feeling\n\nsick, and she asked if she could come in the next day.          According\n\nto Freadman, Smith then said, \"No, you have to come in the office\n\ntoday.   You have two choices.      You go out on disability or you come\n\nin the office. There's changes in the department that affect you.\"\n\n            Freadman went into the office on June 26 and met with\n\nSmith.   Smith advised her that her job function was being rotated,\n\nand that she would now be working on the Desktop Life Cycle\n\nManagement Program under Richard Sitkus.          Freadman would now be\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\freporting to Joann Kraemer, a manager two levels below Smith.\n\nAlso, her new position was in a technical, not a management, area.\n\nFreadman met with Sitkus, the head of her new project, and he\n\ninformed her that he was moving her cubicle closer to him so that\n\neveryone on the team could be together.                 Freadman remained at work\n\nfor the rest of the day, and then took personal time off the next\n\ntwo days.       She was hospitalized on June 29, 2000, and was in and\n\nout of the hospital for approximately ninety days for treatment of\n\nher    ulcerative      colitis.         Freadman    never     returned   to   her   new\n\nposition.\n\n                                           II.\n\n               Freadman       brought     suit     in   December     2001     against\n\nMetropolitan under the ADA and under state law.                   She alleged that\n\nshe had been discriminated against on account of her disability in\n\nJuly 1999 when she was assigned to the EDB project, as well as in\n\nJune    2000    when    she    was   assigned      to   the    Desktop   Life   Cycle\n\nManagement Program. Freadman also claimed that Metropolitan failed\n\nto provide reasonable accommodations around the time of her medical\n\nleave in 1999 and during the recurrence of her illness in June\n\n2000.    Further, she alleged that Metropolitan retaliated against\n\nher for requesting accommodations.                 Freadman also brought several\n\nclaims against Metropolitan for disability-related discrimination\n\nin violation of state law.                 See Rhode Island Fair Employment\n\nPractices Act (FEPA), R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 28-5-1 to -42; Rhode Island\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fCivil Rights of Individuals with Handicaps Act (RICRIHA), id.\n\n§§ 42-87-1 to -5. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as\n\nwell       as    compensatory       and     punitive    damages,     alleging     that\n\nMetropolitan's conduct caused her to suffer great physical injury\n\nand pain of body, emotional distress, humiliation, indignity, and\n\neconomic losses.\n\n                 After discovery, Metropolitan moved for summary judgment,\n\narguing that Freadman had failed to make out a prima facie case of\n\ndisparate         treatment,      failure    to    accommodate,    or   retaliation.\n\nMetropolitan argued, inter alia, that Freadman's June 2, 2000 and\n\nJune 26, 2000 conversations with Smith did not constitute requests\n\nfor reasonable accommodations, that there was no causal connection\n\nbetween Freadman's disability and the alleged adverse employment\n\naction,         and   that   in   any   event     Freadman   had   failed   to   rebut\n\nMetropolitan's evidence that the change in her duties was motivated\n\nby legitimate business reasons.\n\n                 The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation\n\nrecommending that Metropolitan's motion for summary judgment be\n\ngranted. On plaintiff's disparate treatment claims, the magistrate\n\njudge assumed that Freadman would be able to show that she suffered\n\nfrom a disability within the meaning of the ADA3 and that she was\n\nnevertheless able to perform the essential functions of her job\n\n\n       3\n          The magistrate judge noted that the ADA, FEPA, and\nRICRIHA are similar statutes, and applied the analysis applicable\nunder the ADA to Freadman's state law claims.\n\n                                            -11-\n\fwith or without a reasonable accommodation.           The magistrate judge\n\nalso assumed, without deciding, that the change in plaintiff's\n\nduties in June 2000 constituted a materially adverse employment\n\naction.4   The magistrate judge found, however, that Freadman had\n\nfailed to present \"any evidence which would enable a rational jury\n\nto find that the reassignment of her duties in June 2000 was based,\n\neither in whole or in part, on her alleged disability.\"             Further,\n\nthe magistrate judge stated that a rational jury would not have\n\nbeen able to find that Metropolitan's explanation for the change in\n\nFreadman's   duties   in   June   2000   was   a   pretext   for   disability\n\ndiscrimination.   On plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claims,\n\nthe magistrate judge again assumed that Freadman would be able to\n\ndemonstrate that she was disabled and that she was able to perform\n\nthe essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable\n\naccommodation.    The magistrate judge concluded, however, that\n\nFreadman had not met her burden of showing that Metropolitan,\n\ndespite knowing of plaintiff's disability, failed to reasonably\n\naccommodate it; in particular, he faulted plaintiff for not making\n\nsufficiently direct and specific requests for accommodation in June\n\n2000.5   Finally, on plaintiff's retaliation claims, the magistrate\n\n\n     4\n          With respect to plaintiff's July 1999 disparate treatment\nclaim, the magistrate judge found that plaintiff had not suffered\na materially adverse employment action.\n     5\n          The magistrate judge found that plaintiff had not met her\nburden of showing that her requested accommodation in May 1999 was\nreasonable. He additionally found that plaintiff could not show\n\n                                   -12-\n\fjudge held that the change in Freadman's duties in June 2000 had\n\nnot been ordered in retaliation for any protected activity under\n\nthe ADA.6\n\n             Freadman objected to the magistrate judge's conclusions\n\nregarding her disparate treatment, failure to accommodate, and\n\nretaliation claims, but only with respect to events occurring in\n\nJune 2000.\n\n             The district court granted Metropolitan's motion for\n\nsummary judgment.    The court agreed with the magistrate judge that\n\nFreadman had failed to show causation on her prima facie case of\n\ndisparate treatment. Freadman, 2006 WL 346455, at *5-6. The court\n\nalso held that Freadman had failed on June 2 to articulate a\n\nrequest that was linked to her disability or that was specific\n\nenough to communicate a request for immediate leave.    Id. at *2-3.\n\nIt further held that Freadman's request on June 26 to come into\n\nwork the next day also was insufficiently linked to her disability.\n\nId. at *4.    Finally, the district court agreed with the magistrate\n\njudge that Freadman's retaliation claims must fail because her\n\nrequests did not constitute protected activity.     Id. at *6-7.\n\n             Freadman appeals from the grant of summary judgment.\n\n\nthat Metropolitan had failed to accommodate a request in March\n2000.\n     6\n          The magistrate judge noted that plaintiff could not\nestablish a prima facie case as to retaliation in July 1999 because\nthis change in Freadman's duties did not constitute a materially\nadverse employment action.\n\n                                 -13-\n\f                                 III.\n\n          Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56©;\n\nsee also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).\n\n\"Once the moving party avers the absence of genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact, the nonmovant must show that a factual dispute does\n\nexist, but summary judgment cannot be defeated by relying on\n\nimprobable      inferences,   conclusory   allegations,   or   rank\n\nspeculation.\"    Ingram v. Brink's, Inc., 414 F.3d 222, 228-29 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     We may affirm the grant of summary judgment on any\n\nground supported by the record.    Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp.\n\nof N. Am., 377 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nA.        ADA Disparate Treatment Claim\n\n          The ADA prohibits discrimination against \"a qualified\n\nindividual with a disability because of the disability of such\n\nindividual in regard to . . . terms, conditions, and privileges of\n\nemployment.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).\n\n          We apply here the burden-shifting framework articulated\n\nby the Supreme Court in McDonnell-Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.\n\n792, 802-05 (1973).      See Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe,\n\nInc., 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st Cir. 1999); Dichner v. Liberty Travel,\n\n141 F.3d 24, 29-30 & n.5 (1st Cir. 1998).         If the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\festablishes a prima facie case,7 the burden then shifts to the\n\ndefendant to \"articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason\n\nfor its employment decision and to produce credible evidence to\n\nshow that the reason advanced was the real reason.\"            Tobin v.\n\nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co., 433 F.3d 100, 105 (1st Cir. 2005).        If the\n\ndefendant   offers   a   legitimate,   non-discriminatory   reason,   the\n\ninitial inference of discrimination evaporates, Mesnick v. Gen.\n\nElec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir. 1991), and the burden then\n\nshifts back to the plaintiff to \"proffer evidence to establish that\n\n[the defendant's] non-discriminatory justification is mere pretext,\n\ncloaking discriminatory animus,\" Tobin, 433 F.3d at 105.              The\n\nemployer's burden of articulating a non-discriminatory reason is\n\nonly a burden of production, not a burden of persuasion; the burden\n\nof proving unlawful discrimination rests with the plaintiff at all\n\ntimes.   Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133,\n\n142 (2000); Dichner, 141 F.3d at 30.\n\n            Freadman argues that Metropolitan violated the ADA by\n\nremoving her from the EDB project on June 26.          On appeal, she\n\nasserts that the district court erred in holding that she did not\n\n\n\n     7\n          To satisfy the requirements of a prima facie case of\ndisparate treatment, a plaintiff must establish that (1) she\nsuffers from a disability or handicap, as defined by the ADA; (2)\nshe was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of her\njob, either with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) the\ndefendant took an adverse employment action against her because of,\nin whole or in part, her protected disability. Tobin v. Liberty\nMut. Ins. Co., 433 F.3d 100, 104 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                  -15-\n\festablish a prima facie case of disability discrimination because\n\nshe failed to show causation.         We bypass the prima facie case issue\n\nbecause it is clear that plaintiff has not mustered enough evidence\n\nfor a reasonable jury to conclude that Metropolitan's stated reason\n\nfor her job rotation was pretextual.             See Fennell v. First Step\n\nDesigns, Ltd., 83 F.3d 526, 535 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"On summary\n\njudgment, the need to order the presentation of proof is largely\n\nobviated, and a court may often dispense with strict attention to\n\nthe burden-shifting framework, focusing instead on whether the\n\nevidence as a whole is sufficient to make out a jury question as to\n\npretext and discriminatory animus.\").\n\n            Metropolitan      says   it   removed    Freadman     from    the   EDB\n\nproject because of (1) her behavior during her June 7 meeting with\n\nCawley,   (2)    her   unsatisfactory     presentation      to    the    Officers'\n\nStrategic Planning Group, and (3) Cawley's resulting loss of\n\nconfidence in Freadman.          It is undisputed that at the June 7\n\nmeeting, Cawley expressed concern over the length of Freadman's\n\npresentation for June 9 and told her that he wanted it shortened.\n\nIt   is   also   undisputed    that    Cawley,      after   the    presentation,\n\nconcluded that Freadman had not shortened the presentation enough.\n\nFreadman herself concedes that Cawley was upset when he ended the\n\nJune 9 presentation early because of its length.                  Further, it is\n\nundisputed that Cawley told CEO Rein he had instructed Freadman in\n\nadvance of the presentation not to use breakout sessions, and that\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fRein was surprised that Freadman had done so.              There is no evidence\n\nthat the statement to Rein was motivated by discrimination.                  It is\n\nalso undisputed that after the presentation, Cawley told Smith and\n\nthe Vice President of Human Resources that a new position needed to\n\nbe found for Freadman because she had ignored his instructions.\n\nWhether or not Freadman had explicitly been told to remove the\n\nbreakout    sessions,    there    is   no   evidence     that   Cawley   did    not\n\ngenuinely believe that Freadman had violated his instructions, or\n\nthat his belief was motivated by discrimination.8                   Based on this\n\nevidence, it is clear that defendant met its burden of articulating\n\na   legitimate,     non-discriminatory        reason      for   Freadman's      job\n\nrotation.\n\n            Plaintiff argues that Metropolitan's explanation was\n\npretext. She first points to the temporal relationship between her\n\nJune 2000 requests and her job rotation.               Freadman cites Oliver v.\n\nDigital Equip. Corp., 846 F.2d 103 (1st Cir. 1988), for the\n\nproposition that the occurrence of an adverse employment action\n\n\"soon    after\"   an   employee   engages     in   a    protected    activity   is\n\n\n\n\n     8\n           Freadman has not put forward any proof that Cawley's\nstated   dissatisfaction with    her   conduct  was  \"inaccurate,\nunbelievable, idiosyncratic, or misleading.\" Velázquez-Fernández\nv. NCE Foods, Inc., 476 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 2007). Nor is this a\ncase where a decision maker is fed biased information by\ndiscriminatory underlings.   See Cariglia v. Hertz Equip. Rental\nCorp., 363 F.3d 77, 85-88 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                       -17-\n\f\"indirect     proof    of    a    causal      connection   between     the    [adverse\n\nemployment action] and the activity.\"9                  Id. at 110.\n\n             Timing    may       bear   on    the   question   of    causation   in   a\n\nretaliation claim, but we have also warned that a \"narrow focus [on\n\ntiming may] ignore[] the larger sequence of events and also the\n\nlarger truth.\"        Soileau v. Guilford of Me. Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).        Here, the larger sequence of events shows that\n\nthe company had accommodated Freadman's requests concerning her\n\nulcerative colitis.          After her return from medical leave, she was\n\nallowed to work part-time for several weeks, even though such work\n\nwas not normally available for managers.                   She also received two\n\nsalary increases shortly after returning to Metropolitan, and in\n\n2000 she was selected to participate in a program for rising stars\n\nat    the   company.        Moreover,        Freadman    was   allowed   to    hire   a\n\nreplacement when one of her subordinates left Metropolitan, even\n\nthough there was a company-wide hiring freeze in effect. Also, the\n\ncompany had given her a performance rating in early 2000 that was\n\nhigher than the rating she earned before the onset of her illness.\n\n             Further, the timing between the June 2 request for time\n\noff and the June 26 job rotation does not support a finding of\n\npretext.     There is uncontradicted evidence that the motivation for\n\nthe    change   in    Freadman's        responsibilities       lay    with    Cawley's\n\n\n       9\n          We discuss in the next section whether the June 2\nconversation was indeed a protected request for a reasonable\naccommodation.\n\n                                             -18-\n\finteractions with Freadman on June 7 and June 9 and his resulting\n\ninability to trust her in a high-profile position.                   As for the June\n\n26 request to work from home, this request cannot support a finding\n\nof   pretext     because    it    occurred    after     the   decision    to   remove\n\nFreadman from the EDB project had been made.\n\n            The record as a whole demonstrates that the decision to\n\nmove Freadman into a new position was not causally linked either to\n\nher disability or to her June 2000 conversations with Smith.                      See\n\nCalero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 25-26 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (finding that temporal proximity was sufficient to make out\n\na prima facie case, but affirming dismissal of claim because\n\nplaintiff had failed to demonstrate pretext); Wright v. CompUSA,\n\nInc., 352 F.3d 472, 478 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"[C]hronological proximity\n\ndoes not by itself establish causality . . . .\"); Soileau, 105 F.3d\n\nat 16-17 (acknowledging that discharge occurred immediately after\n\nrequest   for     accommodation,       but    concluding      that   \"[t]he    larger\n\npicture undercuts any claim of causation\").\n\n            Freadman       also    attempts    to   argue     that   Metropolitan's\n\nreasons for removing her from the EDB project are pretextual\n\nbecause Cawley failed to follow Metropolitan's disciplinary policy\n\n-- that is, he did not counsel her about the purported misconduct\n\nthat led to her rotation.           There is no evidence that if there was\n\na    violation    of   the       discipline    policy    it    was    motivated    by\n\ndiscrimination.        Indeed, the claim that there was a violation is\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fundercut by the fact that Metropolitan's policy does not require\n\ncounseling for \"extreme cases[] such as insubordination.\"              Given\n\nhis dissatisfaction with Freadman's presentation and his lack of\n\nconfidence in her ability to follow his instructions, Cawley\n\nreasonably determined that Freadman's behavior qualified as an\n\n\"extreme case,\" and he was thus under no obligation to counsel\n\nFreadman regarding her actions or her reassignment.            The decision\n\nto   rotate      Freadman    into   another   position   without   providing\n\ncounseling \"was within the bounds of [Metropolitan's] disciplinary\n\npolicy and raise[d] no inference of pretext.\"             Colburn v. Parker\n\nHannifin/Nichols Portland Div., 429 F.3d 325, 337 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThere    was    nothing     \"idiosyncratic    or   questionable\"   about   the\n\nemployer's decision.

See Ingram, 414 F.3d at 228-29 (noting that summary judgment\n\ncannot be avoided by relying on improbable inferences or conclusory\n\nallegations).\n\nB.             ADA Reasonable Accommodation Claims\n\n               On appeal, Freadman claims that Metropolitan failed to\n\naccommodate her disability on two occasions -- June 2, before her\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fpresentation to the officers group, when she requested time off,\n\nand June 26, when she asked to work at home for an additional day.10\n\n          The definition of discrimination under the ADA includes\n\n\"not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or\n\nmental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a\n\ndisability who is an applicant or employee, unless [the] covered\n\nentity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue\n\nhardship on the operation of the [entity's] business.\"    42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12112(b)(5)(A); see also Higgins, 194 F.3d at 264.    In order to\n\nsurvive a motion for summary judgment on a reasonable accommodation\n\nclaim, the plaintiff must \"produce enough evidence for a reasonable\n\njury to find that (1) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA,\n\n(2) he was able to perform the essential functions of the job with\n\nor without a reasonable accommodation, and (3) [the defendant],\n\ndespite knowing of [the plaintiff]'s disability, did not reasonably\n\naccommodate it.\"   Rocafort v. IBM Corp., 334 F.3d 115, 119 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n     10\n          The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has\nfiled an amicus brief on Freadman's behalf, making the limited\nargument that plaintiff made requests for time off and to work at\nhome, and that these constituted requests for accommodations under\nthe ADA as well as \"protected activity\" for purposes of the ADA's\nanti-retaliation provision.   While we agree with the EEOC that\nunder certain facts a request for time off or to work at home may\nconstitute a requested accommodation, Freadman's evidence fails to\nestablish that she made requests for reasonable accommodations\nwhich were denied by the employer.\n\n                               -21-\n\f1.          June 2 Request\n\n            Freadman alleges that Metropolitan knew of her disability\n\nyet failed to reasonably accommodate it after she told Smith that\n\nshe \"needed to take some time off because [she was] starting not to\n\nfeel well\" and that \"some of [her] symptoms may be returning.\"\n\n            The ADA imposes liability for an employer's failure to\n\naccommodate \"known physical or mental limitations\" of an employee.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added).        Ordinarily, the\n\nemployer's duty to accommodate is triggered by a request from the\n\nemployee.    Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 261 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); see also 1 B. Lindemann & P.

That\n\nis because \"an employee's disability and concomitant need for\n\naccommodation are often not known to the employer.\" Reed, 244 F.3d\n\nat 261.     Thus, the plaintiff has the burden of showing that she\n\n\"sufficiently requested the accommodation in question.\"11     Id. at\n\n260.    The employee's request (1) \"must be 'sufficiently direct and\n\nspecific,'\" and (2) \"must explain how the accommodation requested\n\nis linked to some disability.\"    Id. at 261 (quoting Wynne v. Tufts\n\n\n\n       11\n          Different rules may apply in situations where a\ndisability prevents the employee from requesting an accommodation,\nor where the need for an accommodation is obvious. See Reed, 244\nF.3d at 261 n.7. That is not the case here. There is no evidence\nto suggest, and plaintiff does not argue, that her colitis\nprevented her from properly requesting an accommodation.\n\n                                 -22-\n\fUniv. Sch. of Med., 976 F.2d 791, 795 (1st Cir. 1992)); see also\n\nEstades-Negroni, 377 F.3d at 64 (requiring request to be \"express\"\n\nand \"linked to a disability\").\n\n           In addition to making a sufficient request concerning a\n\nknown limitation, the plaintiff must also show that the proposed\n\naccommodation is reasonable -- that it \"would enable her to perform\n\nthe essential functions of her job,\" and that \"at least on the face\n\nof   things,     it     is     feasible    for     the    employer    under     the\n\ncircumstances.\"        Reed, 244 F.3d at 259; see also US Airways, Inc.\n\nv.

Acushnet Co.,\n\n460 F.3d 141, 148 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           If the plaintiff can make these showings, the defendant\n\nthen has the opportunity to show that the proposed accommodation\n\nwould impose an undue hardship.             Reed, 244 F.3d at 259; see also\n\nBarnett, 535 U.S. at 402.             We need not address the questions of\n\nreasonableness or undue hardship because Freadman has failed to\n\nshow that her request for time off was for time off before the June\n\n9 presentation.\n\n           As    to    the    link    between    Freadman's    request   and    her\n\ndisability, Freadman and the EEOC argue that there was sufficient\n\nevidence   for    a    jury    to    conclude   that   Metropolitan    knew    that\n\nFreadman's      June    2     request    was    related   to   her    disability.\n\nMetropolitan disputes this.             The appropriate inquiry is whether\n\ndefendant knew or reasonably should have known that the reason for\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fFreadman's request was her disability.           See Wynne, 976 F.2d at 795\n\n(addressing a claim brought under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794).12\n\n            We agree that there was sufficient evidence to create a\n\ntriable issue on the link between Freadman's June 2 request and her\n\ndisabling colitis. Taking the evidence in plaintiff's favor, Smith\n\nknew that Freadman took medical leave from March 1999 to July 1999\n\nin order to receive treatment for her colitis.              While Freadman was\n\nrecovering, Smith acknowledged plaintiff's need for more reasonable\n\nhours and a better work/life balance.                Further, when one of\n\nFreadman's subordinates left Metropolitan in March 2000, Freadman\n\nnotified Smith that she needed to hire a replacement or else risk\n\nimpairing    her   health.      When   Smith    responded    that   there   were\n\nconcerns    that   the   home   office    was   getting   too   big,   Freadman\n\nobjected, \"I'm basically killing myself to keep this [project] on\n\ntrack, and I'm going to get sick again.\"           Smith replied, \"I know.\n\nI know.    All right.    All right.      Just [hire a replacement] quick.\"\n\nThis is not a situation, as in Soileau, where the employer's mere\n\nknowledge of medical leave over three years prior was insufficient\n\nto put it on notice of a present disability.              105 F.3d at 14, 16.\n\n            Freadman's accommodation claim nevertheless founders due\n\nto her failure to produce evidence that would permit a jury to\n\n\n     12\n          \"Claims under Title I of the ADA and § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act are analyzed under the same standards.\" Phelps\nv. Optima Health, Inc., 251 F.3d 21, 23 n.2 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                       -24-\n\fconclude that the employer was put on notice of a \"sufficiently\n\ndirect and specific\" request for her desired accommodation.    She\n\nargues it was clear that her request was to take time off starting\n\non June 2, rather than at some unspecified time. However, Freadman\n\ntold Smith that she \"needed to take some time off because [she was]\n\nstarting not to feel well\" (emphasis added).   Plaintiff expressed\n\nmerely a need to take \"some time off\" without specifying when she\n\nwould need that time off.   Freadman, who had better knowledge than\n\nSmith of her condition and symptoms, had some burden to be specific\n\nabout the accommodation she required.   See Reed, 244 F.3d at 260-\n\n62; see also Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130,\n\n1136-37 (7th Cir. 1996) (recognizing that liability for a failure\n\nto accommodate claim may turn on whether \"missing information is of\n\nthe type that can only be provided by one of the parties\").     No\n\nrational jury could conclude that Smith reasonably should have\n\nknown that Freadman was requesting time off before the presentation\n\non June 9.   The employer has \"no duty to divine the need for a\n\nspecial accommodation\" where the employee fails to make an adequate\n\nrequest.   Reed, 244 F.3d at 261.\n\n           Smith, in response to Freadman's request, reasonably\n\nsuggested that Freadman take time off after the presentation, only\n\na week later.   To the extent plaintiff adequately requested time\n\noff at some unspecified point in the future, defendant granted a\n\nreasonable accommodation.   If this was not what Freadman sought,\n\n\n                                -25-\n\fshe could have clarified that she needed time off immediately. She\n\nnever did so.\n\n           There        was   no     transgression    of        the   employer's\n\nresponsibility to help determine what would constitute a reasonable\n\naccommodation.      The federal regulations implementing the equal\n\nemployment provisions of the ADA state:\n\n           To   determine    the  appropriate  reasonable\n           accommodation it may be necessary for the\n           covered entity to initiate an informal,\n           interactive    process   with   the  qualified\n           individual with a disability in need of the\n           accommodation. This process should identify\n           the precise limitations resulting from the\n           disability      and    potential    reasonable\n           accommodations that could overcome those\n           limitations.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3).            \"Once a qualified individual with a\n\ndisability has requested provision of a reasonable accommodation,\n\nthe   employer   must     make   a   reasonable   effort   to     determine   the\n\nappropriate accommodation.\"           Id. pt. 1630, app. § 1630.9.13          The\n\nemployer   has     an    obligation    upon   learning     of    an   employee's\n\ndisability to \"engage in a meaningful dialogue with the employee to\n\nfind the best means of accommodating that disability.\"                Tobin, 433\n\nF.3d at 108. The employee also has an obligation: \"The appropriate\n\n\n\n      13\n          The EEOC's interpretive guidance on Title I of the ADA,\n29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app., \"'while not controlling upon the courts\nby reason of [its] authority, do[es] constitute a body of\nexperience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may\nproperly resort for guidance.'\"     Grenier v. Cyanamid Plastics,\nInc., 70 F.3d 667, 672 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Meritor Sav. Bank,\nFSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65 (1986)).\n\n                                       -26-\n\freasonable accommodation is best determined through a flexible,\n\ninteractive    process   that   involves   both   the   employer   and   the\n\n[employee] with a disability.\"      29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. § 1630.9;\n\nsee also Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 24.\n\n            Here, there was an informal process. But Freadman failed\n\nto be sufficiently specific, and Metropolitan granted the request\n\nit thought had been made.       Under the circumstances, Metropolitan\n\noffered plaintiff a reasonable accommodation, and Freadman cannot\n\nnow argue that the company should have offered something different.\n\nCf. Webster v. Methodist Occupational Health Ctrs., Inc., 141 F.3d\n\n1236, 1238 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"An employee cannot refuse reasonable\n\naccommodations during the interactive process . . ., and then after\n\ndismissal suggest something different . . . .\").\n\n            In a final attempt to salvage the June 2 reasonable\n\naccommodation claim, Freadman -- but not the EEOC – argues that her\n\nfailure to clarify her request was excusable due to intimidation:\n\nshe believed she would be punished if she pursued her request for\n\ntime off.     We reject plaintiff's proposition that employees who\n\nmake requests have no obligation to further clarify their needs\n\nonce the employer offers an accommodation the employee believes is\n\ninsufficient. There may well be instances in which an employee has\n\nmade a clear request, the employer has denied the accommodation or\n\noffered an unsatisfactory accommodation, the employee has become\n\ntoo intimidated to continue seeking a satisfactory accommodation,\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fand the employer reasonably should have understood that dynamic.\n\nThis will depend on the particular facts of the case.                          Here,\n\nplaintiff has not made a plausible, objective case of intimidation.\n\nSee Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc., 96 F.3d 506, 515 (1st Cir.\n\n1996);    accord     Beck,    75     F.3d   at   1135-36.       Before   June     2,\n\nMetropolitan had granted Freadman several months of time off for\n\ntreatment of her ulcerative colitis.                 The employer even made\n\nexceptions to company work rules and hiring freezes.                     Moreover,\n\nSmith    had    given     Freadman    two   raises   and    a   high   performance\n\nevaluation since her return from medical leave in 1999.                  Smith did\n\nin fact reasonably respond to the request made of him.                           No\n\nreasonable juror could find that there was intimidation so as to\n\nexcuse Freadman from clarifying her request.                Summary judgment in\n\nfavor of Metropolitan on Freadman's June 2 reasonable accommodation\n\nclaim is appropriate.\n\n2.             June 26 Request\n\n               Freadman     alleges     that     Metropolitan     knew    of     her\n\ndisability, yet failed to reasonably accommodate it, when on June\n\n26 she informed Smith that she was still feeling sick and then\n\nasked if she could work from home an additional day.                      Smith's\n\nresponse was, \"No, you have to come in the office today.                  You have\n\ntwo choices.       You go out on disability or you come in the office.\n\nThere's changes in the department that affect you.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\f          Freadman decided to go into the office rather than go out\n\non disability.    She explained that \"no one wants to go out on\n\ndisability   unless   .   .   .   they   absolutely   have   to,\"   and   she\n\nadditionally explained that \"normally, you have to use a certain\n\nnumber of sick days prior to going out on disability.\"          Smith, for\n\nhis part, said that he had told Freadman, \"[I]f you are not feeling\n\nwell, then you should consider taking, you know, [paid time off] or\n\ngoing out on disability; if you are going to work, whether it's\n\nfrom home or in the office, then you need to come in.\"\n\n          It is far from clear that any accommodation claim can be\n\nmaintained when an employee argues she should not, after having\n\ntaken unauthorized leave, be put to the choice of taking disability\n\nleave or coming into the office to arrange working at home.\n\nFurther, Freadman does not claim to have suffered any particular\n\nharm from going into the office on June 26.\n\n          If this claim is meant to color the June 2 accommodation\n\nclaim, it adds nothing.       Metropolitan's response to the June 26\n\nrequest was entirely reasonable.\n\n          If the claim is meant to demonstrate that Freadman was\n\nentitled to work at home,14 it was still reasonable for the employer\n\n\n     14\n          Freadman has made no effort, however, to show that she\ncould have performed the essential functions of her job at home.\nSee Mulloy, 460 F.3d at 148; Kvorjak v. Maine, 259 F.3d 48, 55 (1st\nCir. 2001); Reed, 244 F.3d at 259; see also Feliciano v. Rhode\nIsland, 160 F.3d 780, 785 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"The ADA does not\nrequire an employer to accommodate a disability by foregoing an\nessential function of the position or by reallocating essential\n\n                                    -29-\n\fto have her come into the office to arrange that.\n\n             Summary judgment on the June 26 failure to accommodate\n\nclaim is affirmed.\n\nC.           ADA Retaliation Claim\n\n             Freadman alleges that her June 2 and June 26 requests for\n\naccommodation constituted protected conduct, and that as a result\n\nof these requests, she suffered an adverse employment action when\n\nshe was rotated out of the EDB project.\n\n             The ADA's retaliation provision states that \"[n]o person\n\nshall discriminate against any individual because such individual\n\nhas opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter.\"            42\n\nU.S.C. § 12203(a).        Requesting an accommodation is protected\n\nconduct for purposes of the ADA's retaliation provision.             Wright,\n\n352   F.3d   at   478.   An   ADA   plaintiff   may   assert   a   claim   for\n\nretaliation even if she fails to succeed on a disability claim.\n\nSoileau, 105 F.3d at 16.\n\n             To establish a claim of retaliation, a plaintiff must\n\nshow that (1) she engaged in protected conduct, (2) she suffered an\n\nadverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal connection\n\nbetween the protected conduct and the adverse employment action.\n\nWright, 352 F.3d at 478; Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 25.\n\n             Plaintiff's retaliation claim fails.       Even assuming that\n\nFreadman engaged in protected conduct and suffered an adverse\n\n\nfunctions to make other workers' jobs more onerous.\").\n\n                                    -30-\n\femployment action, she has not shown a causal connection between\n\nher June 2000 requests and her job rotation on June 26.          No\n\nreasonable juror could find that Freadman's June 2 conversation\n\nwith Smith had any bearing on Cawley's decision to change her job\n\nresponsibilities.    Further, no causation can be established based\n\non the June 26 request to work from home, as this request occurred\n\nafter Cawley had made the decision to remove Freadman from the EDB\n\nproject. We affirm summary judgment for Metropolitan on Freadman's\n\nretaliation claim.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          For the reasons stated above,15 the district court's entry\n\nof summary judgment for Metropolitan is affirmed.        Costs are\n\nawarded to defendant.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n          Plaintiff does not appeal from entry of summary judgment\non her FEPA and RICRIHA claims under Rhode Island law.\n\n                                -31-\n\f",

In March 1999, Freadman became ill with ulcerative colitis, and from March 1999 to July 1999, she took medical leave for treatment of this condition. At the time, Freadman reported to Assistant Vice President Robert Smith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During her convalescence, Smith visited Freadman and phoned her on several occasions. During these conversations, Freadman and Smith discussed Freadman's need for \"reasonable hours, [fewer] last minute time driven assignments, work/life balance, being able to exercise, [and] having adequate staff.\" Smith agreed to Freadman's request for a better work/life balance and to make changes; indeed, he told Freadman that she worked too hard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman returned to work in July 1999. She was accommodated by being allowed to work part-time for the first several weeks, even though such part-time work was not normally available for managers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon her return, Smith reassigned Freadman's training, compliance, and performance enhancement duties to other employees in an attempt to reduce her workload, as she had requested. Smith also arranged for Freadman to take over a new project known as \"Ease of Doing Business\" (EDB), which was headed by Smith's boss, Chris Cawley. Although Smith did not request that she do so, Freadman began working long hours again, including nights and weekends. According to plaintiff, she needed to work such hours because of the high-pressure assignments she received. Smith in fact had previously told her on more than one occasion that \"it would be okay [for her] to do a B job instead of an A job.\" Freadman discounted that statement and did not discuss the matter with him further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within approximately six months after her return to work, Freadman received two salary increases in the amounts of $5,000 and $4,700, for a total salary of $80,000. She received these raises at the election of Smith, her supervisor. In February 2000, Smith gave Freadman a rating of \"5,\" the highest possible performance rating, in her review. This rating was higher than the rating Freadman had received before the onset of her illness. Freadman was also selected in 2000 to participate in a program for the development of high-performing, non-officer employees. Smith had nominated her for the program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2000, one of Freadman's subordinates left Metropolitan. Freadman spoke to Smith about replacing this employee, noting that the subordinate was her \"top performer.\" Freadman explained that she was already working nights and weekends on EDB, and she expressed her belief that she would not be able to keep the project on track without impairing her health, unless she could replace the departed employee. Although there was a company-wide hiring freeze, Smith arranged for Freadman to hire a replacement. Freadman hired someone to fill the position, and that employee worked for Freadman through June 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2000, Metropolitan's CEO, Catherine Rein, asked Freadman to give a high-profile presentation on EDB to the Officers' Strategic Planning Group on June 9, 2000. Freadman was under the supervision of Cawley, Smith's superior, for this project, and Cawley had authority to make changes in her presentation. In an e-mail dated May 31, 2000, Freadman asked Cawley for his views on the presentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman's ulcerative colitis became active again in June 2000. This led to an important conversation, the significance of which is at issue in this appeal. Freadman stated that on June 2, 2000, she advised Smith that she was working too hard, and that she \"needed to take some time off because [she was] starting not to feel well.\" Freadman also told Smith that \"some of [her] symptoms may be returning.\" According to Freadman, Smith responded by saying, \"Just get through the presentation on June 9. Take your time off after. Keep it up. You're doing great. Everything is going excellent.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Freadman was not any more explicit than the words quoted. She did not explicitly request a postponement of the June 9 presentation, which the CEO of the company had requested. She did not explicitly say that she wanted time off before the June 9 presentation. She did not explicitly state that her ulcerative colitis had returned and that she needed to be accommodated immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, it is undisputed that when Smith expressed confidence in her and suggested she take time off after the presentation, she did not say to him that she needed time off before the presentation. Nor did she raise the topic again with Smith or anyone else. Nor was there any physical manifestation obvious to others that Freadman should not have been working between June 2 and June 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this litigation started, in an answer to an interrogatory, Freadman explained that she \"believed that [she] could not take any time off as a result of this meeting with Mr. Smith\" because she would be \"viewed as a complainer and a liability.\" She alleges that she feared punishment and retaliation. She did not, however, raise these concerns with anyone at the company at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 7, 2000, Cawley stopped by Freadman's cubicle to look at Freadman's work on the June 9 presentation on EDB. Freadman does not allege that her illness impaired her ability to prepare for this meeting, or that it affected her ability to request an accommodation on June 7. During the June 7 meeting, Cawley was critical of the slides Freadman had prepared and told her to shorten the presentation. Cawley was concerned about making good use of the officers' time and wanted to leave half an hour for the officers to talk about their products in light of the presentation. Freadman asked Cawley what she should remove from the presentation. Cawley responded that it was her job to decide which slides to cut.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Smith, who was present at this meeting, testified that Cawley had suggested to Freadman that the presentation had too many slides, that the individual slides were too busy, and that Freadman needed to shorten the presentation and simplify the slides. Lyndalu Pieranunzi, a Metropolitan employee subordinate to Freadman who was present throughout the meeting, confirmed that there had been a discussion about shortening the presentation and streamlining the content. Pieranunzi also testified that there was tension between Freadman and Cawley during the meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the meeting with Freadman, Cawley reiterated to Smith that Freadman's presentation was too busy and contained too many slides. Later that night, Freadman telephoned Smith, who advised her to shorten the presentation and clean up the slides, as Cawley had suggested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 9, 2000, Freadman gave her presentation to the Officers' Strategic Planning Group. Freadman had the officers participate in breakout sessions, and the presentation was longer than Cawley wanted. Due to time constraints, Cawley intervened and ended the breakout sessions early. Freadman noted that Cawley was upset when he shortened the presentation. Smith, who attended the presentation, remembered the introduction going longer than he had expected it would, based on the instructions Cawley had given Freadman. Pieranunzi, who assisted Freadman on the day of the presentation, testified that they \"ran out of time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metropolitan's CEO, Rein, testified that she was surprised that Freadman used breakout sessions at the strategic planning meeting. Shortly after the presentation, Cawley explained to Rein that he had instructed Freadman in advance of the presentation not to hold breakout sessions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the next business day, June 12, 2000, Freadman went into the office. Smith stopped by her cubicle that day and said, \"I thought you were going to take some time off.\" Freadman responded that she was going to take the rest of the week off, and that she would use some personal days as she was \"not feeling well.\" Smith agreed to this plan.

[,] that he didn't want her to be the project manager on something that would put her in that position,\" and that she should be rotated into another position.

On June 26, Freadman advised her administrative assistant that she would again work from home that day, due to her illness. Later that day, Smith called Freadman and told her she needed to come into the office. Freadman responded that she was still feeling sick, and she asked if she could come in the next day. According to Freadman, Smith then said, \"No, you have to come in the office today. You have two choices. You go out on disability or you come in the office. There's changes in the department that affect you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman went into the office on June 26 and met with Smith. Smith advised her that her job function was being rotated, and that she would now be working on the Desktop Life Cycle Management Program under Richard Sitkus. Freadman would now be reporting to Joann Kraemer, a manager two levels below Smith. Also, her new position was in a technical, not a management, area. Freadman met with Sitkus, the head of her new project, and he informed her that he was moving her cubicle closer to him so that everyone on the team could be together. Freadman remained at work for the rest of the day, and then took personal time off the next two days. She was hospitalized on June 29, 2000, and was in and out of the hospital for approximately ninety days for treatment of her ulcerative colitis. Freadman never returned to her new position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman brought suit in December 2001 against Metropolitan under the ADA and under state law. She alleged that she had been discriminated against on account of her disability in July 1999 when she was assigned to the EDB project, as well as in June 2000 when she was assigned to the Desktop Life Cycle Management Program. Freadman also claimed that Metropolitan failed to provide reasonable accommodations around the time of her medical leave in 1999 and during the recurrence of her illness in June 2000. Further, she alleged that Metropolitan retaliated against her for requesting accommodations. Freadman also brought several claims against Metropolitan for disability-related discrimination in violation of state law. <i>See</i> Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;&#167; 28-5-1 to 28-5-42; Rhode Island Civil Rights of Individuals with Handicaps Act (RICRIHA), <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 42-87-1 to 42-87-5. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that Metropolitan's conduct caused her to suffer great physical injury and pain of body, emotional distress, humiliation, indignity, and economic losses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, Metropolitan moved for summary judgment, arguing that Freadman had failed to make out a prima facie case of disparate treatment, failure to accommodate, or retaliation. Metropolitan argued, inter alia, that Freadman's June 2, 2000 and June 26, 2000 conversations with Smith did not constitute requests for reasonable accommodations, that there was no causal connection between Freadman's disability and the alleged adverse employment action, and that in any event Freadman had failed to rebut Metropolitan's evidence that the change in her duties was motivated by legitimate business reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending that Metropolitan's motion for summary judgment be granted. On plaintiff's disparate treatment claims, the magistrate judge assumed that Freadman would be able to show that she suffered from a disability within the meaning of the ADA<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and that she was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation. The magistrate judge also assumed, without deciding, that the change in plaintiff's duties in June 2000 constituted a materially adverse employment action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The magistrate judge found, however, that Freadman had failed to present \"any evidence which would enable a rational jury to find that the reassignment of her duties in June 2000 was based, either in whole or in part, on her alleged disability.\" Further, the magistrate judge stated that a rational jury would not have been able to find that Metropolitan's explanation for the change in Freadman's duties in June 2000 was a pretext for disability discrimination. On plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claims, the magistrate judge again assumed that Freadman would be able to demonstrate that she was disabled and that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation. The magistrate judge concluded, however, that Freadman had not met her burden of showing that Metropolitan, despite knowing of plaintiff's disability, failed to reasonably accommodate it; in particular, he faulted plaintiff for not making sufficiently direct and specific requests for accommodations in June 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Finally, on plaintiff's retaliation claims, the magistrate judge held that the change in Freadman's duties in June 2000 had not been ordered in retaliation for any protected activity under the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman objected to the magistrate judge's conclusions regarding her disparate treatment, failure to accommodate, and retaliation claims, but only with respect to events occurring in June 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted Metropolitan's motion for summary judgment. The court agreed with the magistrate judge that Freadman had failed to show causation on her prima facie case of disparate treatment. <i>Freadman,</i> 2006 WL 346455, at *5-6. The court also held that Freadman had failed on June 2 to articulate a request that was linked to her disability or that was specific enough to communicate a request for immediate leave. <i>Id.</i> at *2-3. It further held that Freadman's request on June 26 to come into work the next day also was insufficiently linked to her disability. <i>Id.</i> at *4. Finally, the district court agreed with the magistrate judge that Freadman's retaliation claims must fail because her requests did not constitute protected activity. <i>Id.</i> at *6-7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman appeals from the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <i>see also Celotex Corp. v.

The employer's burden of articulating a non-discriminatory reason is only a burden of production, not a burden of persuasion; the burden of proving unlawful discrimination rests with the plaintiff at all times. <i>Reeves v.

On appeal, she asserts that the district court erred in holding that she did not establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination because she failed to show causation. We bypass the prima facie case issue because it is clear that plaintiff has not mustered enough evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Metropolitan's stated reason for her job rotation was pretextual. <i>See Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd.,</i> 83 F.3d 526, 535 (1st Cir.1996) (\"On summary judgment, the need to order the presentation of proof is largely obviated, and a court may often dispense with strict attention to the burden-shifting framework, focusing instead on whether the evidence as a whole is sufficient to make out a jury question as to pretext and discriminatory animus.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metropolitan says it removed Freadman from the EDB project because of (1) her behavior during her June 7 meeting with Cawley, (2) her unsatisfactory presentation to the Officers' Strategic Planning Group, and (3) Cawley's resulting loss of confidence in Freadman. It is undisputed that at the June 7 meeting, Cawley expressed concern over the length of Freadman's presentation for June 9 and told her that he wanted it shortened. It is also undisputed that Cawley, after the presentation, concluded that Freadman had not shortened the presentation enough. Freadman herself concedes that Cawley was upset when he ended the June 9 presentation early because of its length. Further, it is undisputed that Cawley told CEO Rein he had instructed Freadman in advance of the presentation not to use breakout sessions, and that Rein was surprised that Freadman had done so. There is no evidence that the statement to Rein was motivated by discrimination. It is also undisputed that after the presentation, Cawley told Smith and the Vice President of Human Resources that a new position needed to be found for Freadman because she had ignored his instructions. Whether or not Freadman had explicitly been told to remove the breakout sessions, there is no evidence that Cawley did not genuinely believe that Freadman had violated his instructions, or that his belief was motivated by discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Based on this evidence, it is clear that defendant met its burden of articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Freadman's job rotation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff argues that Metropolitan's explanation was pretext. She first points to the temporal relationship between her June 2000 requests and her job rotation. Freadman cites <i>Oliver v. Digital Equipment Corp.,</i> 846 F.2d 103 (1st Cir.1988), for the proposition that the occurrence of an adverse employment action \"soon after\" an employee engages in a protected activity is \"indirect proof of a causal connection between the [adverse employment action] and the activity.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>Id.</i> at 110.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Timing may bear on the question of causation in a retaliation claim, but we have also warned that a \"narrow focus [on timing may] ignore[] the larger sequence of events and also the larger truth.\" <i>Soileau v. Guilford of Me. Inc.,</i> 105 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1997). Here, the larger sequence of events shows that the company had accommodated Freadman's requests concerning her ulcerative colitis. After her return from medical leave, she was allowed to work part-time for several weeks, even though such work was not normally available for managers. She also received two salary increases shortly after returning to Metropolitan, and in 2000 she was selected to participate in a program for rising stars at the company. Moreover, Freadman was allowed to hire a replacement when one of her subordinates left Metropolitan, even though there was a company-wide hiring freeze in effect. Also, the company had given her a performance rating in early 2000 that was higher than the rating she earned before the onset of her illness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the timing between the June 2 request for time off and the June 26 job rotation does not support a finding of pretext. There is uncontradicted evidence that the motivation for the change in Freadman's responsibilities lay with Cawley's interactions with Freadman on June 7 and June 9 and his resulting inability to trust her in a high-profile position. As for the June 26 request to work from home, this request cannot support a finding of pretext because it occurred <i>after</i> the decision to remove Freadman from the EDB project had been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record as a whole demonstrates that the decision to move Freadman into a new position was not causally linked either to her disability or to her June 2000 conversations with Smith. <i>See Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 355 F.3d 6, 25-26 (1st Cir.2004) (finding that temporal proximity was sufficient to make out a prima facie case, but affirming dismissal of claim because plaintiff had failed to demonstrate pretext); <i>Wright v. CompUSA, Inc.,</i> 352 F.3d 472, 478 (1st Cir.2003) (\"[C]hronological proximity does not by itself establish causality. . . .\"); <i>Soileau,</i> 105 F.3d at 16-17 (acknowledging that discharge occurred immediately after request for accommodation, but concluding that \"[t]he larger picture undercuts any claim of causation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman also attempts to argue that Metropolitan's reasons for removing her from the EDB project are pretextual because Cawley failed to follow Metropolitan's disciplinary policy &#8212; that is, he did not counsel her about the purported misconduct that led to her rotation. There is no evidence that if there was a violation of the discipline policy it was motivated by discrimination. Indeed, the claim that there was a violation is undercut by the fact that Metropolitan's policy does not require counseling for \"extreme cases[] such as insubordination.\" Given his dissatisfaction with Freadman's presentation and his lack of confidence in her ability to follow his instructions, Cawley reasonably determined that Freadman's behavior qualified as an \"extreme case,\" and he was thus under no obligation to counsel Freadman regarding her actions or her reassignment. The decision to rotate Freadman into another position without providing counseling \"was within the bounds of [Metropolitan's] disciplinary policy and raise[d] no inference of pretext.\" <i>Colburn v. Parker Hannifin/Nichols Portland Div.,</i> 429 F.3d 325, 337 (1st Cir.2005). There was nothing \"idiosyncratic or questionable\" about the employer's decision. <i>Gray v. New Eng. Tel. &amp; Tel.

Metropolitan disputes this. The appropriate inquiry is whether defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the reason for Freadman's request was her disability. <i>See Wynne,</i> 976 F.2d at 795 (addressing a claim brought under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that there was sufficient evidence to create a triable issue on the link between Freadman's June 2 request and her disabling colitis. Taking the evidence in plaintiff's favor, Smith knew that Freadman took medical leave from March 1999 to July 1999 in order to receive treatment for her colitis. While Freadman was recovering, Smith acknowledged plaintiff's need for more reasonable hours and a better work/life balance. Further, when one of Freadman's subordinates left Metropolitan in March 2000, Freadman notified Smith that she needed to hire a replacement <i>or else</i> risk impairing her health. When Smith responded that there were concerns that the home office was getting too big, Freadman objected, \"I'm basically killing myself to keep this [project] on track, and I'm going to get sick again.\" Smith replied, \"I know. I know. All right. All right. Just [hire a replacement] quick.\" This is not a situation, as in <i>Soileau,</i> where the employer's mere knowledge of medical leave <i>over three years prior</i> was insufficient to put it on notice of a present disability. 105 F.3d at 14, 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman's accommodation claim nevertheless founders due to her failure to produce evidence that would permit a jury to conclude that the employer was put on notice of a \"sufficiently direct and specific\" request for her desired accommodation. She argues it was clear that her request was to take time off starting on June 2, rather than at some unspecified time. However, Freadman told Smith that she \"needed to take some time off because [she was] <i>starting</i> not to feel well\" (emphasis added). Plaintiff expressed merely a need to take \"some time off\" without specifying <i>when</i> she would need that time off. Freadman, who had better knowledge than Smith of her condition and symptoms, had some burden to be specific about the accommodation she required. <i>See Reed,</i> 244 F.3d at 260-62; <i>see also Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents,</i> 75 F.3d 1130, 1136-37 (7th Cir.1996) (recognizing that liability for a failure to accommodate claim may turn on whether \"missing information is of the type that can only be provided by one of the parties\"). No rational jury could conclude that Smith reasonably should have known that Freadman was requesting time off before the presentation on June 9. The employer has \"no duty to divine the need for a special accommodation\" where the employee fails to make an adequate request. <i>Reed,</i> 244 F.3d at 261.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith, in response to Freadman's request, reasonably suggested that Freadman take time off after the presentation, only a week later.

But Freadman failed to be sufficiently specific, and Metropolitan granted the request it thought had been made. Under the circumstances, Metropolitan offered plaintiff a reasonable accommodation, and Freadman cannot now argue that the company should have offered something different. <i>Cf. Webster v. Methodist Occupational Health Ctrs., Inc.,</i> 141 F.3d 1236, 1238 (7th Cir.1998) (\"An employee cannot refuse reasonable accommodations during the interactive process ..., and then after dismissal suggest something different. . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a final attempt to salvage the June 2 reasonable accommodation claim, Freadman &#8212; but not the EEOC &#8212; argues that her failure to clarify her request was excusable due to intimidation: she believed she would be punished if she pursued her request for time off. We reject plaintiff's proposition that employees who make requests have no obligation to further clarify their needs once the employer offers an accommodation the employee believes is insufficient. There may well be instances in which an employee has made a clear request, the employer has denied the accommodation or offered an unsatisfactory accommodation, the employee has become too intimidated to continue seeking a satisfactory accommodation, and the employer reasonably should have understood that dynamic. This will depend on the particular facts of the case. Here, plaintiff has not made a plausible, objective case of intimidation. <i>See Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc.,</i> 96 F.3d 506, 515 (1st Cir. 1996); <i>accord Beck,</i> 75 F.3d at 1135-36. Before June 2, Metropolitan had granted Freadman several months of time off for treatment of her ulcerative colitis. The employer even made exceptions to company work rules and hiring freezes. Moreover, Smith had given Freadman two raises and a high performance evaluation since her return from medical leave in 1999. Smith did in fact reasonably respond to the request made of him. No reasonable juror could find that there was intimidation so as to excuse Freadman from clarifying her request. Summary judgment in favor of Metropolitan on Freadman's June 2 reasonable accommodation claim is appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>June 26 Request</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman alleges that Metropolitan knew of her disability, yet failed to reasonably accommodate it, when on June 26 she informed Smith that she was still feeling sick and then asked if she could work from home an additional day. Smith's response was, \"No, you have to come in the office today. You have two choices. You go out on disability or you come in the office. There's changes in the department that affect you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman decided to go into the office rather than go out on disability. She explained that \"no one wants to go out on disability unless . . . they absolutely have to,\" and she additionally explained that \"normally, you have to use a certain number of sick days prior to going out on disability.\" Smith, for his part, said that he had told Freadman, \"[I]f you are not feeling well, then you should consider taking, you know, [paid time off] or going out on disability; if you are going to work, whether it's from home or in the office, then you need to come in.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is far from clear that any accommodation claim can be maintained when an employee argues she should not, after having taken unauthorized leave, be put to the choice of taking disability leave or coming into the office to arrange working at home. Further, Freadman does not claim to have suffered any particular harm from going into the office on June 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this claim is meant to color the June 2 accommodation claim, it adds nothing.

Requesting an accommodation is protected conduct for purposes of the ADA's retaliation provision. <i>Wright,</i> 352 F.3d at 478. An ADA plaintiff may assert a claim for retaliation even if she fails to succeed on a disability claim. <i>Soileau,</i> 105 F.3d at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a claim of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) she engaged in protected conduct, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action. <i>Wright,</i> 352 F.3d at 478; <i>Calero-Cerezo,</i> 355 F.3d at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's retaliation claim fails. Even assuming that Freadman engaged in protected conduct and suffered an adverse employment action, she has not shown a causal connection between her June 2000 requests and her job rotation on June 26. No reasonable juror could find that Freadman's June 2 conversation with Smith had any bearing on Cawley's decision to change her job responsibilities. Further, no causation can be established based on the June 26 request to work from home, as this request occurred after Cawley had made the decision to remove Freadman from the EDB project. We affirm summary judgment for Metropolitan on Freadman's retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> the district court's entry of summary judgment for Metropolitan is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Smith denies that Freadman ever told him that she was sick prior to the June 9 presentation.

In March 1999, Freadman became ill with ulcerative colitis, and from March 1999 to July 1999, she took medical leave for treatment of this condition. At the time, Freadman reported to Assistant Vice President Robert Smith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During her convalescence, Smith visited Freadman and phoned her on several occasions. During these conversations, Freadman and Smith discussed Freadman's need for \"reasonable hours, [fewer] last minute time driven assignments, work/life balance, being able to exercise, [and] having adequate staff.\" Smith agreed to Freadman's request for a better work/life balance and to make changes; indeed, he told Freadman that she worked too hard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman returned to work in July 1999. She was accommodated by being allowed to work part-time for the first several weeks, even though such part-time work was not normally available for managers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon her return, Smith reassigned Freadman's training, compliance, and performance enhancement duties to other employees in an attempt to reduce her workload, as she had requested. Smith also arranged for Freadman to take over a new project known as \"Ease of Doing Business\" (EDB), which was headed by Smith's boss, Chris Cawley. Although Smith did not request that she do so, Freadman began working long hours again, including nights and weekends. According to plaintiff, she needed to work such hours because of the high-pressure assignments she received. Smith in fact had previously told her on more than one occasion that \"it would be okay [for her] to do a B job instead of an A job.\" Freadman discounted that statement and did not discuss the matter with him further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within approximately six months after her return to work, Freadman received two salary increases in the amounts of $5,000 and $4,700, for a total salary of $80,000. She received these raises at the election of Smith, her supervisor. In February 2000, Smith gave Freadman a rating of \"5,\" the highest possible performance rating, in her review. This rating was higher than the rating Freadman had received before the onset of her illness. Freadman was also selected in 2000 to participate in a program for the development of high-performing, non-officer employees. Smith had nominated her for the program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2000, one of Freadman's subordinates left Metropolitan. Freadman spoke to Smith about replacing this employee, noting that the subordinate was her \"top performer.\" Freadman explained that she was already working nights and weekends on EDB, and she expressed her belief that she would not be able to keep the project on track without impairing her health, unless she could replace the departed employee. Although there was a company-wide hiring freeze, Smith arranged for Freadman to hire a replacement. Freadman hired someone to fill the position, and that employee worked for Freadman through June 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2000, Metropolitan's CEO, Catherine Rein, asked Freadman to give a high-profile presentation on EDB to the Officers' Strategic Planning Group on June 9, 2000. Freadman was under the supervision of Cawley, Smith's superior, for this project, and Cawley had authority to make changes in her presentation. In an e-mail dated May 31, 2000, Freadman asked Cawley for his views on the presentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman's ulcerative colitis became active again in June 2000. This led to an important conversation, the significance of which is at issue in this appeal. Freadman stated that on June 2, 2000, she advised Smith that she was working too hard, and that she \"needed to take some time off because [she was] starting not to feel well.\" Freadman also told Smith that \"some of [her] symptoms may be returning.\" According to Freadman, Smith responded by saying, \"Just get through the presentation on June 9. Take your time off after. Keep it up. You're doing great. Everything is going excellent.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Freadman was not any more explicit than the words quoted. She did not explicitly request a postponement of the June 9 presentation, which the CEO of the company had requested. She did not explicitly say that she wanted time off before the June 9 presentation. She did not explicitly state that her ulcerative colitis had returned and that she needed to be accommodated immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, it is undisputed that when Smith expressed confidence in her and suggested she take time off after the presentation, she did not say to him that she needed time off before the presentation. Nor did she raise the topic again with Smith or anyone else. Nor was there any physical manifestation obvious to others that Freadman should not have been working between June 2 and June 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this litigation started, in an answer to an interrogatory, Freadman explained that she \"believed that [she] could not take any time off as a result of this meeting with Mr. Smith\" because she would be \"viewed as a complainer and a liability.\" She alleges that she feared punishment and retaliation. She did not, however, raise these concerns with anyone at the company at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 7, 2000, Cawley stopped by Freadman's cubicle to look at Freadman's work on the June 9 presentation on EDB. Freadman does not allege that her illness impaired her ability to prepare for this meeting, or that it affected her ability to request an accommodation on June 7. During the June 7 meeting, Cawley was critical of the slides Freadman had prepared and told her to shorten the presentation. Cawley was concerned about making good use of the officers' time and wanted to leave half an hour for the officers to talk about their products in light of the presentation. Freadman asked Cawley what she should remove from the presentation. Cawley responded that it was her job to decide which slides to cut.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Smith, who was present at this meeting, testified that Cawley had suggested to Freadman that the presentation had too many slides, that the individual slides were too busy, and that Freadman needed to shorten the presentation and simplify the slides. Lyndalu Pieranunzi, a Metropolitan employee subordinate to Freadman who was present throughout the meeting, confirmed that there had been a discussion about shortening the presentation and streamlining the content. Pieranunzi also testified that there was tension between Freadman and Cawley during the meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the meeting with Freadman, Cawley reiterated to Smith that Freadman's presentation was too busy and contained too many slides. Later that night, Freadman telephoned Smith, who advised her to shorten the presentation and clean up the slides, as Cawley had suggested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 9, 2000, Freadman gave her presentation to the Officers' Strategic Planning Group. Freadman had the officers participate in breakout sessions, and the presentation was longer than Cawley wanted. Due to time constraints, Cawley intervened and ended the breakout sessions early. Freadman noted that Cawley was upset when he shortened the presentation. Smith, who attended the presentation, remembered the introduction going longer than he had expected it would, based on the instructions Cawley had given Freadman. Pieranunzi, who assisted Freadman on the day of the presentation, testified that they \"ran out of time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metropolitan's CEO, Rein, testified that she was surprised that Freadman used breakout sessions at the strategic planning meeting. Shortly after the presentation, Cawley explained to Rein that he had instructed Freadman in advance of the presentation not to hold breakout sessions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the next business day, June 12, 2000, Freadman went into the office. Smith stopped by her cubicle that day and said, \"I thought you were going to take some time off.\" Freadman responded that she was going to take the rest of the week off, and that she would use some personal days as she was \"not feeling well.\" Smith agreed to this plan. Freadman worked at home for the remainder of that week.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 12, Cawley told Smith that he \"could not rely upon [Freadman] to do what he told her to do at a high profile environment . . . [,] that he didn't want her to be the project manager on something that would put her in that position,\" and that she should be rotated into another position. Smith recommended Freadman for a vacant position in the Desktop Life Cycle Management Program, and Cawley accepted this recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After June 9, Cawley twice spoke with Metropolitan's Vice President of Human Resources about rotating Freadman into a new position. Cawley explained that Freadman had ignored his instructions to alter her presentation and remove breakout sessions from the agenda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman worked from home until June 26, 2000, an extra week beyond the period upon which she and Smith had agreed. On June 26, Freadman advised her administrative assistant that she would again work from home that day, due to her illness. Later that day, Smith called Freadman and told her she needed to come into the office. Freadman responded that she was still feeling sick, and she asked if she could come in the next day. According to Freadman, Smith then said, \"No, you have to come in the office today. You have two choices. You go out on disability or you come in the office. There's changes in the department that affect you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman went into the office on June 26 and met with Smith. Smith advised her that her job function was being rotated, and that she would now be working on the Desktop Life Cycle Management Program under Richard Sitkus. Freadman would now be reporting to Joann Kraemer, a manager two levels below Smith. Also, her new position was in a technical, not a management, area. Freadman met with Sitkus, the head of her new project, and he informed her that he was moving her cubicle closer to him so that everyone on the team could be together. Freadman remained at work for the rest of the day, and then took personal time off the next two days. She was hospitalized on June 29, 2000, and was in and out of the hospital for approximately ninety days for treatment of her ulcerative colitis. Freadman never returned to her new position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman brought suit in December 2001 against Metropolitan under the ADA and under state law. She alleged that she had been discriminated against on account of her disability in July 1999 when she was assigned to the EDB project, as well as in June 2000 when she was assigned to the Desktop Life Cycle Management Program. Freadman also claimed that Metropolitan failed to provide reasonable accommodations around the time of her medical leave in 1999 and during the recurrence of her illness in June 2000. Further, she alleged that Metropolitan retaliated against her for requesting accommodations. Freadman also brought several claims against Metropolitan for disability-related discrimination in violation of state law. <i>See</i> Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;&#167; 28-5-1 to 28-5-42; Rhode Island Civil Rights of Individuals with Handicaps Act (RICRIHA), <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 42-87-1 to 42-87-5. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that Metropolitan's conduct caused her to suffer great physical injury and pain of body, emotional distress, humiliation, indignity, and economic losses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, Metropolitan moved for summary judgment, arguing that Freadman had failed to make out a prima facie case of disparate treatment, failure to accommodate, or retaliation. Metropolitan argued, inter alia, that Freadman's June 2, 2000 and June 26, 2000 conversations with Smith did not constitute requests for reasonable accommodations, that there was no causal connection between Freadman's disability and the alleged adverse employment action, and that in any event Freadman had failed to rebut Metropolitan's evidence that the change in her duties was motivated by legitimate business reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending that Metropolitan's motion for summary judgment be granted. On plaintiff's disparate treatment claims, the magistrate judge assumed that Freadman would be able to show that she suffered from a disability within the meaning of the ADA<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and that she was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation. The magistrate judge also assumed, without deciding, that the change in plaintiff's duties in June 2000 constituted a materially adverse employment action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The magistrate judge found, however, that Freadman had failed to present \"any evidence which would enable a rational jury to find that the reassignment of her duties in June 2000 was based, either in whole or in part, on her alleged disability.\" Further, the magistrate judge stated that a rational jury would not have been able to find that Metropolitan's explanation for the change in Freadman's duties in June 2000 was a pretext for disability discrimination. On plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claims, the magistrate judge again assumed that Freadman would be able to demonstrate that she was disabled and that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation. The magistrate judge concluded, however, that Freadman had not met her burden of showing that Metropolitan, despite knowing of plaintiff's disability, failed to reasonably accommodate it; in particular, he faulted plaintiff for not making sufficiently direct and specific requests for accommodations in June 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Finally, on plaintiff's retaliation claims, the magistrate judge held that the change in Freadman's duties in June 2000 had not been ordered in retaliation for any protected activity under the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman objected to the magistrate judge's conclusions regarding her disparate treatment, failure to accommodate, and retaliation claims, but only with respect to events occurring in June 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted Metropolitan's motion for summary judgment.

It further held that Freadman's request on June 26 to come into work the next day also was insufficiently linked to her disability. <i>Id.</i> at *4.

It is undisputed that at the June 7 meeting, Cawley expressed concern over the length of Freadman's presentation for June 9 and told her that he wanted it shortened. It is also undisputed that Cawley, after the presentation, concluded that Freadman had not shortened the presentation enough. Freadman herself concedes that Cawley was upset when he ended the June 9 presentation early because of its length. Further, it is undisputed that Cawley told CEO Rein he had instructed Freadman in advance of the presentation not to use breakout sessions, and that Rein was surprised that Freadman had done so. There is no evidence that the statement to Rein was motivated by discrimination. It is also undisputed that after the presentation, Cawley told Smith and the Vice President of Human Resources that a new position needed to be found for Freadman because she had ignored his instructions. Whether or not Freadman had explicitly been told to remove the breakout sessions, there is no evidence that Cawley did not genuinely believe that Freadman had violated his instructions, or that his belief was motivated by discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Based on this evidence, it is clear that defendant met its burden of articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Freadman's job rotation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff argues that Metropolitan's explanation was pretext.

Here, the larger sequence of events shows that the company had accommodated Freadman's requests concerning her ulcerative colitis. After her return from medical leave, she was allowed to work part-time for several weeks, even though such work was not normally available for managers. She also received two salary increases shortly after returning to Metropolitan, and in 2000 she was selected to participate in a program for rising stars at the company. Moreover, Freadman was allowed to hire a replacement when one of her subordinates left Metropolitan, even though there was a company-wide hiring freeze in effect. Also, the company had given her a performance rating in early 2000 that was higher than the rating she earned before the onset of her illness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the timing between the June 2 request for time off and the June 26 job rotation does not support a finding of pretext. There is uncontradicted evidence that the motivation for the change in Freadman's responsibilities lay with Cawley's interactions with Freadman on June 7 and June 9 and his resulting inability to trust her in a high-profile position. As for the June 26 request to work from home, this request cannot support a finding of pretext because it occurred <i>after</i> the decision to remove Freadman from the EDB project had been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record as a whole demonstrates that the decision to move Freadman into a new position was not causally linked either to her disability or to her June 2000 conversations with Smith. <i>See Calero-Cerezo v.

There is no evidence that if there was a violation of the discipline policy it was motivated by discrimination. Indeed, the claim that there was a violation is undercut by the fact that Metropolitan's policy does not require counseling for \"extreme cases[] such as insubordination.\" Given his dissatisfaction with Freadman's presentation and his lack of confidence in her ability to follow his instructions, Cawley reasonably determined that Freadman's behavior qualified as an \"extreme case,\" and he was thus under no obligation to counsel Freadman regarding her actions or her reassignment.

Metropolitan disputes this. The appropriate inquiry is whether defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the reason for Freadman's request was her disability. <i>See Wynne,</i> 976 F.2d at 795 (addressing a claim brought under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that there was sufficient evidence to create a triable issue on the link between Freadman's June 2 request and her disabling colitis. Taking the evidence in plaintiff's favor, Smith knew that Freadman took medical leave from March 1999 to July 1999 in order to receive treatment for her colitis. While Freadman was recovering, Smith acknowledged plaintiff's need for more reasonable hours and a better work/life balance. Further, when one of Freadman's subordinates left Metropolitan in March 2000, Freadman notified Smith that she needed to hire a replacement <i>or else</i> risk impairing her health. When Smith responded that there were concerns that the home office was getting too big, Freadman objected, \"I'm basically killing myself to keep this [project] on track, and I'm going to get sick again.\" Smith replied, \"I know. I know. All right. All right. Just [hire a replacement] quick.\" This is not a situation, as in <i>Soileau,</i> where the employer's mere knowledge of medical leave <i>over three years prior</i> was insufficient to put it on notice of a present disability. 105 F.3d at 14, 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freadman's accommodation claim nevertheless founders due to her failure to produce evidence that would permit a jury to conclude that the employer was put on notice of a \"sufficiently direct and specific\" request for her desired accommodation. She argues it was clear that her request was to take time off starting on June 2, rather than at some unspecified time. However, Freadman told Smith that she \"needed to take some time off because [she was] <i>starting</i> not to feel well\" (emphasis added). Plaintiff expressed merely a need to take \"some time off\" without specifying <i>when</i> she would need that time off. Freadman, who had better knowledge than Smith of her condition and symptoms, had some burden to be specific about the accommodation she required. <i>See Reed,</i> 244 F.3d at 260-62; <i>see also Beck v.

We reject plaintiff's proposition that employees who make requests have no obligation to further clarify their needs once the employer offers an accommodation the employee believes is insufficient. There may well be instances in which an employee has made a clear request, the employer has denied the accommodation or offered an unsatisfactory accommodation, the employee has become too intimidated to continue seeking a satisfactory accommodation, and the employer reasonably should have understood that dynamic. This will depend on the particular facts of the case. Here, plaintiff has not made a plausible, objective case of intimidation. <i>See Jacques v.

Before June 2, Metropolitan had granted Freadman several months of time off for treatment of her ulcerative colitis. The employer even made exceptions to company work rules and hiring freezes. Moreover, Smith had given Freadman two raises and a high performance evaluation since her return from medical leave in 1999. Smith did in fact reasonably respond to the request made of him. No reasonable juror could find that there was intimidation so as to excuse Freadman from clarifying her request.

Further, no causation can be established based on the June 26 request to work from home, as this request occurred after Cawley had made the decision to remove Freadman from the EDB project.
