John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Virginia G. Villa, Assistant Federal Defender, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Thomas E.\nDelahanty II, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          May 23, 2011\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.         After defendant-appellant Olin\n\nDudley Stevens was convicted on a charge of failing to register\n\nunder the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA),\n\nPub. L. No. 109-248, tit. I, §§ 101-155, 120 Stat. 587, 590-611\n\n(2006), the district court sentenced him to serve 85 months in\n\nprison.     He challenges his conviction, alleging both evidentiary\n\ninsufficiency and constitutional infirmity.           Concluding that his\n\narguments lack merit, we affirm.\n\n            We rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict.    United States v. Rodríguez-Vélez, 597 F.3d 32, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).      In 1993, the defendant was convicted of a sex crime in\n\nRhode Island and incarcerated.       Upon his release from immurement,\n\nthe state notified him of his duty to register annually as a sex\n\noffender.     See R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-16(a) (1992) (repealed\n\n1996).1     He    initially   complied    and   renewed   his   registration\n\nperiodically. He eventually became less assiduous, and his failure\n\nto keep his registration current led, in 1996, to a no contest plea\n\nto a charge of failing to register as a sex offender.            He did not\n\nlearn his lesson and, four years later, he was again convicted on\n\n\n\n     1\n       From time to time, the Rhode Island General Assembly\ntinkered with the sex offender registration law, and the procedural\nhistory is complicated. Withal, the district court found that the\n1992 version of the law (which was in effect when the defendant was\nconvicted of the sex crime that required him to register) applied\nto the defendant throughout his stay in Rhode Island.        United\nStates v. Stevens, 598 F. Supp. 2d 133, 141-42 (D. Me. 2009).\nBecause that finding is not challenged here, we do not trace the\nlaw's subsequent history.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fa charge of failure to keep his state sex offender registration\n\ncurrent and given a suspended sentence.\n\n           We fast-forward to January of 2007, when the defendant\n\nmoved from Rhode Island to Maine.             He failed to notify the\n\nauthorities in Rhode Island of his change in residence and likewise\n\nfailed to register as a sex offender in Maine as required by that\n\nstate's law.    See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A, § 11223.             By the\n\nsame token, he neglected to comply with SORNA (which Congress had\n\nenacted in 2006).\n\n           These    delinquencies     came   to     the   attention   of    the\n\nauthorities and, in February of 2008, a federal grand jury indicted\n\nthe   defendant    for     non-compliance    with    SORNA's    registration\n\nrequirements.      See 42 U.S.C. § 16913.         After a bench trial, the\n\ndistrict   court   found    him   guilty.    The    court   concluded      that,\n\nalthough the defendant lacked actual knowledge of his duty to\n\nregister as a sex offender,2 he was on constructive notice of this\n\nduty because he had registered several times in Rhode Island and\n\nalso had been convicted for failing to register.            United States v.\n\nStevens, 598 F. Supp. 2d 133, 153 (D. Me. 2009).               Following the\n\nimposition of sentence, the defendant filed a timely notice of\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n      2\n       The court noted that Rhode Island law enforcement officers\nmay not have apprised the defendant of his ongoing duty to\nregister. The court found that the shifting legal framework, see\nsupra note 1, may have confused some officers, who, in turn,\nmisinformed the defendant about his duty to register.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f           We   begin   our     discussion    of   the     merits    with     the\n\ndefendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.                     We\n\nreview such challenges de novo, appraising the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict.         Rodríguez-Vélez, 597 F.3d at\n\n38.   \"The verdict must stand unless the evidence is so scant that\n\na rational factfinder could not conclude that the government proved\n\nall the essential elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\"   Id. at 39.\n\n           The defendant's challenge has twin foci.                  First, he\n\nclaims that the government did not present sufficient evidence that\n\nSORNA required him to register as a sex offender after he had\n\ntraveled in interstate commerce.       At bottom, this claim rests on a\n\nlegal interpretation, and the defendant argues that the evidence is\n\ninadequate   under   that     interpretation.      Thus,    the     statute   of\n\nconviction frames this aspect of the argument.\n\n           SORNA provides in pertinent part:\n\n           (a) In general. — Whoever —\n           (1) is required to register under the Sex\n           Offender Registration and Notification Act;\n           (2)(A) is a sex offender as defined for the\n           purposes of [SORNA] . . . ; or\n           (B) travels in interstate or foreign commerce\n           . . . ; and\n           (3) knowingly fails to register or update a\n           registration as required by [SORNA];\n           shall be fined under this title or imprisoned\n           not more than 10 years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2250(a).\n\n           The defendant posits that this requirement did not become\n\napplicable until the Attorney General promulgated an implementing\n\n                                    -4-\n\fregulation in February of 2007.      See 72 Fed. Reg. 8894, 8896 (Feb.\n\n28, 2007).    Because this regulation post-dated his 2007 trip from\n\nRhode Island to Maine, his thesis runs, that travel cannot be said\n\nto have triggered the federal registration requirement.\n\n            This contention is old hat. We previously have held that\n\nSORNA was fully effective as of the date of its enactment: July 27,\n\n2006.    United States v. DiTomasso, 621 F.3d 17, 25 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\nIt therefore stands decided, under settled circuit precedent, that\n\nthe     defendant's   interstate   travel   in   2007   brought   SORNA's\n\nregistration requirement into play.         Consequently, the district\n\ncourt correctly applied the requirement in this instance.\n\n            The second focus of the defendant's claim of evidentiary\n\ninsufficiency is that the government did not present proof adequate\n\nto show that he knowingly violated SORNA.               In mounting this\n\nargument, the defendant does not challenge the supportability of\n\nthe district court's finding that he had constructive notice of a\n\nregistration requirement.     Rather, he claims that SORNA requires a\n\nshowing of a specific intent to violate its registration provision\n\n(and, therefore, requires a showing of actual knowledge of that\n\nprovision).     To the extent that this claim poses a question of\n\nstatutory construction, our standard of review remains de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 405 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            SORNA makes it a crime to \"knowingly fail[] to register\n\nor update a registration as required by [SORNA].\"              18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2250(a).     The defendant suggests that \"knowingly\" modifies all\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthe language that follows it, with the result that a person cannot\n\nviolate the statutory proscription unless he knows specifically of\n\nhis obligation to register under SORNA and nevertheless flouts that\n\nobligation.   This suggestion lacks force.\n\n            The Supreme Court has given us the appropriate starting\n\npoint for our analysis.   The Court has said that \"unless the text\n\nof the statute dictates a different result, the term 'knowingly'\n\nmerely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the\n\noffense.\"   Bryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 193 (1998).   Our\n\nown precedent is to the same effect.    See United States v. Meade,\n\n175 F.3d 215, 226 n.5 (1st Cir. 1999).       Nothing in the text of\n\nSORNA dictates a different result.      Indeed, giving words their\n\nordinary meaning, the adverb \"knowingly\" modifies only the phrase\n\n\"fails to register,\" not the next phrase, \"as required by [SORNA].\"\n\nCf. United States v. Currier, 621 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1980)\n\n(construing \"knowingly\" in 18 U.S.C. § 922(m), a firearms statute,\n\nas not requiring the government to prove specific intent).\n\n            In an effort to remove his case from the sweep of the\n\nBryan rule, the defendant urges us to find that the meaning of\n\n\"knowingly\" in section 2250(a) is at least unclear, thus making\n\napplicable the rule of lenity.   The notion that lack of clarity may\n\nground an exception to the Bryan rule is plausible.      See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Godin, 534 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir. 2008) (applying\n\nrule of lenity after concluding that the knowledge requirement in\n\nan unrelated statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a), was ambiguous).     But\n\n                                 -6-\n\fambiguity is a condition precedent to the invocation of the rule of\n\nlenity, see, e.g., United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, 514\n\n(2008); United States v. Dwinells, 508 F.3d 63, 69-70 (1st Cir.\n\n2007),   and     SORNA   contains     no    ambiguity      with    respect     to   its\n\nknowledge requirement.\n\n             The short of it is that, in the case at hand, no textual\n\nclue counsels against giving \"knowingly\" the usual meaning that\n\nBryan ascribes to that term.               Accordingly, we hold that section\n\n2250(a)(3) requires only that the government prove general intent;\n\nthat   is,   a   defendant's    awareness       of   his   failure       to   register\n\nsimpliciter.       We    add   that   this     holding     is     well   within     the\n\nmainstream.      It comports with the holdings of every other court of\n\nappeals that has decided this point.             See, e.g., United States v.\n\nFuller, 627 F.3d 499, 507-08 (2d Cir. 2010); United States v.\n\nVoice, 622 F.3d 870, 876 (8th Cir. 2010); United States v. Vasquez,\n\n611 F.3d 325, 328-29 (7th Cir. 2010).\n\n             That ends this aspect of the matter.                  Inasmuch as the\n\nstatute of conviction contains only a general intent requirement,\n\nthe government had to prove no more than that the defendant was\n\naware that he had not registered.               See Bryan, 524 U.S. at 193;\n\nFuller, 627 F.3d at 507-08. On this point, even the district\n\ncourt's finding of constructive notice was superfluous.\n\n             The district court's determination that the government\n\ncarried this burden cannot seriously be questioned.                       It follows\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fthat   the    evidence      was    sufficient    to    support   the   defendant's\n\nconviction.\n\n              In   a   different     (but   equally     unavailing)     vein,   the\n\ndefendant advances a pair of constitutional claims.                     We review\n\nthese claims de novo.             United States v. Volungus, 595 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2010).          Neither of them is substantial.\n\n              To begin, the defendant asserts that convicting him\n\ndespite      his   lack    of   actual   knowledge      of   SORNA's   requirement\n\ndeprives him of due process of law.               This assertion flies in the\n\nteeth of the venerable principle that ignorance of the law is no\n\nexcuse.      See, e.g., United States v. Int'l Minerals & Chem. Corp.,\n\n402 U.S. 558, 562-63 (1971); United States v. Robinson, 137 F.3d\n\n652, 654 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              Of course, there is an acknowledged exception to this\n\nprinciple for conduct that is wholly passive, see Lambert v.\n\nCalifornia, 355 U.S. 225, 228 (1957), and the defendant seeks\n\nrefuge within the narrow confines of this exception.                      But the\n\ncircumstances of this case do not lend themselves to an application\n\nof the exception.\n\n              There is no need to tarry.              In an earlier SORNA case,\n\nUnited States v. Gagnon, 621 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2010), the\n\ndefendant made the same claim.                 We flatly rejected the claim,\n\nholding that because the defendant was chargeable with knowledge of\n\nan obligation to register as a sex offender, his failure to do so\n\nwas not within the purview of Lambert.                  Gagnon, 621 F.3d at 33.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fGagnon   is    controlling:   there,   as   here,   the   defendant   was   a\n\nconvicted sex offender who was on notice of a duty to register.3\n\nSee id. at 33.         Thus, the exception does not apply and the\n\ndefendant's due process argument fails.\n\n              Finally, the defendant asseverates that SORNA cannot be\n\nenforced because Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to\n\nenact it.      U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.            We confronted and\n\ndefenestrated this very same asseveration in DiTomasso, in which we\n\nheld that the enactment of the statute was well within the scope of\n\ncongressional authority under the Commerce Clause.           DiTomasso, 621\n\nF.3d at 26.     We reiterated that holding in Gagnon, 621 F.3d at 32.\n\nGiven those decisions, the defendant's Commerce Clause argument\n\nnecessarily fails.\n\n              We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       In Gagnon, we noted that the defendant either had actual\nnotice or was \"chargeable with\" notice (i.e., that he had\nconstructive notice). 621 F.3d at 33. For this purpose, either\ntype of notice suffices to satisfy the demands of due process.\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

The Court has said that \"unless the text of the statute dictates a different result, the term `knowingly' merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.\" <i>Bryan v. United States,</i> 524 U.S. 184, 193, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998). Our own precedent is to the same effect. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Meade,</i> 175 F.3d 215, 226 n. 5 (1st Cir.1999). Nothing in the text of SORNA dictates a different result. Indeed, giving words their ordinary meaning, the adverb \"knowingly\" modifies only the phrase \"fails to register,\" not the next phrase, \"as required by [SORNA].\" <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Currier,</i> 621 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1980) (construing \"knowingly\" in 18 U.S.C. § 922(m), a firearms statute, as not requiring the government to prove specific intent).</p>\n<p>In an effort to remove his case from the sweep of the <i>Bryan</i> rule, the defendant urges us to find that the meaning of \"knowingly\" in section 2250(a) is at least unclear, thus making applicable the rule of lenity. The notion that lack of clarity may ground an exception to the <i>Bryan</i> rule is plausible. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Godin,</i> 534 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir. 2008) (applying rule of lenity after concluding that the knowledge requirement in an unrelated statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a), was ambiguous). But ambiguity is a condition precedent to the invocation of the rule of lenity, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Santos,</i> 553 U.S. 507, 514, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008); <i>United States v. Dwinells,</i> 508 F.3d 63, 69-70 (1st Cir.2007), and SORNA contains no ambiguity with respect to its knowledge requirement.</p>\n<p>The short of it is that, in the case at hand, no textual clue counsels against giving \"knowingly\" the usual meaning that <i>Bryan</i> ascribes to that term. Accordingly, we hold that section 2250(a)(3) requires only that the government prove general intent; that is, a defendant's awareness of his failure to register simpliciter. We add <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> that this holding is well within the mainstream. It comports with the holdings of every other court of appeals that has decided this point. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Fuller,</i> 627 F.3d 499, 507-08 (2d Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Voice,</i> 622 F.3d 870, 876 (8th Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Vasquez,</i> 611 F.3d 325, 328-29 (7th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. Inasmuch as the statute of conviction contains only a general intent requirement, the government had to prove no more than that the defendant was aware that he had not registered. <i>See </i><i>Bryan,</i> 524 U.S. at 193, 118 S.Ct. 1939; <i>Fuller,</i> 627 F.3d at 507-08. On this point, even the district court's finding of constructive notice was superfluous.</p>\n<p>The district court's determination that the government carried this burden cannot seriously be questioned. It follows that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction.</p>\n<p>In a different (but equally unavailing) vein, the defendant advances a pair of constitutional claims. We review these claims de novo. <i>United States v. Volungus,</i> 595 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2010). Neither of them is substantial.</p>\n<p>To begin, the defendant asserts that convicting him despite his lack of actual knowledge of SORNA's requirement deprives him of due process of law. This assertion flies in the teeth of the venerable principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Int'l Minerals &amp; Chem. Corp.,</i> 402 U.S. 558, 562-63, 91 S.Ct. 1697, 29 L.Ed.2d 178 (1971); <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 137 F.3d 652, 654 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>Of course, there is an acknowledged exception to this principle for conduct that is wholly passive, <i>see </i><i>Lambert v. California,</i> 355 U.S. 225, 228, 78 S.Ct. 240, 2 L.Ed.2d 228 (1957), and the defendant seeks refuge within the narrow confines of this exception. But the circumstances of this case do not lend themselves to an application of the exception.</p>\n<p>There is no need to tarry. In an earlier SORNA case, <i>United States v. Gagnon,</i> 621 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.2010), the defendant made the same claim. We flatly rejected the claim, holding that because the defendant was chargeable with knowledge of an obligation to register as a sex offender, his failure to do so was not within the purview of <i>Lambert. </i><i>Gagnon,</i> 621 F.3d at 33. <i>Gagnon</i> is controlling: there, as here, the defendant was a convicted sex offender who was on notice of a duty to register.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See id.</i> at 33. Thus, the exception does not apply and the defendant's due process argument fails.</p>\n<p>Finally, the defendant asseverates that SORNA cannot be enforced because Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to enact it. U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. We confronted and defenestrated this very same asseveration in <i>DiTomasso,</i> in which we held that the enactment of the statute was well within the scope of congressional authority under the Commerce Clause. <i>DiTomasso,</i> 621 F.3d at 26. We reiterated that holding in <i>Gagnon,</i> 621 F.3d at 32. Given those decisions, the defendant's Commerce Clause argument necessarily fails.</p>\n<p>We need go no further.

No. 109-248, tit. I, §§ 101-155, 120 Stat. 587, 590-611 (2006), the district court sentenced him to serve 85 months in prison. He challenges his conviction, alleging both evidentiary insufficiency and constitutional infirmity. Concluding that his arguments lack merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p>We rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Vélez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18\"><a href=\"/opinion/18/united-states-v-rodriguez-velez/\"><span class=\"volume\">597</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir. 2010). In 1993, the defendant was convicted of a sex crime in Rhode Island and incarcerated. Upon his release from immurement, the state notified him of his duty to register annually as a sex offender. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-16(a) (1992) (repealed 1996).<sup>[1]</sup> He initially complied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> and renewed his registration periodically. He eventually became less assiduous, and his failure to keep his registration current led, in 1996, to a no contest plea to a charge of failing to register as a sex offender. He did not learn his lesson and, four years later, he was again convicted on a charge of failure to keep his state sex offender registration current and given a suspended sentence.</p>\n<p>We fast-forward to January of 2007, when the defendant moved from Rhode Island to Maine. He failed to notify the authorities in Rhode Island of his change in residence and likewise failed to register as a sex offender in Maine as required by that state's law. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A, § 11223. By the same token, he neglected to comply with SORNA (which Congress had enacted in 2006).</p>\n<p>These delinquencies came to the attention of the authorities and, in February of 2008, a federal grand jury indicted the defendant for non-compliance with SORNA's registration requirements. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 16913. After a bench trial, the district court found him guilty. The court concluded that, although the defendant lacked actual knowledge of his duty to register as a sex offender,<sup>[2]</sup> he was on constructive notice of this duty because he had registered several times in Rhode Island and also had been convicted for failing to register. <i>United States v. Stevens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1476845\"><a href=\"/opinion/1476845/united-states-v-stevens/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 153 (D.Me.2009). Following the imposition of sentence, the defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p>We begin our discussion of the merits with the defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. We review such challenges de novo, appraising the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>Rodríguez-Vélez,</i> 597 F.3d at 38. \"The verdict must stand unless the evidence is so scant that a rational factfinder could not conclude that the government proved <i>all</i> the essential elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> at 39.</p>\n<p>The defendant's challenge has twin foci. First, he claims that the government did not present sufficient evidence that SORNA required him to register as a sex offender after he had traveled in interstate commerce. At bottom, this claim rests on a legal interpretation, and the defendant argues that the evidence is inadequate under that interpretation. Thus, the statute of conviction frames this aspect of the argument.</p>\n<p>SORNA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) In general.Whoever</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2)(A) is a sex offender as defined for the purposes of [SORNA] ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) travels in interstate or foreign commerce...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by [SORNA]; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 2250(a).</p>\n<p>The defendant posits that this requirement did not become applicable until the Attorney General promulgated an implementing regulation in February of 2007. <i>See</i> 72 Fed.Reg. 8894, 8896 (Feb. 28, 2007). Because this regulation post-dated his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> 2007 trip from Rhode Island to Maine, his thesis runs, that travel cannot be said to have triggered the federal registration requirement.</p>\n<p>This contention is old hat. We previously have held that SORNA was fully effective as of the date of its enactment: July 27, 2006. <i>United States v. DiTomasso,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"175740\"><a href=\"/opinion/175740/united-states-v-ditomasso/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2010). It therefore stands decided, under settled circuit precedent, that the defendant's interstate travel in 2007 brought SORNA's registration requirement into play. Consequently, the district court correctly applied the requirement in this instance.</p>\n<p>The second focus of the defendant's claim of evidentiary insufficiency is that the government did not present proof adequate to show that he knowingly violated SORNA. In mounting this argument, the defendant does not challenge the supportability of the district court's finding that he had constructive notice of a registration requirement. Rather, he claims that SORNA requires a showing of a specific intent to violate its registration provision (and, therefore, requires a showing of actual knowledge of that provision). To the extent that this claim poses a question of statutory construction, our standard of review remains de novo. <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202599\"><a href=\"/opinion/202599/united-states-v-leahy/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 405 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>SORNA makes it a crime to \"knowingly fail[] to register or update a registration as required by [SORNA].\" 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a). The defendant suggests that \"knowingly\" modifies all the language that follows it, with the result that a person cannot violate the statutory proscription unless he knows specifically of his obligation to register <i>under SORNA</i> and nevertheless flouts that obligation. This suggestion lacks force.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has given us the appropriate starting point for our analysis. The Court has said that \"unless the text of the statute dictates a different result, the term `knowingly' merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.\" <i>Bryan v.
