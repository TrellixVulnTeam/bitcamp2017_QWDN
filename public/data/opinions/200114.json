This litigation has traveled a\n\ntortuous path -- begun in a Rhode Island trial court, removed to\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island,\n\nappealed to this court, forwarded by this court to the Supreme\n\nCourt of Rhode Island with a request for instruction on questions\n\nof Rhode Island law, and, now, returned to this court for final\n\ndisposition of the pending appeal in the light of the authoritative\n\nexplication of Rhode Island law provided by the state Supreme\n\nCourt.    In this Court's prior opinion, Wigginton v. Centracchio,\n\n205 F.3d 504 (1st Cir. 2000), as predicate for our announcement of\ncertain interim rulings and for our invocation of the aid of the\n\nSupreme Court of Rhode Island, we narrated in considerable detail\nthe events giving rise to this litigation and the proceedings in\nthe District Court.    In the first section of today's opinion we\n\nwill present a compressed version of that narrative. In the second\nsection of this opinion we will summarize the interim rulings\nannounced in our prior opinion, culminating in an explanation of\n\nwhy we found it appropriate to solicit the assistance of Rhode\nIsland's highest court with respect to questions of Rhode Island\nlaw that seemed likely to be controlling.     In the third section of\n\nthis opinion we will set forth the substance of that court's\nresponsive ruling and apply those teachings to the pending appeal.\n\nI.   The events leading to litigation, and the proceedings in the\n\nDistrict Court\n\n     A.   The events leading to litigation:\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f       Appellant Eugene E. Wigginton served in the Marines from 1967\n\nto 1970 and was then honorably discharged.              In 1979 Wigginton was\n\ncommissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army\nReserve and, concomitantly, in the Rhode Island Army National Guard\n\n(\"RIANG\"). He received regular promotions, and by 1996 -- the year\n\nin   which   the   event   triggering      this   litigation    took   place   --\nWigginton, by then forty-six years old, had almost twenty years of\n\naggregate service in the Marines and RIANG and had attained the\n\nrank of major.      In January of 1996 Wigginton was advised that in\n\nMay of that year his status would be considered by a Selective\n\nRetention Board, pursuant to National Guard Regulation (?NGR?) 635-\n\n102.     The stated purpose of NGR 635-102 was to \"[e]nsur[e] that\n\nonly the most capable officers are retained beyond 20 years of\nqualifying service for assignment to the comparatively few higher\n\nlevel command and staff positions.\"               Of the ten RIANG officers\n\nwhose    status    was   considered   at    the   May   1996   session   of    the\nSelective Retention Board, four -- of whom Wigginton was one --\n\nwere recommended for non-retention.                Pursuant to the Board's\n\nrecommendation, Brigadier General Reginald E. Centracchio, Adjutant\n\nGeneral of Rhode Island, then notified Wigginton that he was to be\n\nseparated from RIANG as of July 13, 1996; separation followed on\n\nthat date.\n\n        In September of 1996 Wigginton filed a two-count § 1983 (42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983) suit against Centracchio and the State of Rhode\n\nIsland in the Superior Court for Providence County.               The first of\n\nthe two § 1983 counts charged that termination of Wigginton's RIANG\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcommission constituted deprivation without due process of law of a\n\nconstitutionally    protected      property   right        to   continue   as   a\n\ncommissioned    officer   until    age    sixty   --   a    substantive    right\nassertedly embodied in § 30-3-13 of Rhode Island General Laws.\n\nThat statutory provision, part of the Rhode Island military code\n\nenacted by the Rhode Island Legislature in 1956, is as follows:\n                All commissioned officers of the staff\n          corps and departments, hereafter appointed,\n          shall have had previous military experience,\n          except chaplains, officers of the judge\n          advocate general's corps, and medical corps\n          officers.   They shall hold their positions\n          until they shall have reached the age of sixty\n          (60) years, unless retired prior to that time\n          by reason of resignation or disability, or for\n          cause to be determined by an efficiency board\n          or a court-martial legally convened for that\n          purpose. Vacancies among these officers shall\n          be filled by appointment from the commissioned\n          officer of the national guard or from such\n          other civilians as may be specifically\n          qualified for duty therein.\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13.\n\n     The second § 1983 count, sounding in procedural due process,\n\ncontained two elements.     One element was a claim that the criteria\n\nprescribed by NGR 635-102 as governing the retention/non-retention\ndecision had not been followed in Wigginton's case.                  The other\n\nelement was a claim that the absence of any explanation of the\n\ngrounds for the non-retention decision constituted a fatal due\n\nprocess flaw.\n\n     B.   The proceedings in the District Court\n\n     Centracchio removed the case to the District Court and then\n\nfiled a motion to dismiss.        The Magistrate Judge to whom the case\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fhad been referred recommended to the District Judge that the motion\n\nto dismiss be granted on the ground that claims arising in the\n\nmilitary    service   were    non-justiciable.       The     District   Court,\ndisagreeing    with   the    Magistrate    Judge,   denied    the   motion   to\n\ndismiss. The District Judge ruled that damage actions arising from\n\nmilitary service were not justiciable, but that an equitable action\n-- such as Wigginton's, seeking reinstatement in commissioned\n\nstatus -- could be entertained by an Article III court.                      The\n\nDistrict Court then authorized the parties to engage in discovery\n\naddressed to the meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, the Rhode\n\nIsland statute relied on by Wigginton in the first count of his\n\ncomplaint, with a view to determining whether Wigginton had been a\n\n\"commissioned officer [] of the staff corps and departments\" within\nthe meaning of the statute. At the close of discovery, Centracchio\n\nand Wigginton both filed motions for summary judgment.\n\n     The District Court granted Centracchio's motion for summary\njudgment.     With respect to Wigginton's first count, the District\n\nCourt found that neither Wigginton nor Centracchio had presented\n\nevidence    that   gave     the   statutory    phrase   \"staff      corps    and\n\ndepartments\" any cognizable meaning. The District Court then ruled\n\nthat, since Wigginton as plaintiff had the burden of establishing\n\nthe legal groundwork for his substantive due process claim, his\n\ninability to demonstrate that he was an \"officer [] of the staff\n\ncorps and departments\" meant that the claim presented in the first\n\ncount of the complaint \"must fail.\"           The District Court then went\n\non to address Wigginton's procedural due process claims -- the\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fclaims presented in the second count -- and found them without\n\nmerit.\n\n       Wigginton     appealed      to    this    court    from    the    order    of    the\nDistrict     Court    granting      summary      judgment        and    dismissing      his\n\ncomplaint.\n\nII.    This court's prior opinion\n\n       In    addressing      Wigginton's         appeal     we     first       considered\n\nCentracchio's        contention      that       Wigginton's       claims       were    non-\n\njusticiable.         We    held   that    the    District     Court      had    correctly\n\ndetermined that, since Wigginton was not seeking damages but rather\nthe equitable relief of reinstatement as a commissioned RIANG\n\nofficer, his claims were justiciable.\n       We then turned to the District Court's grant of summary\njudgment     in    favor    of    Centracchio.           First    we    considered      the\n\ndismissal of Wigginton's second count alleging a lack of procedural\ndue process.        Wigginton had not pursued on appeal his contention\nthat   the    Selective      Retention      Board    had     not       adhered    to    the\n\ndecisional criteria prescribed by NGR 635-102; accordingly, we\nconfined our attention to Wigginton's claim that he had a due\nprocess right to an explanation of the reasons for the denial of\n\nretention.        We agreed with the District Court's rejection of that\nclaim.\n       Next we considered the District Court's grant of summary\n\njudgment dismissing the first count of Wigginton's complaint.                            As\nnoted above, the District Court reasoned that, since the testimony\n\nand arguments presented by the parties shed no useful light on the\n\n                                          -6-\n\fmeaning of the crucial and opaque statutory phrase \"staff corps and\n\ndepartments,\" and since Wigginton as plaintiff had the burden of\n\nestablishing all of the elements of his claim, Wigginton's failure\nto come forward with a persuasive showing that he came within the\n\nprotective embrace of the statutory phrase meant that his claim\n\n\"must fail.\"\n       But \"[h]ere,\" we said, \"we part company with the District\n\nCourt.\"    Wigginton, 205 F.3d at 517.   And we undertook to explain\n\nwhy:\n\n                 On cross-motions for summary judgment, a\n            plaintiff loses if he cannot produce evidence\n            tending to establish a fact that, under the\n            governing law, the plaintiff is required to\n            prove in order to make out his cause of\n            action. But that was not the situation at the\n            point that the District Court granted summary\n            judgment against appellant and in favor of\n            appellees.   When the District Court granted\n            summary judgment, no determination had been\n            arrived at as to what the governing law was.\n            That is to say, neither the meaning of the\n            phrase \"staff corps and departments\" as used\n            in R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-13-3, nor the extent of\n            the rights created by that statute if\n            applicable, had been judicially resolved. And\n            under those circumstances, there was no way to\n            tell whether the evidence adduced by Major\n            Wigginton would, if credited by a fact-finder,\n            suffice as a matter of Rhode Island law to\n            present the federal constitutional question\n            whether state law rights had been abridged\n            without due process.     Accordingly, it was\n            error to grant summary judgment on the first\n            count in favor of General Centracchio and the\n            State of Rhode Island.     And it would , a\n            fortiori, have been error to grant summary\n            judgment in favor of Major Wigginton.\n\nId. at 517 (footnote omitted).\n\n       Having pointed out that the District Court had not arrived at\n\na dispositive construction of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, and that\n\n                                 -7-\n\fwithout such a dispositive construction neither the Centracchio nor\n\nthe Wigginton motion for summary judgment could be ruled on, we\n\nthen acknowledged that we, too, could not arrive at a reliable\nconstruction of the statute. We explained the statute's ambiguity,\n\nand the lack of conventional resources to resolve that ambiguity,\n\nand we then went on to conclude that the sensible course was to ask\nthe Supreme Court of Rhode Island to provide an authoritative\n\nconstruction of this esoteric statute:\n\n                  The general thrust of the first two\n          sentences of the statute is apparent. Those\n          persons who are \"commissioned officers of the\n          staff corps and departments . . . shall hold\n          their positions until they have reached the\n          age of sixty (60) years, unless retired prior\n          to that time by reason of resignation or\n          disability, or for cause to be determined by\n          an efficiency board or a court martial.\"\n          Major Wigginton -- a commissioned officer of\n          RIANG who had not reached age sixty, and who\n          had not been retired by reason of resignation\n          or disability, or for cause -- would appear\n          (absent any other contingencies attached to\n          Major Wigginton's continued employment by\n          Rhode Island law) to be within the protective\n          embrace of the statute if he was an officer of\n          the \"staff corps and departments.\" But what\n          that latter phrase means remains unclear. The\n          first sentence of the statute -- \"All\n          commissioned officers of the staff corps and\n          departments hereafter appointed, shall have\n          had previous military experience, except\n          chaplains, officers of the judge advocate\n          general's corps, and medical corps officers\" -\n          - makes it plain that the phrase \"staff corps\n          and departments\" connotes a cohort inclusive\n          of, but broader than, \"chaplains, officers of\n          the judge advocate general's corps, and\n          medical corps officers.\"    How much broader?\n          Broad enough to include Major Wigginton, an\n          officer    originally  commissioned   in   the\n          Military Police, later assigned as a Public\n          Affairs Officer, and ultimately acting as an\n          Education Officer?      We derive no useful\n          textual guidance from the two other provisions\n\n                               -8-\n\f         of the statutory code governing RIANG that\n         employ   the    phrase   \"staff    corps   and\n         departments.\"    Appellant and appellees, in\n         their submissions to this court, have been\n         unable to adduce any useful legislative\n         history of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 and we\n         have found none.    Further, the parties have\n         not cited any pertinent decisions construing\n         R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13; and our research\n         confirms that no court (whether a Rhode Island\n         court, a federal court, or a court of another\n         state) has, in a reported opinion, construed\n         \"staff corps and departments\" as utilized in\n         R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 (or, indeed, as\n         utilized in either of the two other provisions\n         of the statutory code governing RIANG that\n         employ the phrase).\n\n               Thus, what we have before us is a Rhode\n         Island statute which is a tabula rasa.\n         Moreover, the state military code of which the\n         statute is a part is a very special kind of\n         state legislative enactment, for the code\n         governs the Rhode Island aspects of a joint\n         state-federal enterprise of great importance -\n         - the Rhode Island Army National Guard. Under\n         these circumstances, in order to achieve a\n         responsible resolution of the issues presented\n         by the pending appeal, it plainly would be\n         better to have a current and authoritative\n         construction of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 by\n         the Rhode Island judiciary than to have a\n         conjectured prophecy by this court of what\n         Rhode Island's courts might be expected to\n         rule at some future time.        Happily, the\n         Supreme Court of Rhode Island has in place a\n         procedure pursuant to which it \"may answer\n         questions of law certified to it by . . . a\n         Court of Appeals of the United States . . .\n         when requested by the certifying court if\n         there are involved in any proceeding before it\n         questions of law which may be determinative of\n         the cause then pending in the certifying court\n         and as to which it appears to the certifying\n         court there is no controlling precedent in the\n         decisions of this court.\"        Rhode Island\n         Supreme Court Rules, Art. I, Rule 6, § 1. The\n         quoted    rule    precisely   describes    the\n         circumstance in which this court finds itself.\n\n205 F.3d at 518-19 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n                              -9-\n\f      Accordingly, invoking the Supreme Court of Rhode Island's\n\nprocedure for responding to questions certified by other courts, we\n\ncertified     two   questions,   explaining        the   reasons    for    the\ncertification of these questions in an \"Order for Certification of\n\nCertain Questions to the Rhode Island Supreme Court,\"              Wigginton\n\nv.   Centracchio,   214   F.3d   1   (1st   Cir.   2000),   the    Order   for\nCertification having been crafted as a supplement to our opinion.\n\nThe two certified questions were as follows:\n\n            1.      At the time Major Wigginton was\n            discharged from RIANG, was he an officer of\n            the \"staff corps and departments\" within the\n            meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13?\n\n            2.    If the answer to Question 1 is \"Yes,\"\n            does that signify that, pursuant to R.I. Gen.\n            Laws § 30-3-13, Major Wigginton was (in the\n            absence   of   resignation,   disability,   or\n            dismissal for cause) therefore entitled to\n            continue as a RIANG officer until age sixty,\n            or would Rhode Island's statutory and/or\n            decisional law attach any other contingency to\n            Major Wigginton's continued status as a RIANG\n            officer?\n      In our Order for Certification we elaborated on the certified\n\nquestions:\n\n                    If the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\n             determines that Major Wigginton was not, when\n             discharged from RIANG, an officer of the\n             \"staff corps and departments\" within the\n             meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws § 30-3-13, that\n             ruling would be dispositive of the litigation,\n             adversely to Major Wigginton.      If, on the\n             other hand, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\n             determines that Major Wigginton, at the time\n             of his discharge, was an officer of the \"staff\n             corps and departments\" within the meaning of\n             the statute, the Court of Appeals would wish\n             advice on the further question whether R.I.\n             Gen. Laws § 30-3-13 is to be taken to mean\n             what its plain text connotes -- namely, that\n             Major Wigginton, as an officer who has not\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            been retired by resignation or disability, or\n            for cause, is entitled to continue in his\n            RIANG status until he is sixty years old -- or\n            whether   Rhode  Island's   statutory   and/or\n            decisional law governing RIANG attaches any\n            other   contingency   to   Major   Wigginton's\n            continued status until age sixty as a RIANG\n            officer.\n214 F.3d at 3.\n\nIII.    The ruling of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, and its\n\napplication to the pending appeal\n\n       The Supreme Court of Rhode Island responded to our Order for\nCertification in a unanimous and characteristically thoughtful\n\nopinion, written    by   Chief   Justice   Williams.   The   opinion   is\nreported at Wigginton v. Centracchio, 787 A.2d 1151 (R.I. 2001).\n\nA copy of the opinion is annexed hereto as an appendix to this\nopinion.\n       In the opening two paragraphs of the opinion, Chief Justice\n\nWilliams states:\n                  The United States Court of Appeals For\n            the First Circuit has requested from this\n            Court its opinion with regard to two certified\n            questions so as to assist that court in\n            resolving a wrongful termination claim under\n            42 U.S.C. § 1983.    The First Circuit sought\n            clarification of the meaning of G.L. 1956 §\n            30-3-13, a statute arguably entitling Maj.\n            Eugene E. Wigginton (plaintiff), to remain in\n            his position in the Rhode Island Army National\n            Guard (RIANG) until the age of sixty.     This\n            Court reviewed the certification order and\n            determined that the questions, as certified,\n            required resolution of issues of fact, a task\n            not permitted to us by Article I, Rule 6 of\n            the   Supreme   Court   Rules   of   Appellate\n            Procedure. Thus, we issued an order modifying\n            the original questions and setting forth the\n            single question to which we would respond.\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f               \"What is the meaning of the term 'staff\n         corps and departments'           contained in\n         General Laws 1956 § 30-3-13?\"\n\n         If the plaintiff can establish that he was a\n         member of the \"staff corps and departments,\"\n         he might have a constitutional or statutory\n         basis upon which to contest his discharge.\n         Absent a definition of the terms, no court is\n         able to properly address plaintiff's claims.\n\n                    Having considered all relevant\n         authorities, we respond that \"staff corps and\n         departments\" is a vestigial term that cannot\n         fairly be construed to have any meaning in the\n         RIANG's modern military organization or any\n         application to commissioned officers since\n         1956.\n\n787 A.2d at 1152-1153 (footnote omitted).\n\n     The closing portion of the opinion is as follows:\n\n          Historical Army Organization\n\n                The Court notes that the phrase \"staff\n          corps and departments\" does not appear in any\n          modern    United   States   Army    table   of\n          organization, or in the United States Code.\n          To ascertain the origin of the term it is\n          necessary    to  look   to   historical   Army\n          organization.\n\n              After the War of 1812, Secretary of War\n         John C. Calhoun separated the War Department\n         into two groups -- a departmental staff and\n         the Army in the field (otherwise referred to\n         as the \"line\").     See James E. Hewes, Jr.,\n         From Root to McNamara: Army Organization and\n         Administration,    1900-1963   3   (Center   of\n         Military History 1975).       The departmental\n         staff consisted of the heads of individual\n         departments (or bureaus) and each department\n         performed a \"specialized function or service.\"\n         Id.    Some of the staff departments were\n         referred to as \"corps,\" including the corps of\n         engineers and signal corps.          Some were\n         referred to as \"departments,\" including the\n         JAG   department,    the   adjutant   general's\n         department, the quartermaster's department,\n         the    subsistence     department,    the   pay\n\n                              -12-\n\fdepartment, the medical department and the\nordnance department.\n      Thus, in the early nineteenth century,\nthe term \"staff corps and departments\"\nreferred to groups of officers performing a\n\"specialized function or service.\" The scope\nof \"staff corps and departments,\" however,\nevolved    because     of     the     continuous\nreorganization of the War Department.        For\nexample,    in   1917,    the     quartermaster,\nsubsistence    and   pay    departments     were\nconsolidated into a single quartermaster\ncorps.   See Hewes, at 17, 21-22.       One year\nlater, the portion of the quartermaster corps\nthat formerly was the pay department emerged\nas the finance department. See id. at 48. At\nthe same time, a new tank corps was formed\nfrom members of the ordnance department and\ncorps of engineers.      See id.      Next, the\nchemical warfare department and the chaplains\ndepartment became independent departments.\nSee id. at 51.\n\n      The organization of the RIANG mirrored\nthe organization of the War Department.     In\n1929, commissioned officers of the RIANG were\ndivided into two groups, the \"staff corps and\ndepartments\" and the \"line.\" 1929 R.I. Nat'l\nGuard Adj. Gen. Ann. Rep. 19.      The \"staff\ncorps and departments\" consisted of the\nadjutant     general's     department,     the\nquartermaster corps, the signal corps, the\nmedical corps, the medical administrative\ncorps, inspector general's department, the JAG\ncorps, the ordnance department, the dental\ncorps, the veterinary corps and the chaplains.\nSee id.\n\n       However, by World War II, the terms\n\"staff corps\" and \"departments\" ceased to\nexist. See Hewes, at 90.    Instead, the War\nDepartment began using the terms \"technical\nservices\" or \"administrative services.\" Id.\nat 97, 99.      In 1942, there were seven\ntechnical services and four administrative\nservices. However, only some of the technical\nor administrative service corps were formerly\nconsidered \"staff corps and departments.\" In\n1947, the War Department was officially\nrenamed the Department of the Army. See id.\n\n                     -13-\n\fat 167. At that time, the armed forces were\nreorganized into a centralized body under the\nDepartment of Defense similar to its present\nstructure. See id. at 310-11.\n\nModern Army Organization\n\n     Today, the Army is divided into the basic\nbranches and the special branches.      See 10\nU.S.C. §§ 3063, 3064, 3067. There is no group\nof officers deemed members of the \"staff corps\nand departments.\" Further, branches that were\nhistorically members of the \"staff corps and\ndepartments\" are now found in both the basic\nand special branches of the Army.     When the\nLegislature enacted § 30-3-13 in 1956, the\nDepartment of the Army already had been\nreorganized. Consequently, the \"staff corps\nand departments\" no longer existed. We must\nassume then that the Legislature adopted the\nprovisions   governing   the   RIANG   without\nintending to have its organization conflict\nwith its federal counterparts. This must be\ntrue since § 30-3-13 expressly provides that\nthe Legislature intends for the RIANG to be\n\"organized as to branch or arm of service into\nsuch     federally      recognized      units,\norganizations,    corps,    departments,    or\notherwise as shall be authorized by the laws\nof the United States and the regulations\nissued thereunder.\"\n\n\nConclusion\n\n       In conclusion, we find that the term\n\"staff corps and departments\" is a vestigial\nterm that cannot fairly be construed to have\nany meaning in modern military organization or\napplication    to    presently    commissioned\nofficers. This Court is constrained to make\nsuch a conclusion because history has wrought\nsuch substantial change to the organization\nand structure of the United States Army and\nthe RIANG. To conclude otherwise would permit\nthe First Circuit to consider plaintiff's\nmembership within a group that no longer\nexists. We decline to permit such an absurd\nresult. See In re Estate of Gervais, 770 A.2d\nat 880 (citing Hargreaves v. Jack, 750 A.2d\n430, 435 (R.I. 2000)).\n\n                    -14-\n\f     In our Order for Certification we stated that \"[i]f the\n\nSupreme Court of Rhode Island determines that Major Wigginton was\n\nnot, when discharged from RIANG, an officer of the 'staff corps and\ndepartments' within the meaning of R.I. Gen.

In this Court's prior opinion, <i>Wigginton v.

Wigginton served in the Marines from 1967 to 1970 and was then honorably discharged. In 1979 Wigginton was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve and, concomitantly, in the Rhode Island Army National Guard (\"RIANG\"). He received regular promotions, and by 1996 &#8212; the year in which the event triggering this litigation took place &#8212; Wigginton, by then forty-six years old, had almost twenty years of aggregate service in the Marines and RIANG and had attained the rank of major. In January of 1996 Wigginton was advised that in May of that year his status would be considered by a Selective Retention Board, pursuant to National Guard Regulation (\"NGR\") 635-102. The stated purpose of NGR 635-102 was to \"[e]nsur[e] that only the most capable officers are retained beyond 20 years of qualifying service for assignment to the comparatively few higher level command and staff positions.\" Of the ten RIANG officers whose status was considered at the May 1996 session of the Selective Retention Board, four &#8212; of whom Wigginton was one &#8212; were recommended for non-retention. Pursuant to the Board's recommendation, Brigadier General Reginald E. Centracchio, Adjutant General of Rhode Island, then notified Wigginton that he was to be separated from RIANG as of July 13, 1996; separation followed on that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September of 1996 Wigginton filed a two-count &#167; 1983 (42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983) suit against Centracchio and the State of Rhode Island in the Superior Court for Providence County. The first of the two &#167; 1983 counts charged that termination of Wigginton's RIANG commission constituted deprivation without due process of law of a constitutionally protected property right to continue as a commissioned officer until age sixty &#8212; a substantive right assertedly embodied in &#167; 30-3-13 of Rhode Island General Laws. That statutory provision, part of the Rhode Island military code enacted by the Rhode Island Legislature in 1956, is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All commissioned officers of the staff corps and departments, hereafter appointed, shall have had previous military experience, except chaplains, officers of the judge advocate general's corps, and medical corps officers. They shall hold their positions until they shall have reached the age of sixty (60) years, unless retired prior to that time by reason of resignation or disability, or for cause to be determined by an efficiency board or a court-martial legally convened for that purpose. Vacancies among these officers shall be filled by appointment from the commissioned officer of the national guard or from such other civilians as may be specifically qualified for duty therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">R.I.

One element was a claim that the criteria prescribed by NGR 635-102 as governing the retention/non-retention decision had not been followed in Wigginton's case. The other element was a claim that the absence of any explanation of the grounds for the non-retention decision constituted a fatal due process flaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The proceedings in the District Court</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Centracchio removed the case to the District Court and then filed a motion to dismiss. The Magistrate Judge to whom the case had been referred recommended to the District Judge that the motion to dismiss be granted on the ground that claims arising in the military service were non-justiciable. The District Court, disagreeing with the Magistrate Judge, denied the motion to dismiss. The District Judge ruled that damage actions arising from military service were not justiciable, but that an equitable action &#8212; such as Wigginton's, seeking reinstatement in commissioned status &#8212; could be entertained by an Article III court. The District Court then authorized the parties to engage in discovery addressed to the meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13, the Rhode Island statute relied on by Wigginton in the first count of his complaint, with a view to determining whether Wigginton had been a \"commissioned officer[ ] of the staff corps and departments\" within the meaning of the statute. At the close of discovery, Centracchio and Wigginton both filed motions for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court granted Centracchio's motion for summary judgment. With respect to Wigginton's first count, the District Court found that neither Wigginton nor Centracchio had presented evidence that gave the statutory phrase \"staff corps and departments\" any cognizable meaning. The District Court then ruled that, since Wigginton as plaintiff had the burden of establishing the legal groundwork for his substantive due process claim, his inability to demonstrate that he was an \"officer[] of the staff corps and departments\" meant that the claim presented in the first count of the complaint \"must fail.\" The District Court then went on to address Wigginton's procedural due process claims &#8212; the claims presented in the second count &#8212; and found them without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wigginton appealed to this court from the order of the District Court granting summary judgment and dismissing his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. <i>This court's prior opinion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing Wigginton's appeal we first considered Centracchio's contention that Wigginton's claims were non-justiciable. We held that the District Court had correctly determined that, since Wigginton was not seeking damages but rather the equitable relief of reinstatement as a commissioned RIANG officer, his claims were justiciable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We then turned to the District Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Centracchio. First we considered the dismissal of Wigginton's second count alleging a lack of procedural due process. Wigginton had not pursued on appeal his contention that the Selective Retention Board had not adhered to the decisional criteria prescribed by NGR 635-102; accordingly, we confined our attention to Wigginton's claim that he had a due process right to an explanation of the reasons for the denial of retention. We agreed with the District Court's rejection of that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next we considered the District Court's grant of summary judgment dismissing the first count of Wigginton's complaint. As noted above, the District Court reasoned that, since the testimony and arguments presented by the parties shed no useful light on the meaning of the crucial and opaque statutory phrase \"staff corps and departments,\" and since Wigginton as plaintiff had the burden of establishing all of the elements of his claim, Wigginton's failure to come forward with a persuasive showing that he came within the protective embrace of the statutory phrase meant that his claim \"must fail.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But \"[h]ere,\" we said, \"we part company with the District Court.\" <i>Wigginton,</i> 205 F.3d at 517. And we undertook to explain why:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, a plaintiff loses if he cannot produce evidence tending to establish a fact that, under the governing law, the plaintiff is required to prove in order to make out his cause of action. But that was not the situation at the point that the District Court granted summary judgment against appellant and in favor of appellees. When the District Court granted summary judgment, no determination had been arrived at as to what the governing law was. That is to say, neither the meaning of the phrase \"staff corps and departments\" as used in R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-13-3, nor the extent of the rights created by that statute if applicable, had been judicially resolved. And under those circumstances, there was no way to tell whether the evidence adduced by Major Wigginton would, if credited by a fact-finder, suffice as a matter of Rhode Island law to present the federal constitutional question whether state law rights had been abridged without due process. Accordingly, it was error to grant summary judgment on the first count in favor of General Centracchio and the State of Rhode Island. And it would, <i>a fortiori,</i> have been error to grant summary judgment in favor of Major Wigginton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 517 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having pointed out that the District Court had not arrived at a dispositive construction of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13, and that without such a dispositive construction neither the Centracchio nor the Wigginton motion for summary judgment could be ruled on, we then acknowledged that we, too, could not arrive at a reliable construction of the statute. We explained the statute's ambiguity, and the lack of conventional resources to resolve that ambiguity, and we then went on to conclude that the sensible course was to ask the Supreme Court of Rhode Island to provide an authoritative construction of this esoteric statute:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general thrust of the first two sentences of the statute is apparent. Those persons who are \"commissioned officers of the staff corps and departments... shall hold their positions until they have reached the age of sixty (60) years, unless retired prior to that time by reason of resignation or disability, or for cause to be determined by an efficiency board or a court martial.\" Major Wigginton &#8212; a commissioned officer of RIANG who had not reached age sixty, and who had not been retired by reason of resignation or disability, or for cause &#8212; would appear (absent any other contingencies attached to Major Wigginton's continued employment by Rhode Island law) to be within the protective embrace of the statute if he was an officer of the \"staff corps and departments.\" But what that latter phrase means remains unclear. The first sentence of the statute &#8212; \"All commissioned officers of the staff corps and departments hereafter appointed, shall have had previous military experience, except chaplains, officers of the judge advocate general's corps, and medical corps officers\" &#8212; makes it plain that the phrase \"staff corps and departments\" connotes a cohort inclusive of, but broader than, \"chaplains, officers of the judge advocate general's corps, and medical corps officers.\" How much broader? Broad enough to include Major Wigginton, an officer originally commissioned in the Military Police, later assigned as a Public Affairs Officer, and ultimately acting as an Education Officer? We derive no useful textual guidance from the two other provisions of the statutory code governing RIANG that employ the phrase \"staff corps and departments.\" Appellant and appellees, in their submissions to this court, have been unable to adduce any useful legislative history of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13 and we have found none. Further, the parties have not cited any pertinent decisions construing R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13; and our research confirms that no court (whether a Rhode Island court, a federal court, or a court of another state) has, in a reported opinion, construed \"staff corps and departments\" as utilized in R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13 (or, indeed, as utilized in either of the two other provisions of the statutory code governing RIANG that employ the phrase).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, what we have before us is a Rhode Island statute which is a <i>tabula rasa.</i> Moreover, the state military code of which the statute is a part is a very special kind of state legislative enactment, for the code governs the Rhode Island aspects of a joint state-federal enterprise of great importance &#8212; the Rhode Island Army National Guard. Under these circumstances, in order to achieve a responsible resolution of the issues presented by the pending appeal, it plainly would be better to have a current and authoritative construction of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13 by the Rhode Island judiciary than to have a conjectured prophecy by this court of what Rhode Island's courts might be expected to rule at some future time. Happily, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island has in place a procedure pursuant to which it \"may answer questions of law certified to it by ... a Court of Appeals of the United States ... when requested by the certifying court if there are involved in any proceeding before it questions of law which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of this court.\" Rhode Island Supreme Court Rules, Art. I, Rule 6, &#167; 1. The quoted rule precisely describes the circumstance in which this court finds itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">205 F.3d at 518-19 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, invoking the Supreme Court of Rhode Island's procedure for responding to questions certified by other courts, we certified two questions, explaining the reasons for the certification of these questions in an \"Order for Certification of Certain Questions to the Rhode Island Supreme Court,\" <i>Wigginton v. Centracchio,</i> 214 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2000), the Order for Certification having been crafted as a supplement to our opinion. The two certified questions were as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. At the time Major Wigginton was discharged from RIANG, was he an officer of the \"staff corps and departments\" within the meaning of R.I. Gen.

If the answer to Question 1 is \"Yes,\" does that signify that, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13, Major Wigginton was (in the absence of resignation, disability, or dismissal for cause) therefore entitled to continue as a RIANG officer until age sixty, or would Rhode Island's statutory and/or decisional law attach any other contingency to Major Wigginton's continued status as a RIANG officer?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our Order for Certification we elaborated on the certified questions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Supreme Court of Rhode Island determines that Major Wigginton was not, when discharged from RIANG, an officer of the \"staff corps and departments\" within the meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13, that ruling would be dispositive of the litigation, adversely to Major Wigginton. If, on the other hand, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island determines that Major Wigginton, at the time of his discharge, was an officer of the \"staff corps and departments\" within the meaning of the statute, the Court of Appeals would wish advice on the further question whether R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13 is to be taken to mean what its plain text connotes&#8212;namely, that Major Wigginton, as an officer who has not been retired by resignation or disability, or for cause, is entitled to continue in his RIANG status until he is sixty years old&#8212;or whether Rhode Island's statutory and/or decisional law governing RIANG attaches any other contingency to Major Wigginton's continued status until age sixty as a RIANG officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">214 F.3d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. <i>The ruling of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, and its application to the pending appeal</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of Rhode Island responded to our Order for Certification in a unanimous and characteristically thoughtful opinion, written by Chief Justice Williams. The opinion is reported at <i>Wigginton v. Centracchio,</i> 787 A.2d 1151 (R.I.2001).

The First Circuit sought clarification of the meaning of G.L.1956 &#167; 30-3-13, a statute arguably entitling Maj. Eugene E. Wigginton (plaintiff), to remain in his position in the Rhode Island Army National Guard (RIANG) until the age of sixty. This Court reviewed the certification order and determined that the questions, as certified, required resolution of issues of fact, a task not permitted to us by Article I, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. Thus, we issued an order modifying the original questions and setting forth the single question to which we would respond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"What is the meaning of the term `staff corps and departments' contained in General Laws 1956 &#167; 30-3-13?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the plaintiff can establish that he was a member of the \"staff corps and departments,\" he might have a constitutional or statutory basis upon which to contest his discharge.

To ascertain the origin of the term it is necessary to look to historical Army organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the War of 1812, Secretary of War John C. Calhoun separated the War Department into two groups &#8212; a departmental staff and the Army in the field (otherwise referred to as the \"line\"). <i>See</i> James E. Hewes, Jr., <i>From Root to McNamara: Army Organization and Administration, 1900-1963</i> 3 (Center of Military History 1975). The departmental staff consisted of the heads of individual departments (or bureaus) and each department performed a \"specialized function or service.\" <i>Id.</i> Some of the staff departments were referred to as \"corps,\" including the corps of engineers and signal corps. Some were referred to as \"departments,\" including the JAG department, the adjutant general's department, the quartermaster's department, the subsistence department, the pay department, the medical department and the ordnance department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in the early nineteenth century, the term \"staff corps and departments\" referred to groups of officers performing a \"specialized function or service.\" The scope of \"staff corps and departments,\" however, evolved because of the continuous reorganization of the War Department. For example, in 1917, the quartermaster, subsistence and pay departments were consolidated into a single quartermaster corps. <i>See Hewes,</i> at 17, 21-22. One year later, the portion of the quartermaster corps that formerly was the pay department emerged as the finance department. <i>See id.</i> at 48. At the same time, a new tank corps was formed from members of the ordnance department and corps of engineers. <i>See id.</i> Next, the chemical warfare department and the chaplains department became independent departments. <i>See id.</i> at 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The organization of the RIANG mirrored the organization of the War Department. In 1929, commissioned officers of the RIANG were divided into two groups, the \"staff corps and departments\" and the \"line.\" 1929 R.I. Nat'l Guard Adj. Gen. Ann. Rep. 19. The \"staff corps and departments\" consisted of the adjutant general's department, the quartermaster corps, the signal corps, the medical corps, the medical administrative corps, inspector general's department, the JAG corps, the ordnance department, the dental corps, the veterinary corps and the chaplains. <i>See id.</i> However, by World War II, the terms \"staff corps\" and \"departments\" ceased to exist. <i>See Hewes,</i> at 90. Instead, the War Department began using the terms \"technical services\" or \"administrative services.\" <i>Id.</i> at 97, 99. In 1942, there were seven technical services and four administrative services. However, only some of the technical or administrative service corps were formerly considered \"staff corps and departments.\" In 1947, the War Department was officially renamed the Department of the Army. <i>See id.</i> at 167. At that time, the armed forces were reorganized into a centralized body under the Department of Defense similar to its present structure. <i>See id.</i> at 310-11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Modern Army Organization</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Today, the Army is divided into the basic branches and the special branches. <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3063, 3064, 3067. There is no group of officers deemed members of the \"staff corps and departments.\" Further, branches that were historically members of the \"staff corps and departments\" are now found in both the basic and special branches of the Army. When the Legislature enacted &#167; 30-3-13 in 1956, the Department of the Army already had been reorganized. Consequently, the \"staff corps and departments\" no longer existed. We must assume then that the Legislature adopted the provisions governing the RIANG without intending to have its organization conflict with its federal counterparts. This must be true since &#167; 30-3-13 expressly provides that the Legislature intends for the RIANG to be \"organized as to branch or arm of service into such federally recognized units, organizations, corps, departments, or otherwise as shall be authorized by the laws of the United States and the regulations issued thereunder.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, we find that the term \"staff corps and departments\" is a vestigial term that cannot fairly be construed to have any meaning in modern military organization or application to presently commissioned officers. This Court is constrained to make such a conclusion because history has wrought such substantial change to the organization and structure of the United States Army and the RIANG. To conclude otherwise would permit the First Circuit to consider plaintiff's membership within a group that no longer exists. We decline to permit such an absurd result. <i>See In re Estate of Gervais,</i> 770 A.2d at 880 (citing <i>Hargreaves v. Jack,</i> 750 A.2d 430, 435 (R.I.2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our Order for Certification we stated that \"[i]f the Supreme Court of Rhode Island determines that Major Wigginton was not, when discharged from RIANG, an officer of the `staff corps and departments' within the meaning of R.I.

Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13, has, as a matter of Rhode Island law, no \"meaning in modern military organization or application to presently commissioned officers,\" appellant Wigginton's &#167; 1983 claim, for which that statutory term is the foundation, is foreclosed.

Wigginton served in the Marines from 1967 to 1970 and was then honorably discharged. In 1979 Wigginton was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve and, concomitantly, in the Rhode Island Army National Guard (\"RIANG\"). He received regular promotions, and by 1996 &#8212; the year in which the event triggering this litigation took place &#8212; Wigginton, by then forty-six years old, had almost twenty years of aggregate service in the Marines and RIANG and had attained the rank of major. In January of 1996 Wigginton was advised that in May of that year his status would be considered by a Selective Retention Board, pursuant to National Guard Regulation (\"NGR\") 635-102. The stated purpose of NGR 635-102 was to \"[e]nsur[e] that only the most capable officers are retained beyond 20 years of qualifying service for assignment to the comparatively few higher level command and staff positions.\" Of the ten RIANG officers whose status was considered at the May 1996 session of the Selective Retention Board, four &#8212; of whom Wigginton was one &#8212; were recommended for non-retention. Pursuant to the Board's recommendation, Brigadier General Reginald E. Centracchio, Adjutant General of Rhode Island, then notified Wigginton that he was to be separated from RIANG as of July 13, 1996; separation followed on that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September of 1996 Wigginton filed a two-count &#167; 1983 (42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983) suit against Centracchio and the State of Rhode Island in the Superior Court for Providence County. The first of the two &#167; 1983 counts charged that termination of Wigginton's RIANG commission constituted deprivation without due process of law of a constitutionally protected property right to continue as a commissioned officer until age sixty &#8212; a substantive right assertedly embodied in &#167; 30-3-13 of Rhode Island General Laws. That statutory provision, part of the Rhode Island military code enacted by the Rhode Island Legislature in 1956, is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All commissioned officers of the staff corps and departments, hereafter appointed, shall have had previous military experience, except chaplains, officers of the judge advocate general's corps, and medical corps officers. They shall hold their positions until they shall have reached the age of sixty (60) years, unless retired prior to that time by reason of resignation or disability, or for cause to be determined by an efficiency board or a court-martial legally convened for that purpose. Vacancies among these officers shall be filled by appointment from the commissioned officer of the national guard or from such other civilians as may be specifically qualified for duty therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">R.I.

One element was a claim that the criteria prescribed by NGR 635-102 as governing the retention/non-retention decision had not been followed in Wigginton's case. The other element was a claim that the absence of any explanation of the grounds for the non-retention decision constituted a fatal due process flaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The proceedings in the District Court</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Centracchio removed the case to the District Court and then filed a motion to dismiss. The Magistrate Judge to whom the case had been referred recommended to the District Judge that the motion to dismiss be granted on the ground that claims arising in the military service were non-justiciable. The District Court, disagreeing with the Magistrate Judge, denied the motion to dismiss. The District Judge ruled that damage actions arising from military service were not justiciable, but that an equitable action &#8212; such as Wigginton's, seeking reinstatement in commissioned status &#8212; could be entertained by an Article III court. The District Court then authorized the parties to engage in discovery addressed to the meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13, the Rhode Island statute relied on by Wigginton in the first count of his complaint, with a view to determining whether Wigginton had been a \"commissioned officer[ ] of the staff corps and departments\" within the meaning of the statute. At the close of discovery, Centracchio and Wigginton both filed motions for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court granted Centracchio's motion for summary judgment. With respect to Wigginton's first count, the District Court found that neither Wigginton nor Centracchio had presented evidence that gave the statutory phrase \"staff corps and departments\" any cognizable meaning. The District Court then ruled that, since Wigginton as plaintiff had the burden of establishing the legal groundwork for his substantive due process claim, his inability to demonstrate that he was an \"officer[] of the staff corps and departments\" meant that the claim presented in the first count of the complaint \"must fail.\" The District Court then went on to address Wigginton's procedural due process claims &#8212; the claims presented in the second count &#8212; and found them without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wigginton appealed to this court from the order of the District Court granting summary judgment and dismissing his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. <i>This court's prior opinion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing Wigginton's appeal we first considered Centracchio's contention that Wigginton's claims were non-justiciable. We held that the District Court had correctly determined that, since Wigginton was not seeking damages but rather the equitable relief of reinstatement as a commissioned RIANG officer, his claims were justiciable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We then turned to the District Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Centracchio. First we considered the dismissal of Wigginton's second count alleging a lack of procedural due process. Wigginton had not pursued on appeal his contention that the Selective Retention Board had not adhered to the decisional criteria prescribed by NGR 635-102; accordingly, we confined our attention to Wigginton's claim that he had a due process right to an explanation of the reasons for the denial of retention. We agreed with the District Court's rejection of that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next we considered the District Court's grant of summary judgment dismissing the first count of Wigginton's complaint. As noted above, the District Court reasoned that, since the testimony and arguments presented by the parties shed no useful light on the meaning of the crucial and opaque statutory phrase \"staff corps and departments,\" and since Wigginton as plaintiff had the burden of establishing all of the elements of his claim, Wigginton's failure to come forward with a persuasive showing that he came within the protective embrace of the statutory phrase meant that his claim \"must fail.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But \"[h]ere,\" we said, \"we part company with the District Court.\" <i>Wigginton,</i> 205 F.3d at 517. And we undertook to explain why:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, a plaintiff loses if he cannot produce evidence tending to establish a fact that, under the governing law, the plaintiff is required to prove in order to make out his cause of action. But that was not the situation at the point that the District Court granted summary judgment against appellant and in favor of appellees. When the District Court granted summary judgment, no determination had been arrived at as to what the governing law was. That is to say, neither the meaning of the phrase \"staff corps and departments\" as used in R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-13-3, nor the extent of the rights created by that statute if applicable, had been judicially resolved. And under those circumstances, there was no way to tell whether the evidence adduced by Major Wigginton would, if credited by a fact-finder, suffice as a matter of Rhode Island law to present the federal constitutional question whether state law rights had been abridged without due process. Accordingly, it was error to grant summary judgment on the first count in favor of General Centracchio and the State of Rhode Island. And it would, <i>a fortiori,</i> have been error to grant summary judgment in favor of Major Wigginton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 517 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having pointed out that the District Court had not arrived at a dispositive construction of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13, and that without such a dispositive construction neither the Centracchio nor the Wigginton motion for summary judgment could be ruled on, we then acknowledged that we, too, could not arrive at a reliable construction of the statute. We explained the statute's ambiguity, and the lack of conventional resources to resolve that ambiguity, and we then went on to conclude that the sensible course was to ask the Supreme Court of Rhode Island to provide an authoritative construction of this esoteric statute:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general thrust of the first two sentences of the statute is apparent. Those persons who are \"commissioned officers of the staff corps and departments... shall hold their positions until they have reached the age of sixty (60) years, unless retired prior to that time by reason of resignation or disability, or for cause to be determined by an efficiency board or a court martial.\" Major Wigginton &#8212; a commissioned officer of RIANG who had not reached age sixty, and who had not been retired by reason of resignation or disability, or for cause &#8212; would appear (absent any other contingencies attached to Major Wigginton's continued employment by Rhode Island law) to be within the protective embrace of the statute if he was an officer of the \"staff corps and departments.\" But what that latter phrase means remains unclear. The first sentence of the statute &#8212; \"All commissioned officers of the staff corps and departments hereafter appointed, shall have had previous military experience, except chaplains, officers of the judge advocate general's corps, and medical corps officers\" &#8212; makes it plain that the phrase \"staff corps and departments\" connotes a cohort inclusive of, but broader than, \"chaplains, officers of the judge advocate general's corps, and medical corps officers.\" How much broader? Broad enough to include Major Wigginton, an officer originally commissioned in the Military Police, later assigned as a Public Affairs Officer, and ultimately acting as an Education Officer? We derive no useful textual guidance from the two other provisions of the statutory code governing RIANG that employ the phrase \"staff corps and departments.\" Appellant and appellees, in their submissions to this court, have been unable to adduce any useful legislative history of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13 and we have found none. Further, the parties have not cited any pertinent decisions construing R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13; and our research confirms that no court (whether a Rhode Island court, a federal court, or a court of another state) has, in a reported opinion, construed \"staff corps and departments\" as utilized in R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13 (or, indeed, as utilized in either of the two other provisions of the statutory code governing RIANG that employ the phrase).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, what we have before us is a Rhode Island statute which is a <i>tabula rasa.</i> Moreover, the state military code of which the statute is a part is a very special kind of state legislative enactment, for the code governs the Rhode Island aspects of a joint state-federal enterprise of great importance &#8212; the Rhode Island Army National Guard. Under these circumstances, in order to achieve a responsible resolution of the issues presented by the pending appeal, it plainly would be better to have a current and authoritative construction of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13 by the Rhode Island judiciary than to have a conjectured prophecy by this court of what Rhode Island's courts might be expected to rule at some future time. Happily, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island has in place a procedure pursuant to which it \"may answer questions of law certified to it by ... a Court of Appeals of the United States ... when requested by the certifying court if there are involved in any proceeding before it questions of law which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of this court.\" Rhode Island Supreme Court Rules, Art. I, Rule 6, &#167; 1. The quoted rule precisely describes the circumstance in which this court finds itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">205 F.3d at 518-19 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, invoking the Supreme Court of Rhode Island's procedure for responding to questions certified by other courts, we certified two questions, explaining the reasons for the certification of these questions in an \"Order for Certification of Certain Questions to the Rhode Island Supreme Court,\" <i>Wigginton v. Centracchio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768898\"><a href=\"/opinion/768898/eugene-e-wigginton-v-reginald-a-centracchio/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2000), the Order for Certification having been crafted as a supplement to our opinion. The two certified questions were as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. At the time Major Wigginton was discharged from RIANG, was he an officer of the \"staff corps and departments\" within the meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. If the answer to Question 1 is \"Yes,\" does that signify that, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13, Major Wigginton was (in the absence of resignation, disability, or dismissal for cause) therefore entitled to continue as a RIANG officer until age sixty, or would Rhode Island's statutory and/or decisional law attach any other contingency to Major Wigginton's continued status as a RIANG officer?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our Order for Certification we elaborated on the certified questions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Supreme Court of Rhode Island determines that Major Wigginton was not, when discharged from RIANG, an officer of the \"staff corps and departments\" within the meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13, that ruling would be dispositive of the litigation, adversely to Major Wigginton. If, on the other hand, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island determines that Major Wigginton, at the time of his discharge, was an officer of the \"staff corps and departments\" within the meaning of the statute, the Court of Appeals would wish advice on the further question whether R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13 is to be taken to mean what its plain text connotes&#8212;namely, that Major Wigginton, as an officer who has not been retired by resignation or disability, or for cause, is entitled to continue in his RIANG status until he is sixty years old&#8212;or whether Rhode Island's statutory and/or decisional law governing RIANG attaches any other contingency to Major Wigginton's continued status until age sixty as a RIANG officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">214 F.3d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. <i>The ruling of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, and its application to the pending appeal</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of Rhode Island responded to our Order for Certification in a unanimous and characteristically thoughtful opinion, written by Chief Justice Williams. The opinion is reported at <i>Wigginton v. Centracchio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2320813\"><a href=\"/opinion/2320813/wigginton-v-centracchio/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1151</span></a></span> (R.I.2001).

The First Circuit sought clarification of the meaning of G.L.1956 &#167; 30-3-13, a statute arguably entitling Maj. Eugene E. Wigginton (plaintiff), to remain in his position in the Rhode Island Army National Guard (RIANG) until the age of sixty. This Court reviewed the certification order and determined that the questions, as certified, required resolution of issues of fact, a task not permitted to us by Article I, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. Thus, we issued an order modifying the original questions and setting forth the single question to which we would respond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"What is the meaning of the term `staff corps and departments' contained in General Laws 1956 &#167; 30-3-13?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the plaintiff can establish that he was a member of the \"staff corps and departments,\" he might have a constitutional or statutory basis upon which to contest his discharge.

To ascertain the origin of the term it is necessary to look to historical Army organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the War of 1812, Secretary of War John C. Calhoun separated the War Department into two groups &#8212; a departmental staff and the Army in the field (otherwise referred to as the \"line\"). <i>See</i> James E. Hewes, Jr., <i>From Root to McNamara: Army Organization and Administration, 1900-1963</i> 3 (Center of Military History 1975). The departmental staff consisted of the heads of individual departments (or bureaus) and each department performed a \"specialized function or service.\" <i>Id.</i> Some of the staff departments were referred to as \"corps,\" including the corps of engineers and signal corps. Some were referred to as \"departments,\" including the JAG department, the adjutant general's department, the quartermaster's department, the subsistence department, the pay department, the medical department and the ordnance department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in the early nineteenth century, the term \"staff corps and departments\" referred to groups of officers performing a \"specialized function or service.\" The scope of \"staff corps and departments,\" however, evolved because of the continuous reorganization of the War Department. For example, in 1917, the quartermaster, subsistence and pay departments were consolidated into a single quartermaster corps. <i>See Hewes,</i> at 17, 21-22. One year later, the portion of the quartermaster corps that formerly was the pay department emerged as the finance department. <i>See id.</i> at 48. At the same time, a new tank corps was formed from members of the ordnance department and corps of engineers. <i>See id.</i> Next, the chemical warfare department and the chaplains department became independent departments. <i>See id.</i> at 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The organization of the RIANG mirrored the organization of the War Department. In 1929, commissioned officers of the RIANG were divided into two groups, the \"staff corps and departments\" and the \"line.\" 1929 R.I. Nat'l Guard Adj. Gen. Ann. Rep. 19. The \"staff corps and departments\" consisted of the adjutant general's department, the quartermaster corps, the signal corps, the medical corps, the medical administrative corps, inspector general's department, the JAG corps, the ordnance department, the dental corps, the veterinary corps and the chaplains. <i>See id.</i> However, by World War II, the terms \"staff corps\" and \"departments\" ceased to exist. <i>See Hewes,</i> at 90. Instead, the War Department began using the terms \"technical services\" or \"administrative services.\" <i>Id.</i> at 97, 99. In 1942, there were seven technical services and four administrative services. However, only some of the technical or administrative service corps were formerly considered \"staff corps and departments.\" In 1947, the War Department was officially renamed the Department of the Army. <i>See id.</i> at 167. At that time, the armed forces were reorganized into a centralized body under the Department of Defense similar to its present structure. <i>See id.</i> at 310-11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Modern Army Organization</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Today, the Army is divided into the basic branches and the special branches. <i>See</i> 10 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3063, 3064, 3067. There is no group of officers deemed members of the \"staff corps and departments.\" Further, branches that were historically members of the \"staff corps and departments\" are now found in both the basic and special branches of the Army. When the Legislature enacted &#167; 30-3-13 in 1956, the Department of the Army already had been reorganized. Consequently, the \"staff corps and departments\" no longer existed. We must assume then that the Legislature adopted the provisions governing the RIANG without intending to have its organization conflict with its federal counterparts. This must be true since &#167; 30-3-13 expressly provides that the Legislature intends for the RIANG to be \"organized as to branch or arm of service into such federally recognized units, organizations, corps, departments, or otherwise as shall be authorized by the laws of the United States and the regulations issued thereunder.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, we find that the term \"staff corps and departments\" is a vestigial term that cannot fairly be construed to have any meaning in modern military organization or application to presently commissioned officers. This Court is constrained to make such a conclusion because history has wrought such substantial change to the organization and structure of the United States Army and the RIANG. To conclude otherwise would permit the First Circuit to consider plaintiff's membership within a group that no longer exists. We decline to permit such an absurd result. <i>See In re Estate of Gervais,</i> 770 A.2d at 880 (citing <i>Hargreaves v.

Gen. Laws &#167; 30-3-13, has, as a matter of Rhode Island law, no \"meaning in modern military organization or application to presently commissioned officers,\" appellant Wigginton's &#167; 1983 claim, for which that statutory term is the foundation, is foreclosed.
