In this appeal, plaintiff-\n\nappellant    Administration       for   Child    Support,    a     unit   of    the\n\nDepartment    of   the   Family   of    the   Commonwealth    of    Puerto     Rico\n\n(\"Puerto Rico\"), seeks review of a decision of the district court\n\ngranting summary judgment in favor of the United States Department\n\nof Health and Human Services (\"HHS\" or \"Agency\") in a proceeding\n\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C. § 610(c).     Puerto Rico brought this action to challenge the\n\nAgency's assessment of a financial penalty against certain federal\n\ngrant money used to fund Puerto Rico's child support enforcement\n\nprograms, after HHS determined that Puerto Rico had failed to\n\nsatisfy     data   reporting      requirements,      or     meet     performance\n\nbenchmarks, in consecutive fiscal years.\n\n            Puerto Rico contends that HHS acted in an arbitrary and\n\ncapricious manner when it refused to accept data submitted 45 days\n\nafter the regulatory deadline, and failed to provide adequate\n\nnotice of its intent to assess the penalty.            It asserts that both\n\nof these actions were predicated on the Agency's unreasonable\n\nreading of applicable regulations.              The district court rejected\n\nthese contentions, concluding that the Agency's interpretation of\n\nits regulations was reasonable and entitled to deference.                      After\n\ncareful review, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f                                 I.   Background\n\n              A.    Statutory and Regulatory Framework\n\n              Puerto Rico participates in the Temporary Assistance to\n\nNeedy Families, or TANF, program, which is administered by HHS\n\npursuant to Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 601\n\n-619.   The TANF program provides block grants, also known as State\n\nFamily Assistance Grants, to eligible states.                  See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 603(a)(1).1       A central purpose of these grants is to lend a hand\n\nto states which \"provide assistance to needy families so that\n\nchildren may be cared for in their own home or in the homes of\n\nrelatives.\"        Id. § 601.   Eligibility for TANF grants is predicated\n\non the state's operation of child support enforcement programs --\n\nthat    is,   programs    designed     to     locate   non-custodial     parents,\n\nestablish paternity, and obtain child and spousal support -- in\n\naccordance with Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.                    See 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 651-669b; see also 42 U.S.C. § 602(a)(2).\n\n              Title IV-D enforces strict performance standards and\n\nreporting requirements on states as a condition of funding.                Under\n\nthis regime, states may qualify for incentive payments based on the\n\nrelative      effectiveness     of    their    performance   in   five    areas:\n\npaternity establishment, child support order establishment, current\n\ncollections, average collections, and cost effectiveness.                     42\n\n\n1\n   Puerto Rico is treated as a state for purposes of the TANF\nprogram, 42 U.S.C. § 619(5), and Title IV-D of the Social Security\nAct, id. § 1301(a)(1).\n\n                                        -3-\n\fU.S.C. § 658a(b)(6); 45 C.F.R. § 305.2. Each fiscal year, eligible\n\nstates must submit \"complete and reliable\" data to demonstrate\n\ntheir performance in each of these areas.     42 U.S.C. § 658a(b)\n\n(5)(B); see also id. § 652(g)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 305.1(i) & (j).   Data\n\nis considered \"reliable\" if it meets a 95% standard of reliability\n\nas determined by the Secretary of HHS, 45 C.F.R. § 305.1(i), and\n\n\"complete\" if it includes all reporting elements necessary to\n\ncompute performance levels and is submitted within the proper\n\ntimeframe, id. § 305.1(j).2   HHS regulations set the deadline for\n\nsubmitting this data as the December 31st following the end of each\n\nfiscal year, i.e., the end of the first quarter following the\n\nconclusion of the fiscal year.   See 45 C.F.R. § 305.32(f).\n\n          Based on this data, HHS calculates the amount of each\n\nstate's incentive payments. 42 U.S.C. § 658a(b). If the Secretary\n\ndetermines that the data submitted by the state is reliable and\n\ncomplete, he will determine how the state performed with respect to\n\neach of the five performance measures as compared to other eligible\n\nstates; incentive payments are then allocated to each state as a\n\nshare of a fixed \"[i]ncentive payment pool\" set aside by Congress\n\nfor each fiscal year.   Id.   However, if the Secretary determines\n\nthat the state has submitted unreliable or incomplete data for any\n\n\n2\n   To assess the completeness, reliability, and security of the\ndata submitted by the states and the accuracy of the reporting\nsystems used in calculating the five performance indicators, the\nSecretary is obligated to conduct audits of this data at least once\nevery three years. 42 U.S.C. § 652(a)(4)(C)(i).\n\n                                 -4-\n\fparticular     performance     indicator,     or     has   failed     to    satisfy\n\napplicable performance benchmarks, the state will not receive an\n\nincentive payment for that indicator for that financial year.                      See\n\nid.\n\n           States are also subject to penalties based on their year-\n\nto-year    performance       in   three     of     these     areas:        paternity\n\nestablishment,       support      order     establishment,          and     current\n\ncollections.    See 42 U.S.C. § 609.         When in a given fiscal year a\n\nstate fails to either submit complete and reliable data or satisfy\n\nsubstantive     performance       measures,        the     next     fiscal        year\n\nautomatically becomes a \"corrective action year\" in which the state\n\nis required to improve its performance or face penalties.                          Id.\n\n§ 609(a)(8)(A); 45 C.F.R. §§ 305.40, 305.61(a)-(b).                 That is, when\n\na state in consecutive fiscal years fails either the data reporting\n\nrequirement     and/or   the      substantive        performance      requirement\n\n(including a reporting failure in one year and a performance\n\nfailure in the other), it is subject to a penalty under the TANF\n\nprogram.\n\n           As   is   relevant     here,     states    must   establish        a   90%\n\n\"paternity establishment percentage,\" or PEP, for each year in\n\norder to qualify for an incentive payment for that performance\n\nindicator.3     42 U.S.C. § 652(g)(1)(A).             If a state's PEP falls\n\n\n3\n  The PEP measures a state's success at establishing the paternity\nof children born out-of-wedlock. 42 U.S.C. § 652(g). A state may\ncalculate its PEP according to either (1) the percentage of\n\n                                      -5-\n\fbelow this 90% threshold, however, it may still satisfy this\n\nperformance    requirement   by   demonstrating   a   certain    level   of\n\nimprovement over the previous fiscal year's PEP.           Id. § 652(g)\n\n(1)(B)-(F); 45 C.F.R. § 305.40(a)(1).          When a state fails to\n\nsatisfy the PEP performance and/or reporting criteria in two\n\nconsecutive years, it is subject to a penalty.               The penalty\n\nassessed is a certain percentage of the TANF grant; the first\n\nfailure is penalized by a 1-2% reduction, but subsequent failures\n\nmay be penalized by as much as 5%.        42 U.S.C. § 609(a)(8)(B); 45\n\nC.F.R. § 305.61(c).   When a penalty is imposed, a state must expend\n\nits own funds to make up the difference.       45 C.F.R. § 262.1(e)(1).\n\n          HHS is required to \"notify the State in writing\" when it\n\ndetermines that a state is subject to a penalty.                45 C.F.R.\n\n§§ 262.7, 305.66.      The notice must inform the state of the\n\ndeficiency which is the basis for the penalty, as well as the\n\nreasons for, and amount of, the penalty assessed.               45 C.F.R.\n\n§ 305.66(b).    The penalty is imposed in the fiscal year following\n\nthe Agency's final decision.      45 C.F.R. § 262.1(c)(2).      States may\n\nappeal to the HHS Departmental Appeals Board (\"DAB\") within sixty\n\ndays of receipt of such notice.          42 U.S.C. § 610(b); 45 C.F.R.\n\n§§ 262.7, 305.66.\n\n\n\nchildren born out of wedlock statewide for whom paternity is\nestablished, or (2) the percentage of children participating in\nstate child support programs for whom paternity is established.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 652(g)(2); 45 C.F.R. § 305.2.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f          B.   Facts and Proceedings Below\n\n          The basic facts are not in dispute. On February 7, 2002,\n\nHHS notified Puerto Rico that its auditors had determined that\n\nPuerto Rico's fiscal year (\"FY\") 2001 PEP data was deficient.             As\n\nHHS explained, Puerto Rico had submitted PEP data covering its\n\nperformance over an eighteen-month period from January 1, 2000 to\n\nJune 30, 2001, rather than the proper twelve-month period from\n\nAugust 1, 2000 to July 31, 2001.        Thus, HHS determined that Puerto\n\nRico's FY 2001 PEP data was not accurate because it included data\n\nprior to the reporting period, and was incomplete because it was\n\nmissing data for July 2001.4\n\n          Puerto     Rico   attempted    to   submit   corrected   data   on\n\nFebruary 14, 2002.    However, in a letter dated March 20, 2002, HHS\n\ninformed Puerto Rico that it would not accept the corrected PEP\n\ndata for purposes of calculating incentive payments because the\n\nDecember 31, 2001 deadline set forth in 45 C.F.R § 305.32(f) had\n\npassed. HHS explained that a \"cut-off point is necessary for us to\n\nmake the required performance determinations and calculations on a\n\ntimely basis\" because \"payments of incentives cannot be made to any\n\nstate until the entire process has been completed for all states in\n\n\n\n4\n   HHS permits states to use a reporting period other than the\nfederal fiscal year, provided \"like\" data are used and compared\nfrom year-to-year. For FY 2000, Puerto Rico submitted data for the\ntwelve-month period from August 1, 1999 through July 31, 2000.\nAccordingly, Puerto Rico was required for FY 2001 to submit data\nfrom August 1, 2000 through July 31, 2001.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fa given fiscal year.\"    Puerto Rico thus received no PEP incentive\n\npayment for FY 2001.    However, because FY 2001 data was used both\n\nto compute incentive payments for FY 2001 and to qualify for FY\n\n2002 incentives based on improved performance, HHS indicated that\n\nit would accept the corrected PEP data covering FY 2001 for the\n\nlimited purpose of determining whether Puerto Rico \"qualif[ied] for\n\nincentives on the basis of improved performance in FY 2002.\"     The\n\ncorrected FY 2001 data showed a PEP of 92%.\n\n           For FY 2002, Puerto Rico submitted data which showed a\n\nPEP of 88%.    This PEP fell below the minimum threshold of 90% and\n\ndid not demonstrate an improvement over the previous fiscal year's\n\nPEP of 92%.    Thus, Puerto Rico had failed for two consecutive years\n\nto submit reliable PEP data (FY 2001) or meet substantive PEP\n\nperformance targets (FY 2002).     Accordingly, HHS notified Puerto\n\nRico on November 14, 2003 that it would be penalized by 1% on its\n\nFY 2003 TANF grant. HHS ultimately assessed a penalty of $582,365.\n\n           Puerto Rico appealed this decision to the DAB and argued\n\nthat the Agency had erred both by failing to accept its corrected\n\ndata in February 2002, and by notifying Puerto Rico in an untimely\n\nfashion of its penalty.     Puerto Rico claimed that each of these\n\nactions was based on an unreasonable interpretation of applicable\n\nregulations.     The DAB rejected both contentions and upheld the\n\npenalty.   Puerto Rico then filed this APA action in the district\n\ncourt challenging the Agency's final decision. The district court,\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fadopting a magistrate judge's recommendation, agreed with the DAB\n\nand   granted    summary   judgment   in    favor   of   HHS.   This   appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                             II.   Discussion\n\n            A.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review grants of summary judgment de novo.          However,\n\nin an APA action, \"'judicial review, even at the summary judgment\n\nstage, is narrow.'\" Visiting Nurse Ass'n Gregoria Auffant, Inc. v.\n\nThompson, 447 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Associated\n\nFisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)).     Under the familiar APA standard, we may \"only set aside\n\nagency actions, findings, and conclusions if they are 'arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance\n\nwith the law.'\"       Id. (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)).             \"[W]here\n\nCongress has entrusted rulemaking and administrative authority to\n\nan agency, courts normally accord the agency particular deference\n\nin respect to the interpretation of regulations promulgated under\n\nthat authority.\" Id. (quoting South Shore Hosp., Inc. v. Thompson,\n\n308 F.3d 91, 97 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\n            B.   Late Submission of Performance Data\n\n            Puerto Rico first argues that HHS's decision not to\n\naccept the revised FY 2001 data submitted on February 14, 2002 was\n\narbitrary and capricious.       Puerto Rico asserts that because the\n\ndata was submitted \"only\" forty-five days late, HHS had sufficient\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\ftime to consider the corrected data, which would have shown a PEP\n\nof 92% and thus no FY 2001 deficiency.             Accordingly, Puerto Rico\n\ncontends that HHS had \"no logical or reasonable explanation\" for\n\nfailing to accept the FY 2001 data for purposes of determining\n\nwhether reliable and complete information had been submitted for FY\n\n2001.5\n\n           We hold that HHS's decision not to accept and consider\n\nPuerto   Rico's      untimely   PEP   data   to    determine   its   FY    2001\n\nperformance    for    incentive   purposes   was    neither    arbitrary   nor\n\ncapricious.       An agency's interpretation of its regulations is\n\nentitled to \"substantial deference,\" and must be given controlling\n\nweight unless it is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\n\nregulation.\"    Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512\n\n(1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).            Here, as Puerto Rico\n\nacknowledges, the regulation at issue unambiguously required Puerto\n\nRico to submit the FY 2001 PEP data by December 31, 2001.                    45\n\nC.F.R. § 305.32(f). The regulation further made it clear that only\n\n\n5\n   Puerto Rico also argues that HHS has been inconsistent in the\napplication of its guidelines because it has in other cases\naccepted modified data past the regulatory deadline.       However,\nPuerto Rico has identified no instance in which HHS has accepted\nuntimely data to determine the prior fiscal year's performance for\nincentive payment purposes. Rather, Puerto Rico cites to one case\nin which HHS requested a state to submit corrected data past the\nregulatory deadline for the purpose of measuring the next year's\nincentives based on improved performance, as it also did here. See\nNevada v. Department of Health and Human Servs., No. 3:05-cv-00677\n(D.Nev. Dec. 28, 2006) (slip op., appended to Appellee's brief).\nAccordingly, we reject Puerto Rico's contention that there is an\ninconsistency in need of explanation.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fdata submitted by that date would be considered by HHS for purposes\n\nof   determining   completeness   and    reliability.   Id.    HHS   has\n\nexplained that this deadline is necessary to allow the Agency\n\nsufficient time to analyze the data and determine each state's\n\nentitlement to incentive payments.       See Child Support Enforcement\n\nProgram; Incentive Payments, Audit Penalties, 65 Fed. Reg. 82,178,\n\n82,184 (Dec. 27, 2000) (explaining, in preamble to final rule, that\n\n\"[a] cut-off point [of December 31st] is necessary for us to make\n\nthe required performance determinations and calculations on a\n\ntimely basis\").    That is, because incentive payments are allocated\n\nto each state as a percentage of a common pool of funds based on\n\nrelative performance, 42 U.S.C. § 658a(b), the Agency cannot\n\nreasonably accommodate late submissions without delaying incentive\n\npayments to every eligible state.        Puerto Rico has not identified\n\nany evidence in the record that calls the Agency's explanation into\n\nquestion, nor has it offered any plausible interpretation of its\n\nown.   Under these circumstances, the Agency's decision to read its\n\nregulations as written was not plainly erroneous.\n\n           Alternatively, Puerto Rico argues that HHS acted in an\n\narbitrary and capricious manner when it rejected the timely, but\n\nuncorrected, FY 2001 data covering the eighteenth-month period from\n\nJanuary 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001.       Because the regulations provide\n\nthat, in certain limited circumstances, the Secretary may excuse\n\nnoncompliance with Title IV-D reporting requirements, Puerto Rico\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fargues that the Agency's decision to reject Puerto Rico's FY 2001\n\nPEP data was an abuse of discretion.                  The regulation on which\n\nPuerto Rico relies provides that the Secretary may disregard a\n\nstate's failure to submit complete and reliable data, and forgo the\n\nassessment of a penalty,\n\n             if   the    Secretary    determines   that   the\n             incompleteness or unreliability of the data,\n             or the noncompliance with one or more of the\n             IV-D requirements, is of a technical nature\n             which    does    not   adversely    affect   the\n             performance of the State's IV-D program or\n             does not adversely affect the determination of\n             the   level     of    the   State's    paternity\n             establishment or other performance measures\n             percentages.\n\n45 C.F.R. § 305.62.      We agree with HHS that Puerto Rico's failure\n\nto comply with the FY 2001 PEP reporting requirements was not of a\n\n\"technical nature\" and, therefore, the Secretary had no discretion\n\nto accept Puerto Rico's submission.            As the DAB reasonably found,\n\nany calculations based on eighteen months of data -- as opposed to\n\nthe proper twelve month period -- would have skewed Puerto Rico's\n\nPEP   rate   upward   for   FY   2001    and   thus    would   have   \"adversely\n\naffect[ed] the determination of the level of the State's paternity\n\nestablishment.\"       Under these circumstances, the Agency did not\n\nabuse its discretion when it rejected Puerto Rico's timely FY 2001\n\ndata due to the deficiencies identified above, or assessed a\n\npenalty based, in part, on that reporting failure.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f          C.   Notice\n\n          Next, Puerto Rico argues that the district court erred in\n\nconcluding that HHS provided adequate notice of its assessment of\n\nthe TANF penalty.   It contends that HHS's interpretation of the\n\napplicable regulation does not give the state an opportunity to\n\ncure the deficiency, and is arbitrary and capricious because it\n\nfrustrates Congress's intent to give states the chance to take\n\ncorrective action and avoid the penalty.    Puerto Rico emphasizes\n\nthat it received notice of the penalty on November 14, 2003 --\n\nthirteen months after the end of FY 2002 and, it asserts, too late\n\nto take corrective action.\n\n          HHS regulations provide that \"[i]f a State is found by\n\nthe Secretary to be subject to a penalty,\" then it must \"notify the\n\nState in writing of such finding.\"    45 C.F.R. § 305.66(a).   The\n\nnotice must:\n\n          (1) Explain the deficiency or deficiencies\n          which result in the State being subject to a\n          penalty, indicate the amount of the potential\n          penalty, and give reasons for the finding; and\n\n          (2) Specify that the penalty will be assessed\n          in accordance with the provisions of 45 C.F.R.\n          262.1(b) through (e) and 262.7 if the State is\n          found to have failed to correct the deficiency\n          or deficiencies cited in the notice during the\n          automatic corrective action year (i.e., the\n          succeeding fiscal year following the year with\n          respect to which the deficiency occurred.)\n\nId. § 305.66(b).    HHS has consistently interpreted § 305.66 to\n\nrequire written notice of a penalty only after a state has \"failed\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fto   correct    the    deficiency      or   deficiencies      .   .   .    during   the\n\nautomatic corrective action year\" and has been \"found by the\n\nSecretary to be subject to a penalty.\"                See Ala. Dep't of Human\n\nRes. v. United States HHS, 478 F. Supp. 2d 85, 89 (D.D.C. 2007);\n\nNevada, No. 3:05-cv-00677, slip op. at 11.\n\n            By its plain terms, § 305.66(a) does not require HHS to\n\ngive advance notice of its intent to assess a penalty in order to\n\npermit    the   state     to    take    corrective     action.            Rather,   the\n\nregulations contemplate that the Agency will notify the state \"if\"\n\nit determines that the state \"is . . . subject to a penalty.\"                       45\n\nC.F.R. § 305.66(a).       Thus, HHS was required to inform Puerto Rico\n\nof its intent to impose a penalty only after it determined that\n\nconsecutive reporting and/or performance failures had occurred.\n\n            Puerto Rico contends that this interpretation deprives\n\nstates of the opportunity to correct a deficiency before the\n\nassessment of a penalty.              However, a state is not subject to a\n\npenalty    until      there    have    been     performance       and/or    reporting\n\ndeficiencies for two consecutive fiscal years.                        See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 609(a)(8)(A); 45 C.F.R. § 305.61.              States have an opportunity to\n\ncure deficiencies, and thus avoid a penalty, during the \"corrective\n\naction year\" which \"automatic[ally]\" follows the fiscal year in\n\nwhich the initial deficiency is found.              45 C.F.R. § 305.66(b)(2);\n\nsee also 45 C.F.R. § 305.61 (providing that HHS may only impose\n\npenalty if, \"[w]ith respect to the immediately succeeding fiscal\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fyear, the State failed to take sufficient corrective action to\n\nachieve the appropriate performance levels or compliance or the\n\ndata submitted by the State are still incomplete and unreliable\");\n\nAla.

Supp. 2d at 89 (\"[A] state is not\n\nsubject to a penalty until after the end of the corrective action\n\nyear which follows immediately and automatically upon a year of\n\nnoncompliance.   Therefore, a penalty cannot be assessed and notice\n\nis not required, until after the end of, not prior to, the\n\ncorrective action year.\").\n\n            In this case, Puerto Rico was on notice that it could be\n\nsubject to a penalty for FY 2002 PEP deficiencies by at least\n\nMarch 20, 2002, when HHS formally rejected the corrected FY 2001\n\nPEP data.   Accordingly, we reject the contention that the Agency's\n\ninterpretation of the § 305.66 notice provision is unreasonable\n\nbecause it prevents states from taking corrective action to avoid\n\nthe imposition of a penalty.6\n\n            Puerto Rico also claims that the Agency's interpretation\n\nshould be set aside because it has not been provided with an\n\n\n6\n    Indeed, the preamble to § 305.66 emphasizes that\n\n      the State should not wait or rely upon the Secretary's\n      determination of a data or a performance deficiency in\n      order to begin corrective action. Two consecutive years\n      of failure (either poor data or poor performance) in the\n      same performance measure criterion will trigger a penalty\n      imposition.\n\nChild Support Enforcement Program;      Incentive   Payments,   Audit\nPenalties, 65 Fed.

We deem\n\nthese arguments waived.    See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n\n17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            Thus, we conclude that the Agency's interpretation of the\n\nnotice provision is reasonable, and entitled to deference.

Puerto Rico brought this action to challenge the Agency's assessment of a financial penalty against certain federal grant money used to fund Puerto Rico's child support enforcement programs, after HHS determined that Puerto Rico had failed to satisfy data reporting requirements, or meet performance benchmarks, in consecutive fiscal years.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico contends that HHS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it refused to accept data submitted 45 days after the regulatory deadline, and failed to provide adequate notice of its intent to assess the penalty. It asserts that both of these actions were predicated on the Agency's unreasonable reading of applicable regulations. The district court rejected these contentions, concluding that the Agency's interpretation of its regulations was reasonable and entitled to deference. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Statutory and Regulatory Framework</h2>\n<p>Puerto Rico participates in the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, program, which is administered by HHS pursuant to Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 601-619. The TANF program provides block grants, also known as State Family Assistance Grants, to eligible states. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 603(a)(1).<sup>[1]</sup> A central purpose of these grants is to lend a hand to states which \"provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own home or in the homes of relatives.\" <i>Id.</i> § 601. Eligibility for TANF grants is predicated on the state's operation of child support enforcement programsthat is, programs designed to locate non-custodial parents, establish paternity, and obtain child and spousal supportin accordance with Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. §§ 651-669b; <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. § 602(a)(2).</p>\n<p>Title IV-D enforces strict performance standards and reporting requirements on states as a condition of funding. Under this regime, states may qualify for incentive payments based on the relative effectiveness of their performance in five areas: paternity establishment, child support order establishment, current collections, average collections, and cost effectiveness. 42 U.S.C. § 658a(b)(6); 45 C.F.R. § 305.2. Each fiscal year, eligible states must submit \"complete and reliable\" data to demonstrate their performance in each of these areas. 42 U.S.C. § 658a(b)(5)(B); <i>see also id.</i> § 652(g)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 305.1(i) &amp; (j). Data is considered \"reliable\" if it meets a 95% standard of reliability as determined by the Secretary of HHS, 45 C.F.R. § 305.1(i), and \"complete\" if it includes all reporting elements necessary to compute performance levels and is submitted within the proper timeframe, <i>id.</i> § 305.1(j).<sup>[2]</sup> HHS regulations set the deadline for submitting this data as the December 31st following the end of each fiscal year, <i>i.e.,</i> the end of the first quarter following the conclusion of the fiscal year. <i>See</i> 45 C.F.R. § 305.32(f).</p>\n<p>Based on this data, HHS calculates the amount of each state's incentive payments. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*743</span> 42 U.S.C. § 658a(b). If the Secretary determines that the data submitted by the state is reliable and complete, he will determine how the state performed with respect to each of the five performance measures as compared to other eligible states; incentive payments are then allocated to each state as a share of a fixed \"[i]ncentive payment pool\" set aside by Congress for each fiscal year. <i>Id.</i> However, if the Secretary determines that the state has submitted unreliable or incomplete data for any particular performance indicator, or has failed to satisfy applicable performance benchmarks, the state will not receive an incentive payment for that indicator for that financial year. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>States are also subject to penalties based on their year-to-year performance in three of these areas: paternity establishment, support order establishment, and current collections. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 609. When in a given fiscal year a state fails to either submit complete and reliable data or satisfy substantive performance measures, the next fiscal year automatically becomes a \"corrective action year\" in which the state is required to improve its performance or face penalties. <i>Id.</i> § 609(a)(8)(A); 45 C.F.R. §§ 305.40, 305.61(a)-(b). That is, when a state in consecutive fiscal years fails either the data reporting requirement and/or the substantive performance requirement (including a reporting failure in one year and a performance failure in the other), it is subject to a penalty under the TANF program.</p>\n<p>As is relevant here, states must establish a 90% \"paternity establishment percentage,\" or PEP, for each year in order to qualify for an incentive payment for that performance indicator.<sup>[3]</sup> 42 U.S.C. § 652(g)(1)(A). If a state's PEP falls below this 90% threshold, however, it may still satisfy this performance requirement by demonstrating a certain level of improvement over the previous fiscal year's PEP. <i>Id.</i> § 652(g)(1)(B)-(F); 45 C.F.R. § 305.40(a)(1). When a state fails to satisfy the PEP performance and/or reporting criteria in two consecutive years, it is subject to a penalty. The penalty assessed is a certain percentage of the TANF grant; the first failure is penalized by a 1-2% reduction, but subsequent failures may be penalized by as much as 5%. 42 U.S.C. § 609(a)(8)(B); 45 C.F.R. § 305.61(c). When a penalty is imposed, a state must expend its own funds to make up the difference. 45 C.F.R. § 262.1(e)(1).</p>\n<p>HHS is required to \"notify the State in writing\" when it determines that a state is subject to a penalty. 45 C.F.R. §§ 262.7, 305.66. The notice must inform the state of the deficiency which is the basis for the penalty, as well as the reasons for, and amount of, the penalty assessed. 45 C.F.R. § 305.66(b). The penalty is imposed in the fiscal year following the Agency's final decision. 45 C.F.R. § 262.1(c)(2). States may appeal to the HHS Departmental Appeals Board (\"DAB\") within sixty days of receipt of such notice. 42 U.S.C. § 610(b); 45 C.F.R. §§ 262.7, 305.66.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Facts and Proceedings Below</h2>\n<p>The basic facts are not in dispute. On February 7, 2002, HHS notified Puerto Rico that its auditors had determined that Puerto Rico's fiscal year (\"FY\") 2001 PEP data was deficient. As HHS explained, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*744</span> Puerto Rico had submitted PEP data covering its performance over an eighteen-month period from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001, rather than the proper twelve-month period from August 1, 2000 to July 31, 2001. Thus, HHS determined that Puerto Rico's FY 2001 PEP data was not accurate because it included data prior to the reporting period, and was incomplete because it was missing data for July 2001.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Puerto Rico attempted to submit corrected data on February 14, 2002. However, in a letter dated March 20, 2002, HHS informed Puerto Rico that it would not accept the corrected PEP data for purposes of calculating incentive payments because the December 31, 2001 deadline set forth in 45 C.F.R § 305.32(f) had passed. HHS explained that a \"cut-off point is necessary for us to make the required performance determinations and calculations on a timely basis\" because \"payments of incentives cannot be made to any state until the entire process has been completed for <i>all</i> states in a given fiscal year.\" Puerto Rico thus received no PEP incentive payment for FY 2001. However, because FY 2001 data was used both to compute incentive payments for FY 2001 <i>and</i> to qualify for FY 2002 incentives based on improved performance, HHS indicated that it would accept the corrected PEP data covering FY 2001 for the limited purpose of determining whether Puerto Rico \"qualif[ied] for incentives on the basis of improved performance in FY 2002.\" The corrected FY 2001 data showed a PEP of 92%.</p>\n<p>For FY 2002, Puerto Rico submitted data which showed a PEP of 88%. This PEP fell below the minimum threshold of 90% and did not demonstrate an improvement over the previous fiscal year's PEP of 92%. Thus, Puerto Rico had failed for two consecutive years to submit reliable PEP data (FY 2001) or meet substantive PEP performance targets (FY 2002). Accordingly, HHS notified Puerto Rico on November 14, 2003 that it would be penalized by 1% on its FY 2003 TANF grant. HHS ultimately assessed a penalty of $582,365.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico appealed this decision to the DAB and argued that the Agency had erred both by failing to accept its corrected data in February 2002, and by notifying Puerto Rico in an untimely fashion of its penalty. Puerto Rico claimed that each of these actions was based on an unreasonable interpretation of applicable regulations. The DAB rejected both contentions and upheld the penalty. Puerto Rico then filed this APA action in the district court challenging the Agency's final decision. The district court, adopting a magistrate judge's recommendation, agreed with the DAB and granted summary judgment in favor of HHS. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review grants of summary judgment <i>de novo.</i> However, in an APA action, \"`judicial review, even at the summary judgment stage, is narrow.'\" <i>Visiting Nurse Ass'n Gregoria Auffant, Inc. v. Thompson,</i> 447 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley,</i> 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997)). Under the familiar APA standard, we may \"only set aside agency actions, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*745</span> findings, and conclusions if they are `arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)). \"[W]here Congress has entrusted rulemaking and administrative authority to an agency, courts normally accord the agency particular deference in respect to the interpretation of regulations promulgated under that authority.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>South Shore Hosp., Inc. v. Thompson,</i> 308 F.3d 91, 97 (1st Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Late Submission of Performance Data</h2>\n<p>Puerto Rico first argues that HHS's decision not to accept the revised FY 2001 data submitted on February 14, 2002 was arbitrary and capricious. Puerto Rico asserts that because the data was submitted \"only\" forty-five days late, HHS had sufficient time to consider the corrected data, which would have shown a PEP of 92% and thus no FY 2001 deficiency. Accordingly, Puerto Rico contends that HHS had \"no logical or reasonable explanation\" for failing to accept the FY 2001 data for purposes of determining whether reliable and complete information had been submitted for FY 2001.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We hold that HHS's decision not to accept and consider Puerto Rico's untimely PEP data to determine its FY 2001 performance for incentive purposes was neither arbitrary nor capricious. An agency's interpretation of its regulations is entitled to \"substantial deference,\" and must be given controlling weight unless it is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" <i>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala,</i> 512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, as Puerto Rico acknowledges, the regulation at issue unambiguously required Puerto Rico to submit the FY 2001 PEP data by December 31, 2001. 45 C.F.R. § 305.32(f). The regulation further made it clear that only data submitted by that date would be considered by HHS for purposes of determining completeness and reliability. <i>Id.</i> HHS has explained that this deadline is necessary to allow the Agency sufficient time to analyze the data and determine each state's entitlement to incentive payments. <i>See</i> Child Support Enforcement Program; Incentive Payments, Audit Penalties, 65 Fed.Reg. 82,178, 82,184 (Dec. 27, 2000) (explaining, in preamble to final rule, that \"[a] cut-off point [of December 31st] is necessary for us to make the required performance determinations and calculations on a timely basis\"). That is, because incentive payments are allocated to each state as a percentage of a common pool of funds based on relative performance, 42 U.S.C. § 658a(b), the Agency cannot reasonably accommodate late submissions without delaying incentive payments to every eligible state. Puerto Rico has not identified any evidence in the record that calls the Agency's explanation into question, nor has it offered any plausible interpretation of its own. Under these circumstances, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*746</span> Agency's decision to read its regulations as written was not plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Puerto Rico argues that HHS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it rejected the timely, but uncorrected, FY 2001 data covering the eighteenth-month period from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001. Because the regulations provide that, in certain limited circumstances, the Secretary may excuse noncompliance with Title IV-D reporting requirements, Puerto Rico argues that the Agency's decision to reject Puerto Rico's FY 2001 PEP data was an abuse of discretion. The regulation on which Puerto Rico relies provides that the Secretary may disregard a state's failure to submit complete and reliable data, and forgo the assessment of a penalty,</p>\n<blockquote>if the Secretary determines that the incompleteness or unreliability of the data, or the noncompliance with one or more of the IV-D requirements, is of a technical nature which does not adversely affect the performance of the State's IV-D program or does not adversely affect the determination of the level of the State's paternity establishment or other performance measures percentages.</blockquote>\n<p>45 C.F.R. § 305.62. We agree with HHS that Puerto Rico's failure to comply with the FY 2001 PEP reporting requirements was not of a \"technical nature\" and, therefore, the Secretary had no discretion to accept Puerto Rico's submission. As the DAB reasonably found, any calculations based on eighteen months of dataas opposed to the proper twelve month period would have skewed Puerto Rico's PEP rate upward for FY 2001 and thus would have \"adversely affect[ed] the determination of the level of the State's paternity establishment.\" Under these circumstances, the Agency did not abuse its discretion when it rejected Puerto Rico's timely FY 2001 data due to the deficiencies identified above, or assessed a penalty based, in part, on that reporting failure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Notice</h2>\n<p>Next, Puerto Rico argues that the district court erred in concluding that HHS provided adequate notice of its assessment of the TANF penalty. It contends that HHS's interpretation of the applicable regulation does not give the state an opportunity to cure the deficiency, and is arbitrary and capricious because it frustrates Congress's intent to give states the chance to take corrective action and avoid the penalty. Puerto Rico emphasizes that it received notice of the penalty on November 14, 2003thirteen months after the end of FY 2002 and, it asserts, too late to take corrective action.</p>\n<p>HHS regulations provide that \"[i]f a State is found by the Secretary to be subject to a penalty,\" then it must \"notify the State in writing of such finding.\" 45 C.F.R. § 305.66(a). The notice must:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) Explain the deficiency or deficiencies which result in the State being subject to a penalty, indicate the amount of the potential penalty, and give reasons for the finding; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Specify that the penalty will be assessed in accordance with the provisions of 45 C.F.R. 262.1(b) through (e) and 262.7 if the State is found to have failed to correct the deficiency or deficiencies cited in the notice during the automatic corrective action year (i.e., the succeeding fiscal year following the year with respect to which the deficiency occurred.)</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 305.66(b). HHS has consistently interpreted § 305.66 to require written notice of a penalty only <i>after</i> a state has \"failed to correct the deficiency or deficiencies... during the automatic corrective action year\" and has been \"found by the Secretary to be subject to a penalty.\" <i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*747</span> <i>Ala. Dep't of Human Res. v. United States HHS,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d 85, 89 (D.D.C.2007); <i>Nevada,</i> No. 3:05-cv-00677, slip op. at 11.</p>\n<p>By its plain terms, § 305.66(a) does not require HHS to give advance notice of its intent to assess a penalty in order to permit the state to take corrective action. Rather, the regulations contemplate that the Agency will notify the state \"if\" it determines that the state \"is ... subject to a penalty.\" 45 C.F.R. § 305.66(a). Thus, HHS was required to inform Puerto Rico of its intent to impose a penalty only <i>after</i> it determined that consecutive reporting and/or performance failures had occurred.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico contends that this interpretation deprives states of the opportunity to correct a deficiency before the assessment of a penalty. However, a state is not subject to a penalty until there have been performance and/or reporting deficiencies for two consecutive fiscal years. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 609(a)(8)(A); 45 C.F.R. § 305.61. States have an opportunity to cure deficiencies, and thus avoid a penalty, during the \"corrective action year\" which \"automatic[ally]\" follows the fiscal year in which the initial deficiency is found. 45 C.F.R. § 305.66(b)(2); <i>see also</i> 45 C.F.R. § 305.61 (providing that HHS may only impose penalty if, \"[w]ith respect to the immediately succeeding fiscal year, the State failed to take sufficient corrective action to achieve the appropriate performance levels or compliance or the data submitted by the State are still incomplete and unreliable\"); <i>Ala. Dep't of Human Res.,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 89 (\"[A] state is not subject to a penalty until after the end of the corrective action year which follows immediately and automatically upon a year of noncompliance. Therefore, a penalty cannot be assessed and notice is not required, until after the end of, not prior to, the corrective action year.\").</p>\n<p>In this case, Puerto Rico was on notice that it could be subject to a penalty for FY 2002 PEP deficiencies by at least March 20, 2002, when HHS formally rejected the corrected FY 2001 PEP data. Accordingly, we reject the contention that the Agency's interpretation of the § 305.66 notice provision is unreasonable because it prevents states from taking corrective action to avoid the imposition of a penalty.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Puerto Rico also claims that the Agency's interpretation should be set aside because it has not been provided with an opportunity to propose and implement a corrective compliance plan, a procedure available to states before HHS imposes a penalty under other TANF provisions not at issue in this appeal. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 609(c). However, as Puerto Rico acknowledges, the statute on which it relies for this contention expressly provides that the opportunity to propose and implement such corrective compliance plans \"shall not apply\" to a penalty, like that at issue here, assessed for PEP deficiencies pursuant to § 609(a)(8). <i>Id.</i> § 609(c)(4).</p>\n<p>Finally, Puerto Rico asserts, without developed argument, that \"horn book\" law and principles of due process prevent the imposition of a penalty without adequate prior notice. We deem these arguments waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>Thus, we conclude that the Agency's interpretation of the notice provision is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*748</span> reasonable, and entitled to deference. <i>See </i><i>Thomas Jefferson Univ.,</i> 512 U.S. at 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Puerto Rico is treated as a state for purposes of the TANF program, 42 U.S.C. § 619(5), and Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, <i>id.</i> § 1301(a)(1).</p>\n<p>[2]  To assess the completeness, reliability, and security of the data submitted by the states and the accuracy of the reporting systems used in calculating the five performance indicators, the Secretary is obligated to conduct audits of this data at least once every three years. 42 U.S.C. § 652(a)(4)(C)(i).</p>\n<p>[3]  The PEP measures a state's success at establishing the paternity of children born out-of-wedlock. 42 U.S.C. § 652(g).

Puerto Rico brought this action to challenge the Agency's assessment of a financial penalty against certain federal grant money used to fund Puerto Rico's child support enforcement programs, after HHS determined that Puerto Rico had failed to satisfy data reporting requirements, or meet performance benchmarks, in consecutive fiscal years.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico contends that HHS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it refused to accept data submitted 45 days after the regulatory deadline, and failed to provide adequate notice of its intent to assess the penalty. It asserts that both of these actions were predicated on the Agency's unreasonable reading of applicable regulations. The district court rejected these contentions, concluding that the Agency's interpretation of its regulations was reasonable and entitled to deference. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Statutory and Regulatory Framework</h2>\n<p>Puerto Rico participates in the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, program, which is administered by HHS pursuant to Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 601-619. The TANF program provides block grants, also known as State Family Assistance Grants, to eligible states. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 603(a)(1).<sup>[1]</sup> A central purpose of these grants is to lend a hand to states which \"provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own home or in the homes of relatives.\" <i>Id.</i> § 601. Eligibility for TANF grants is predicated on the state's operation of child support enforcement programsthat is, programs designed to locate non-custodial parents, establish paternity, and obtain child and spousal supportin accordance with Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. §§ 651-669b; <i>see also</i> 42 U.S.C. § 602(a)(2).</p>\n<p>Title IV-D enforces strict performance standards and reporting requirements on states as a condition of funding. Under this regime, states may qualify for incentive payments based on the relative effectiveness of their performance in five areas: paternity establishment, child support order establishment, current collections, average collections, and cost effectiveness. 42 U.S.C. § 658a(b)(6); 45 C.F.R. § 305.2. Each fiscal year, eligible states must submit \"complete and reliable\" data to demonstrate their performance in each of these areas. 42 U.S.C. § 658a(b)(5)(B); <i>see also id.</i> § 652(g)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 305.1(i) &amp; (j). Data is considered \"reliable\" if it meets a 95% standard of reliability as determined by the Secretary of HHS, 45 C.F.R. § 305.1(i), and \"complete\" if it includes all reporting elements necessary to compute performance levels and is submitted within the proper timeframe, <i>id.</i> § 305.1(j).<sup>[2]</sup> HHS regulations set the deadline for submitting this data as the December 31st following the end of each fiscal year, <i>i.e.,</i> the end of the first quarter following the conclusion of the fiscal year. <i>See</i> 45 C.F.R. § 305.32(f).</p>\n<p>Based on this data, HHS calculates the amount of each state's incentive payments. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*743</span> 42 U.S.C. § 658a(b). If the Secretary determines that the data submitted by the state is reliable and complete, he will determine how the state performed with respect to each of the five performance measures as compared to other eligible states; incentive payments are then allocated to each state as a share of a fixed \"[i]ncentive payment pool\" set aside by Congress for each fiscal year. <i>Id.</i> However, if the Secretary determines that the state has submitted unreliable or incomplete data for any particular performance indicator, or has failed to satisfy applicable performance benchmarks, the state will not receive an incentive payment for that indicator for that financial year. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>States are also subject to penalties based on their year-to-year performance in three of these areas: paternity establishment, support order establishment, and current collections. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 609. When in a given fiscal year a state fails to either submit complete and reliable data or satisfy substantive performance measures, the next fiscal year automatically becomes a \"corrective action year\" in which the state is required to improve its performance or face penalties. <i>Id.</i> § 609(a)(8)(A); 45 C.F.R. §§ 305.40, 305.61(a)-(b). That is, when a state in consecutive fiscal years fails either the data reporting requirement and/or the substantive performance requirement (including a reporting failure in one year and a performance failure in the other), it is subject to a penalty under the TANF program.</p>\n<p>As is relevant here, states must establish a 90% \"paternity establishment percentage,\" or PEP, for each year in order to qualify for an incentive payment for that performance indicator.<sup>[3]</sup> 42 U.S.C. § 652(g)(1)(A). If a state's PEP falls below this 90% threshold, however, it may still satisfy this performance requirement by demonstrating a certain level of improvement over the previous fiscal year's PEP. <i>Id.</i> § 652(g)(1)(B)-(F); 45 C.F.R. § 305.40(a)(1). When a state fails to satisfy the PEP performance and/or reporting criteria in two consecutive years, it is subject to a penalty. The penalty assessed is a certain percentage of the TANF grant; the first failure is penalized by a 1-2% reduction, but subsequent failures may be penalized by as much as 5%. 42 U.S.C. § 609(a)(8)(B); 45 C.F.R. § 305.61(c). When a penalty is imposed, a state must expend its own funds to make up the difference. 45 C.F.R. § 262.1(e)(1).</p>\n<p>HHS is required to \"notify the State in writing\" when it determines that a state is subject to a penalty. 45 C.F.R. §§ 262.7, 305.66. The notice must inform the state of the deficiency which is the basis for the penalty, as well as the reasons for, and amount of, the penalty assessed. 45 C.F.R. § 305.66(b). The penalty is imposed in the fiscal year following the Agency's final decision. 45 C.F.R. § 262.1(c)(2). States may appeal to the HHS Departmental Appeals Board (\"DAB\") within sixty days of receipt of such notice. 42 U.S.C. § 610(b); 45 C.F.R. §§ 262.7, 305.66.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Facts and Proceedings Below</h2>\n<p>The basic facts are not in dispute. On February 7, 2002, HHS notified Puerto Rico that its auditors had determined that Puerto Rico's fiscal year (\"FY\") 2001 PEP data was deficient. As HHS explained, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*744</span> Puerto Rico had submitted PEP data covering its performance over an eighteen-month period from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001, rather than the proper twelve-month period from August 1, 2000 to July 31, 2001. Thus, HHS determined that Puerto Rico's FY 2001 PEP data was not accurate because it included data prior to the reporting period, and was incomplete because it was missing data for July 2001.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Puerto Rico attempted to submit corrected data on February 14, 2002. However, in a letter dated March 20, 2002, HHS informed Puerto Rico that it would not accept the corrected PEP data for purposes of calculating incentive payments because the December 31, 2001 deadline set forth in 45 C.F.R § 305.32(f) had passed. HHS explained that a \"cut-off point is necessary for us to make the required performance determinations and calculations on a timely basis\" because \"payments of incentives cannot be made to any state until the entire process has been completed for <i>all</i> states in a given fiscal year.\" Puerto Rico thus received no PEP incentive payment for FY 2001. However, because FY 2001 data was used both to compute incentive payments for FY 2001 <i>and</i> to qualify for FY 2002 incentives based on improved performance, HHS indicated that it would accept the corrected PEP data covering FY 2001 for the limited purpose of determining whether Puerto Rico \"qualif[ied] for incentives on the basis of improved performance in FY 2002.\" The corrected FY 2001 data showed a PEP of 92%.</p>\n<p>For FY 2002, Puerto Rico submitted data which showed a PEP of 88%. This PEP fell below the minimum threshold of 90% and did not demonstrate an improvement over the previous fiscal year's PEP of 92%. Thus, Puerto Rico had failed for two consecutive years to submit reliable PEP data (FY 2001) or meet substantive PEP performance targets (FY 2002). Accordingly, HHS notified Puerto Rico on November 14, 2003 that it would be penalized by 1% on its FY 2003 TANF grant. HHS ultimately assessed a penalty of $582,365.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico appealed this decision to the DAB and argued that the Agency had erred both by failing to accept its corrected data in February 2002, and by notifying Puerto Rico in an untimely fashion of its penalty. Puerto Rico claimed that each of these actions was based on an unreasonable interpretation of applicable regulations. The DAB rejected both contentions and upheld the penalty. Puerto Rico then filed this APA action in the district court challenging the Agency's final decision. The district court, adopting a magistrate judge's recommendation, agreed with the DAB and granted summary judgment in favor of HHS. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review grants of summary judgment <i>de novo.</i> However, in an APA action, \"`judicial review, even at the summary judgment stage, is narrow.'\" <i>Visiting Nurse Ass'n Gregoria Auffant, Inc. v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202197\"><a href=\"/opinion/202197/visiting-nurse-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v.

Under the familiar APA standard, we may \"only set aside agency actions, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*745</span> findings, and conclusions if they are `arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)). \"[W]here Congress has entrusted rulemaking and administrative authority to an agency, courts normally accord the agency particular deference in respect to the interpretation of regulations promulgated under that authority.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>South Shore Hosp., Inc. v. Thompson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></span>, 97 (1st Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Late Submission of Performance Data</h2>\n<p>Puerto Rico first argues that HHS's decision not to accept the revised FY 2001 data submitted on February 14, 2002 was arbitrary and capricious. Puerto Rico asserts that because the data was submitted \"only\" forty-five days late, HHS had sufficient time to consider the corrected data, which would have shown a PEP of 92% and thus no FY 2001 deficiency. Accordingly, Puerto Rico contends that HHS had \"no logical or reasonable explanation\" for failing to accept the FY 2001 data for purposes of determining whether reliable and complete information had been submitted for FY 2001.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We hold that HHS's decision not to accept and consider Puerto Rico's untimely PEP data to determine its FY 2001 performance for incentive purposes was neither arbitrary nor capricious. An agency's interpretation of its regulations is entitled to \"substantial deference,\" and must be given controlling weight unless it is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" <i>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117865\"><a href=\"/opinion/117865/thomas-jefferson-univ-v-shalala/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 512, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117865\"><a href=\"/opinion/117865/thomas-jefferson-univ-v-shalala/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span> (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, as Puerto Rico acknowledges, the regulation at issue unambiguously required Puerto Rico to submit the FY 2001 PEP data by December 31, 2001. 45 C.F.R. § 305.32(f). The regulation further made it clear that only data submitted by that date would be considered by HHS for purposes of determining completeness and reliability. <i>Id.</i> HHS has explained that this deadline is necessary to allow the Agency sufficient time to analyze the data and determine each state's entitlement to incentive payments. <i>See</i> Child Support Enforcement Program; Incentive Payments, Audit Penalties, 65 Fed.Reg. 82,178, 82,184 (Dec. 27, 2000) (explaining, in preamble to final rule, that \"[a] cut-off point [of December 31st] is necessary for us to make the required performance determinations and calculations on a timely basis\"). That is, because incentive payments are allocated to each state as a percentage of a common pool of funds based on relative performance, 42 U.S.C. § 658a(b), the Agency cannot reasonably accommodate late submissions without delaying incentive payments to every eligible state. Puerto Rico has not identified any evidence in the record that calls the Agency's explanation into question, nor has it offered any plausible interpretation of its own. Under these circumstances, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*746</span> Agency's decision to read its regulations as written was not plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Puerto Rico argues that HHS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it rejected the timely, but uncorrected, FY 2001 data covering the eighteenth-month period from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001. Because the regulations provide that, in certain limited circumstances, the Secretary may excuse noncompliance with Title IV-D reporting requirements, Puerto Rico argues that the Agency's decision to reject Puerto Rico's FY 2001 PEP data was an abuse of discretion. The regulation on which Puerto Rico relies provides that the Secretary may disregard a state's failure to submit complete and reliable data, and forgo the assessment of a penalty,</p>\n<blockquote>if the Secretary determines that the incompleteness or unreliability of the data, or the noncompliance with one or more of the IV-D requirements, is of a technical nature which does not adversely affect the performance of the State's IV-D program or does not adversely affect the determination of the level of the State's paternity establishment or other performance measures percentages.</blockquote>\n<p>45 C.F.R. § 305.62. We agree with HHS that Puerto Rico's failure to comply with the FY 2001 PEP reporting requirements was not of a \"technical nature\" and, therefore, the Secretary had no discretion to accept Puerto Rico's submission. As the DAB reasonably found, any calculations based on eighteen months of dataas opposed to the proper twelve month period would have skewed Puerto Rico's PEP rate upward for FY 2001 and thus would have \"adversely affect[ed] the determination of the level of the State's paternity establishment.\" Under these circumstances, the Agency did not abuse its discretion when it rejected Puerto Rico's timely FY 2001 data due to the deficiencies identified above, or assessed a penalty based, in part, on that reporting failure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Notice</h2>\n<p>Next, Puerto Rico argues that the district court erred in concluding that HHS provided adequate notice of its assessment of the TANF penalty. It contends that HHS's interpretation of the applicable regulation does not give the state an opportunity to cure the deficiency, and is arbitrary and capricious because it frustrates Congress's intent to give states the chance to take corrective action and avoid the penalty. Puerto Rico emphasizes that it received notice of the penalty on November 14, 2003thirteen months after the end of FY 2002 and, it asserts, too late to take corrective action.</p>\n<p>HHS regulations provide that \"[i]f a State is found by the Secretary to be subject to a penalty,\" then it must \"notify the State in writing of such finding.\" 45 C.F.R. § 305.66(a). The notice must:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) Explain the deficiency or deficiencies which result in the State being subject to a penalty, indicate the amount of the potential penalty, and give reasons for the finding; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Specify that the penalty will be assessed in accordance with the provisions of 45 C.F.R. 262.1(b) through (e) and 262.7 if the State is found to have failed to correct the deficiency or deficiencies cited in the notice during the automatic corrective action year (i.e., the succeeding fiscal year following the year with respect to which the deficiency occurred.)</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 305.66(b). HHS has consistently interpreted § 305.66 to require written notice of a penalty only <i>after</i> a state has \"failed to correct the deficiency or deficiencies... during the automatic corrective action year\" and has been \"found by the Secretary to be subject to a penalty.\" <i>See</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*747</span> <i>Ala. Dep't of Human Res. v. United States HHS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575241\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575241/state-of-ala-dept-of-human-v-us-dept-hhs/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 89 (D.D.C.2007); <i>Nevada,</i> No. 3:05-cv-00677, slip op. at 11.</p>\n<p>By its plain terms, § 305.66(a) does not require HHS to give advance notice of its intent to assess a penalty in order to permit the state to take corrective action. Rather, the regulations contemplate that the Agency will notify the state \"if\" it determines that the state \"is ... subject to a penalty.\" 45 C.F.R. § 305.66(a). Thus, HHS was required to inform Puerto Rico of its intent to impose a penalty only <i>after</i> it determined that consecutive reporting and/or performance failures had occurred.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico contends that this interpretation deprives states of the opportunity to correct a deficiency before the assessment of a penalty. However, a state is not subject to a penalty until there have been performance and/or reporting deficiencies for two consecutive fiscal years. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 609(a)(8)(A); 45 C.F.R. § 305.61. States have an opportunity to cure deficiencies, and thus avoid a penalty, during the \"corrective action year\" which \"automatic[ally]\" follows the fiscal year in which the initial deficiency is found. 45 C.F.R. § 305.66(b)(2); <i>see also</i> 45 C.F.R. § 305.61 (providing that HHS may only impose penalty if, \"[w]ith respect to the immediately succeeding fiscal year, the State failed to take sufficient corrective action to achieve the appropriate performance levels or compliance or the data submitted by the State are still incomplete and unreliable\"); <i>Ala. Dep't of Human Res.,</i> 478 F.Supp.2d at 89 (\"[A] state is not subject to a penalty until after the end of the corrective action year which follows immediately and automatically upon a year of noncompliance. Therefore, a penalty cannot be assessed and notice is not required, until after the end of, not prior to, the corrective action year.\").</p>\n<p>In this case, Puerto Rico was on notice that it could be subject to a penalty for FY 2002 PEP deficiencies by at least March 20, 2002, when HHS formally rejected the corrected FY 2001 PEP data. Accordingly, we reject the contention that the Agency's interpretation of the § 305.66 notice provision is unreasonable because it prevents states from taking corrective action to avoid the imposition of a penalty.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Puerto Rico also claims that the Agency's interpretation should be set aside because it has not been provided with an opportunity to propose and implement a corrective compliance plan, a procedure available to states before HHS imposes a penalty under other TANF provisions not at issue in this appeal. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 609(c). However, as Puerto Rico acknowledges, the statute on which it relies for this contention expressly provides that the opportunity to propose and implement such corrective compliance plans \"shall not apply\" to a penalty, like that at issue here, assessed for PEP deficiencies pursuant to § 609(a)(8). <i>Id.</i> § 609(c)(4).</p>\n<p>Finally, Puerto Rico asserts, without developed argument, that \"horn book\" law and principles of due process prevent the imposition of a penalty without adequate prior notice. We deem these arguments waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

A state may calculate its PEP according to either (1) the percentage of children born out of wedlock statewide for whom paternity is established, or (2) the percentage of children participating in state child support programs for whom paternity is established. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. § 652(g)(2); 45 C.F.R. § 305.2.</p>\n<p>[4]  HHS permits states to use a reporting period other than the federal fiscal year, provided \"like\" data are used and compared from year-to-year. For FY 2000, Puerto Rico submitted data for the twelve-month period from August 1, 1999 through July 31, 2000. Accordingly, Puerto Rico was required for FY 2001 to submit data from August 1, 2000 through July 31, 2001.</p>\n<p>[5]  Puerto Rico also argues that HHS has been inconsistent in the application of its guidelines because it has in other cases accepted modified data past the regulatory deadline. However, Puerto Rico has identified no instance in which HHS has accepted untimely data to determine the <i>prior</i> fiscal year's performance for incentive payment purposes. Rather, Puerto Rico cites to one case in which HHS requested a state to submit corrected data past the regulatory deadline for the purpose of measuring the <i>next</i> year's incentives based on improved performance, as it also did here. <i>See Nevada v. Department of Health and Human Servs.,</i> No. 3:05-cv-00677 (D.Nev. Dec. 28, 2006) (slip op., appended to Appellee's brief). Accordingly, we reject Puerto Rico's contention that there is an inconsistency in need of explanation.</p>\n<p>[6]  Indeed, the preamble to § 305.66 emphasizes that\n</p>\n<p>the State should not wait or rely upon the Secretary's determination of a data or a performance deficiency in order to begin corrective action. Two consecutive years of failure (either poor data or poor performance) in the same performance measure criterion will trigger a penalty imposition.</p>\n<p>Child Support Enforcement Program; Incentive Payments, Audit Penalties, 65 Fed.Reg. at 82,192.</p>\n\n</div>",
