Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Eduardo A Vera Ramírez, with whom Eileen Landrón Guardiola and\nLandrón & Vera, L.L.P., were on brief, for appellant.\n     Nydia María Díaz-Buxó for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 19, 2003\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.       By means of this interlocutory\n\nappeal, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico attempts to exploit the\n\nSupreme Court's recent redefinition of the calculus of federalism.\n\nSee, e.g., Rosie D. v. Swift, 310 F.3d 230, 231 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(noting that the Court has \"tilt[ed] the scales more and more\n\ntoward states' rights\").     The Commonwealth's core contention is\n\nthat the 1991 Civil Rights Act fails validly to abrogate the\n\nStates' Eleventh Amendment immunity insofar as the Act authorizes\n\nthe imposition of compensatory damages in Title VII actions against\n\nthe States (and against Puerto Rico, which is considered the\n\nfunctional equivalent of a State for Eleventh Amendment purposes).\n\nThis raises an interesting question but, as presently postured, one\n\nthat falls beyond our purview.\n\n            The stumbling block is the time-tested precept that \"[n]o\n\nmatter how tantalizing a problem may be, a federal appellate court\n\ncannot scratch intellectual itches unless it has jurisdiction to\n\nreach them.\"   Director, OWCP v. Bath Iron Works Corp., 853 F.2d 11,\n\n13   (1st   Cir.   1988).   In   this    instance,   the   Commonwealth's\n\ninterlocutory appeal rests not on a denial of an asserted immunity\n\nfrom suit, but, rather, on a denial of an asserted immunity from\n\nthe imposition of a certain type of money damages. So constructed,\n\nthe appeal does not satisfy the requirements of the collateral\n\norder doctrine, and, thus, does not come within the encincture of\n\nour appellate jurisdiction.       We therefore dismiss the appeal,\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fleaving the substantive issue raised by the Commonwealth to await\n\nend-of-case review.\n\n                                      I.\n\n                               Setting the Stage\n\n           We    glean   the    necessary    facts   from      the   plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint.      See LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d\n\n507, 508 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           The Commonwealth hired plaintiff-appellee Tomás Aquino\n\nEspinal-Domínguez, a native of the Dominican Republic, on September\n\n7, 1988.     He worked in various capacities for the Department of\n\nNatural Resources (the Department) during the next fifteen years.\n\nAt that point, he was unceremoniously ousted from his employment.\n\n           The plaintiff concluded that his firing resulted from\n\nnational     origin   discrimination        and   filed   an    administrative\n\ncomplaint to that effect with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission (EEOC).       The EEOC declined to pursue a full-dress\n\ninvestigation, instead issuing a right to sue letter.                 Letter in\n\nhand, the plaintiff repaired to the federal district court and sued\n\nthe Commonwealth under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17.\n\nHis complaint alleged that he had been discharged on the basis of\n\nhis national origin, see id. § 2000e-2(a)(1), and prayed for\n\nreinstatement, back pay, marginal benefits, compensatory damages,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fand \"any other remedy in law or equity\" that might be available\n\nagainst the Commonwealth.1\n\n          The Title VII claim brought the plaintiff face to face\n\nwith the Eleventh Amendment, which provides that \"[t]he Judicial\n\npower of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any\n\nsuit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the\n\nUnited States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or\n\nSubjects of any Foreign State.\"         U.S. Const. amend. XI.   This\n\nprovision has been authoritatively interpreted to safeguard States\n\nfrom suits brought in federal court by their own citizens as well\n\nas by citizens of other States.    See, e.g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415\n\nU.S. 651, 662-63 (1974); Rosie D., 310 F.3d at 233 n.2.          This\n\nimmunity can, however, be waived or abrogated by Congress under\n\ncertain limited circumstances.      See College Sav. Bank v. Fla.\n\nPrepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 670 (1999);\n\nRamirez v. P.R. Fire Serv., 715 F.2d 694, 697 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n          Despite its unique commonwealth status, Puerto Rico is\n\ntreated for many juridical purposes as a State.         The Eleventh\n\n\n\n     1\n      Two features of the plaintiff's complaint deserve special\nmention. First, only the Commonwealth is prosecuting this appeal;\nthus, we omit any further reference to the Department and the\nseveral departmental officials who are named as additional\ndefendants. Second, the complaint at one point cites 42 U.S.C. §\n2000e(j), a definitional provision that deals with discrimination\non the basis of religion. Since the body of the complaint contains\nno facts alluding either to the plaintiff's religion or to any\nfailure to accommodate the plaintiff's religious practices, we\nassume that the citation is in error.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fAmendment is included in this compendium and, thus, Puerto Rico is\n\nentitled to a full measure of Eleventh Amendment immunity.          See,\n\ne.g., Jusino Mercado v. Comm. of Puerto Rico, 214 F.3d 34, 37 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n          Hoisting this banner, the Commonwealth moved to dismiss\n\nthe plaintiff's complaint on the ground that the Eleventh Amendment\n\npretermitted   it   (at   least   in    part).    To   comprehend   the\n\nCommonwealth's position, it is helpful to place Title VII into an\n\nhistorical perspective.\n\n          Congress originally enacted Title VII as part of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964.    Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 253\n\n(1964).   In 1972, it amended the law to include public employers,\n\nthus clearing the way for the prosecution of private rights of\n\naction against States that practiced discrimination.        See Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Act of 1972, Pub. L. No. 92-261, 86 Stat.\n\n103, 103 (1972).    This new right afforded only a limited set of\n\nremedies against a state defendant, mainly equitable in nature.\n\nCongress expanded the roster of remedies available against the\n\nStates in 1991, adding compensatory damages to the mix.      See Civil\n\nRights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, 1072\n\n(1991) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(1)).\n\n          In this proceeding, the Commonwealth, with a bow toward\n\nthe Supreme Court's decision in        Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S.\n\n445, 456 (1976), concedes that Title VII, in its 1972 incarnation,\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fconstituted a valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity.                  See\n\nAppellant's Br. at 10-11.          In line with this concession, it has\n\nnot, insofar as can be gleaned from its papers, attempted to\n\ncircumnavigate federal jurisdiction as to the remedies that were\n\nauthorized    when     Fitzpatrick    was     decided   (i.e.,    the   remedies\n\noriginally provided by the 1972 amendments to Title VII).                 These\n\nremedies included pecuniary damages, albeit in the form of back pay\n\nawards.   See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(5)(g)(1); see also Fitzpatrick, 427\n\nU.S. at 452-56 (holding that a back pay award is appropriate in a\n\nTitle VII case because Congress had the power to abrogate state\n\nsovereign immunity under section five of the Fourteenth Amendment);\n\nSea Land Serv. Inc. v. Estado Libre Asociado, 588 F.2d 312, 313 n.3\n\n(1st Cir. 1978) (discussing Fitzpatrick).\n\n             This    concession    perforce    means    that   the   plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint has opened the Eleventh Amendment portal at least part-\n\nway.   The Commonwealth, however, seeks to keep the gates from\n\nopening   more      widely.   To    that    end,   it   directs   its   Eleventh\n\nAmendment challenge to the availability of the nascent compensatory\n\ndamages remedy.       It grounds this challenge on the premise that the\n\n1991 Civil Rights Act, which made that anodyne available against\n\nthe States for the first time, fails to pass the congruence and\n\nproportionality test delineated by the Supreme Court's recent\n\nEleventh Amendment jurisprudence.             See, e.g., City of Boerne v.\n\nFlores, 521 U.S. 507, 519-20 (1997) (holding that legislation\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fpassed pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment must\n\nexhibit \"congruence and proportionality between the injury to be\n\nprevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end\").              All\n\nlegislation enacted pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment must pass this test in order validly to abrogate States'\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity.     Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v.\n\nGarrett, 531 U.S. 356, 364 (2001).\n\n           Invoking this doctrine and noting that Congress relied\n\nupon section five in authorizing private rights of action against\n\nstate defendants, the Commonwealth asserts that Congress acted\n\noutside its constitutional authority in purporting to abrogate\n\nstate sovereign immunity when it amended Title VII in 1991 (and\n\nthat, therefore, the Eleventh Amendment continues to protect the\n\nCommonwealth from being forced to pay compensatory damages in Title\n\nVII actions).   Unimpressed by the ingenuity of this assertion, the\n\ndistrict   court   summarily   denied   the   Commonwealth's   motion    to\n\ndismiss.   This appeal ensued.\n\n                                  II.\n\n                        Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n           Even though the parties have assumed the existence of\n\nappellate jurisdiction, we enjoy no comparable luxury.           Because\n\nfederal courts are powerless to act in the absence of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction, we have an unflagging obligation to notice\n\njurisdictional defects and to pursue them on our own initiative.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fSee Ins. Corp. of Ir. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S.\n\n694, 702 (1982); United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 767 (1st Cir.\n\n1994); In re Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d 1000, 1002 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).      After    all,    litigants      cannot   confer     subject    matter\n\njurisdiction    on    a     federal    court    by   \"indolence,     oversight,\n\nacquiescence, or consent.\"        Horn, 29 F.3d at 768.\n\n            The difficulty here is that the order appealed from — the\n\norder denying the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss — does not end\n\nthe case.    It is, therefore, not \"final.\"             That matters because\n\nfederal appellate jurisdiction in most civil actions arises out of\n\nthe power to review \"final decisions of the district courts of the\n\nUnited   States.\"      28    U.S.C.    §   1291.     Although    this     finality\n\nprinciple admits of certain exceptions, the majority of them are\n\nstatutory in origin. See, e.g., id. § 1292(a)(1)-(3) (establishing\n\nspecial rules for jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals from\n\norders   involving        injunctive       relief,   admiralty     cases,     and\n\nreceivership matters).        None of these statutory exceptions applies\n\nhere.\n\n            To be sure, the Supreme Court has glossed the finality\n\nprinciple, admonishing that the general requirement of finality\n\nshould not be applied mechanically. See Cohen v. Beneficial Indus.\n\nLoan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949) (suggesting that courts should\n\ngive the finality principle a \"practical rather than a technical\n\nconstruction\").      This pragmatic approach has spawned a few judge-\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fmade exceptions to the general rule.      Chief among these is the so-\n\ncalled collateral order doctrine.        Because that doctrine affords\n\nthe only arguable basis for appellate jurisdiction over this\n\nappeal, we chart its contours.\n\n           Any effort to decipher the collateral order doctrine must\n\nbegin with the Supreme Court's seminal opinion in Cohen.         There,\n\nthe Court held that an order may be appealed immediately if it\n\n\"finally   determine[s]   claims    of   right   separable   from,   and\n\ncollateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be\n\ndenied review and too independent of the cause itself to require\n\nthat appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is\n\nadjudicated.\"   Id. at 546.   Following the Cohen Court's lead, we\n\nhave said that collaterality demands conformity to the following\n\nfour requirements:\n\n           The order must involve:        (1) an issue\n           essentially unrelated to the merits of the\n           main dispute, capable of review without\n           disrupting the main trial; (2) a complete\n           resolution of the issue, not one that is\n           \"unfinished\" or \"inconclusive\"; (3) a right\n           incapable of vindication on appeal from final\n           judgment; and (4) an important and unsettled\n           question of controlling law, not merely a\n           question of the proper exercise of the trial\n           court's discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Sorren, 605 F.2d 1211, 1213 (1st Cir. 1979).\n\nTypically, all four of these prerequisites — which we have termed\n\n\"separability, finality, urgency, and importance,\" Recticel Foam,\n\n859 F.2d at 1004 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) —\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fmust be satisfied in order to pave the way for the operation of the\n\ncollateral order doctrine.          See id. at 1003-04.\n\n           A    decade     ago,   the     Supreme   Court     ruled   that   an\n\ninterlocutory order denying a State's claim of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity from suit may be appealed immediately by way of the\n\ncollateral order doctrine.        P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf\n\n& Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 141 (1993).          The State's claim that the\n\nEleventh Amendment conferred upon it a total immunity from suit\n\nfurnished the predicate for the Court's finding that the elements\n\nof the collateral order doctrine were present.                See id. at 144.\n\nThe Court reasoned as follows.            A trial court's denial of such an\n\nimmunity claim is final because it conclusively determines that the\n\nState can be subjected to the coercive processes of the federal\n\ncourts.   See id. at 145.           It is urgent because the principal\n\nbenefit conferred by the Eleventh Amendment — an immunity from suit\n\n— will be \"lost as litigation proceeds past motion practice.\"                Id.\n\nThird, the trial court's order involves an important legal question\n\n(the   existence    and    extent    of    a   \"fundamental    constitutional\n\nprotection\").      Id.    And, finally, that question has no bearing on\n\nthe substantive merits of the case (and, thus, is separable).                Id.\n\n           Here, the parties' assumption that we enjoy appellate\n\njurisdiction apparently rests on the belief that Puerto Rico\n\nAqueduct is controlling.          We are less sanguine.           The precise\n\nquestion before the Puerto Rico Aqueduct Court was \"whether a\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fdistrict court order denying a claim by a State or a state entity\n\nto Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court may be\n\nappealed    under   the   collateral   order   doctrine.\"   Id.   at   141\n\n(emphasis supplied).        The Court's affirmative answer to that\n\nquestion gives us appellate jurisdiction to decide — even in the\n\nabsence of a final judgment — whether a State is amenable to suit\n\nin a federal court with respect to a Title VII claim.        See, e.g.,\n\nid.; Okruhlik v. Univ. of Ark., 255 F.3d 615, 621 (8th Cir. 2001).\n\nBut that issue is not before us.       Here, the Commonwealth does not\n\nassert that it is immune from a Title VII suit in federal court.\n\nIts only developed argument is that it is immune from a particular\n\nstrain of damages (a remedy first made available by Congress in\n\n1991). This fact distinguishes the case before us from Puerto Rico\n\nAqueduct.    See Mercer v. Magnant, 40 F.3d 893, 896 (7th Cir. 1994)\n\n(\"The foundation for the interlocutory appeal authorized by [Puerto\n\nRico Aqueduct] is the existence of a right not to be a litigant.\").\n\nIt follows inexorably that accepting appellate jurisdiction over\n\nthe instant appeal would require an extension of the holding\n\nannounced in Puerto Rico Aqueduct.2\n\n\n     2\n      We recognize that it may be possible to wrench certain\nlanguage in the Puerto Rico Aqueduct opinion from its contextual\nmoorings to promote the proposition that any denial of any species\nof immunity is subject to immediate review. See, e.g., 506 U.S. at\n147 (explaining that States \"may take advantage of the collateral\norder doctrine to appeal a district court order denying a claim of\nEleventh Amendment immunity\").        Because indulging in such\nlinguistic legerdemain would distort the Court's rationale, we\neschew that course.\n\n                                   -11-\n\f           We turn, then, to the task of testing the viability of\n\nsuch an extension.     This requires us to assess the Commonwealth's\n\nactual asseveration (that subjecting it to a claim for compensatory\n\ndamages in a Title VII suit properly brought against it in a\n\nfederal court is barred by the Eleventh Amendment) and to decide,\n\napplying the Cohen criteria, whether a pretrial rejection of that\n\nasseveration is subject to immediate appeal.\n\n           Of the four requirements underpinning the collateral\n\norder doctrine,      urgency    is   perhaps    the     most   elemental.        See\n\nRecticel Foam, 859 F.2d at 1004 (terming urgency the \"central\n\nfocus\"    of   the   Cohen     inquiry    and       perhaps    the    \"dispositive\n\ncriterion\"); Boreri v. Fiat, S.p.A., 763 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1985) (similar).     Here, our inquiry starts — and stops — with this\n\ncriterion.3    We have equated urgency with a showing of irreparable\n\nharm.     See Boreri,    763    F.2d     at   21.      In   this     instance,   the\n\nCommonwealth has wholly failed to show that precluding an immediate\n\nappeal of the district court's order will result in any irreparable\n\nharm.    We explain briefly.\n\n            There is a critical difference between avoiding trial, on\n\nthe one hand, and limiting exposure to liability, on the other\n\nhand. The denial of a colorable claim of immunity from suit cannot\n\neffectively be reviewed after trial as the very object and purpose\n\n\n     3\n      Although not necessary for our conclusion, we note that this\ninterlocutory appeal might well fail the finality prong of the\nCohen test.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fof the immunity is to protect the holder from the indignity of\n\nbeing subjected to the coercive processes of a judicial tribunal at\n\nthe instance of a private party.        See In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443,\n\n505 (1887); see also Pullman Constr. Indus., Inc. v. United States,\n\n23 F.3d 1166, 1168 (7th Cir. 1994) (characterizing the Court's\n\ndecision in Puerto Rico Aqueduct as protecting \"a governmental\n\nbody's right to avoid litigation in another sovereign's courts\").\n\nPut another way, the \"ultimate justification\" for applying the\n\ncollateral   order   doctrine   in    cases   involving   state   sovereign\n\nimmunity \"is the importance of ensuring that the States' dignitary\n\ninterests can be fully vindicated.\"           P.R. Aqueduct, 506 U.S. at\n\n146.\n\n            This concern is not implicated when the State interposes\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment not as the basis for an immunity from suit,\n\nbut, rather, as a defense to one of several remedies sought by a\n\nparticular plaintiff.     See Thomas v. Nakatani, 309 F.3d 1203, 1207\n\n(9th Cir. 2002) (explaining that the crucial difference between\n\nnon-final orders denying immunity that are immediately appealable\n\nand non-final orders that are not is whether \"the action . . .\n\nwould proceed against the state whether or not it prevailed on\n\nappeal\").     That   scenario   reflects      an   interest   which,   unlike\n\nimmunity from suit, is \"fully vindicable on appeal from final\n\njudgment.\"   Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S.\n\n863, 882 (1994).     That is a vastly different matter:        when a State\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fhas filed a pretrial motion invoking the Eleventh Amendment not to\n\nestablish an immunity from suit but merely to afford itself a\n\ndefense to a particular strain of damages, there is no reason to\n\nenswathe a    denial   of   its   motion     within   the    collateral   order\n\ndoctrine.    See Cherry v. Univ. of Wis. Sys. Bd. of Regents, 265\n\nF.3d 541, 547 (7th Cir. 2001) (declining to address claim that\n\nstate   agency   is    immune     from   a   punitive       damages   award   on\n\ninterlocutory appeal because \"[a] claim of immunity to a certain\n\nclass of damages\" is different in kind from a claim of immunity\n\nfrom suit); Burns-Vidlak v. Chandler, 165 F.3d 1257, 1260-61 (9th\n\nCir. 1999) (finding no appellate jurisdiction over State's claim\n\nthat an award of punitive damages for a violation of Title II of\n\nthe ADA is barred by the Eleventh Amendment because the State\n\n\"concedes that it is subject to suit . . . in federal court\").\n\n            Divorced from the question of whether a State can be sued\n\nat all in a federal court, the much narrower question of whether it\n\ncan be held liable for a certain type of pecuniary damages is a\n\nquestion that adequately can be reviewed following trial.                     See\n\nCherry, 265 F.3d at 547 (finding no risk of irretrievable loss and\n\nholding that a denial of a claimed immunity from punitive damages\n\ncan be effectively reviewed after judgment); see generally CSX\n\nTransp., Inc. v. Kissimmee Util. Auth., 153 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th\n\nCir. 1998) (adjudging claims of sovereign immunity under Florida\n\nstate law not subject to interlocutory review because Florida state\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fimmunity is immunity only from damages and not from suit itself);\n\ncf. P.R. Aqueduct, 506 U.S. at 145-46 (suggesting that if the\n\nEleventh      Amendment   conferred     only    a     defense    to   liability,\n\ninterlocutory review might not be warranted).                   In the ordinary\n\ncase, a party who is subjected to an erroneous award of damages can\n\nremedy that error fully through an end-of-case appeal.                    See Swint\n\nv. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 43 (1995) (making clear\n\nthat a potentially \"erroneous ruling on liability may be reviewed\n\neffectively on appeal from final judgment\").\n\n              That tenet is fully operative here.           If the plaintiff's\n\ncase   goes    forward    and   the   Commonwealth     is    found    liable      for\n\ncompensatory damages, it will have an ample opportunity to test the\n\npropriety of that award before it is forced to pay.              Thus, the only\n\nharm that the Commonwealth stands to suffer from the unavailability\n\nof interlocutory review is an inchoate harm stemming from an\n\nerroneous     but   non-final    ruling.       That    is   always    a    risk    in\n\nlitigation — and not the sort of harm that warrants special\n\nsolicitude. After all, \"almost every pretrial or trial order might\n\nbe called 'effectively unreviewable' in the sense that relief from\n\nerror can never extend to rewriting history.\"               Digital Equip., 511\n\nU.S. at 872.\n\n              Indeed, if the harm asserted here were deemed sufficient\n\nto warrant interlocutory review, the Cohen exception would swallow\n\nthe finality principle in a single gulp.              That is a consummation\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fthat ought to be avoided.           The Supreme Court repeatedly has\n\ncautioned that the collateral order doctrine constitutes only a\n\n\"narrow exception\" to the final judgment rule and that it \"should\n\nstay that way.\"      Id. at 868.       There is good reason why the\n\nconditions for interlocutory appeal are stringent. The case at bar\n\nsimply does not satisfy those conditions.\n\n           The Supreme Court's decision in Behrens v. Pelletier, 516\n\nU.S. 299 (1996), does not suggest a contrary result.           There, the\n\nCourt clarified that the collateral order doctrine provides a\n\njurisdictional hook on which to hang an immediate appeal from an\n\norder denying qualified immunity even though the case contains\n\nequitable claims against the \"same\" defendant.          Id. at 311-12.\n\nThat situation is readily distinguishable from the case before us.\n\n           If an action is dismissed on qualified immunity grounds,\n\nthat dismissal disposes of the entire case against the defendant in\n\nhis or her personal capacity.        See Scott v. Lacy, 811 F.2d 1153,\n\n1153-54 (7th Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (\"[A] public official who is\n\na defendant in a suit [for injunctive relief] is not 'on trial' at\n\nall.   The suit seeks relief against him in his official capacity;\n\nhe need not attend the trial, which will be conducted by attorneys\n\nrepresenting   the   governmental    body.\").    Any   cause   of   action\n\nremaining is against the defendant in his or her official capacity.\n\nAn official capacity claim is tantamount to a suit against the\n\ngovernmental entity, not to a suit against the individual.            See,\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fe.g., Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-66 (1985); Nereida-\n\nGonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 705 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nThus,    a   successful     Behrens      appeal    completely      protects   the\n\nindividual from litigating on his or her own behalf; it does not\n\nfunction merely to eliminate certain remedies from the case whilst\n\nleaving the identities of the litigants intact.4\n\n                                        III.\n\n                                   Conclusion\n\n             We need go no further.       We conclude that where, as here,\n\na State asserts only that a singular remedy, compensatory damages,\n\nis precluded by the Eleventh Amendment, yet acknowledges that it is\n\nsubject to the plaintiff's federal court suit with respect to other\n\nremedies     arising   as   part   of   the    same   cause   of   action,    that\n\nacknowledgment defeats any claim of entitlement to an interlocutory\n\nappeal. In such circumstances, the State must await final judgment\n\nbefore testing on appeal the question of what remedies may be\n\navailable.     Mercer, 40 F.3d at 897.            Refusing to allow immediate\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      In all events, the purposes served by the doctrine of\nqualified immunity are distinct from those served by the Eleventh\nAmendment.    State sovereign immunity is intended primarily to\n\"prevent the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive\nprocess of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties.\"\nIn re Ayers, 123 U.S. at 505. Qualified immunity, however, is \"a\nright to immunity from certain claims, not from litigation in\ngeneral.\"    Behrens, 516 U.S. at 312 (emphasis in original).\nConsequently, the purposes of qualified immunity are served fully\nby allowing an interlocutory appeal even when an official capacity\nclaim will remain velivolent.\n\n                                        -17-\n\freview in such instances will not render \"impossible any review\n\nwhatsoever.\"   United States v. Ryan, 402 U.S. 530, 533 (1971).\n\n          We dismiss the appeal, without prejudice, for want of\n\nappellate jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f",

Swift,</i> 310 F.3d 230, 231 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that the Court has \"tilt[ed] the scales more and more toward states' rights\"). The Commonwealth's core contention is that the 1991 Civil Rights Act fails validly to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity insofar as the Act authorizes the imposition of compensatory damages in Title VII actions against the States (and against Puerto Rico, which is considered the functional equivalent of a State for Eleventh Amendment purposes). This raises an interesting question but, as presently postured, one that falls beyond our purview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stumbling block is the time-tested precept that \"[n]o matter how tantalizing a problem may be, a federal appellate court cannot scratch intellectual itches unless it has jurisdiction to reach them.\" <i>Director, OWCP v. Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 853 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1988). In this instance, the Commonwealth's interlocutory appeal rests not on a denial of an asserted immunity from suit, but, rather, on a denial of an asserted immunity from the imposition of a certain type of money damages. So constructed, the appeal does not satisfy the requirements of the collateral order doctrine, and, thus, does not come within the encincture of our appellate jurisdiction. We therefore dismiss the appeal, leaving the substantive issue raised by the Commonwealth to await end-of-case review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Setting the Stage</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We glean the necessary facts from the plaintiff's complaint. <i>See LaChapelle v.

His complaint alleged that he had been discharged on the basis of his national origin, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1), and prayed for reinstatement, back pay, marginal benefits, compensatory damages, and \"any other remedy in law or equity\" that might be available against the Commonwealth.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Title VII claim brought the plaintiff face to face with the Eleventh Amendment, which provides that \"[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\" U.S. Const. amend. XI. This provision has been authoritatively interpreted to safeguard States from suits brought in federal court by their own citizens as well as by citizens of other States. <i>See, e.g., Edelman v.

Pub.L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 253 (1964). In 1972, it amended the law to include public employers, thus clearing the way for the prosecution of private rights of action against States that practiced discrimination. <i>See</i> Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-261, 86 Stat. 103, 103 (1972). This new right afforded only a limited set of remedies against a state defendant, mainly equitable in nature. Congress expanded the roster of remedies available against the States in 1991, adding compensatory damages to the mix. <i>See</i> Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, 1072 (1991) (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(a)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this proceeding, the Commonwealth, with a bow toward the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,</i> 427 U.S. 445, 456, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976), concedes that Title VII, in its 1972 incarnation, constituted a valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity. <i>See</i> Appellant's Br. at 10-11. In line with this concession, it has not, insofar as can be gleaned from its papers, attempted to circumnavigate federal jurisdiction as to the remedies that were authorized when <i>Fitzpatrick</i> was decided (i.e., the remedies originally provided by the 1972 amendments to Title VII). These remedies included pecuniary damages, albeit in the form of back pay awards. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(5)(g)(1); <i>see also Fitzpatrick,</i> 427 U.S. at 452-56, 96 S.Ct. 2666 (holding that a back pay award is appropriate in a Title VII case because Congress had the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity under section five of the Fourteenth Amendment); <i>Sea Land Serv. Inc. v. Estado Libre Asociado,</i> 588 F.2d 312, 313 n. 3 (1st Cir.1978) (discussing <i>Fitzpatrick</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This concession perforce means that the plaintiff's complaint has opened the Eleventh Amendment portal at least part-way. The Commonwealth, however, seeks to keep the gates from opening more widely. To that end, it directs its Eleventh Amendment challenge to the availability of the nascent compensatory damages remedy. It grounds this challenge on the premise that the 1991 Civil Rights Act, which made that anodyne available against the States for the first time, fails to pass the congruence and proportionality test delineated by the Supreme Court's recent Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence. <i>See, e.g., City of Boerne v. Flores,</i> 521 U.S. 507, 519-20, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997) (holding that legislation passed pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment must exhibit \"congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end\"). All legislation enacted pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment must pass this test in order validly to abrogate States' Eleventh Amendment immunity. <i>Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,</i> 531 U.S. 356, 364, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking this doctrine and noting that Congress relied upon section five in authorizing private rights of action against state defendants, the Commonwealth asserts that Congress acted outside its constitutional authority in purporting to abrogate state sovereign immunity when it amended Title VII in 1991 (and that, therefore, the Eleventh Amendment continues to protect the Commonwealth from being forced to pay compensatory damages in Title VII actions). Unimpressed by the ingenuity of this assertion, the district court summarily denied the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Appellate Jurisdiction</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the parties have assumed the existence of appellate jurisdiction, we enjoy no comparable luxury. Because federal courts are powerless to act in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction, we have an unflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects and to pursue them on our own initiative. <i>See Ins. Corp. of Ir. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee,</i> 456 U.S. 694, 702, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982); <i>United States v.

After all, litigants cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on a federal court by \"indolence, oversight, acquiescence, or consent.\" <i>Horn,</i> 29 F.3d at 768.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty here is that the order appealed from &#8212; the order denying the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss &#8212; does not end the case. It is, therefore, not \"final.\" That matters because federal appellate jurisdiction in most civil actions arises out of the power to review \"final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. Although this finality principle admits of certain exceptions, the majority of them are statutory in origin. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> &#167; 1292(a)(1)-(3) (establishing special rules for jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals from orders involving injunctive relief, admiralty cases, and receivership matters). None of these statutory exceptions applies here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the Supreme Court has glossed the finality principle, admonishing that the general requirement of finality should not be applied mechanically. <i>See Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp.,</i> 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949) (suggesting that courts should give the finality principle a \"practical rather than a technical construction\"). This pragmatic approach has spawned a few judge-made exceptions to the general rule. Chief among these is the so-called collateral order doctrine. Because that doctrine affords the only arguable basis for appellate jurisdiction over this appeal, we chart its contours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any effort to decipher the collateral order doctrine must begin with the Supreme Court's seminal opinion in <i>Cohen.</i> There, the Court held that an order may be appealed immediately if it \"finally determine[s] claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\" <i>Id.</i> at 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221. Following the <i>Cohen</i> Court's lead, we have said that collaterality demands conformity to the following four requirements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order must involve: (1) an issue essentially unrelated to the merits of the main dispute, capable of review without disrupting the main trial; (2) a complete resolution of the issue, not one that is \"unfinished\" or \"inconclusive\"; (3) a right incapable of vindication on appeal from final judgment; and (4) an important and unsettled question of controlling law, not merely a question of the proper exercise of the trial court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Sorren,</i> 605 F.2d 1211, 1213 (1st Cir.1979). Typically, all four of these prerequisites &#8212; which we have termed \"separability, finality, urgency, and importance,\" <i>Recticel Foam,</i> 859 F.2d at 1004 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) &#8212; must be satisfied in order to pave the way for the operation of the collateral order doctrine. <i>See id.</i> at 1003-04.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that an interlocutory order denying a State's claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit may be appealed immediately by way of the collateral order doctrine. <i>P.R. Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> 506 U.S. 139, 141, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993). The State's claim that the Eleventh Amendment conferred upon it a total immunity from suit furnished the predicate for the Court's finding that the elements of the collateral order doctrine were present. <i>See id.</i> at 144, 113 S.Ct. 684. The Court reasoned as follows. A trial court's denial of such an immunity claim is final because it conclusively determines that the State can be subjected to the coercive processes of the federal courts. <i>See id.</i> at 145, 113 S.Ct. 684. It is urgent because the principal benefit conferred by the Eleventh Amendment &#8212; an immunity from suit &#8212; will be \"lost as litigation proceeds past motion practice.\" <i>Id.</i> Third, the trial court's order involves an important legal question (the existence and extent of a \"fundamental constitutional protection\"). <i>Id.</i> And, finally, that question has no bearing on the substantive merits of the case (and, thus, is separable). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the parties' assumption that we enjoy appellate jurisdiction apparently rests on the belief that <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct</i> is controlling. We are less sanguine. The precise question before the <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct</i> Court was \"whether a district court order denying a claim by a State or a state entity to Eleventh Amendment immunity <i>from suit</i> in federal court may be appealed under the collateral order doctrine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 141, 113 S.Ct. 684 (emphasis supplied). The Court's affirmative answer to that question gives us appellate jurisdiction to decide &#8212; even in the absence of a final judgment &#8212; whether a State is amenable to suit in a federal court with respect to a Title VII claim. <i>See, e.g., id.; Okruhlik v. Univ. of Ark.,</i> 255 F.3d 615, 621 (8th Cir.2001). But that issue is not before us. Here, the Commonwealth does not assert that it is immune from a Title VII suit in federal court. Its only developed argument is that it is immune from a particular strain of damages (a remedy first made available by Congress in 1991). This fact distinguishes the case before us from <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct. See Mercer v. Magnant,</i> 40 F.3d 893, 896 (7th Cir.1994) (\"The foundation for the interlocutory appeal authorized by [<i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct</i>] is the existence of a right not to be a litigant.\"). It follows inexorably that accepting appellate jurisdiction over the instant appeal would require an extension of the holding announced in <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to the task of testing the viability of such an extension. This requires us to assess the Commonwealth's actual asseveration (that subjecting it to a claim for compensatory damages in a Title VII suit properly brought against it in a federal court is barred by the Eleventh Amendment) and to decide, applying the <i>Cohen</i> criteria, whether a pretrial rejection of that asseveration is subject to immediate appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the four requirements underpinning the collateral order doctrine, urgency is perhaps the most elemental. <i>See Recticel Foam,</i> 859 F.2d at 1004 (terming urgency the \"central focus\" of the <i>Cohen</i> inquiry and perhaps the \"dispositive criterion\"); <i>Boreri v. Fiat, S.p.A.,</i> 763 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1985) (similar). Here, our inquiry starts &#8212; and stops &#8212; with this criterion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We have equated urgency with a showing of irreparable harm. <i>See Boreri,</i> 763 F.2d at 21. In this instance, the Commonwealth has wholly failed to show that precluding an immediate appeal of the district court's order will result in any irreparable harm. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a critical difference between avoiding trial, on the one hand, and limiting exposure to liability, on the other hand. The denial of a colorable claim of immunity from suit cannot effectively be reviewed after trial as the very object and purpose of the immunity is to protect the holder from the indignity of being subjected to the coercive processes of a judicial tribunal at the instance of a private party. <i>See In re Ayers,</i> 123 U.S. 443, 505, 8 S.Ct. 164, 31 L.Ed. 216 (1887); <i>see also Pullman Constr. Indus., Inc. v. United States,</i> 23 F.3d 1166, 1168 (7th Cir.1994) (characterizing the Court's decision in <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct</i> as protecting \"a governmental body's right to avoid litigation in another sovereign's courts\"). Put another way, the \"ultimate justification\" for applying the collateral order doctrine in cases involving state sovereign immunity \"is the importance of ensuring that the States' dignitary interests can be fully vindicated.\" <i>P.R. Aqueduct,</i> 506 U.S. at 146, 113 S.Ct. 684.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This concern is not implicated when the State interposes the Eleventh Amendment not as the basis for an immunity from suit, but, rather, as a defense to one of several remedies sought by a particular plaintiff. <i>See Thomas v. Nakatani,</i> 309 F.3d 1203, 1207 (9th Cir.2002) (explaining that the crucial difference between non-final orders denying immunity that are immediately appealable and non-final orders that are not is whether \"the action... would proceed against the state whether or not it prevailed on appeal\"). That scenario reflects an interest which, unlike immunity from suit, is \"fully vindicable on appeal from final judgment.\" <i>Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc.,</i> 511 U.S. 863, 882, 114 S.Ct. 1992, 128 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994). That is a vastly different matter: when a State has filed a pretrial motion invoking the Eleventh Amendment not to establish an immunity from suit but merely to afford itself a defense to a particular strain of damages, there is no reason to enswathe a denial of its motion within the collateral order doctrine. <i>See Cherry v. Univ. of Wis. Sys. Bd. of Regents,</i> 265 F.3d 541, 547 (7th Cir.2001) (declining to address claim that state agency is immune from a punitive damages award on interlocutory appeal because \"[a] claim of immunity to a certain class of damages\" is different in kind from a claim of immunity from suit); <i>Burns-Vidlak v. Chandler,</i> 165 F.3d 1257, 1260-61 (9th Cir.1999) (finding no appellate jurisdiction over State's claim that an award of punitive damages for a violation of Title II of the ADA is barred by the Eleventh Amendment because the State \"concedes that it is subject to suit ... in federal court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Divorced from the question of whether a State can be sued at all in a federal court, the much narrower question of whether it can be held liable for a certain type of pecuniary damages is a question that adequately can be reviewed following trial. <i>See Cherry,</i> 265 F.3d at 547 (finding no risk of irretrievable loss and holding that a denial of a claimed immunity from punitive damages can be effectively reviewed after judgment); <i>see generally CSX Transp., Inc. v. Kissimmee Util. Auth.,</i> 153 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th Cir.1998) (adjudging claims of sovereign immunity under Florida state law not subject to interlocutory review because Florida state immunity is immunity only from damages and not from suit itself); <i>cf. P.R. Aqueduct,</i> 506 U.S. at 145-46, 113 S.Ct. 684 (suggesting that if the Eleventh Amendment conferred only a defense to liability, interlocutory review might not be warranted). In the ordinary case, a party who is subjected to an erroneous award of damages can remedy that error fully through an end-of-case appeal. <i>See Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n,</i> 514 U.S. 35, 43, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995) (making clear that a potentially \"erroneous ruling on liability may be reviewed effectively on appeal from final judgment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That tenet is fully operative here. If the plaintiff's case goes forward and the Commonwealth is found liable for compensatory damages, it will have an ample opportunity to test the propriety of that award before it is forced to pay. Thus, the only harm that the Commonwealth stands to suffer from the unavailability of interlocutory review is an inchoate harm stemming from an erroneous but non-final ruling. That is always a risk in litigation &#8212; and not the sort of harm that warrants special solicitude. After all, \"almost every pretrial or trial order might be called `effectively unreviewable' in the sense that relief from error can never extend to rewriting history.\" <i>Digital Equip.,</i> 511 U.S. at 872, 114 S.Ct. 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, if the harm asserted here were deemed sufficient to warrant interlocutory review, the <i>Cohen</i> exception would swallow the finality principle in a single gulp. That is a consummation that ought to be avoided. The Supreme Court repeatedly has cautioned that the collateral order doctrine constitutes only a \"narrow exception\" to the final judgment rule and that it \"should stay that way.\" <i>Id.</i> at 868, 114 S.Ct. 1992. There is good reason why the conditions for interlocutory appeal are stringent. The case at bar simply does not satisfy those conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Behrens v. Pelletier,</i> 516 U.S. 299, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996), does not suggest a contrary result. There, the Court clarified that the collateral order doctrine provides a jurisdictional hook on which to hang an immediate appeal from an order denying qualified immunity even though the case contains equitable claims against the \"same\" defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 311-12, 116 S.Ct. 834. That situation is readily distinguishable from the case before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If an action is dismissed on qualified immunity grounds, that dismissal disposes of the entire case against the defendant in his or her personal capacity. <i>See Scott v. Lacy,</i> 811 F.2d 1153, 1153-54 (7th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (\"[A] public official who is a defendant in a suit [for injunctive relief] is not `on trial' at all. The suit seeks relief against him in his official capacity; he need not attend the trial, which will be conducted by attorneys representing the governmental body.\"). Any cause of action remaining is against the defendant in his or her official capacity. An official capacity claim is tantamount to a suit against the governmental entity, not to a suit against the individual. <i>See, e.g., Kentucky v. Graham,</i> 473 U.S. 159, 165-66, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985); <i>Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado,</i> 990 F.2d 701, 705 (1st Cir.1993). Thus, a successful <i>Behrens</i> appeal completely protects the individual from litigating on his or her own behalf; it does not function merely to eliminate certain remedies from the case whilst leaving the identities of the litigants intact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We conclude that where, as here, a State asserts only that a singular remedy, compensatory damages, is precluded by the Eleventh Amendment, yet acknowledges that it is subject to the plaintiff's federal court suit with respect to other remedies arising as part of the same cause of action, that acknowledgment defeats any claim of entitlement to an interlocutory appeal. In such circumstances, the State must await final judgment before testing on appeal the question of what remedies may be available. <i>Mercer,</i> 40 F.3d at 897. Refusing to allow immediate review in such instances will not render \"impossible any review whatsoever.\" <i>United States v.

The Commonwealth's core contention is that the 1991 Civil Rights Act fails validly to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity insofar as the Act authorizes the imposition of compensatory damages in Title VII actions against the States (and against Puerto Rico, which is considered the functional equivalent of a State for Eleventh Amendment purposes).

In this instance, the Commonwealth's interlocutory appeal rests not on a denial of an asserted immunity from suit, but, rather, on a denial of an asserted immunity from the imposition of a certain type of money damages.

It grounds this challenge on the premise that the 1991 Civil Rights Act, which made that anodyne available against the States for the first time, fails to pass the congruence and proportionality test delineated by the Supreme Court's recent Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence. <i>See, e.g., City of Boerne v.

It is, therefore, not \"final.\" That matters because federal appellate jurisdiction in most civil actions arises out of the power to review \"final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. Although this finality principle admits of certain exceptions, the majority of them are statutory in origin. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> &#167; 1292(a)(1)-(3) (establishing special rules for jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals from orders involving injunctive relief, admiralty cases, and receivership matters).

This pragmatic approach has spawned a few judge-made exceptions to the general rule. Chief among these is the so-called collateral order doctrine.

The State's claim that the Eleventh Amendment conferred upon it a total immunity from suit furnished the predicate for the Court's finding that the elements of the collateral order doctrine were present. <i>See id.</i> at 144, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112800\"><a href=\"/opinion/112800/puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority-v-metcalf-eddy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A trial court's denial of such an immunity claim is final because it conclusively determines that the State can be subjected to the coercive processes of the federal courts. <i>See id.</i> at 145, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112800\"><a href=\"/opinion/112800/puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority-v-metcalf-eddy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is urgent because the principal benefit conferred by the Eleventh Amendment &#8212; an immunity from suit &#8212; will be \"lost as litigation proceeds past motion practice.\" <i>Id.</i> Third, the trial court's order involves an important legal question (the existence and extent of a \"fundamental constitutional protection\"). <i>Id.</i> And, finally, that question has no bearing on the substantive merits of the case (and, thus, is separable). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the parties' assumption that we enjoy appellate jurisdiction apparently rests on the belief that <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct</i> is controlling. We are less sanguine. The precise question before the <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct</i> Court was \"whether a district court order denying a claim by a State or a state entity to Eleventh Amendment immunity <i>from suit</i> in federal court may be appealed under the collateral order doctrine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 141, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112800\"><a href=\"/opinion/112800/puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority-v-metcalf-eddy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span> (emphasis supplied). The Court's affirmative answer to that question gives us appellate jurisdiction to decide &#8212; even in the absence of a final judgment &#8212; whether a State is amenable to suit in a federal court with respect to a Title VII claim. <i>See, e.g., id.; Okruhlik v.

But that issue is not before us. Here, the Commonwealth does not assert that it is immune from a Title VII suit in federal court. Its only developed argument is that it is immune from a particular strain of damages (a remedy first made available by Congress in 1991). This fact distinguishes the case before us from <i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct. See Mercer v. Magnant,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682767\"><a href=\"/opinion/682767/mary-mercer-v-suzanne-magnant-administrator-of-the-indiana-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span>, 896 (7th Cir.1994) (\"The foundation for the interlocutory appeal authorized by [<i>Puerto Rico Aqueduct</i>] is the existence of a right not to be a litigant.\").

This requires us to assess the Commonwealth's actual asseveration (that subjecting it to a claim for compensatory damages in a Title VII suit properly brought against it in a federal court is barred by the Eleventh Amendment) and to decide, applying the <i>Cohen</i> criteria, whether a pretrial rejection of that asseveration is subject to immediate appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the four requirements underpinning the collateral order doctrine, urgency is perhaps the most elemental. <i>See Recticel Foam,</i> 859 F.2d at 1004 (terming urgency the \"central focus\" of the <i>Cohen</i> inquiry and perhaps the \"dispositive criterion\"); <i>Boreri v.

Here, our inquiry starts &#8212; and stops &#8212; with this criterion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We have equated urgency with a showing of irreparable harm. <i>See Boreri,</i> 763 F.2d at 21.

If the plaintiff's case goes forward and the Commonwealth is found liable for compensatory damages, it will have an ample opportunity to test the propriety of that award before it is forced to pay. Thus, the only harm that the Commonwealth stands to suffer from the unavailability of interlocutory review is an inchoate harm stemming from an erroneous but non-final ruling. That is always a risk in litigation &#8212; and not the sort of harm that warrants special solicitude.

The suit seeks relief against him in his official capacity; he need not attend the trial, which will be conducted by attorneys representing the governmental body.\"). Any cause of action remaining is against the defendant in his or her official capacity. An official capacity claim is tantamount to a suit against the governmental entity, not to a suit against the individual. <i>See, e.g., Kentucky v.

Thus, a successful <i>Behrens</i> appeal completely protects the individual from litigating on his or her own behalf; it does not function merely to eliminate certain remedies from the case whilst leaving the identities of the litigants intact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We conclude that where, as here, a State asserts only that a singular remedy, compensatory damages, is precluded by the Eleventh Amendment, yet acknowledges that it is subject to the plaintiff's federal court suit with respect to other remedies arising as part of the same cause of action, that acknowledgment defeats any claim of entitlement to an interlocutory appeal. In such circumstances, the State must await final judgment before testing on appeal the question of what remedies may be available. <i>Mercer,</i> 40 F.3d at 897.
