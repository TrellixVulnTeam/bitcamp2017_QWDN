Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Luis A. Guzmán-Dupont, for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivision, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 21, 2008\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Pedro Pimentel was indicted on\n\nsix counts of conspiracy to import with the intent to distribute\n\ndrugs into the United States.       He pled guilty on five counts, and\n\nhe was sentenced to a total of 180 months' imprisonment.         Pimentel\n\nargues that the district court erred in accepting his plea because\n\nthere was no factual basis for it.              He also argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred by not properly instructed him as to Count\n\nFive. After careful consideration, we affirm Pimentel's conviction\n\nand the district court's judgment.\n\n                            I.   Background\n\n          Pimentel,   a   citizen    of   the   Dominican   Republic,   was\n\nindicted, along with ten co-defendants, for conspiracy and other\n\ndrug-trafficking-related crimes.      The Government had evidence that\n\non March 15, 2005, Pimentel met with other persons in Isla Verde,\n\nPuerto Rico to coordinate shipments of drugs into the United States\n\nfrom the Dominican Republic; two weeks later, Pimentel met with one\n\nof his co-defendants and other persons in the Dominican Republic to\n\ncoordinate the importation of cocaine into the United States.           The\n\nGovernment also had evidence of Pimentel and his co-defendants'\n\ninvolvement with drugs shipped in June and September of 2005.\n\n          Pimentel was arrested on October 27, 2005, by the Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration as he attempted to pick up the drug\n\nshipments.   He was indicted for conspiracy to import into the\n\nUnited States over five kilograms of cocaine, conspiracy to possess\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fwith the intent to distribute over five kilograms of cocaine,\n\naiding and abetting in the possession of a weapon in furtherance of\n\na drug trafficking offense, distribution of a detectable amount of\n\nheroin, and a forfeiture count -- all in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 963, 841(a)(1), 846, and 853(p) and 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)\n\nand 2, respectively.    On October 5, 2006, he entered a straight\n\nplea on Counts One through Five of the superseding indictment.    He\n\nwas sentenced on February 28, 2007, to 120 months' imprisonment on\n\nCounts One, Two, Three, and Five, to be served concurrently. Count\n\nSix was a forfeiture allegation. He was sentenced to sixty months'\n\nimprisonment as to Count Four, to be served consecutively to Counts\n\nOne, Two, Three, and Five, for a total prison term of 180 months.\n\nThe court imposed a supervised release term of five years on Counts\n\nOne, Two, Three, and Five, to be served concurrently.    The court\n\nalso imposed a special monetary assessment of $100.00 on each count\n\nfor a total of $500.00.         Pimentel appeals his plea and the\n\nconviction as to Count Five.\n\n                          II.    Discussion\n\n          A.   Standard of Review\n\n          Pimentel did not object to the alleged errors below;\n\nthus, we will reverse only upon a showing of plain error.        See\n\nUnited States v. Rodríguez-León, 402 F.3d 17, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993)).       To\n\nsatisfy the plain error standard, the defendant must show (1) an\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\ferror (2) that was \"'clear and obvious,'\" (3) which affected his\n\nsubstantial rights, and (4) seriously undermined the \"'fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\"          United\n\nStates v. Jimínez, 498 F.3d 82, 85 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001)).        The burden is\n\non the defendant to demonstrate that the outcome would likely have\n\nbeen different if the error had not occurred.       See United States v.\n\nMescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004). Pimentel \"can prevail\n\n. . . only if he demonstrates a substantial defect in the Rule 11\n\nproceeding itself.\"       United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 613-14\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (citing United States v. Mateo, 950 F.2d 44, 45\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) and United States v. Parra-Ibáñez, 936 F.2d 588,\n\n593-94 (1st Cir. 1991)).\n\n           B.   Rule 11\n\n           Pimentel argues that his guilty plea was not given\n\nvoluntarily,    willingly,    or   intelligently,   and   is,   therefore,\n\ninvalid.   See United States v. Pizarro-Berríos, 448 F.3d 1, 4 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).     He also argues that he made a statement at his\n\nsentencing hearing that was an assertion of his innocence.             The\n\nrecord does not support these arguments.\n\n           Rule 11 \"establishes a procedure for district courts to\n\nensure that a plea of guilty is constitutionally valid.\"            United\n\nStates v. Medina-Román, 376 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2004).          \"Before the\n\ncourt accepts a plea of guilty . . . the defendant [is] placed\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\funder oath, and the court must address the defendant personally in\n\nopen court.\"     Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1).           The district court then\n\ninforms the defendant of his rights and makes a determination that\n\nthe defendant understands his rights.              See id.    Rule 11 has three\n\ncore concerns that guide our review of whether a plea meets its\n\nrequirements: \"(1) absence of coercion, (2) understanding of the\n\ncharges, and (3) knowledge of the consequences of the plea.\"\n\nRodríguez-León, 402 F.3d at 24 (citing United States v. Isom, 85\n\nF.3d 831, 835 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n           Rule 11 also requires the district court to determine\n\nwhether there is a factual basis for a guilty plea.                   See Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(b)(3); United States v. Skerret-Ortega, 529 F.3d 33, 38\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).      \"When determining whether a sufficient factual\n\nbasis exists to support a guilty plea, the question before the\n\ncourt 'is . . . whether there is enough evidence so that the plea\n\nhas a rational basis in facts that the defendant concedes or that\n\nthe   government    proffers    as     supported     by    credible   evidence.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Delgado-Hernández, 420 F.3d 16, 27 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting United States v. Gandía-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2000)).    The     district    court    need   not    be    convinced   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt that an accused is guilty.                 See Skerret-Ortega,\n\n529 F.3d at 38.\n\n           We have repeatedly said that for the acceptance of a\n\nguilty plea to be valid under Rule 11, the plea colloquy need not\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fbe perfect.     See United States v. Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d 594,\n\n598 (1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4-5\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (\"What is critical is the substance of what was\n\ncommunicated by the trial court, and what should reasonably have\n\nbeen understood by the defendant, rather than the form of the\n\ncommunication.\"); United States v. Raineri, 42 F.3d 36, 45 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).     Pimentel's attempted retraction after his guilty plea\n\nalso faces a high hurdle on appeal because he has \"no absolute\n\nright to retract his plea.\"      United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d\n\n1535,    1537   (1st   Cir.   1989)    (citations   omitted);   see     also\n\nMiranda-González v. United States, 181 F.3d 164, 165 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n           The record indicates that although Pimentel was initially\n\nhesitant about the plea, the court adequately advised him on five\n\nseparate occasions that he had an absolute right not to plead\n\nguilty and to go to trial.             In response to his unease, the\n\nGovernment advised the court that it had an undercover police\n\nofficer who would testify at trial regarding Pimentel's involvement\n\nin the crimes he was charged with committing.        After speaking with\n\nhis counsel, Pimentel determined that he would plead guilty.              At\n\nthe change-of-plea (\"COP\") hearing Pimentel also acknowledged that\n\nhe was not forced, coerced, or intimidated into pleading guilty and\n\nthat he was satisfied with his counsel's representation.              At the\n\nsentencing hearing, Pimentel did not request the withdrawal of his\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fguilty plea, though he did express some concerns.           He claimed that\n\nthere was an alleged missing tape-recording that could reflect that\n\nhe was not willing to take part in the conspiracy.          He also claimed\n\nthat the drugs and firearms seized during the arrest did not belong\n\nto him.\n\n           After Pimentel made those claims, the district court\n\nadvised him that he was not charged as the owner of the drugs or\n\nthe weapon, but that he was charged with conspiracy.           The district\n\ncourt determined that Pimentel's claims of exculpatory evidence\n\nlacked credibility because he had previously admitted to the\n\nconspiracy and admitted that there was a gun in the vehicle when he\n\nwent with his co-defendant to pick up the drugs. Pimentel's lawyer\n\nalso ensured the district court that the Government had provided\n\nPimentel   with   all   of   the   video   and   audio   evidence   that    was\n\navailable. Pimentel does not contest the fact that he was involved\n\nin picking up the drugs or that his co-defendant possessed a\n\nfirearm during the commission of the drug offense.                  When the\n\nGovernment presented facts at the COP hearing in relation to the\n\ndrug and firearms offenses, Pimentel admitted to the court that he\n\nagreed to the factual proffer presented by the Government.                 From\n\nour reading of the record, the district court did indeed inform\n\nPimentel of his rights under Rule 11.\n\n           Pimentel argues that the district court did not inform\n\nhim of the overt acts in the counts on which he was pleading.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fOvert acts, however, are not elements of drug conspiracy offenses,\n\nand the district court was not required to cite or address them in\n\nits explanation of the conspiracy charges.             See United States v.\n\nShabani, 513 U.S. 10, 13-14 (1994); United States v. Vega-Figueroa,\n\n234 F.3d 744, 754 (1st Cir. 2000).            Furthermore, the Government\n\nneed not prove overt acts in order to convict a defendant of a drug\n\nconspiracy offense.         See United States v. Bello-Pérez, 977 F.2d\n\n664, 669 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"The government is not required to plead\n\nor   prove    any   overt    act   in    furtherance   of   a   section   846\n\nconspiracy.\").      The district court adequately and fully advised\n\nPimentel concerning the nature of the five offenses charged in the\n\nsuperseding indictment; Pimentel acknowledged that he had discussed\n\nthe charges with his attorney, understood the allegations, and\n\nchose to plead guilty.\n\n             Pimentel also argues that the district court failed to\n\nadvise him of his rights under Rule 11(b)(1)(A). When the district\n\ncourt accepts a plea agreement, it must advise a defendant that the\n\nGovernment has a \"right, in a prosecution for perjury or false\n\nstatement, to use against the defendant any statement that the\n\ndefendant gives under oath.\"        Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(A).         The\n\ndistrict court did not advise.          But in United States v. Vonn, 535\n\nU.S. 55 (2002), the Supreme Court determined that when a defendant\n\nfails to object to a Rule 11 error in a trial court's guilty plea\n\ncolloquy, the error is only reversible upon a showing that such\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\ferror was plain and affected the defendant's substantial rights,\n\ninstead of the harmless error standard stated in Rule 11(h).        Id.\n\nat 59; see also United States v. Borrero-Acevedo, 533 F.3d 11, 15\n\n(1st     Cir.   2008).    When   determining   whether   a   defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights were affected, we \"consult the whole record.\"\n\nVonn, 535 U.S. at 59.     Pimentel failed to argue or present facts on\n\nappeal that his rights were substantially affected by the court's\n\nerror.     This argument is therefore waived.    See United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                          1.   Count Five\n\n            The Government acknowledges that the district court erred\n\nwith respect to Count Five because it did not advise Pimentel of\n\nthe proper statutory penalty.         The district court should have\n\nadvised Pimentel of the proper penalty but addressed Count Five\n\nlike the other drug offenses. The Government asserts, though, that\n\nPimentel fails to argue that his substantial rights were affected;\n\nnor can he show that his substantial rights were affected.           We\n\nagree.     The error made no difference in Pimentel's sentence.      He\n\nreceived the fifteen years' imprisonment that the Government said\n\nit would recommend.      See United States v. King, 234 F.3d 126, 127\n\n(2d Cir. 2000) (\"[W]e have only reversed a judgment of conviction\n\nfor a violation of Rule 11(e)(2) when the defendant received a\n\nhigher sentence than that recommended by the government, or when\n\nthere were other factors to 'tip the scale' in favor of reversal.\")\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f(citation omitted).       The district court and Pimentel's lawyer\n\nadvised him of the sentence range.            The record reflects that\n\nPimentel acknowledged his understanding of his possible sentence.\n\nHe then received that sentence.       Therefore, his claim as to Count\n\nFive fails.\n\n           C.    Rejecting Guilty Plea Before Sentencing\n\n           Pimentel argues that entering a guilty plea does not\n\nwaive any challenges he might have to the acceptance of the plea.\n\nRule 11 allows a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea, for any\n\nreason, \"after the court accepts the plea, but before it imposes\n\nsentence if, the defendant can show a fair and just reason for\n\nrequesting    the   withdrawal.\"     Fed.    R.    Crim.   P.   11(d)(2)(B).\n\nPimentel admits that he did not file a motion to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea before sentencing.         His claim therefore is without\n\nmerit, and we need go no further.\n\n           D.    Conviction for \"Detectable Amount of Heroin\"\n\n           Finally, Pimentel argues that his conviction under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1) involving a mixture or substance containing a\n\ndetectable amount of heroin, without more, was entered for an\n\noffense for which there is no Sentencing Guideline. He argues that\n\nthe indictment is unreasonable and plain error because it did not\n\ncontain a specific weight of heroin and should be declared invalid.\n\nHe   maintains   that   the   conviction   under   Count   Five   without   a\n\nspecific weight of heroin is plain error.              Although the D.C.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fCircuit has held that a related subsection of § 841 \"contains no\n\nthreshold drug-quantity requirement and, therefore, it was not\n\nerror to indict [the defendant] for possessing 'a detectable\n\namount' but omit mention of the specific quantity,\" United States\n\nv. Gillespie, 436 F.3d 272, 276 (D.C. Cir. 2006), we do not need to\n\ndecide this issue today because Pimentel did not properly raise\n\nthis argument in the district court.\n\n            Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3) requires that\n\na   claim   that   an   indictment   has    a   \"defect,\"    such   as    being\n\ninsufficiently specific, be raised prior to trial.             Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 12(b)(3)(B); see also United States v. DiGregorio, 605 F.2d\n\n1184, 1193 n.10 (1st Cir. 1979).            If the claimed defect is not\n\njurisdictional, the defendant's failure to raise the Rule 12(b)(3)\n\nclaim constitutes a waiver from which this Court will grant relief\n\nonly for good cause.     See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(e); United States v.\n\nMack, 892 F.2d 134, 136 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n            The alleged error is not a jurisdictional defect because\n\nthe district court has subject matter jurisdiction over \"all\n\noffenses against the laws of the United States.\"            18 U.S.C. § 3231;\n\nUnited States v. Lussier, 929 F.2d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1991).                 This\n\ncategory of offenses includes crimes defined in Title 21.                See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841.      The Supreme Court has determined that indictment\n\ndefects are not jurisdictional, and thus, the omission of specific\n\ndrug quantities in a 21 U.S.C. § 846 drug conspiracy offense was\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fnot a jurisdictional defect.    United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S.\n\n625, 631 (2002); see also United States v. López, 300 F.3d 46, 59\n\nn.5 (1st Cir. 2002).   Moreover, we have previously held that drug\n\nquantity is not an element of a § 841 offense.     See United States\n\nv. Malouf, 466 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v.\n\nGoodine, 326 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 2003).    The failure to state the\n\nspecific drug quantity affects only the maximum punishment possible\n\nfor the offense and not the offense charged.          See 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b); Goodine, 326 F.3d at 32-33. Pimentel's claim, therefore,\n\nis without merit.\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the guilty plea\n\nand the conviction as to Count Five.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f",

Pedro Pimentel was indicted on\n\nsix counts of conspiracy to import with the intent to distribute\n\ndrugs into the United States.       He pled guilty on five counts, and\n\nhe was sentenced to a total of 180 months' imprisonment.         Pimentel\n\nargues that the district court erred in accepting his plea because\n\nthere was no factual basis for it.              He also argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred by not properly instructed him as to Count\n\nFive. After careful consideration, we affirm Pimentel's conviction\n\nand the district court's judgment.\n\n                            I.   Background\n\n          Pimentel,   a   citizen    of   the   Dominican   Republic,   was\n\nindicted, along with ten co-defendants, for conspiracy and other\n\ndrug-trafficking-related crimes.      The Government had evidence that\n\non March 15, 2005, Pimentel met with other persons in Isla Verde,\n\nPuerto Rico to coordinate shipments of drugs into the United States\n\nfrom the Dominican Republic; two weeks later, Pimentel met with one\n\nof his co-defendants and other persons in the Dominican Republic to\n\ncoordinate the importation of cocaine into the United States.           The\n\nGovernment also had evidence of Pimentel and his co-defendants'\n\ninvolvement with drugs shipped in June and September of 2005.\n\n          Pimentel was arrested on October 27, 2005, by the Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration as he attempted to pick up the drug\n\nshipments.   He was indicted for conspiracy to import into the\n\nUnited States over five kilograms of cocaine, conspiracy to possess\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fwith the intent to distribute over five kilograms of cocaine,\n\naiding and abetting in the possession of a weapon in furtherance of\n\na drug trafficking offense, distribution of a detectable amount of\n\nheroin, and a forfeiture count -- all in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 963, 841(a)(1), 846, and 853(p) and 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)\n\nand 2, respectively.    On October 5, 2006, he entered a straight\n\nplea on Counts One through Five of the superseding indictment.    He\n\nwas sentenced on February 28, 2007, to 120 months' imprisonment on\n\nCounts One, Two, Three, and Five, to be served concurrently. Count\n\nSix was a forfeiture allegation. He was sentenced to sixty months'\n\nimprisonment as to Count Four, to be served consecutively to Counts\n\nOne, Two, Three, and Five, for a total prison term of 180 months.\n\nThe court imposed a supervised release term of five years on Counts\n\nOne, Two, Three, and Five, to be served concurrently.    The court\n\nalso imposed a special monetary assessment of $100.00 on each count\n\nfor a total of $500.00.         Pimentel appeals his plea and the\n\nconviction as to Count Five.\n\n                          II.    Discussion\n\n          A.

In response to his unease, the\n\nGovernment advised the court that it had an undercover police\n\nofficer who would testify at trial regarding Pimentel's involvement\n\nin the crimes he was charged with committing.        After speaking with\n\nhis counsel, Pimentel determined that he would plead guilty.              At\n\nthe change-of-plea (\"COP\") hearing Pimentel also acknowledged that\n\nhe was not forced, coerced, or intimidated into pleading guilty and\n\nthat he was satisfied with his counsel's representation.              At the\n\nsentencing hearing, Pimentel did not request the withdrawal of his\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fguilty plea, though he did express some concerns.           He claimed that\n\nthere was an alleged missing tape-recording that could reflect that\n\nhe was not willing to take part in the conspiracy.          He also claimed\n\nthat the drugs and firearms seized during the arrest did not belong\n\nto him.\n\n           After Pimentel made those claims, the district court\n\nadvised him that he was not charged as the owner of the drugs or\n\nthe weapon, but that he was charged with conspiracy.           The district\n\ncourt determined that Pimentel's claims of exculpatory evidence\n\nlacked credibility because he had previously admitted to the\n\nconspiracy and admitted that there was a gun in the vehicle when he\n\nwent with his co-defendant to pick up the drugs. Pimentel's lawyer\n\nalso ensured the district court that the Government had provided\n\nPimentel   with   all   of   the   video   and   audio   evidence   that    was\n\navailable. Pimentel does not contest the fact that he was involved\n\nin picking up the drugs or that his co-defendant possessed a\n\nfirearm during the commission of the drug offense.                  When the\n\nGovernment presented facts at the COP hearing in relation to the\n\ndrug and firearms offenses, Pimentel admitted to the court that he\n\nagreed to the factual proffer presented by the Government.                 From\n\nour reading of the record, the district court did indeed inform\n\nPimentel of his rights under Rule 11.\n\n           Pimentel argues that the district court did not inform\n\nhim of the overt acts in the counts on which he was pleading.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fOvert acts, however, are not elements of drug conspiracy offenses,\n\nand the district court was not required to cite or address them in\n\nits explanation of the conspiracy charges.

The district court adequately and fully advised\n\nPimentel concerning the nature of the five offenses charged in the\n\nsuperseding indictment; Pimentel acknowledged that he had discussed\n\nthe charges with his attorney, understood the allegations, and\n\nchose to plead guilty.\n\n             Pimentel also argues that the district court failed to\n\nadvise him of his rights under Rule 11(b)(1)(A).

The district court should have\n\nadvised Pimentel of the proper penalty but addressed Count Five\n\nlike the other drug offenses.

Conviction for \"Detectable Amount of Heroin\"\n\n           Finally, Pimentel argues that his conviction under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1) involving a mixture or substance containing a\n\ndetectable amount of heroin, without more, was entered for an\n\noffense for which there is no Sentencing Guideline.

If the claimed defect is not\n\njurisdictional, the defendant's failure to raise the Rule 12(b)(3)\n\nclaim constitutes a waiver from which this Court will grant relief\n\nonly for good cause.

This\n\ncategory of offenses includes crimes defined in Title 21.                See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841.      The Supreme Court has determined that indictment\n\ndefects are not jurisdictional, and thus, the omission of specific\n\ndrug quantities in a 21 U.S.C. § 846 drug conspiracy offense was\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fnot a jurisdictional defect.
