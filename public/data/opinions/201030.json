R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-1181\n\n                          DOROTHY LAFORTUNE,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                     CITY OF BIDDEFORD, ET AL.,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n          [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Dorothy Lafortune on brief pro se.\n     Harry B. Center II, Aaron P. Burns and Smith, Elliott, Smith\n& Garmey, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                              May 26, 2004\n\f     Per Curiam. Dorothy Lafortune challenges the district court's\n\ndismissal of her claims brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the\n\nCity of Biddeford, Maine, (\"Biddeford\") and its Mayor, as moot. We\n\nconclude that the district court erred in finding that defendants\n\nhad met its burden of demonstrating that the challenged conduct\n\nwould not recur.\n\n     Lafortune's claims centered on two Biddeford City Council\n\norders which removed her public access cable television program\n\nfrom the air and suspended her right to use Biddeford's public\n\naccess television facilities for \"a minimum period of one year.\"\n\nLafortune also argued that Biddeford's requirement that she obtain\n\nwritten releases from any private citizen to be mentioned in her\n\nprogram before the program aired violated the Cable Communications\n\nPolicy Act of 1984, 47 U.S.C. ยง 544(f), as well as the First and\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\n     After    a    magistrate     judge   issued   a   Recommended   Decision\n\nconcluding    that    Biddeford's     release      requirement    violated    ยง\n\n544(f)(1)    and   imposed   an    unconstitutional     prior    restraint   on\n\nLaFortune's freedom of speech, Biddeford adopted an emergency\n\nordinance suspending operation of all community access broadcasting\n\npending revision of the terms governing use of the public access\n\nchannel.     The ordinance further stated Biddeford's intention to\n\npromptly resume public access programming.               The district court\n\nsubsequently stayed the litigation to allow Biddeford to determine\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fits future public access policy, and the parties were ordered to\n\nsubmit status reports to the court every sixty days.\n\n     Two months later, Biddeford resumed, on an interim basis,\n\nbroadcasting public meetings, but continued its \"suspension\" of\n\nprogramming produced by members of the public.           Despite repeated\n\nassurances   by   Biddeford    that    it   was   actively   reviewing   and\n\nrewriting its entire public access policy, in December 2002,\n\nBiddeford filed a status report and request for dismissal.               The\n\nCity said inter alia:         \"Granting any of this requested relief\n\n[sought by the plaintiff] will be meaningless, unless the City of\n\nBiddeford chooses to provide a public access channel.\"            At most,\n\nthe relief sought would lead to \"a possible order to allow the\n\nPlaintiff to broadcast programming on a channel that may not\n\nexist.\"\n\n     It is unclear whether further representations were made by\n\nBiddeford in further submissions or in any oral hearing that may\n\nhave been held but no such representations are set forth in its\n\nbrief on this appeal.   Pertinently, that brief says the following:\n\n     In the fall of 2002, Biddeford reopened its public access\n     channel only for school-sponsored programming, as well as\n     city council and planning and zoning board meetings. . .\n     . In December 2002, the court concluded that Biddeford's\n     public access channel no longer provided a forum for any\n     public access, including LaFortune, and dismissed the\n     complaint as moot.\n\nWhat led the court to so conclude is not stated in the brief.\n\nAlthough the brief goes on to describe the elimination of public\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\faccess as \"permanent,\" there is no reference to any fact to support\n\nsuch a label.\n\n      The    district    court's    order     also   describes   no   specific\n\nrepresentation by Biddeford.         It says in relevant part:\n\n      After repeated assurances to this court that its whole\n      public access program was being rewritten, and after the\n      interim reinstatement of public meeting broadcasting,\n      Biddeford now seemingly takes the position that no\n      further change is any longer in the offing. The most\n      recently announced position leads me to the conclusion\n      that this lawsuit is now moot.\n\nMissing from this is any express representation by Biddeford that\n\nit   has    determined   permanently     to    discontinue   public    access.\n\nPossibly, based on repeated delays in producing the promised new\n\nregime for reopening public access, the district court made a\n\npractical judgment that resumption of full-scale public access was\n\nunlikely.    In any event, it dismissed the case as moot (albeit with\n\nsome expressed misgivings).\n\n      We are not persuaded on this record that Biddeford carried its\n\n\"heavy burden\" to show that this case is moot, a burden that has a\n\nspecial bite when the mootness claim is based on voluntary action--\n\nor in this case inaction--by the party who is attempting to invoke\n\nthe doctrine.     See Conservation Law Foundation v. Evans, 360 F.3d\n\n21, 24-27 (1st Cir. 2004).         In the absence of a well-supported and\n\ncredible express representation by Biddeford that full-scale public\n\naccess is permanently off the table, we see no way to sustain a\n\nfinding of mootness.       Possibly on remand the district court can\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fpoint to prior statements, or new ones may be forthcoming, to show\n\nthat Biddeford has permanently eliminated full-scale public access.\n\n     Whether such a representation, if adequately supported and\n\nfound credible, would render the case moot is not entirely clear.\n\nAlthough Lafortune's various complaints and brief on appeal are not\n\ncrystal clear, there is a suggestion in her brief on appeal that\n\nshe regards Biddeford as having reinstated public access while\n\nselectively limiting who may use it; and, on this ground, or as\n\nredress for past abuse, she may be charging that Biddeford is now\n\nforced to provide access to her.       Whether she chooses to develop\n\nsuch a nascent argument on remand, or whether it has any merit, are\n\nissues to be settled in the district court.         We mention these\n\npossibilities only to make clear that we have not foreclosed them\n\nby   referring    to   the   inadequacy    of   Biddeford's   current\n\nrepresentation.\n\n     The order of the district court dismissing the case is vacated\n\nand the matter remanded for further proceedings.      This is without\n\nprejudice to a further order finding mootness on a more developed\n\nrecord.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
