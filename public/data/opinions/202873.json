Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                 Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges,\n                      and Lisi,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     James B.

This case, arising under the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1001-1461, involves an unfortunately frequent scenario.\n\nThe defendant's ERISA plan documents and Summary Plan Description\n\nare clear in their terms as to plan benefits.             Nonetheless, a\n\nrepresentative of the plan sponsor gave an employee incorrect\n\ninformation. The employee claims to have relied on the information\n\nprovided; the company refuses to pay benefits on the grounds that\n\nthere was a failure to comply with the terms of the plan documents.\n\nSee Law v. Ernst & Young, 956 F.2d 364, 368-72 (1st Cir. 1992);\n\nFlorence Nightingale Nursing Servs. v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,\n\nNo. 94-1754, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 17506, at *9 (1st Cir. July 19,\n\n1995); see also, e.g., Mello v. Sara Lee Corp., 431 F.3d 440, 442-\n\n43 (5th Cir. 2005); Frahm v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y of the\n\nU.S., 137 F.3d 955, 956-57 (7th Cir. 1998); HealthSouth Rehab.\n\nHosp. v. Am. Nat'l Red Cross, 101 F.3d 1005, 1006-08 (4th Cir.\n\n1996); Greany v. W. Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co., 973 F.2d 812, 814-\n\n16, 822 (9th Cir. 1992).      A variant on this fact pattern occurs\n\nwhen the company representative fails to give information about the\n\noptions that are available. See, e.g., Watson v. Deaconess Waltham\n\nHosp., 298 F.3d 102 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          In   this   case,   Diane   Todisco    filed   suit   to   obtain\n\nsupplemental   life   insurance   benefits      from   defendant     Verizon\n\nCommunications, Inc., based on an election made by her now-deceased\n\n                                  -2-\n\fhusband, Richard Todisco.       Mr. Todisco made that election in\n\nreliance on incorrect information that Verizon provided to him\n\norally over Verizon's telephone hotline.           The essence of Mrs.\n\nTodisco's present claim is that equitable estoppel should operate\n\nto force Verizon to pay benefits.\n\n           The district court dismissed the suit on the pleadings,\n\nand then denied a motion to amend on the grounds of futility.\n\nFollowing Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson, 534\n\nU.S. 204 (2002), and Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U.S. 248\n\n(1993), the district court concluded that Mrs. Todisco did not seek\n\n\"appropriate equitable relief\" that could be awarded under ERISA's\n\nsection 502(a)(3).    We affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           This case is on appeal from the district court's denial\n\nof plaintiff's motion to file a third amended complaint.              We\n\ndescribe the facts as set out in that proposed complaint.\n\n           For many years, Mr. Todisco worked as an employee of\n\nVerizon and its predecessor companies, which we collectively refer\n\nto as \"Verizon.\"    Under Verizon's ERISA-covered benefit plan, Mr.\n\nTodisco was automatically enrolled in a \"Basic Life Insurance\n\nPolicy\" with an $88,000 death benefit.      Mrs. Todisco was named the\n\nbeneficiary on that policy.\n\n           Verizon maintained a telephone hotline for employees who\n\nhad   questions   about   employee    benefit   programs.   On   several\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\foccasions between November 1999 and January 2000, Mr. Todisco\n\ncalled this hotline to ask questions about his options for adding\n\nsupplemental life insurance.           He was informed that during an \"open\n\nenrollment period,\" he had the right to increase the level of his\n\ninsurance benefits to $176,000 without submitting any statement of\n\nhis current health. Based on this information, Mr. Todisco elected\n\nto purchase the supplemental coverage, and he named his wife as the\n\nbeneficiary on this additional coverage.                   He did not submit a\n\nstatement of health.1              Additionally, in reliance on Verizon's\n\nstatements, Mr. Todisco removed his wife as the beneficiary on his\n\nbasic       life    insurance     policy   and    replaced     her   with   his   two\n\ndaughters.          At the time Mr. Todisco made these decisions, he\n\nsuffered from serious mental and physical health problems.                    It is\n\nnot clear whether he could have submitted a statement of health\n\nthat        would   have   been    adequate      to   render   him   eligible     for\n\nsupplemental life insurance.\n\n                Mr. Todisco died shortly after making these decisions,\n\nand Verizon later paid the $88,000 basic life insurance benefit to\n\nMr. Todisco's daughters. However, Verizon did not pay Mrs. Todisco\n\nthe additional $88,000 in supplemental insurance benefits; its\n\nbasis for this was that Mr. Todisco had failed to comply with the\n\n\n        1\n       There are no allegations that Mr. Todisco ever paid any\npremiums for this supplemental life insurance. Evidence submitted\nat earlier stages in the case suggested that premiums were not\nbeing withheld from Mr. Todisco's paycheck, which prompted Mr.\nTodisco to make additional calls to Verizon's hotline.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fterms of its benefits plan, which required Mr. Todisco to fill out\n\na statement of health form in order to be eligible for supplemental\n\ninsurance.\n\n                 In October 2001, Mrs. Todisco sued Verizon in state court\n\non a state law claim for breach of contract.                      Verizon removed the\n\ncase to federal district court.                   On July 30, 2002, the suit was\n\ndismissed         as    preempted      by   ERISA    after     plaintiff      refused   to\n\nstipulate that her claim should be treated as an ERISA claim.2\n\n                 Mrs. Todisco then filed a motion to vacate the judgment,\n\nwhich the district court granted, and on October 31, 2002, she\n\nfiled       an   amended     complaint        asserting   a    claim    for    breach   of\n\nfiduciary duty under ERISA. Some nineteen days later, Mrs. Todisco\n\nfiled a second amended complaint, this one adding a claim under\n\nERISA for reformation of the plan documents and seeking benefits\n\nunder the reformed plan documents.                   Over Verizon's objection, the\n\ndistrict         court    permitted      the    filing    of     this   second   amended\n\ncomplaint.             Verizon   did    not    dispute    that    the   second   amended\n\ncomplaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n                 Verizon moved for judgment on the pleadings, which the\n\ndistrict court granted on August 25, 2004.3                      In a cogent opinion,\n\n\n        2\n       Mrs. Todisco makes no claim on appeal that the state law\nclaim is not preempted.\n        3\n       In the motion's \"statement of facts\" section, Verizon noted\nthe second amended complaint's allegation that Mr. Todisco had been\ngiven wrong information, and Verizon further noted that plaintiff\nwas not claiming any entitlement to benefits under the plan. In\n\n                                               -5-\n\fthe court ruled that the facts plaintiff described could not\n\nentitle her to the reformation remedy that she sought or to an\n\naward of money damages. The court nonetheless stated that it would\n\ngive Mrs. Todisco the opportunity to try and advance a claim for\n\nequitable estoppel, and so the court granted her leave to file a\n\nmotion to amend the complaint for this purpose.\n\n          Mrs. Todisco filed such a motion on October 29, 2004, and\n\nher proposed third amended complaint requested that Verizon pay her\n\nthe $88,000 in supplemental life insurance benefits. But while the\n\nproposed complaint contained a claim for equitable estoppel, it\n\nalso set out a separate claim that Mrs. Todisco was in fact\n\nentitled to benefits under the plan's terms.   At an oral hearing,\n\nthe district court remarked that this second claim went beyond the\n\nscope of the court's leave, and that it was \"inconsistent with all\n\nof [plaintiff's] previous allegations.\"    Counsel clarified that\n\nMrs. Todisco was not claiming that she was actually entitled to\n\nbenefits under the plan, but rather that she sought estoppel to\n\n\n\n\nresponse, Mrs. Todisco stated that she largely agreed with\nVerizon's characterization of her allegations, although she\nclarified that she was claiming that she was entitled to plan\nbenefits if the court granted her request to reform the plan\ndocuments. Mrs. Todisco did not otherwise contend that the plan\nterms were subject to an interpretation under which she would be\neligible for benefits. When the district court granted Verizon's\nmotion, its description of the facts included the statement that\n\"[u]nder the written terms of the plan, [Mr. Todisco] was not\nentitled to the additional coverage without supplying a statement\nof health. This had not been done.\"\n\n                               -6-\n\falter the plan terms; she believed she was entitled to benefits\n\nunder those altered terms.\n\n             The district court denied the plaintiff's motion to amend\n\nbecause it would be futile.               First, the court explained that\n\nplaintiff was seeking compensatory monetary damages, not equitable\n\nrelief. Relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Great-West, the\n\ndistrict court held that the requested award of damages could not\n\nbe granted under ERISA's section 502(a)(3).                   Second, the court\n\nexplained    that   Mrs.    Todisco's      estoppel     claim    failed     for   an\n\nindependent reason.        In the court's view, an ERISA plaintiff could\n\nonly assert a claim for equitable estoppel when the defendant's\n\nmisrepresentation concerned a plan provision about which there\n\ncould be reasonable disagreement.           Otherwise, any reliance by the\n\nplaintiff would be unreasonable.             Since Verizon's plan was not\n\nambiguous, the court concluded that Mrs. Todisco's claim was not\n\nviable.\n\n             Mrs. Todisco timely appealed.         She argues only that the\n\ndenial of her motion to amend was erroneous.\n\n                                      II.\n\n             When a district court denies a motion for leave to amend\n\nthe complaint, our review is for abuse of discretion.                     Universal\n\nCommc'n Sys., Inc. v. Lycos, Inc., 478 F.3d 413, 418 (1st Cir.\n\n2007); see also Adorno v. Crowley Towing & Transp. Co., 443 F.3d\n\n122,   126   (1st   Cir.    2006)   (an    error   of   law     is   an   abuse   of\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fdiscretion).       In our review, we must defer to the district court\n\n\"for any adequate reason apparent from the record.\"                  Resolution\n\nTrust Corp. v. Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir. 1994).           Futility of\n\nthe amendment constitutes an adequate reason to deny the motion to\n\namend.    Adorno, 443 F.3d at 126.       The motion may also be denied if\n\na proffered amendment comes \"too late,\" or if it \"otherwise would\n\nserve no useful purpose.\" Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R., 445 F.3d\n\n50, 58 (1st Cir. 2006).           The district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in this case.\n\nA.          The ERISA Remedial Scheme\n\n            ERISA    is   a   \"comprehensive    and    reticulated    statute,\"\n\nNachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 446 U.S. 359, 361\n\n(1980),    which     reflects    significant     congressional       study   and\n\ncompromise.        Mertens, 508 U.S. at 251, 262-63.             Within that\n\ncompromise, ERISA's section 502, 29 U.S.C. § 1132, governs civil\n\nenforcement.       See Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S.\n\n134, 139-40 (1985).       Two provisions in section 502 are at the heart\n\nof this case.\n\n            Section       502(a)(1)(B)      empowers    a   \"participant     or\n\nbeneficiary\" to bring suit \"to recover benefits due to him under\n\nthe terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the\n\nplan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms\n\nof the plan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). Section 502(a)(3) allows\n\na \"participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary\" to sue \"(A) to enjoin\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fany act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter\n\nor the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate\n\nequitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce\n\nany provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.\"           Id.\n\n§ 1132(a)(3).\n\n           Mrs. Todisco contends that in seeking to apply equitable\n\nestoppel, she is simply seeking \"appropriate equitable relief\"\n\nwithin the meaning of section 502(a)(3)(B).          In the alternative,\n\nshe contends that equitable estoppel should operate to allow her to\n\nseek benefits due to her under the terms of her plan within the\n\nmeaning of section 502(a)(1)(B).\n\nB.         The Section 502(a)(3)(B) Claim\n\n           Mrs. Todisco's first argument is foreclosed by Supreme\n\nCourt precedent.4    In Mertens, the Court interpreted the phrase\n\n\"appropriate equitable relief\" to exclude claims for compensatory\n\nmonetary damages, which the Court deemed a classic form of legal\n\nrelief.    See 508 U.S. at 255.       The Court held that the phrase\n\nreferred   \"to   those   categories   of   relief   that   were   typically\n\navailable in equity (such as injunction, mandamus, and restitution,\n\nbut not compensatory damages).\"       Id. at 256.\n\n\n\n     4\n       Several of our decisions have assumed, without deciding,\nthat a claim for equitable estoppel is viable in this circuit.\nThose cases proceeded to reject those claims on the facts\npresented.   See, e.g., Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan for\nSalaried Employees, 239 F.3d 51, 57 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting that\nthe issue remains open in this circuit); Law, 956 F.2d at 371 n.9.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f            This interpretation was further confirmed by Great-West,\n\nwhich held that even certain forms of restitution do not constitute\n\n\"equitable relief\" within the meaning of section 502(a)(3)(B). 534\n\nU.S. at 214.      Great-West involved a claim for restitution that the\n\nCourt characterized as an attempt to \"impos[e] personal liability\n\non [defendants] for a contractual obligation to pay money.\" Id. at\n\n221. Great-West held that despite the invocation of \"restitution,\"\n\nthe claim was still essentially an action at law.             Id. at 213-14.\n\nThe Court distinguished suits for equitable restitution, which it\n\ndescribed    as   suits   that   aimed   to   \"restore   to   the   plaintiff\n\nparticular funds or property in the defendant's possession.\"               Id.\n\nat 214 (emphasis added); cf. Sereboff v. Mid Atl. Med. Servs., 126\n\nS. Ct. 1869, 1874 (2006) (finding that when a plaintiff seeks\n\n\"recovery through a constructive trust or equitable lien on a\n\nspecifically identified fund, not from the [defendants'] assets\n\ngenerally,\" the suit is one for equitable restitution and thus\n\npermissible under section 502(a)(3)(B)).            Although Mrs. Todisco\n\nasserts that Great-West has subsequently been overruled by the\n\nCourt's decision in Sereboff, that is plainly incorrect.             Sereboff\n\nexplicitly     distinguished     Great-West   on   the   grounds    that   the\n\nplaintiff in Great-West did not seek equitable restitution, as that\n\nplaintiff had not sought the recovery of specifically identifiable\n\nfunds in the possession of the defendant.          See 126 S. Ct. at 1873-\n\n74.\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f            Under Mertens and Great-West, Mrs. Todisco plainly seeks\n\nlegal   relief:     she    seeks   nothing        less   than   the   imposition   of\n\nliability on Verizon, in the form of compensatory monetary damages,\n\nbecause of Verizon's failure to honor the oral representation it\n\nmade to her husband that he did not need to submit a statement of\n\ncurrent health in order to obtain supplemental life insurance.\n\nAccord Slice v. Sons of Nor., 34 F.3d 630, 632-33 (8th Cir. 1994)\n\n(finding that an equitable estoppel claim was foreclosed by Mertens\n\nbecause    it    sought    compensatory       monetary     damages);    Watkins    v.\n\nWestinghouse Hanford Co., 12 F.3d 1517, 1527-28 (9th Cir. 1993)\n\n(same); see also Armstrong v. Jefferson Smurfit Corp., 30 F.3d 11,\n\n13 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that after Mertens, compensatory legal\n\ndamages do not constitute \"appropriate equitable relief\").\n\n            Nor does it matter that Mrs. Todisco claims to be seeking\n\nreliance damages (i.e. the $88,000 in benefits that she lost when\n\nher husband removed her as the beneficiary on his basic life\n\ninsurance policy), rather than expectation damages. That claim for\n\nreliance    damages       is   still   a    claim    for   compensatory    monetary\n\ndamages.        It also does not resemble the kinds of relief that\n\nMertens and Great-West have classified as equitable.                    See Callery\n\nv. U.S. Life Ins. Co. in the City of N.Y., 392 F.3d 401, 405-06\n\n(10th Cir. 2004).          Indeed, reliance damages could not have been\n\n\"typically available in equity,\" Great-West, 534 U.S. at 211, as\n\nthe very idea of recovery for reliance damages lacked a firm\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fconceptual footing until after the era of the divided bench.\n\nCompare C. McCormick, The Fusion of Law and Equity in United States\n\nCourts, 6 N.C. L. Rev. 283, 284 (1928) (noting that the merger of\n\nlaw and equity was largely complete by 1928), with L. Fuller & W.\n\nPerdue, The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages, 46 Yale L.J.\n\n373, 418-19 (1937) (arguing, in a 1937 law review article often\n\ncredited as cohering the modern concept of reliance damages, that\n\nthe   law   ought    to    explicitly    recognize     the   award    of    reliance\n\ndamages), and W. Slawson, The Role of Reliance in Contract Damages,\n\n76    Cornell   L.    Rev.   197,     198-202    (1990)    (tracing     the   modern\n\nunderstanding        of    reliance    damages    to      discussions      over   the\n\nRestatement (First) of Contracts, which was published in 1932).\n\nSee also 3 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence § 813, at 234 (5th ed.\n\n1941) (stating that equitable estoppel \"operates to put the party\n\nentitled to its benefit in the same position as if the thing\n\nrepresented were true\"); Fuller & Perdue, supra, at 406 (noting\n\nthat then-contemporary authorities assumed that recovery on an\n\nestoppel theory would be for expectation damages).\n\n            In the face of this adverse authority, Mrs. Todisco\n\nsuggests    that     our   circuit    has   nonetheless      permitted      contrary\n\nresults.

Boston Shipping Ass'n, 471\n\nF.3d 229 (1st Cir. 2006), plaintiff contends that this court has\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\ftaken a more \"latitudinarian attitude\" to the phrase \"appropriate\n\nequitable relief.\"\n\n          Mrs. Todisco misreads these cases.          Both Glista and Bard\n\ninvolved only claims for benefits due under the plan.           See Bard,\n\n471 F.3d at 234; Glista, 378 F.3d at 119.         Neither of those cases\n\ncomes within the compass of either Mertens or Great-West, as this\n\ncase does.      These cases do not stand for the proposition that\n\ncompensatory monetary damages are \"appropriate equitable relief\"\n\nunder section 502(a)(3)(B).        They hold only that when a court is\n\nconfronted      with   a    claim      for    benefits      pursuant     to\n\nsection 502(a)(1)(B), the court may invoke certain substantive\n\nequitable principles, in certain narrow factual circumstances, in\n\norder to adjudicate that claim for benefits.          Cf. 1 D. Dobbs, Law\n\nof Remedies § 2.1(3), at 62-66 (2d ed. 1993) (distinguishing the\n\nconcept of an \"equitable remedy,\" which refers to the kinds of\n\nrelief   traditionally     accorded    in    courts    of   equity,    with\n\n\"substantive\"    equity,   which    refers   to   certain   principles   of\n\nsubstantive law that could be described as fair or just); id.\n\n§ 2.3(5), at 84 (characterizing equitable estoppel as fitting\n\nwithin the rubric of \"substantive equity\").\n\nC.        The Section 502(a)(1)(B) Claim\n\n          Mrs. Todisco's alternative theory tries to recast her\n\nclaim as one for benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B).         This theory\n\nentails two steps. First, she asks us to invoke equitable estoppel\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fbased on Verizon's misrepresentations to her husband.                          As she\n\nenvisions        it,    this    would    bar   Verizon     from    asserting   that   a\n\nstatement of health form was required during an open enrollment\n\nperiod.         Second, Mrs. Todisco asks us to allow her to claim, under\n\na   reformulated        plan,     the    benefits   that    were    promised   to   her\n\nhusband.        With Verizon barred from invoking the actual language of\n\nits plan, she believes that this claim will be successful.\n\n                 This approach is not permitted by ERISA's text.               Section\n\n502(a)(1)(B) allows a plaintiff to sue only for benefits \"due to\n\nhim under the terms of his plan.\"                      29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B)\n\n(emphasis added).              Here, the plan unambiguously stated that Mr.\n\nTodisco was ineligible to add supplemental life insurance without\n\nsubmitting a statement of health form.5                    Since it is undisputed\n\nthat       he   never   submitted       this   form,   Mrs.   Todisco's   claim     for\n\nbenefits is plainly not a suit for benefits under the terms of the\n\nplan.       Instead, she expressly seeks benefits not authorized by the\n\nplan's terms.\n\n\n\n       5\n       In her proposed third amended complaint, Mrs. Todisco\nalleges that the plan terms are ambiguous as to open enrollment\nperiods.   However, we understand the district court to have\nessentially disregarded this allegation as beyond the scope of the\ncourt's permission, and/or as inconsistent with the plan documents\nthemselves (which had been provided to the court at earlier stages\nin the case).    We see no abuse of discretion in the court's\ndecision to deem the plan terms unambiguous for purposes of\nadjudicating the motion for leave to amend.         Indeed, while\nplaintiff's counsel pointed out to the district court that there\nwas an allegation of ambiguity, counsel also told the court: \"I\nguess if you've got the plan, you can look at it.\"\n\n                                           -14-\n\f          In a case decided post-Mertens, but before Great-West,\n\nthe   Ninth    Circuit     invoked   this     same   reading   of     section\n\n502(a)(1)(B); the court accordingly rejected an attempt by several\n\nplaintiffs to circumvent the fact that their equitable estoppel\n\nclaim was foreclosed by Mertens.         See Watkins, 12 F.3d at 1527-28.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit has also reasoned similarly. See Slice, 34 F.3d\n\nat 631-32 & n.5.\n\n          Mrs. Todisco contends that this circuit's decisions in\n\nGlista and Bard have approved the kind of two-step process she\n\nseeks here.    She is wrong.\n\n          In Glista, the plaintiff brought a claim for disability\n\nbenefits after the defendant plan administrator denied plaintiff's\n\nclaim in administrative proceedings.          See Glista, 378 F.3d at 119.\n\nThroughout the administrative proceedings, the defendant had relied\n\non one plan provision as its basis for denying benefits.              Id. at\n\n118-19.       Once   the   case   went   to   litigation,   the     defendant\n\nadditionally argued that benefits were barred based on a different\n\nplan provision.      Id. at 119-20.      After reviewing ERISA's notice\n\nregulations, the burdens of proof in traditional insurance law, the\n\nplan's own notice requirements, the fact that the defendant had not\n\njustified its earlier failure to inform the plaintiff about this\n\nalternative ground for denial, and the plaintiff's need for a\n\nresolution, we invoked certain equitable considerations to bar the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fdefendant from relying on its newly-articulated rationale. See id.\n\nat 128-32.\n\n            Bard also involved a plaintiff who sued the defendant\n\nplan after it denied his claim for disability benefits.           Through\n\nmost   of    the   administrative   proceedings,   the   defendant   plan\n\nrepeatedly failed to comply with ERISA's notice requirements, with\n\nthe result that the plaintiff was initially unaware that the\n\ndefendant interpreted an ambiguous plan term in a manner that\n\ndiffered from the plaintiff's reasonable understanding.         Bard, 471\n\nF.3d at 237-40.     As a result, the plaintiff believed that the plan\n\ndid not require him to have become disabled before his employment\n\nended, and he submitted medical evidence showing that he became\n\ntotally disabled after his termination.       Id. at 241.    When the plan\n\nbelatedly informed him of its differing view of the plan terms, the\n\nplaintiff submitted new medical evidence in support of his claim,\n\nwhich the plan then rejected as not consistent with the plaintiff's\n\nearlier submissions.     Id. at 241-43.    Based on these facts, as well\n\nas a plethora of ERISA regulatory violations, we cited Glista and\n\ninvoked equitable principles to undo the prejudice that resulted\n\nfrom the defendant's ERISA violations: we barred the defendant from\n\nrelying on the earlier medical evidence submitted.          Id. at 244-45.\n\nBecause the plaintiff's remaining evidence showed that he was\n\nentitled to benefits under the defendant's interpretation of the\n\nplan, we ordered an award of benefits.        Id. at 245-46.\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f              Both Glista and Bard put significant weight on the fact\n\nthat the plan's administrative claims process had been appreciably\n\ncompromised by the defendants. See id. at 244-45; Glista, 378 F.3d\n\nat 128-30.       Here there is no allegation that Verizon denied\n\nbenefits to Mrs. Todisco on a rationale different than what Verizon\n\nstated   to    her,   nor   is   there    an    allegation   that   Verizon   has\n\notherwise failed to comply with ERISA's regulatory requirements for\n\nclaims proceedings.\n\n              There is an even more fundamental problem with Mrs.\n\nTodisco's reliance on Glista and Bard.               To the extent that both\n\ndecisions employed \"equitable\" principles en route to an award of\n\nbenefits under section 502(a)(1)(B), both did so in the context of\n\nreasonable claims that the plaintiff was actually entitled to\n\nbenefits under the terms of the plan documents.                 Mrs. Todisco's\n\nclaim is entirely different. Because the plan's language is clear,\n\nand because Mr. Todisco indisputably did not take the actions that\n\nthis language required, plaintiff cannot reasonably claim that her\n\nsuit is a suit for benefits due under the terms of the plan.\n\nAccordingly, section 502(a)(1)(B) does not permit Mrs. Todisco's\n\nsuit.\n\n                                         III.\n\n              In the end, Mrs. Todisco's argument amounts to a claim\n\nthat on the facts of her case, she must be entitled to some sort of\n\nERISA remedy.     That claim may have particularly sympathetic appeal\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fin light of ERISA's broad preemption of state remedies.                See Aetna\n\nHealth Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200, 222 (2004) (Ginsburg, J.,\n\nconcurring) (expressing dismay that the Court's narrow construction\n\nof   the   term   \"equitable    relief,\"      coupled   with    ERISA's   broad\n\npreemptive force, has created a troubling legal void for persons\n\naffected by ERISA wrongdoings). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has\n\nunambiguously     held   that   such    considerations    may    not   overcome\n\nERISA's textual commands.       See Great-West, 534 U.S. at 220-21.\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed. No costs\n\nare awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\f",

The defendant's ERISA plan documents and Summary Plan Description are clear in their terms as to plan benefits. Nonetheless, a representative of the plan sponsor gave an employee incorrect information. The employee claims to have relied on the information provided; the company refuses to pay benefits on the grounds that there was a failure to comply with the terms of the plan documents. <i>See </i><i>Law v. Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 956 F.2d 364, 368-72 (1st Cir.1992); <i>Florence Nightingale Nursing Servs. v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> No. 94-1754, 1995 WL 422863, at *3, 1995 U.S.App. LEXIS 17506, at *9 (1st Cir. July 19, 1995); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Mello v. Sara Lee Corp.,</i> 431 F.3d 440, 442-43 (5th Cir. 2005); <i>Frahm v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y of the U.S.,</i> 137 F.3d 955, 956-57 (7th Cir.1998); <i>HealthSouth Rehab. Hosp. v. Am.

A variant on this fact pattern occurs when the company representative fails to give information about the options that are available. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Watson v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp.,</i> 298 F.3d 102 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>In this case, Diane Todisco filed suit to obtain supplemental life insurance benefits from defendant Verizon Communications, Inc., based on an election made by her now-deceased husband, Richard Todisco. Mr. Todisco made that election in reliance on incorrect information that Verizon provided to him orally over Verizon's telephone hotline. The essence of Mrs. Todisco's present claim is that equitable estoppel should operate to force Verizon to pay benefits.</p>\n<p>The district court dismissed the suit on the pleadings, and then denied a motion to amend on the grounds of futility. Following <i>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson,</i> 534 U.S. 204, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635 (2002), and <i>Mertens v. Hewitt Associates,</i> 508 U.S. 248, 113 S.Ct. 2063, 124 L.Ed.2d 161 (1993), the district court concluded that Mrs. Todisco did not seek \"appropriate equitable relief\" that could be awarded under ERISA's section 502(a)(3). We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>This case is on appeal from the district court's denial of plaintiff's motion to file a third amended complaint. We describe the facts as set out in that proposed complaint.</p>\n<p>For many years, Mr. Todisco worked as an employee of Verizon and its predecessor companies, which we collectively refer to as \"Verizon.\" Under Verizon's ERISA-covered benefit plan, Mr. Todisco was automatically <span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> enrolled in a \"Basic Life Insurance Policy\" with an $88,000 death benefit. Mrs. Todisco was named the beneficiary on that policy.</p>\n<p>Verizon maintained a telephone hotline for employees who had questions about employee benefit programs. On several occasions between November 1999 and January 2000, Mr. Todisco called this hotline to ask questions about his options for adding supplemental life insurance. He was informed that during an \"open enrollment period,\" he had the right to increase the level of his insurance benefits to $176,000 without submitting any statement of his current health. Based on this information, Mr. Todisco elected to purchase the supplemental coverage, and he named his wife as the beneficiary on this additional coverage. He did not submit a statement of health.<sup>[1]</sup> Additionally, in reliance on Verizon's statements, Mr. Todisco removed his wife as the beneficiary on his basic life insurance policy and replaced her with his two daughters. At the time Mr. Todisco made these decisions, he suffered from serious mental and physical health problems. It is not clear whether he could have submitted a statement of health that would have been adequate to render him eligible for supplemental life insurance.</p>\n<p>Mr. Todisco died shortly after making these decisions, and Verizon later paid the $88,000 basic life insurance benefit to Mr. Todisco's daughters. However, Verizon did not pay Mrs. Todisco the additional $88,000 in supplemental insurance benefits; its basis for this was that Mr. Todisco had failed to comply with the terms of its benefits plan, which required Mr. Todisco to fill out a statement of health form in order to be eligible for supplemental insurance.</p>\n<p>In October 2001, Mrs. Todisco sued Verizon in state court on a state law claim for breach of contract. Verizon removed the case to federal district court. On July 30, 2002, the suit was dismissed as preempted by ERISA after plaintiff refused to stipulate that her claim should be treated as an ERISA claim.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco then filed a motion to vacate the judgment, which the district court granted, and on October 31, 2002, she filed an amended complaint asserting a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA. Some nineteen days later, Mrs. Todisco filed a second amended complaint, this one adding a claim under ERISA for reformation of the plan documents and seeking benefits under the reformed plan documents. Over Verizon's objection, the district court permitted the filing of this second amended complaint. Verizon did not dispute that the second amended complaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p>Verizon moved for judgment on the pleadings, which the district court granted on August 25, 2004.<sup>[3]</sup> In a cogent opinion, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> the court ruled that the facts plaintiff described could not entitle her to the reformation remedy that she sought or to an award of money damages. The court nonetheless stated that it would give Mrs. Todisco the opportunity to try and advance a claim for equitable estoppel, and so the court granted her leave to file a motion to amend the complaint for this purpose.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco filed such a motion on October 29, 2004, and her proposed third amended complaint requested that Verizon pay her the $88,000 in supplemental life insurance benefits. But while the proposed complaint contained a claim for equitable estoppel, it also set out a separate claim that Mrs. Todisco was in fact entitled to benefits under the plan's terms. At an oral hearing, the district court remarked that this second claim went beyond the scope of the court's leave, and that it was \"inconsistent with all of [plaintiff's] previous allegations.\" Counsel clarified that Mrs. Todisco was not claiming that she was actually entitled to benefits under the plan, but rather that she sought estoppel to alter the plan terms; she believed she was entitled to benefits under those altered terms.</p>\n<p>The district court denied the plaintiff's motion to amend because it would be futile. First, the court explained that plaintiff was seeking compensatory monetary damages, not equitable relief. Relying on the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Great-West,</i> the district court held that the requested award of damages could not be granted under ERISA's section 502(a)(3). Second, the court explained that Mrs. Todisco's estoppel claim failed for an independent reason. In the court's view, an ERISA plaintiff could only assert a claim for equitable estoppel when the defendant's misrepresentation concerned a plan provision about which there could be reasonable disagreement. Otherwise, any reliance by the plaintiff would be unreasonable. Since Verizon's plan was not ambiguous, the court concluded that Mrs. Todisco's claim was not viable.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco timely appealed. She argues only that the denial of her motion to amend was erroneous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>When a district court denies a motion for leave to amend the complaint, our review is for abuse of discretion. <i>Universal Commc'n Sys., Inc. v. Lycos, Inc.,</i> 478 F.3d 413, 418 (1st Cir.2007); <i>see also </i><i>Adorn v. Crowley Towing &amp; Transp. Co.,</i> 443 F.3d 122, 126 (1st Cir.2006) (an error of law is an abuse of discretion). In our review, we must defer to the district court \"for any adequate reason apparent from the record.\" <i>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold,</i> 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir.1994). Futility of the amendment constitutes an adequate reason to deny the motion to amend. <i>Adorno,</i> 443 F.3d at 126. The motion may also be denied if a proffered amendment comes \"too late,\" or if it \"otherwise would serve no useful purpose.\" <i>Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> 445 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir.2006). The district court did not abuse its discretion in this case.</p>\n<p>A. <i>The ERISA Remedial Scheme</i></p>\n<p>ERISA is a \"comprehensive and reticulated statute,\" <i>Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp.,</i> 446 U.S. 359, 361, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980), which reflects significant congressional study and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> compromise. <i>Mertens,</i> 508 U.S. at 251, 262-63, 113 S.Ct. 2063. Within that compromise, ERISA's section 502, 29 U.S.C. § 1132, governs civil enforcement. <i>See </i><i>Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,</i> 473 U.S. 134, 139-40, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985). Two provisions in section 502 are at the heart of this case.</p>\n<p>Section 502(a)(1)(B) empowers a \"participant or beneficiary\" to bring suit \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). Section 502(a)(3) allows a \"participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary\" to sue \"(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1132(a)(3).</p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco contends that in seeking to apply equitable estoppel, she is simply seeking \"appropriate equitable relief\" within the meaning of section 502(a)(3)(B). In the alternative, she contends that equitable estoppel should operate to allow her to seek benefits due to her under the terms of her plan within the meaning of section 502(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>B. <i>The Section 502(a)(3)(B) Claim</i></p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco's first argument is foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent.<sup>[4]</sup> In <i>Mertens,</i> the Court interpreted the phrase \"appropriate equitable relief\" to exclude claims for compensatory monetary damages, which the Court deemed a classic form of <i>legal</i> relief. <i>See</i> 508 U.S. at 255, 113 S.Ct. 2063. The Court held that the phrase referred \"to those categories of relief that were <i>typically</i> available in equity (such as injunction, mandamus, and restitution, but not compensatory damages).\" <i>Id.</i> at 256, 113 S.Ct. 2063.</p>\n<p>This interpretation was further confirmed by <i>Great-West,</i> which held that even certain forms of restitution do not constitute \"equitable relief\" within the meaning of section 502(a)(3)(B). 534 U.S. at 214, 122 S.Ct. 708. <i>Great-West</i> involved a claim for restitution that the Court characterized as an attempt to \"impos[e] personal liability on [defendants] for a contractual obligation to pay money.\" <i>Id.</i> at 221. <i>Great-West</i> held that despite the invocation of \"restitution,\" the claim was still essentially an action at law. <i>Id.</i> at 213-14, 122 S.Ct. 708. The Court distinguished suits for equitable restitution, which it described as suits that aimed to \"restore to the plaintiff <i>particular</i> funds or property in the defendant's possession.\" <i>Id.</i> at 214, 122 S.Ct. 708 (emphasis added); <i>cf. </i><i>Sereboff v. Mid Atl. Med. Servs.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1869, 1874, 164 L.Ed.2d 612 (2006) (finding that when a plaintiff seeks \"recovery through a constructive trust or equitable lien on a specifically identified fund, not from the [defendants'] assets generally,\" the suit is one for equitable restitution and thus permissible under section 502(a)(3)(B)). Although Mrs. Todisco asserts that <i>Great-West</i> has subsequently been overruled by the Court's decision in <i>Sereboff,</i> that is plainly incorrect. <i>Sereboff</i> explicitly distinguished <i>Great-West</i> on the grounds that the plaintiff in <i>Great-West</i> did not seek equitable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> restitution, as that plaintiff had not sought the recovery of specifically identifiable funds in the possession of the defendant. <i>See</i> 126 S.Ct. at 1873-74.</p>\n<p>Under <i>Mertens</i> and <i>Great-West,</i> Mrs. Todisco plainly seeks legal relief: she seeks nothing less than the imposition of liability on Verizon, in the form of compensatory monetary damages, because of Verizon's failure to honor the oral representation it made to her husband that he did not need to submit a statement of current health in order to obtain supplemental life insurance. <i>Accord </i><i>Slice v. Sons of Nor.,</i> 34 F.3d 630, 632-33 (8th Cir.1994) (finding that an equitable estoppel claim was foreclosed by <i>Mertens</i> because it sought compensatory monetary damages); <i>Watkins v. Westinghouse Hanford Co.,</i> 12 F.3d 1517, 1527-28 (9th Cir.1993) (same); <i>see also </i><i>Armstrong v. Jefferson Smurfit Corp.,</i> 30 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that after <i>Mertens,</i> compensatory legal damages do not constitute \"appropriate equitable relief\").</p>\n<p>Nor does it matter that Mrs. Todisco claims to be seeking reliance damages (i.e. the $88,000 in benefits that she lost when her husband removed her as the beneficiary on his basic life insurance policy), rather than expectation damages. That claim for reliance damages is still a claim for compensatory monetary damages. It also does not resemble the kinds of relief that <i>Mertens</i> and <i>Great-West</i> have classified as equitable. <i>See </i><i>Callery v. U.S. Life Ins. Co. in the City of N.Y.,</i> 392 F.3d 401, 405-06 (10th Cir.2004). Indeed, reliance damages could not have been \"typically available in equity,\" <i>Great-West,</i> 534 U.S. at 211, 122 S.Ct. 708, as the very idea of recovery for reliance damages lacked a firm conceptual footing until after the era of the divided bench. <i>Compare</i> C. McCormick, <i>The Fusion of Law and Equity in United States Courts,</i> 6 N.C. L.Rev. 283, 284 (1928) (noting that the merger of law and equity was largely complete by 1928), <i>with</i> L. Fuller &amp; W. Perdue, <i>The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages,</i> 46 Yale L.J. 373, 418-19 (1937) (arguing, in a 1937 law review article often credited as cohering the modern concept of reliance damages, that the law ought to explicitly recognize the award of reliance damages), <i>and</i> W. Slawson, <i>The Role of Reliance in Contract Damages,</i> 76 Cornell L.Rev. 197, 198-202 (1990) (tracing the modern understanding of reliance damages to discussions over the <i>Restatement (First) of Contracts,</i> which was published in 1932). <i>See also</i> 3 <i>Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence</i> § 813, at 234 (5th ed.1941) (stating that equitable estoppel \"operates to put the party entitled to its benefit in the same position as if the thing represented were true\"); Fuller &amp; Perdue, <i>supra,</i> at 406 (noting that then-contemporary authorities assumed that recovery on an estoppel theory would be for expectation damages).</p>\n<p>In the face of this adverse authority, Mrs. Todisco suggests that our circuit has nonetheless permitted contrary results. Citing <i>Glista v. Unum Life Insurance Co. of America,</i> 378 F.3d 113 (1st Cir.2004), and <i>Bard v. Boston Shipping Ass'n,</i> 471 F.3d 229 (1st Cir.2006), plaintiff contends that this court has taken a more \"latitudinarian attitude\" to the phrase \"appropriate equitable relief.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco misreads these cases. Both <i>Glista</i> and <i>Bard</i> involved only <i>claims for benefits due under the plan. See </i><i>Bard,</i> 471 F.3d at 234; <i>Glista,</i> 378 F.3d at 119. Neither of those cases comes within the compass of either <i>Mertens</i> or <i>Great-West,</i> as this case does. These cases do not stand for the proposition that compensatory monetary damages are \"appropriate equitable relief\" under section 502(a)(3)(B). They hold only that when a court is confronted with a claim for benefits pursuant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> to section 502(a)(1)(B), the court may invoke certain substantive equitable principles, in certain narrow factual circumstances, in order to adjudicate that claim for benefits. <i>Cf.</i> 1 D. Dobbs, <i>Law of Remedies</i> § 2.1(3), at 62-66 (2d ed.1993) (distinguishing the concept of an \"equitable remedy,\" which refers to the kinds of relief traditionally accorded in courts of equity, with \"substantive\" equity, which refers to certain principles of substantive law that could be described as fair or just); <i>id.</i> § 2.3(5), at 84 (characterizing equitable estoppel as fitting within the rubric of \"substantive equity\").</p>\n<p>C. <i>The Section 502(a)(1)(B) Claim</i></p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco's alternative theory tries to recast her claim as one for benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B). This theory entails two steps. First, she asks us to invoke equitable estoppel based on Verizon's misrepresentations to her husband. As she envisions it, this would bar Verizon from asserting that a statement of health form was required during an open enrollment period. Second, Mrs. Todisco asks us to allow her to claim, under a reformulated plan, the benefits that were promised to her husband. With Verizon barred from invoking the actual language of its plan, she believes that this claim will be successful.</p>\n<p>This approach is not permitted by ERISA's text. Section 502(a)(1)(B) allows a plaintiff to sue only for benefits \"due to him <i>under the terms of his plan.</i>\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Here, the plan unambiguously stated that Mr. Todisco was ineligible to add supplemental life insurance without submitting a statement of health form.<sup>[5]</sup> Since it is undisputed that he never submitted this form, Mrs. Todisco's claim for benefits is plainly not a suit for benefits <i>under the terms of the plan.</i> Instead, she expressly seeks benefits <i>not</i> authorized by the plan's terms.</p>\n<p>In a case decided post-<i>Mertens,</i> but before <i>Great-West,</i> the Ninth Circuit invoked this same reading of section 502(a)(1)(B); the court accordingly rejected an attempt by several plaintiffs to circumvent the fact that their equitable estoppel claim was foreclosed by <i>Mertens. See </i><i>Watkins,</i> 12 F.3d at 1527-28. The Eighth Circuit has also reasoned similarly. <i>See </i><i>Slice,</i> 34 F.3d at 631-32 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco contends that this circuit's decisions in <i>Glista</i> and <i>Bard</i> have approved the kind of two-step process she seeks here. She is wrong.</p>\n<p>In <i>Glista,</i> the plaintiff brought a claim for disability benefits after the defendant plan administrator denied plaintiff's claim in administrative proceedings. <i>See </i><i>Glista,</i> 378 F.3d at 119. Throughout the administrative proceedings, the defendant had relied on one plan provision as its basis for denying benefits. <i>Id.</i> at 118-19. Once the case went to litigation, the defendant additionally argued that benefits were barred based on a different plan provision. <i>Id.</i> at 119-20. After reviewing ERISA's notice regulations, the burdens of proof in traditional insurance law, the plan's own notice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> requirements, the fact that the defendant had not justified its earlier failure to inform the plaintiff about this alternative ground for denial, and the plaintiff's need for a resolution, we invoked certain equitable considerations to bar the defendant from relying on its newly-articulated rationale. <i>See id.</i> at 128-32.</p>\n<p><i>Bard</i> also involved a plaintiff who sued the defendant plan after it denied his claim for disability benefits. Through most of the administrative proceedings, the defendant plan repeatedly failed to comply with ERISA's notice requirements, with the result that the plaintiff was initially unaware that the defendant interpreted an ambiguous plan term in a manner that differed from the plaintiff's reasonable understanding. <i>Bard,</i> 471 F.3d at 237-40. As a result, the plaintiff believed that the plan did not require him to have become disabled before his employment ended, and he submitted medical evidence showing that he became totally disabled after his termination. <i>Id.</i> at 241. When the plan belatedly informed him of its differing view of the plan terms, the plaintiff submitted new medical evidence in support of his claim, which the plan then rejected as not consistent with the plaintiff's earlier submissions. <i>Id.</i> at 241-43. Based on these facts, as well as a plethora of ERISA regulatory violations, we cited <i>Glista</i> and invoked equitable principles to undo the prejudice that resulted from the defendant's ERISA violations: we barred the defendant from relying on the earlier medical evidence submitted. <i>Id.</i> at 244-45. Because the plaintiff's remaining evidence showed that he was entitled to benefits under the defendant's interpretation of the plan, we ordered an award of benefits. <i>Id.</i> at 245-46.</p>\n<p>Both <i>Glista</i> and <i>Bard</i> put significant weight on the fact that the plan's administrative claims process had been appreciably compromised by the defendants. <i>See id.</i> at 244-45; <i>Glista,</i> 378 F.3d at 128-30. Here there is no allegation that Verizon denied benefits to Mrs. Todisco on a rationale different than what Verizon stated to her, nor is there an allegation that Verizon has otherwise failed to comply with ERISA's regulatory requirements for claims proceedings.</p>\n<p>There is an even more fundamental problem with Mrs. Todisco's reliance on <i>Glista</i> and <i>Bard.</i> To the extent that both decisions employed \"equitable\" principles en route to an award of benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B), both did so in the context of reasonable claims that the plaintiff was actually entitled to benefits <i>under the terms of the plan documents.</i> Mrs. Todisco's claim is entirely different. Because the plan's language is clear, and because Mr. Todisco indisputably did not take the actions that this language required, plaintiff cannot reasonably claim that her suit is a suit for benefits due under the terms of the plan. Accordingly, section 502(a)(1)(B) does not permit Mrs. Todisco's suit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>In the end, Mrs. Todisco's argument amounts to a claim that on the facts of her case, she must be entitled to some sort of ERISA remedy. That claim may have particularly sympathetic appeal in light of ERISA's broad preemption of state remedies. <i>See </i><i>Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila,</i> 542 U.S. 200, 222, 124 S.Ct. 2488, 159 L.Ed.2d 312 (2004) (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (expressing dismay that the Court's narrow construction of the term \"equitable relief,\" coupled with ERISA's broad preemptive force, has created a troubling legal void for persons affected by ERISA wrongdoings). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has unambiguously held that such considerations may not overcome ERISA's textual commands. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> <i>See </i><i>Great-West,</i> 534 U.S. at 220-21, 122 S.Ct. 708.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  There are no allegations that Mr. Todisco ever paid any premiums for this supplemental life insurance. Evidence submitted at earlier stages in the case suggested that premiums were not being withheld from Mr. Todisco's paycheck, which prompted Mr. Todisco to make additional calls to Verizon's hotline.</p>\n<p>[2]  Mrs. Todisco makes no claim on appeal that the state law claim is not preempted.</p>\n<p>[3]  In the motion's \"statement of facts\" section, Verizon noted the second amended complaint's allegation that Mr. Todisco had been given <i>wrong</i> information, and Verizon further noted that plaintiff was not claiming any entitlement to benefits under the plan. In response, Mrs. Todisco stated that she largely agreed with Verizon's characterization of her allegations, although she clarified that she was claiming that she <i>was</i> entitled to plan benefits if the court granted her request to reform the plan documents. Mrs. Todisco did not otherwise contend that the plan terms were subject to an interpretation under which she would be eligible for benefits. When the district court granted Verizon's motion, its description of the facts included the statement that \"[u]nder the written terms of the plan, [Mr. Todisco] was not entitled to the additional coverage without supplying a statement of health. This had not been done.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  Several of our decisions have assumed, without deciding, that a claim for equitable estoppel is viable in this circuit. Those cases proceeded to reject those claims on the facts presented. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees,</i> 239 F.3d 51, 57 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that the issue remains open in this circuit); <i>Law,</i> 956 F.2d at 371 n. 9.</p>\n<p>[5]  In her proposed third amended complaint, Mrs. Todisco alleges that the plan terms are ambiguous as to open enrollment periods. However, we understand the district court to have essentially disregarded this allegation as beyond the scope of the court's permission, and/or as inconsistent with the plan documents themselves (which had been provided to the court at earlier stages in the case). We see no abuse of discretion in the court's decision to deem the plan terms unambiguous for purposes of adjudicating the motion for leave to amend. Indeed, while plaintiff's counsel pointed out to the district court that there was an allegation of ambiguity, counsel also told the court: \"I guess if you've got the plan, you can look at it.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>This case is on appeal from the district court's denial of plaintiff's motion to file a third amended complaint. We describe the facts as set out in that proposed complaint.</p>\n<p>For many years, Mr. Todisco worked as an employee of Verizon and its predecessor companies, which we collectively refer to as \"Verizon.\" Under Verizon's ERISA-covered benefit plan, Mr. Todisco was automatically <span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> enrolled in a \"Basic Life Insurance Policy\" with an $88,000 death benefit. Mrs. Todisco was named the beneficiary on that policy.</p>\n<p>Verizon maintained a telephone hotline for employees who had questions about employee benefit programs. On several occasions between November 1999 and January 2000, Mr. Todisco called this hotline to ask questions about his options for adding supplemental life insurance. He was informed that during an \"open enrollment period,\" he had the right to increase the level of his insurance benefits to $176,000 without submitting any statement of his current health. Based on this information, Mr. Todisco elected to purchase the supplemental coverage, and he named his wife as the beneficiary on this additional coverage. He did not submit a statement of health.<sup>[1]</sup> Additionally, in reliance on Verizon's statements, Mr. Todisco removed his wife as the beneficiary on his basic life insurance policy and replaced her with his two daughters. At the time Mr. Todisco made these decisions, he suffered from serious mental and physical health problems. It is not clear whether he could have submitted a statement of health that would have been adequate to render him eligible for supplemental life insurance.</p>\n<p>Mr. Todisco died shortly after making these decisions, and Verizon later paid the $88,000 basic life insurance benefit to Mr. Todisco's daughters. However, Verizon did not pay Mrs. Todisco the additional $88,000 in supplemental insurance benefits; its basis for this was that Mr. Todisco had failed to comply with the terms of its benefits plan, which required Mr. Todisco to fill out a statement of health form in order to be eligible for supplemental insurance.</p>\n<p>In October 2001, Mrs. Todisco sued Verizon in state court on a state law claim for breach of contract. Verizon removed the case to federal district court. On July 30, 2002, the suit was dismissed as preempted by ERISA after plaintiff refused to stipulate that her claim should be treated as an ERISA claim.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco then filed a motion to vacate the judgment, which the district court granted, and on October 31, 2002, she filed an amended complaint asserting a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA. Some nineteen days later, Mrs. Todisco filed a second amended complaint, this one adding a claim under ERISA for reformation of the plan documents and seeking benefits under the reformed plan documents. Over Verizon's objection, the district court permitted the filing of this second amended complaint. Verizon did not dispute that the second amended complaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p>Verizon moved for judgment on the pleadings, which the district court granted on August 25, 2004.<sup>[3]</sup> In a cogent opinion, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> the court ruled that the facts plaintiff described could not entitle her to the reformation remedy that she sought or to an award of money damages. The court nonetheless stated that it would give Mrs. Todisco the opportunity to try and advance a claim for equitable estoppel, and so the court granted her leave to file a motion to amend the complaint for this purpose.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco filed such a motion on October 29, 2004, and her proposed third amended complaint requested that Verizon pay her the $88,000 in supplemental life insurance benefits. But while the proposed complaint contained a claim for equitable estoppel, it also set out a separate claim that Mrs. Todisco was in fact entitled to benefits under the plan's terms. At an oral hearing, the district court remarked that this second claim went beyond the scope of the court's leave, and that it was \"inconsistent with all of [plaintiff's] previous allegations.\" Counsel clarified that Mrs. Todisco was not claiming that she was actually entitled to benefits under the plan, but rather that she sought estoppel to alter the plan terms; she believed she was entitled to benefits under those altered terms.</p>\n<p>The district court denied the plaintiff's motion to amend because it would be futile. First, the court explained that plaintiff was seeking compensatory monetary damages, not equitable relief. Relying on the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Great-West,</i> the district court held that the requested award of damages could not be granted under ERISA's section 502(a)(3). Second, the court explained that Mrs. Todisco's estoppel claim failed for an independent reason. In the court's view, an ERISA plaintiff could only assert a claim for equitable estoppel when the defendant's misrepresentation concerned a plan provision about which there could be reasonable disagreement. Otherwise, any reliance by the plaintiff would be unreasonable. Since Verizon's plan was not ambiguous, the court concluded that Mrs. Todisco's claim was not viable.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco timely appealed. She argues only that the denial of her motion to amend was erroneous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>When a district court denies a motion for leave to amend the complaint, our review is for abuse of discretion. <i>Universal Commc'n Sys., Inc. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span> (1985). Two provisions in section 502 are at the heart of this case.</p>\n<p>Section 502(a)(1)(B) empowers a \"participant or beneficiary\" to bring suit \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). Section 502(a)(3) allows a \"participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary\" to sue \"(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1132(a)(3).</p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco contends that in seeking to apply equitable estoppel, she is simply seeking \"appropriate equitable relief\" within the meaning of section 502(a)(3)(B). In the alternative, she contends that equitable estoppel should operate to allow her to seek benefits due to her under the terms of her plan within the meaning of section 502(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>B. <i>The Section 502(a)(3)(B) Claim</i></p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco's first argument is foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent.<sup>[4]</sup> In <i>Mertens,</i> the Court interpreted the phrase \"appropriate equitable relief\" to exclude claims for compensatory monetary damages, which the Court deemed a classic form of <i>legal</i> relief. <i>See</i> 508 U.S. at 255, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112867\"><a href=\"/opinion/112867/mertens-v-hewitt-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2063</span></a></span>. The Court held that the phrase referred \"to those categories of relief that were <i>typically</i> available in equity (such as injunction, mandamus, and restitution, but not compensatory damages).\" <i>Id.</i> at 256, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112867\"><a href=\"/opinion/112867/mertens-v-hewitt-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2063</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>This interpretation was further confirmed by <i>Great-West,</i> which held that even certain forms of restitution do not constitute \"equitable relief\" within the meaning of section 502(a)(3)(B). 534 U.S. at 214, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118471\"><a href=\"/opinion/118471/great-west-life-annuity-ins-co-v-knudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>. <i>Great-West</i> involved a claim for restitution that the Court characterized as an attempt to \"impos[e] personal liability on [defendants] for a contractual obligation to pay money.\" <i>Id.</i> at 221. <i>Great-West</i> held that despite the invocation of \"restitution,\" the claim was still essentially an action at law. <i>Id.</i> at 213-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118471\"><a href=\"/opinion/118471/great-west-life-annuity-ins-co-v-knudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>. The Court distinguished suits for equitable restitution, which it described as suits that aimed to \"restore to the plaintiff <i>particular</i> funds or property in the defendant's possession.\" <i>Id.</i> at 214, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118471\"><a href=\"/opinion/118471/great-west-life-annuity-ins-co-v-knudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although Mrs. Todisco asserts that <i>Great-West</i> has subsequently been overruled by the Court's decision in <i>Sereboff,</i> that is plainly incorrect. <i>Sereboff</i> explicitly distinguished <i>Great-West</i> on the grounds that the plaintiff in <i>Great-West</i> did not seek equitable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> restitution, as that plaintiff had not sought the recovery of specifically identifiable funds in the possession of the defendant. <i>See</i> 126 S.Ct. at 1873-74.</p>\n<p>Under <i>Mertens</i> and <i>Great-West,</i> Mrs. Todisco plainly seeks legal relief: she seeks nothing less than the imposition of liability on Verizon, in the form of compensatory monetary damages, because of Verizon's failure to honor the oral representation it made to her husband that he did not need to submit a statement of current health in order to obtain supplemental life insurance. <i>Accord </i><i>Slice v.

That claim for reliance damages is still a claim for compensatory monetary damages. It also does not resemble the kinds of relief that <i>Mertens</i> and <i>Great-West</i> have classified as equitable. <i>See </i><i>Callery v. U.S. Life Ins. Co. in the City of N.Y.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165323\"><a href=\"/opinion/165323/callery-v-united-states-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 405-06 (10th Cir.2004). Indeed, reliance damages could not have been \"typically available in equity,\" <i>Great-West,</i> 534 U.S. at 211, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118471\"><a href=\"/opinion/118471/great-west-life-annuity-ins-co-v-knudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, as the very idea of recovery for reliance damages lacked a firm conceptual footing until after the era of the divided bench. <i>Compare</i> C. McCormick, <i>The Fusion of Law and Equity in United States Courts,</i> 6 N.C. L.Rev. 283, 284 (1928) (noting that the merger of law and equity was largely complete by 1928), <i>with</i> L. Fuller &amp; W. Perdue, <i>The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages,</i> 46 Yale L.J. 373, 418-19 (1937) (arguing, in a 1937 law review article often credited as cohering the modern concept of reliance damages, that the law ought to explicitly recognize the award of reliance damages), <i>and</i> W. Slawson, <i>The Role of Reliance in Contract Damages,</i> 76 Cornell L.Rev. 197, 198-202 (1990) (tracing the modern understanding of reliance damages to discussions over the <i>Restatement (First) of Contracts,</i> which was published in 1932). <i>See also</i> 3 <i>Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence</i> § 813, at 234 (5th ed.1941) (stating that equitable estoppel \"operates to put the party entitled to its benefit in the same position as if the thing represented were true\"); Fuller &amp; Perdue, <i>supra,</i> at 406 (noting that then-contemporary authorities assumed that recovery on an estoppel theory would be for expectation damages).</p>\n<p>In the face of this adverse authority, Mrs. Todisco suggests that our circuit has nonetheless permitted contrary results. Citing <i>Glista v. Unum Life Insurance Co. of America,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201189\"><a href=\"/opinion/201189/glista-v-unum-life-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004), and <i>Bard v. Boston Shipping Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></span> (1st Cir.2006), plaintiff contends that this court has taken a more \"latitudinarian attitude\" to the phrase \"appropriate equitable relief.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco misreads these cases. Both <i>Glista</i> and <i>Bard</i> involved only <i>claims for benefits due under the plan. See </i><i>Bard,</i> 471 F.3d at 234; <i>Glista,</i> 378 F.3d at 119. Neither of those cases comes within the compass of either <i>Mertens</i> or <i>Great-West,</i> as this case does. These cases do not stand for the proposition that compensatory monetary damages are \"appropriate equitable relief\" under section 502(a)(3)(B). They hold only that when a court is confronted with a claim for benefits pursuant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> to section 502(a)(1)(B), the court may invoke certain substantive equitable principles, in certain narrow factual circumstances, in order to adjudicate that claim for benefits. <i>Cf.</i> 1 D. Dobbs, <i>Law of Remedies</i> § 2.1(3), at 62-66 (2d ed.1993) (distinguishing the concept of an \"equitable remedy,\" which refers to the kinds of relief traditionally accorded in courts of equity, with \"substantive\" equity, which refers to certain principles of substantive law that could be described as fair or just); <i>id.</i> § 2.3(5), at 84 (characterizing equitable estoppel as fitting within the rubric of \"substantive equity\").</p>\n<p>C. <i>The Section 502(a)(1)(B) Claim</i></p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco's alternative theory tries to recast her claim as one for benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B). This theory entails two steps. First, she asks us to invoke equitable estoppel based on Verizon's misrepresentations to her husband. As she envisions it, this would bar Verizon from asserting that a statement of health form was required during an open enrollment period. Second, Mrs. Todisco asks us to allow her to claim, under a reformulated plan, the benefits that were promised to her husband. With Verizon barred from invoking the actual language of its plan, she believes that this claim will be successful.</p>\n<p>This approach is not permitted by ERISA's text. Section 502(a)(1)(B) allows a plaintiff to sue only for benefits \"due to him <i>under the terms of his plan.</i>\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Here, the plan unambiguously stated that Mr. Todisco was ineligible to add supplemental life insurance without submitting a statement of health form.<sup>[5]</sup> Since it is undisputed that he never submitted this form, Mrs. Todisco's claim for benefits is plainly not a suit for benefits <i>under the terms of the plan.</i> Instead, she expressly seeks benefits <i>not</i> authorized by the plan's terms.</p>\n<p>In a case decided post-<i>Mertens,</i> but before <i>Great-West,</i> the Ninth Circuit invoked this same reading of section 502(a)(1)(B); the court accordingly rejected an attempt by several plaintiffs to circumvent the fact that their equitable estoppel claim was foreclosed by <i>Mertens. See </i><i>Watkins,</i> 12 F.3d at 1527-28. The Eighth Circuit has also reasoned similarly. <i>See </i><i>Slice,</i> 34 F.3d at 631-32 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Todisco contends that this circuit's decisions in <i>Glista</i> and <i>Bard</i> have approved the kind of two-step process she seeks here. She is wrong.</p>\n<p>In <i>Glista,</i> the plaintiff brought a claim for disability benefits after the defendant plan administrator denied plaintiff's claim in administrative proceedings. <i>See </i><i>Glista,</i> 378 F.3d at 119. Throughout the administrative proceedings, the defendant had relied on one plan provision as its basis for denying benefits. <i>Id.</i> at 118-19. Once the case went to litigation, the defendant additionally argued that benefits were barred based on a different plan provision. <i>Id.</i> at 119-20. After reviewing ERISA's notice regulations, the burdens of proof in traditional insurance law, the plan's own notice <span class=\"star-pagination\">*102</span> requirements, the fact that the defendant had not justified its earlier failure to inform the plaintiff about this alternative ground for denial, and the plaintiff's need for a resolution, we invoked certain equitable considerations to bar the defendant from relying on its newly-articulated rationale. <i>See id.</i> at 128-32.</p>\n<p><i>Bard</i> also involved a plaintiff who sued the defendant plan after it denied his claim for disability benefits. Through most of the administrative proceedings, the defendant plan repeatedly failed to comply with ERISA's notice requirements, with the result that the plaintiff was initially unaware that the defendant interpreted an ambiguous plan term in a manner that differed from the plaintiff's reasonable understanding. <i>Bard,</i> 471 F.3d at 237-40. As a result, the plaintiff believed that the plan did not require him to have become disabled before his employment ended, and he submitted medical evidence showing that he became totally disabled after his termination. <i>Id.</i> at 241. When the plan belatedly informed him of its differing view of the plan terms, the plaintiff submitted new medical evidence in support of his claim, which the plan then rejected as not consistent with the plaintiff's earlier submissions. <i>Id.</i> at 241-43. Based on these facts, as well as a plethora of ERISA regulatory violations, we cited <i>Glista</i> and invoked equitable principles to undo the prejudice that resulted from the defendant's ERISA violations: we barred the defendant from relying on the earlier medical evidence submitted. <i>Id.</i> at 244-45. Because the plaintiff's remaining evidence showed that he was entitled to benefits under the defendant's interpretation of the plan, we ordered an award of benefits. <i>Id.</i> at 245-46.</p>\n<p>Both <i>Glista</i> and <i>Bard</i> put significant weight on the fact that the plan's administrative claims process had been appreciably compromised by the defendants. <i>See id.</i> at 244-45; <i>Glista,</i> 378 F.3d at 128-30. Here there is no allegation that Verizon denied benefits to Mrs. Todisco on a rationale different than what Verizon stated to her, nor is there an allegation that Verizon has otherwise failed to comply with ERISA's regulatory requirements for claims proceedings.</p>\n<p>There is an even more fundamental problem with Mrs. Todisco's reliance on <i>Glista</i> and <i>Bard.</i> To the extent that both decisions employed \"equitable\" principles en route to an award of benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B), both did so in the context of reasonable claims that the plaintiff was actually entitled to benefits <i>under the terms of the plan documents.</i> Mrs. Todisco's claim is entirely different. Because the plan's language is clear, and because Mr. Todisco indisputably did not take the actions that this language required, plaintiff cannot reasonably claim that her suit is a suit for benefits due under the terms of the plan. Accordingly, section 502(a)(1)(B) does not permit Mrs. Todisco's suit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>In the end, Mrs. Todisco's argument amounts to a claim that on the facts of her case, she must be entitled to some sort of ERISA remedy. That claim may have particularly sympathetic appeal in light of ERISA's broad preemption of state remedies. <i>See </i><i>Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136991\"><a href=\"/opinion/136991/aetna-health-inc-v-davila/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 222, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136991\"><a href=\"/opinion/136991/aetna-health-inc-v-davila/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span> (2004) (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (expressing dismay that the Court's narrow construction of the term \"equitable relief,\" coupled with ERISA's broad preemptive force, has created a troubling legal void for persons affected by ERISA wrongdoings). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has unambiguously held that such considerations may not overcome ERISA's textual commands. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*103</span> <i>See </i><i>Great-West,</i> 534 U.S. at 220-21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118471\"><a href=\"/opinion/118471/great-west-life-annuity-ins-co-v-knudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i> No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  There are no allegations that Mr. Todisco ever paid any premiums for this supplemental life insurance. Evidence submitted at earlier stages in the case suggested that premiums were not being withheld from Mr. Todisco's paycheck, which prompted Mr. Todisco to make additional calls to Verizon's hotline.</p>\n<p>[2]  Mrs. Todisco makes no claim on appeal that the state law claim is not preempted.</p>\n<p>[3]  In the motion's \"statement of facts\" section, Verizon noted the second amended complaint's allegation that Mr. Todisco had been given <i>wrong</i> information, and Verizon further noted that plaintiff was not claiming any entitlement to benefits under the plan. In response, Mrs. Todisco stated that she largely agreed with Verizon's characterization of her allegations, although she clarified that she was claiming that she <i>was</i> entitled to plan benefits if the court granted her request to reform the plan documents. Mrs. Todisco did not otherwise contend that the plan terms were subject to an interpretation under which she would be eligible for benefits. When the district court granted Verizon's motion, its description of the facts included the statement that \"[u]nder the written terms of the plan, [Mr. Todisco] was not entitled to the additional coverage without supplying a statement of health. This had not been done.\"</p>\n<p>[4]  Several of our decisions have assumed, without deciding, that a claim for equitable estoppel is viable in this circuit. Those cases proceeded to reject those claims on the facts presented. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan for Salaried Employees,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771953\"><a href=\"/opinion/771953/gary-b-mauser-appellantcross-appellee-v-raytheon-company-pension-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that the issue remains open in this circuit); <i>Law,</i> 956 F.2d at 371 n. 9.</p>\n<p>[5]  In her proposed third amended complaint, Mrs. Todisco alleges that the plan terms are ambiguous as to open enrollment periods. However, we understand the district court to have essentially disregarded this allegation as beyond the scope of the court's permission, and/or as inconsistent with the plan documents themselves (which had been provided to the court at earlier stages in the case). We see no abuse of discretion in the court's decision to deem the plan terms unambiguous for purposes of adjudicating the motion for leave to amend. Indeed, while plaintiff's counsel pointed out to the district court that there was an allegation of ambiguity, counsel also told the court: \"I guess if you've got the plan, you can look at it.\"</p>\n\n</div>",
