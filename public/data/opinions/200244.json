Devine & Devine Food Brokers\n\n(\"Devine\"), a Massachusetts food broker, appeals the district\n\ncourt's refusal to impute to Wampler Foods, Inc. (\"Wampler\"), a\n\nVirginia poultry manufacturer, a contractual obligation to pay\n\nDevine a substantial severance penalty.               Devine contends that\n\nWampler assumed this obligation when Wampler purchased a corporate\n\ndivision from Cuddy Farms, Inc. (\"Cuddy\"), the entity with whom\n\nDevine had negotiated the severance provision. We see no basis for\n\nholding Wampler liable for the penalty and accordingly affirm.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n            The genesis of this dispute can be traced to 1987, when\n\nDevine and Cuddy entered into a written food brokerage agreement\n\n(\"the Agreement\") that memorialized an oral contract under which\n\nthe parties had operated since 1984.            The parties subsequently\n\nadded an amendment to the Agreement, providing for a substantial\n\nseverance payment to Devine should Cuddy choose to terminate the\n\nAgreement.     By   its   terms,    North   Carolina     law   governed   the\n\nAgreement.\n\n            By August 1994, Wampler and Cuddy had consummated an\n\nAsset    Purchase   Agreement    (\"APA\")    whereby    Wampler   acquired   a\n\nsubstantial portion of Cuddy's food division in exchange for cash\n\nand newly issued shares of Wampler stock.1            Virginia law governed\n\n\n     1\n       At that time, Cuddy reorganized itself into two divisions:\nthe farm division and the food division. Cuddy retained the farm\ndivision. Wampler paid approximately $72 million for Cuddy's food\n\n                                    -2-\n\fthe APA.   The APA specified the Cuddy liabilities Wampler would\n\nassume with its purchase.      The liabilities arising out of the 1987\n\nCuddy-Devine agreement were not specified.\n\n           After the transaction was completed and after an initial\n\nshuffling among brokers, Wampler selected Devine to represent the\n\nWampler and Cuddy brands in New England.             Wampler notified Devine\n\nby letter that they were entering into a new agreement, which\n\n\"superceded\" any existing contracts with Cuddy.\n\n           In due course, Wampler representatives met with Devine\n\nexecutives, including Joseph and Steven Devine.             At this meeting,\n\nDevine   took   the   position      that   Wampler    had   assumed   Cuddy's\n\nresponsibilities      under   the    Cuddy-Devine     severance   provision.\n\nWampler, however, was adamant that its purchase of Cuddy's assets\n\ndid not obligate it to Devine under the Agreement.            On this issue,\n\nthe parties reached a \"stand off\" and agreed to disagree.\n\n           On January 4, 1995, Wampler sent a letter to Devine\n\nexpanding its area of coverage. The letter reiterated that \"[t]his\n\ndocument will serve as your only brokerage agreement and supercedes\n\nany and all previous agreements or contracts with either Wampler []\n\nor Cuddy Farms.\"      Under the arrangement described in the letter,\n\nWampler compensated Devine according to its own payment schedules.\n\n\n\n\ndivision -- $42,500,000 in cash and $30,800,000 in newly issued\nshares of Wampler stock, representing a 10% stock interest in\nWampler.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f              In the years following, Wampler assigned to Devine new\n\naccounts without reference to the Cuddy termination provision.            In\n\n1997, it consolidated the Wampler and Cuddy brands pursuant to a\n\nnew appointment letter. The letter contained no severance payment\n\nprovision, and Devine did not seek to include such a provision upon\n\nreceipt of the letter.\n\n              On May 18, 1998, Wampler terminated Devine's brokerage\n\nappointment.       Approximately one month later, Wampler notified\n\nDevine   by    letter   of   its   termination   and   offered   Devine   an\n\n\"additional lump sum payment of $50,000.\"\n\n              Eventually, Devine filed this diversity action against\n\nCuddy and Wampler, alleging breach of contract and unfair trade\n\npractices in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, and seeking from\n\nWampler and Cuddy the amount due under the severance provision of\n\nthe Cuddy-Devine contract. Subsequently, the district court allowed\n\nCuddy's motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds and\n\nWampler's motion for summary judgment on the ground that Wampler was\n\nnot liable to Devine under the severance provision.        Devine appeals\n\nonly the court's award of summary judgment to Wampler.\n\n                         II. Breach of Contract\n\n              Under generally accepted corporate law principles, the\n\npurchaser of the assets of another corporation does not assume the\n\ndebts and liabilities of the transferor.         The traditional rule is\n\nsubject to four generally recognized exceptions: (1) the purchasing\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fcorporation expressly or impliedly agrees to assume the selling\n\ncorporation's liabilities; (2) the transaction is a merger of the\n\ntwo entities; (3) the purchaser is a mere continuation of the seller\n\ncorporation; and (4) the transaction is a fraudulent attempt to\n\nevade the seller's liabilities. Dayton v. Peck, Stow, & Wilcox Co.,\n\n739 F.2d 690, 692 (1st Cir. 1984);             15 W. Fletcher, Law of Private\n\nCorporations §§ 7122, at 227-243 (1999).\n\n             Invoking    the   first     of    these   four   principles   Devine\n\ncontends   that   Wampler      assumed     Cuddy's      liabilities   under   the\n\nseverance provision by means of an implied contract between Wampler\n\nand Cuddy.    To sufficiently persuade us on that score, Devine must\n\ndemonstrate    that,    as   with   an    express      contract   claim,   Wampler\n\nmanifested its assent to assume the Cuddy-Devine contract. 1 Corbin\n\non Contracts, § 1.19, at 55 (Rev. Ed. 1993); LiDonni, Inc. v. Hart.,\n\n355 Mass. 580, 583 (1969). A prima facie case of implied assumption\n\nof contract is established where a corporation accepted the benefits\n\nof a contract with knowledge of its terms. See Framingham Sav. Bank\n\nv. Szabo, 617 F.2d 897, 900 (1st Cir. 1980) (applying Massachusetts\n\nlaw).\n\n             The record before us does not permit such a finding.              On\n\nseveral occasions, Wampler explicitly informed Devine that the Cuddy\n\ncontract was superceded.            Wampler's notice of the Cuddy-Devine\n\ncontract was not an effort to stand in the shoes of Cuddy and assume\n\nCuddy's liabilities in toto, but an arrant warning to the contrary.\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fIt is of no moment that the Cuddy-Devine contract was still in\n\neffect during the parties' business dealings;                Wampler was neither\n\na party to that contract nor did it indicate to Devine an intent to\n\nassume the Cuddy contract wholesale.\n\n            To be sure, Wampler adopted many of the contract's terms\n\nin appointing Devine as its New England broker.                   But Devine points\n\nto    no   evidence    suggesting         that,    concomitant     with   Wampler's\n\ndesignation of Devine as its broker, Wampler acquiesced in all of\n\nthe   provisions      of    the   Cuddy    agreement.       Even    though   Wampler\n\nearnestly wanted to secure Devine's services, Devine's refusal to\n\nacknowledge that its arrangement with Wampler contained no severance\n\npenalty is simply insufficient to create such a provision. 1 Corbin\n\non    Contracts,   §       2.8,   at   133-34     (1993);   see    also   Meehan   v.\n\nShaughnessy, 404 Mass. 419, 445 n. 22 (1989).                 We see no basis in\n\nthis case to create by operation of law contract terms that the\n\nparties failed to secure through negotiation.\n\n            Devine also posits that the APA brought about a de facto\n\nmerger between Wampler and Cuddy, rendering Wampler responsible for\n\nCuddy's liabilities.          E.g., Kaiser Found. Health Plan v. Clary &\n\nMoore, P.C., 123 F.3d 201, 205 (4th Cir. 1997); Crawford Harbor\n\nAssocs. v. Blake Constr. Co., 661 F.Supp. 880, 885 (E.D. Va. 1987).\n\nUnder Virginia law, no one factor is dispositive in determining\n\nwhether an asset purchase transaction is in fact a merger. Instead,\n\ncourts have identified four factors that serve as useful analytical\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fguideposts: 1) continuity of enterprise, 2) common identity of the\n\nmanagement and shareholders in the purchasing entity; 3) termination\n\nof the normal operations of selling corporation; and 4) assumption\n\nby the purchaser of the seller's obligations necessary for the\n\ncontinuation of the seller's routine business operations.2 Id.\n\nWhile not dispositive, the factor that typically tips the scales in\n\nfavor of finding a merger is continuity of ownership, usually taking\n\nthe form of an exchange of stock for assets.   Crawford Harbor, 661\n\nF.Supp. at 884.\n\n     The evidence here does not support Devine's de facto merger\n\nargument.   Although Cuddy acquired a 10% stock interest in Wampler\n\nand retained some of Cuddy's managers and clients, Devine emphasizes\n\nform over substance in suggesting that these factors render the\n\ntransaction a merger when all other circumstances support a contrary\n\nconclusion.   There was neither a wholesale continuity of management\n\nor ownership nor a liquidation of the selling corporation.   Indeed,\n\nCuddy survived the merger and continues to do business today. There\n\nis no allegation that the transaction was a mere ruse to avoid the\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       Although the record does not disclose that the district\ncourt made a formal choice-of-law determination, the parties have\naddressed the implied contract claim under Massachusetts law and\nthe merger claim with resort to the law of Virginia. Where the\nsignificant events occurred in Massachusetts, and the APA by its\nterms was to be governed by Virginia law, we have no occasion to\nchallenge these choice-of-law determinations. See, e.g., Fisher v.\nTrainor, 242 F.3d 24, 29 n.2 (1st Cir. 2001); New Ponce Shopping\nCtr. v. Integrand Assur. Co., 86 F.3d 265, 267 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n                                -7-\n\fseller's liabilities.3     To find a de facto merger here would be to\n\nstretch the doctrine beyond its logical limits.\n\n                     III. Unfair Trade Practices\n\n            Devine's final claim of error is that the district court\n\nshould not have entered summary judgment on its unfair trade\n\npractices claim.     Here, the appellant has made no showing that\n\nWampler's   acts   fall   within   \"the   penumbra   of   some   common-law,\n\nstatutory, or other established concept of unfairness; is immoral,\n\nunethical or unscrupulous. . .\" Linkage Corp. v. Trustees of Boston\n\nUniv., 425 Mass. 1, 27 (1997) (quoting PMP Assocs., Inc. v. Globe\n\nNewspaper Co., 366 Mass. 593, 596 (1975)(internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).   After scouring the record, we find nothing in Wampler's\n\nconduct that would give rise to an actionable claim under Chapter\n\n93A. It may be that Wampler wanted to have it both ways by securing\n\nDevine's services without the termination clause.          But Wampler was\n\nup front in expressing this desire. It is not necessarily an unfair\n\ntrade practice to get the better of the bargain.\n\n                             IV. Conclusion\n\n     For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court's\n\naward of summary judgment to Wampler on Devine's breach of contract\n\nand unfair trade practice claims.\n\n\n     3\n        A primary purpose of the de facto merger exception is to\nprotect dissenting shareholders or creditors from a transaction\nthat is a ploy to avoid the seller's liabilities.   15 W. Fletcher,\nLaw of Private Corporations §§ 7045.10, at 32-34 (Rev. Ed. 199).\nCourts commonly appeal to this doctrine where the asset transfer in\nquestion was neither an arms-length bargain nor supported by\nadequate consideration. E.g., Crawford Harbor, 661 F.Supp. at 884.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fAffirmed.   Costs to appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           -9-\n\f",

Instead, courts have identified four factors that serve as useful analytical guideposts: 1) continuity of enterprise, 2) common identity of the management and shareholders in the purchasing entity; 3) termination of the normal operations of selling corporation; and 4) assumption by the purchaser of the seller's obligations necessary for the continuation of the seller's routine business operations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> While not dispositive, the factor that typically tips the scales in favor of finding a merger is continuity of ownership, usually taking the form of an exchange of stock for assets. <i>Crawford Harbor,</i> 661 F.Supp. at 884.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence here does not support Devine's <i>de facto</i> merger argument. Although Cuddy acquired a 10% stock interest in Wampler and retained some of Cuddy's managers and clients, Devine emphasizes form over substance in suggesting that these factors render the transaction a merger when all other circumstances support a contrary conclusion. There was neither a wholesale continuity of management or ownership nor a liquidation of the selling corporation. Indeed, Cuddy survived the merger and continues to do business today. There is no allegation that the transaction was a mere ruse to avoid the seller's liabilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> To find a <i>de facto</i> merger here would be to stretch the doctrine beyond its logical limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Unfair Trade Practices</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Devine's final claim of error is that the district court should not have entered summary judgment on its unfair trade practices claim. Here, the appellant has made no showing that Wampler's acts fall within \"the penumbra of some commonlaw, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; is immoral, unethical or unscrupulous...\" <i>Linkage Corp. v.

Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 366 Mass. 593, 596, 321 N.E.2d 915 (1975))(internal quotation marks omitted). After scouring the record, we find nothing in Wampler's conduct that would give rise to an actionable claim under Chapter 93A. It may be that Wampler wanted to have it both ways by securing Devine's services without the termination clause. But Wampler was up front in expressing this desire.

(\"Wampler\"), a Virginia poultry manufacturer, a contractual obligation to pay Devine a substantial severance penalty. Devine contends that Wampler assumed this obligation when Wampler purchased a corporate division from Cuddy Farms, Inc. (\"Cuddy\"), the entity with whom Devine had negotiated the severance provision. We see no basis for holding Wampler liable for the penalty and accordingly affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The genesis of this dispute can be traced to 1987, when Devine and Cuddy entered into a written food brokerage agreement (\"the Agreement\") that memorialized an oral contract under which the parties had operated since 1984. The parties subsequently added an amendment to the Agreement, providing for a substantial severance payment to Devine should Cuddy choose to terminate the Agreement. By its terms, North Carolina law governed the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By August 1994, Wampler and Cuddy had consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (\"APA\") whereby Wampler acquired a substantial portion of Cuddy's food division in exchange for cash and newly issued shares of Wampler stock.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Virginia law governed the APA. The APA specified the Cuddy liabilities Wampler would assume with its purchase. The liabilities arising out of the 1987 Cuddy-Devine agreement were not specified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the transaction was completed and after an initial shuffling among brokers, Wampler selected Devine to represent the Wampler and Cuddy brands in New England. Wampler notified Devine by letter that they were entering into a new agreement, which \"superceded\" any existing contracts with Cuddy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Wampler representatives met with Devine executives, including Joseph and Steven Devine. At this meeting, Devine took the position that Wampler had assumed Cuddy's responsibilities under the Cuddy-Devine severance provision. Wampler, however, was adamant that its purchase of Cuddy's assets did not obligate it to Devine under the Agreement. On this issue, the parties reached a \"stand off\" and agreed to disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 4, 1995, Wampler sent a letter to Devine expanding its area of coverage. The letter reiterated that \"[t]his document will serve as your only brokerage agreement and supercedes any and all previous agreements or contracts with either Wampler [] or Cuddy Farms.\" Under the arrangement described in the letter, Wampler compensated Devine according to its own payment schedules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the years following, Wampler assigned to Devine new accounts without reference to the Cuddy termination provision. In 1997, it consolidated the Wampler and Cuddy brands pursuant to a new appointment letter. The letter contained no severance payment provision, and Devine did not seek to include such a provision upon receipt of the letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 18, 1998, Wampler terminated Devine's brokerage appointment. Approximately one month later, Wampler notified Devine by letter of its termination and offered Devine an \"additional lump sum payment of $50,000.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Devine filed this diversity action against Cuddy and Wampler, alleging breach of contract and unfair trade practices in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, and seeking from Wampler and Cuddy the amount due under the severance provision of the Cuddy-Devine contract. Subsequently, the district court allowed Cuddy's motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds and Wampler's motion for summary judgment on the ground that Wampler was not liable to Devine under the severance provision. Devine appeals only the court's award of summary judgment to Wampler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Breach of Contract</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under generally accepted corporate law principles, the purchaser of the assets of another corporation does not assume the debts and liabilities of the transferor. The traditional rule is subject to four generally recognized exceptions: (1) the purchasing corporation expressly or impliedly agrees to assume the selling corporation's liabilities; (2) the transaction is a merger of the two entities; (3) the purchaser is a mere continuation of the seller corporation; and (4) the transaction is a fraudulent attempt to evade the seller's liabilities. <i>Dayton v. Peck, Stow, &amp; Wilcox Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439059\"><a href=\"/opinion/439059/david-dayton-v-peck-stow-and-wilcox-co-pexto/\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, 692 (1st Cir.1984); 15 W. Fletcher, <i>Law of Private Corporations</i> &#167;&#167; 7122, at 227-243 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking the first of these four principles Devine contends that Wampler assumed Cuddy's liabilities under the severance provision by means of an implied contract between Wampler and Cuddy. To sufficiently persuade us on that score, Devine must demonstrate that, as with an express contract claim, Wampler manifested its assent to assume the Cuddy-Devine contract. 1 <i>Corbin on Contracts,</i> &#167; 1.19, at 55 (Rev. Ed.1993); <i>LiDonni, Inc. v. Hart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2056145\"><a href=\"/opinion/2056145/lidonni-inc-v-hart/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 583, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2056145\"><a href=\"/opinion/2056145/lidonni-inc-v-hart/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span> (1969). A <i>prima facie</i> case of implied assumption of contract is established where a corporation accepted the benefits of a contract with knowledge of its terms. <i>See Framingham Sav. Bank v. Szabo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375901\"><a href=\"/opinion/375901/framingham-savings-bank-v-joseph-szabo-trustee/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, 900 (1st Cir.1980) (applying Massachusetts law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record before us does not permit such a finding. On several occasions, Wampler explicitly informed Devine that the Cuddy contract was superceded. Wampler's notice of the Cuddy-Devine contract was not an effort to stand in the shoes of Cuddy and assume Cuddy's liabilities <i>in toto,</i> but an arrant warning to the contrary. It is of no moment that the Cuddy-Devine contract was still in effect during the parties' business dealings; Wampler was neither a party to that contract nor did it indicate to Devine an intent to assume the Cuddy contract wholesale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Wampler adopted many of the contract's terms in appointing Devine as its New England broker. But Devine points to no evidence suggesting that, concomitant with Wampler's designation of Devine as its broker, Wampler acquiesced in all of the provisions of the Cuddy agreement. Even though Wampler earnestly wanted to secure Devine's services, Devine's refusal to acknowledge that its arrangement with Wampler contained no severance penalty is simply insufficient to create such a provision. 1 <i>Corbin On Contracts,</i> &#167; 2.8, At 133-34 (1993); <i>See Also Meehan v. Shaughnessy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2222297\"><a href=\"/opinion/2222297/meehan-v-shaughnessy-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, 445 n. 22, 535 N.E.2D 1255 (1989). We see no basis in this case to create by operation of law contract terms that the parties failed to secure through negotiation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Devine also posits that the APA brought about a <i>de facto</i> merger between Wampler and Cuddy, rendering Wampler responsible for Cuddy's liabilities. <i>E.g., Kaiser Found. Health Plan v. Clary &amp; Moore, P.C.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745334\"><a href=\"/opinion/745334/kaiser-foundation-health-plan-of-the-mid-atlantic-states-v-clary-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 205 (4th Cir. 1997); <i>Crawford Harbor Assocs. v.
