This case requires us to decide\n\nfor the first time whether an illegal alien, convicted under the\n\nTravel Act for promoting an unlawful activity involving controlled\n\nsubstances, remains eligible for adjustment of status. Concluding,\n\nas we do, that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) correctly\n\nanswered this question in the negative, we uphold the order of\n\nremoval and deny the alien's petition for judicial review.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The petitioner, José Ramón Urena-Ramirez, is a native of\n\nthe Dominican Republic.    He originally entered the United States\n\nunder a false name and without a valid visa.       Several years later,\n\nfederal authorities charged him with aiding and abetting the\n\ndistribution of cocaine.        He pleaded guilty, inter alia, to a\n\nreduced charge of traveling in interstate commerce to promote an\n\nunlawful activity in violation of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952.\n\nThe sentencing court imposed a 21-month incarcerative term, to be\n\nfollowed by three years of supervised release.\n\n           The    Immigration    and     Naturalization   Service   (INS)\n\ninitiated removal proceedings on November 3, 1997.1             The INS\n\nclaimed that the petitioner was deportable on three grounds,\n\n\n\n     1\n      On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist as an agency within\nthe Department of Justice.        Its enforcement functions were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002).\nBecause the events at issue here predate that reorganization, we\ncontinue to refer to the INS in this opinion.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fnamely,(i) as an alien not in possession of a valid entry document,\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A); (ii) as an alien who had been convicted\n\nof   an   offense     \"relating    to\"    a    controlled      substance,    id.   §\n\n1227(a)(2)(B)(i); and (iii) as an alien convicted of an aggravated\n\nfelony, id. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).              The government based the latter\n\ntwo charges on the petitioner's Travel Act conviction.\n\n            At a removal hearing before an Immigration Judge (IJ),\n\nthe petitioner conceded deportability on the basis of his illegal\n\nentry into the United States.                  He denied the other charges,\n\ncontending that the Travel Act violation was neither a drug-related\n\noffense    nor   an    aggravated        felony.        He     also    requested   a\n\ndiscretionary    adjustment       of   status     and   waiver    of    deportation\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h).2\n\n            Relying on the record of the petitioner's conviction,\n\nincluding the plea agreement (which revealed that the petitioner\n\nhad pleaded guilty to traveling in interstate commerce for the\n\nspecific purpose of promoting \"a business enterprise involving\n\ncocaine\"), the IJ found that the Travel Act conviction constituted\n\nboth a drug-related offense and an aggravated felony. Accordingly,\n\nthe IJ declared the petitioner ineligible for discretionary relief,\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and ordered his removal.                 The BIA affirmed this\n\n\n      2\n      An alien ordinarily may seek adjustment of status to avoid\nremoval. 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). Typically, that relief is at the\ndiscretion of the Attorney General. Id. § 1182(h). Such a waiver\ncannot be granted, however, if the petitioner has committed a drug-\ntrafficking offense or an aggravated felony. Id.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fdecision without opinion.      See id. § 1101(47)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.1(a)(7) (formerly designated as 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(e)(4)); see\n\nalso Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 376-77 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(describing operation of streamlined \"affirmance without opinion\"\n\nprocedure).    This timely petition for judicial review followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            The petitioner advances two closely related assignments\n\nof error.     First, he claims that the Travel Act is not a law\n\n\"relating to\" a controlled substance.         Second, he protests the\n\nclassification of his Travel Act conviction as an aggravated\n\nfelony.\n\n            We first consider the applicable standard of review.\n\nThis case hinges in substantial part on the proper determination of\n\nwhat constitutes a violation of a law relating to a controlled\n\nsubstance under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1101-1537.       The petitioner argues that the BIA incorrectly\n\nconstrued     the   relevant   section   of   the   INA,   8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1227(a)(2)(B)(i), to include the Travel Act violation.            In his\n\nview, that statute cannot be deemed sufficiently related to a\n\ncontrolled substance because the crime (traveling in interstate\n\ncommerce) is separate and distinct from the underlying (drug-\n\nrelated) activity. For essentially the same reason, the petitioner\n\nchallenges the BIA's determination that the Travel Act violation\n\nconstituted \"illicit trafficking,\" as that term is used in 8 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f§ 1101(a)(43)(B) — a determination that not only converted the\n\noffense into an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)       but   also   eliminated   any   chance   for   the\n\npetitioner to obtain discretionary relief (an adjustment of status\n\nand withholding of deportation).\n\n             So viewed, this case turns on a pure question of law:\n\nwhether a particular crime (here, a violation of the Travel Act) is\n\na violation of a law relating to a controlled substance within the\n\npurview of the INA.      That question, as framed, does not implicate\n\nthe INS's exercise of administrative discretion. Consequently, the\n\nquestion engenders de novo review.3          See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,\n\n526 U.S. 415, 424-25 (1999) (explaining that courts normally review\n\nde novo an agency's construction of federal statutes); Herrera-\n\nInirio v. INS, 208 F.3d 299, 304 (1st Cir. 2000) (same).\n\n            We turn next to the petitioner's principal argument:\n\nthat the Travel Act violation is separate and distinct from the\n\nunderlying    (drug-related)     activity.      The   BIA   rejected    this\n\nargument.    So do we.\n\n            The INA provides for the removal of an alien who has\n\n\"been convicted of a violation of . . . any law . . . relating to\n\n\n     3\n      Where Congress has entrusted an administrative agency with\ndiscretion and the governing statute is silent or ambiguous anent\na particular issue, the agency's reading of the statute ordinarily\nwill be upheld if it is reasonable. See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,\n480 U.S. 421, 448-49 (1987); Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res.\nDef. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).     This case does not\npresent the occasion for such deference.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fa   controlled   substance.\"      8   U.S.C.   §   1227(a)(2)(B)(i).     In\n\ninterpreting the phrase \"relating to,\" the BIA looks to the degree\n\nto which the violation in question is connected to underlying\n\n(drug-related) activity.       In re Espinoza-Gonzalez, 22 I. & N. Dec.\n\n889 (BIA 1999).    If the violation and the underlying activity are\n\n\"so closely related\" that the two could not be considered \"separate\n\nor distinct,\" then the two are essentially one and the violation is\n\nof a law \"relating to\" the underlying activity.              Id. (quoting\n\nMatter of Beltran, 20 I. & N. Dec. 521, 528 (BIA 1992)).\n\n           This brings us to the Travel Act, which provides in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n           Whoever travels in interstate or foreign\n           commerce . . . with intent to . . . promote,\n           manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the\n           promotion,   management,   establishment,   or\n           carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and\n           thereafter performs or attempts to perform\n           [any of the acts specified] shall be [punished\n           as provided].\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1952(a)(3).    The Travel Act defines the term \"unlawful\n\nactivity\" to include, among other things, \"any business enterprise\n\ninvolving . . . narcotics or controlled substances . . . .\"            Id. §\n\n1952(b)(1).\n\n           Against this backdrop, we turn to the case at hand.           As\n\nsaid, the petitioner pleaded guilty to traveling in interstate\n\ncommerce to promote a business enterprise involving cocaine (a\n\ncontrolled substance).         The conduct underlying the proscribed\n\ntravel (the promotion of a business enterprise involving cocaine)\n\n                                      -6-\n\fwas   tantamount   to    aiding     and   abetting   the    distribution    of\n\nnarcotics.    The plea agreement makes manifest the petitioner's\n\nadmission of his involvement in that underlying conduct (and, thus,\n\nhis culpability for it).          Cf. United States v. Salerno, 66 F.3d\n\n544, 550 (2d Cir. 1995) (pleading guilty to interstate travel in\n\nfurtherance of drug trafficking is tantamount to pleading to a\n\nfelony drug offense).      We see nothing separate or distinct, as a\n\npractical    matter,    between    the    Travel   Act   violation   and   the\n\npetitioner's involvement in the cocaine trade.             Thus, common sense\n\nindicates that the petitioner's violation of the Travel Act was a\n\nviolation of a law relating to a controlled substance.\n\n            In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\npetitioner makes a number of counter-arguments.             None has merit.\n\n            First, he suggests that a violation of the Travel Act\n\ncannot be a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance\n\nbecause the Travel Act covers a myriad of criminal activities, many\n\nof them non-drug-related (e.g., gambling, bribery). As he sees it,\n\nthe Travel Act fundamentally relates to racketeering rather than to\n\ndrug trafficking (indeed, the Travel Act's placement in the United\n\nStates Code so indicates).        For this reason, he likens his offense\n\nto misprision of a conspiracy to possess an illegal narcotic — an\n\noffense that the Sixth Circuit once ruled was not a violation of a\n\nlaw relating to a controlled substance, see Castaneda De Esper v.\n\nINS, 557 F.2d 79 (6th Cir. 1977) — and to the illegal carriage of\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fa firearm during the commission of a felony — an offense that the\n\nBIA once    ruled    was   not   a   violation   of   a   law   relating   to    a\n\ncontrolled substance notwithstanding that the felony in question\n\nwas itself drug-related, see Matter of Carrillo, 16 I. & N. Dec.\n\n625 (BIA 1978).\n\n            We do not regard these quarter-century-old precedents as\n\npersuasive authority here.           In the first place, both cases were\n\ndecided under an earlier version of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(11)\n\n(1956) (repealed), which was not as sweeping in its definition of\n\na drug-related offense as is the current version.                    The Ninth\n\nCircuit, in refusing to follow Castaneda De Esper and Carrillo on\n\nfacts very much like those of the case at bar, found this change in\n\nthe statutory language significant.           See Johnson v. INS, 971 F.2d\n\n340, 342 n.4 (9th Cir. 1992).           We agree.\n\n            Second   —     and   more   important     —   the   petitioners     in\n\nCastaneda De Esper and Carrillo were both found guilty of violating\n\ngeneral statutes that made no specific reference to drug-related\n\nactivity.     Thus, in Castaneda De Esper, 557 F.2d at 84, the\n\npetitioner was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 4 for \"having knowledge\n\nof . . . a felony\" and concealing that fact.                     Similarly, in\n\nCarrillo, 16 I. & N. Dec. at 625, the petitioner was convicted\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) for illegally \"carrying a firearm during\n\nthe commission of a felony.\"              In both cases the statute of\n\nconviction was a generic statute that did not mention controlled\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fsubstances.4      Unlike those statutes, the Travel Act specifically\n\nrefers to drug-related activity.                It criminalizes, inter alia,\n\ntravel in interstate commerce with the intent to promote, carry on,\n\nor facilitate an unlawful activity, and specifically defines the\n\nterm \"unlawful activity\" to include business enterprises involving\n\ncontrolled substances.         18 U.S.C. § 1952(a)(3)-(b)(1).                    This\n\ncongressional targeting of drug-related activity furnishes a much\n\ncloser nexus than is afforded by the generic statutes involved in\n\nCastaneda De Esper and Carrillo.\n\n           We add, moreover, that Congress passed the Travel Act in\n\nan effort to deny individuals who act for criminal purposes, such\n\nas   interstate    drug   trafficking,          \"access   to   the    channels    of\n\ncommerce.\"     Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U.S. 239, 246 (1972).\n\nThe Travel Act is simply the mechanism that Congress chose to\n\naccomplish regulation of the channels of commerce.                   See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1952 (1970) (adding \"controlled substances\" to the list of\n\nunlawful activities contained in the Travel Act).               The petitioner,\n\nby   traveling    in    interstate       commerce   to    promote     a   narcotics\n\nenterprise,      thus   violated     a    law    specifically    aimed      at   the\n\nregulation of the narcotics trade.               The fact that the Travel Act\n\n\n      4\n      The same is true of the state statute that criminalizes\nsolicitation of another \"with intent to promote or facilitate the\ncommission of a felony or misdemeanor.\" Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-\n1002(A). Thus, the Ninth Circuit's holding that a violation of\nthat generic statute was not a violation of a law relating to a\ncontrolled substance, Coronado-Durazo v. INS, 123 F.3d 1322, 1326\n(9th Cir. 1997), is equally distinguishable.\n\n                                         -9-\n\falso targets other types of interstate travel does not disqualify\n\nit from service, in an appropriate case, as a law relating to\n\ncontrolled substances.    Accord Johnson, 971 F.2d at 342.\n\n           The petitioner also tries to analogize his Travel Act\n\nconviction to a conviction for being an accessory after the fact.\n\nSee, e.g., In re Batista-Hernandez, 21 I. & N. Dec. 955 (BIA 1997)\n\n(holding that the crime of being an accessory after the fact, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3, does not relate to an antecedent controlled substance\n\noffense because it \"takes place subsequent to the completion of the\n\nunderlying felony\" and is not \"punishable equally as the underlying\n\nsubstantive crime\").     He argues that because the penalties for a\n\nTravel Act violation and a narcotics violation are so different,5\n\na Travel Act violation cannot amount to a deportable offense. This\n\ncourse of ratiocination does not journey far.\n\n           In Batista-Hernandez, the BIA focused its analysis of the\n\noffense not merely on the penalties that it carried, but also \"on\n\nthe historical treatment of the crime in question.\"     Id. at 959.\n\nThe question there was to what extent the generic offense of\n\naccessory after the fact related to the underlying (drug-related)\n\nconduct.   The BIA noted that the crime of accessory after the fact\n\ntakes place after the completion of the principal crime, and, as\n\n\n     5\n      A Travel Act violation carries with it a maximum penalty of\nfive years' imprisonment.     See 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a)(3)(A).     A\nnarcotics violation, however, can carry penalties of up to life\nimprisonment, depending upon drug type and quantity. See 21 U.S.C.\n§ 841(b).\n\n                                 -10-\n\fsuch, \"does not aid in the commission of the [principal] offense.\"\n\nId. at 960.     This is a far cry from the petitioner's case, in which\n\nthe   Travel    Act    violation    was    part    and    parcel    of    his   drug-\n\ntrafficking activity.          The fact that the penalties differ, without\n\nmore,   lacks    the       talismanic   significance       that    the    petitioner\n\nattaches to it.\n\n            Next,      the    petitioner      insists     that    his    Travel   Act\n\nviolation     must    be     separate   and    distinct    from    his    underlying\n\nactivity because one can be prosecuted simultaneously for both a\n\nTravel Act infraction and for a specific drug-trafficking offense\n\n(say, possession with intent to distribute).                Cf. United States v.\n\nStafford, 831 F.2d 1479, 1481 (9th Cir. 1987) (a case in which the\n\ndefendant pleaded guilty both to traveling interstate to commit\n\nbribery and to the underlying offense of bribery).                       That plaint\n\nmisses the point.           The issue here is not whether the Travel Act\n\nsometimes overlaps with other criminal statutes, but, rather,\n\nwhether a Travel Act violation is, in particular circumstances, a\n\nviolation of a law relating to a controlled substance.                            For\n\npurposes of this inquiry, the fact that the elements of different\n\ncrimes may partially coincide is meaningless.\n\n            Finally, the petitioner strives to convince us that the\n\nBIA reads the relevant section of the INA too broadly.                    We are not\n\npersuaded.      While adjudicators are bound in certain circumstances\n\nto interpret the Travel Act narrowly, see Rewis v. United States,\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f401 U.S. 808, 812-13 (1971); United States v. Hathaway, 534 F.2d\n\n386, 398 (1st Cir. 1976), and to construe vague terms in favor of\n\nthe alien, Aybar-Alejo v. INS, 230 F.3d 487, 489 (1st Cir. 2000),\n\nneither principle is apposite here.            The question in this case is\n\nwhether    section   1227(a)(2)(B)(i)       covers   offenses       such     as       the\n\npetitioner's Travel Act violation.          That is a question of law, and\n\nthe BIA answered it correctly.\n\n            For these reasons, we hold that the Travel Act is a law\n\nrelating    to    controlled     substances     as   long    as     there        is     a\n\nsufficiently close nexus between the violation and the furtherance\n\nof a drug-related enterprise.            See Johnson, 971 F.2d at 342.\n\nBecause such a nexus exists here, the petitioner's Travel Act\n\nviolation   amounted    to   a    deportable    offense     under      8    U.S.C.     §\n\n1227(a)(2)(B)(i).\n\n            The   petitioner's     remaining     point    goes    to       the   BIA's\n\ndetermination that his Travel Act violation constituted a drug-\n\ntrafficking crime, and, as such, an aggravated felony under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B).         In the last analysis, this argument also\n\ndepends on whether the Travel Act violation can be construed as\n\nrelating to a controlled substance.

Concluding, as we do, that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) correctly answered this question in the negative, we uphold the order of removal and deny the alien's petition for judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, Jos&#233; Ram&#243;n Urena-Ramirez, is a native of the Dominican Republic. He originally entered the United States under a false name and without a valid visa. Several years later, federal authorities charged him with aiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine. He pleaded guilty, inter alia, to a reduced charge of traveling in interstate commerce to promote an unlawful activity in violation of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952. The sentencing court imposed a 21-month incarcerative term, to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated removal proceedings on November 3, 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The INS claimed that the petitioner was deportable on three grounds, namely, (i) as an alien not in possession of a valid entry document, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(A); (ii) as an alien who had been convicted of an offense \"relating to\" a controlled substance, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1227(a)(2)(B)(i); and (iii) as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The government based the latter two charges on the petitioner's Travel Act conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a removal hearing before an Immigration Judge (IJ), the petitioner conceded deportability on the basis of his illegal entry into the United States. He denied the other charges, contending that the Travel Act violation was neither a drug-related offense nor an aggravated felony. He also requested a discretionary adjustment of status and waiver of deportation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(h).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the record of the petitioner's conviction, including the plea agreement (which revealed that the petitioner had pleaded guilty to traveling in interstate commerce for the specific purpose of promoting \"a business enterprise involving cocaine\"), the IJ found that the Travel Act conviction constituted both a drug-related offense and an aggravated felony. Accordingly, the IJ declared the petitioner ineligible for discretionary relief, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(h), and ordered his removal. The BIA affirmed this decision without opinion. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1101(47)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(a)(7) (formerly designated as 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.1(e)(4)); <i>see also Albathani v. INS,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 376-77 (1st Cir.2003) (describing operation of streamlined \"affirmance without opinion\" procedure). This timely petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner advances two closely related assignments of error. First, he claims that the Travel Act is not a law \"relating to\" a controlled substance. Second, he protests the classification of his Travel Act conviction as an aggravated felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider the applicable standard of review. This case hinges in substantial part on the proper determination of what constitutes a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1101-1537. The petitioner argues that the BIA incorrectly construed the relevant section of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), to include the Travel Act violation. In his view, that statute cannot be deemed sufficiently related to a controlled substance because the crime (traveling in interstate commerce) is separate and distinct from the underlying (drug-related) activity. For essentially the same reason, the petitioner challenges the BIA's determination that the Travel Act violation constituted \"illicit trafficking,\" as that term is used in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B) &#8212; a determination that not only converted the offense into an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) but also eliminated any chance for the petitioner to obtain discretionary relief (an adjustment of status and withholding of deportation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So viewed, this case turns on a pure question of law: whether a particular crime (here, a violation of the Travel Act) is a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance within the purview of the INA. That question, as framed, does not implicate the INS's exercise of administrative discretion. Consequently, the question engenders de novo review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. 415, 424-25, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999) (explaining that courts normally review de novo an agency's construction of federal statutes); <i>Herrera-Inirio v. INS,</i> 208 F.3d 299, 304 (1st Cir.2000) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the petitioner's principal argument: that the Travel Act violation is separate and distinct from the underlying (drug-related) activity. The BIA rejected this argument. So do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INA provides for the removal of an alien who has \"been convicted of a violation of ... any law ... relating to a controlled substance.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). In interpreting the phrase \"relating to,\" the BIA looks to the degree to which the violation in question is connected to underlying (drug-related) activity. <i>In re Espinoza-Gonzalez,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 889 (BIA 1999). If the violation and the underlying activity are \"so closely related\" that the two could not be considered \"separate or distinct,\" then the two are essentially one and the violation is of a law \"relating to\" the underlying activity. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Matter of Beltran,</i> 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 521, 528 (BIA 1992)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the Travel Act, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce ... with intent to ... promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to perform [any of the acts specified] shall be [punished as provided].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952(a)(3). The Travel Act defines the term \"unlawful activity\" to include, among other things, \"any business enterprise involving ... narcotics or controlled substances....\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1952(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the case at hand. As said, the petitioner pleaded guilty to traveling in interstate commerce to promote a business enterprise involving cocaine (a controlled substance). The conduct underlying the proscribed travel (the promotion of a business enterprise involving cocaine) was tantamount to aiding and abetting the distribution of narcotics. The plea agreement makes manifest the petitioner's admission of his involvement in that underlying conduct (and, thus, his culpability for it). <i>Cf. United States v. Salerno,</i> 66 F.3d 544, 550 (2d Cir.1995) (pleading guilty to interstate travel in furtherance of drug trafficking is tantamount to pleading to a felony drug offense). We see nothing separate or distinct, as a practical matter, between the Travel Act violation and the petitioner's involvement in the cocaine trade. Thus, common sense indicates that the petitioner's violation of the Travel Act was a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the petitioner makes a number of counter-arguments. None has merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, he suggests that a violation of the Travel Act cannot be a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance because the Travel Act covers a myriad of criminal activities, many of them non-drug-related (e.g., gambling, bribery). As he sees it, the Travel Act fundamentally relates to racketeering rather than to drug trafficking (indeed, the Travel Act's placement in the United States Code so indicates). For this reason, he likens his offense to misprision of a conspiracy to possess an illegal narcotic &#8212; an offense that the Sixth Circuit once ruled was not a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance, <i>see Castaneda De Esper v. INS,</i> 557 F.2d 79 (6th Cir.1977) &#8212; and to the illegal carriage of a firearm during the commission of a felony &#8212; an offense that the BIA once ruled was not a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance notwithstanding that the felony in question was itself drug-related, <i>see Matter of Carrillo,</i> 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 625 (BIA 1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not regard these quarter-century-old precedents as persuasive authority here. In the first place, both cases were decided under an earlier version of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(11) (1956) (repealed), which was not as sweeping in its definition of a drug-related offense as is the current version. The Ninth Circuit, in refusing to follow <i>Castaneda De Esper</i> and <i>Carrillo</i> on facts very much like those of the case at bar, found this change in the statutory language significant. <i>See Johnson v. INS,</i> 971 F.2d 340, 342 n. 4 (9th Cir.1992). We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second &#8212; and more important &#8212; the petitioners in <i>Castaneda De Esper</i> and <i>Carrillo</i> were both found guilty of violating general statutes that made no specific reference to drug-related activity. Thus, in <i>Castaneda De Esper,</i> 557 F.2d at 84, the petitioner was convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4 for \"having knowledge of ... a felony\" and concealing that fact. Similarly, in <i>Carrillo,</i> 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 625, the petitioner was convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) for illegally \"carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony.\" In both cases the statute of conviction was a generic statute that did not mention controlled substances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Unlike those statutes, the Travel Act specifically refers to drug-related activity. It criminalizes, inter alia, travel in interstate commerce with the intent to promote, carry on, or facilitate an unlawful activity, and specifically defines the term \"unlawful activity\" to include business enterprises involving controlled substances. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952(a)(3)-(b)(1). This congressional targeting of drug-related activity furnishes a much closer nexus than is afforded by the generic statutes involved in <i>Castaneda De Esper</i> and <i>Carrillo.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that Congress passed the Travel Act in an effort to deny individuals who act for criminal purposes, such as interstate drug trafficking, \"access to the channels of commerce.\" <i>Erlenbaugh v. United States,</i> 409 U.S. 239, 246, 93 S.Ct. 477, 34 L.Ed.2d 446 (1972). The Travel Act is simply the mechanism that Congress chose to accomplish regulation of the channels of commerce. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952 (1970) (adding \"controlled substances\" to the list of unlawful activities contained in the Travel Act). The petitioner, by traveling in interstate commerce to promote a narcotics enterprise, thus violated a law specifically aimed at the regulation of the narcotics trade. The fact that the Travel Act also targets other types of interstate travel does not disqualify it from service, in an appropriate case, as a law relating to controlled substances. <i>Accord Johnson,</i> 971 F.2d at 342.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also tries to analogize his Travel Act conviction to a conviction for being an accessory after the fact. <i>See, e.g., In re Batista-Hernandez,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 955 (BIA 1997) (holding that the crime of being an accessory after the fact, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3, does not relate to an antecedent controlled substance offense because it \"takes place subsequent to the completion of the underlying felony\" and is not \"punishable equally as the underlying substantive crime\"). He argues that because the penalties for a Travel Act violation and a narcotics violation are so different,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> a Travel Act violation cannot amount to a deportable offense. This course of ratiocination does not journey far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Batista-Hernandez,</i> the BIA focused its analysis of the offense not merely on the penalties that it carried, but also \"on the historical treatment of the crime in question.\" <i>Id.</i> at 959. The question there was to what extent the generic offense of accessory after the fact related to the underlying (drug-related) conduct. The BIA noted that the crime of accessory after the fact takes place <i>after</i> the completion of the principal crime, and, as such, \"does not aid in the commission of the [principal] offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 960. This is a far cry from the petitioner's case, in which the Travel Act violation was part and parcel of his drug-trafficking activity. The fact that the penalties differ, without more, lacks the talismanic significance that the petitioner attaches to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the petitioner insists that his Travel Act violation must be separate and distinct from his underlying activity because one can be prosecuted simultaneously for both a Travel Act infraction and for a specific drug-trafficking offense (say, possession with intent to distribute). <i>Cf. United States v. Stafford,</i> 831 F.2d 1479, 1481 (9th Cir.1987) (a case in which the defendant pleaded guilty both to traveling interstate to commit bribery and to the underlying offense of bribery). That plaint misses the point. The issue here is not whether the Travel Act sometimes overlaps with other criminal statutes, but, rather, whether a Travel Act violation is, in particular circumstances, a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance. For purposes of this inquiry, the fact that the elements of different crimes may partially coincide is meaningless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the petitioner strives to convince us that the BIA reads the relevant section of the INA too broadly. We are not persuaded. While adjudicators are bound in certain circumstances to interpret the Travel Act narrowly, <i>see Rewis v. United States,</i> 401 U.S. 808, 812-13, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971); <i>United States v. Hathaway,</i> 534 F.2d 386, 398 (1st Cir.1976), and to construe vague terms in favor of the alien, <i>Aybar-Alejo v. INS,</i> 230 F.3d 487, 489 (1st Cir.2000), neither principle is apposite here. The question in this case is whether section 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) covers offenses such as the petitioner's Travel Act violation. That is a question of law, and the BIA answered it correctly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we hold that the Travel Act is a law relating to controlled substances as long as there is a sufficiently close nexus between the violation and the furtherance of a drug-related enterprise. <i>See Johnson,</i> 971 F.2d at 342. Because such a nexus exists here, the petitioner's Travel Act violation amounted to a deportable offense under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's remaining point goes to the BIA's determination that his Travel Act violation constituted a drug-trafficking crime, and, as such, an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B). In the last analysis, this argument also depends on whether the Travel Act violation can be construed as relating to a controlled substance. Consequently, what we already have said controls here. Courts define \"illicit trafficking\" as illegally \"trading, selling or dealing\" in specified goods. <i>Kuhali v. Reno,</i> 266 F.3d 93, 107 (2d Cir.2001). Carrying on a business enterprise that deals in narcotics is within this rubric. Thus, the BIA correctly ruled that the petitioner's Travel Act violation constituted an aggravated felony. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B) (listing illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as an aggravated felony).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons stated herein, the petitioner was appropriately held deportable under 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Moreover, he was ineligible, as a matter of law, for discretionary relief. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1182(h).

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, Jos&#233; Ram&#243;n Urena-Ramirez, is a native of the Dominican Republic. He originally entered the United States under a false name and without a valid visa. Several years later, federal authorities charged him with aiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine. He pleaded guilty, inter alia, to a reduced charge of traveling in interstate commerce to promote an unlawful activity in violation of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952. The sentencing court imposed a 21-month incarcerative term, to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated removal proceedings on November 3, 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The INS claimed that the petitioner was deportable on three grounds, namely, (i) as an alien not in possession of a valid entry document, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(A); (ii) as an alien who had been convicted of an offense \"relating to\" a controlled substance, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1227(a)(2)(B)(i); and (iii) as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The government based the latter two charges on the petitioner's Travel Act conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a removal hearing before an Immigration Judge (IJ), the petitioner conceded deportability on the basis of his illegal entry into the United States. He denied the other charges, contending that the Travel Act violation was neither a drug-related offense nor an aggravated felony. He also requested a discretionary adjustment of status and waiver of deportation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(h).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the record of the petitioner's conviction, including the plea agreement (which revealed that the petitioner had pleaded guilty to traveling in interstate commerce for the specific purpose of promoting \"a business enterprise involving cocaine\"), the IJ found that the Travel Act conviction constituted both a drug-related offense and an aggravated felony. Accordingly, the IJ declared the petitioner ineligible for discretionary relief, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(h), and ordered his removal. The BIA affirmed this decision without opinion. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1101(47)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(a)(7) (formerly designated as 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.1(e)(4)); <i>see also Albathani v.

This timely petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner advances two closely related assignments of error. First, he claims that the Travel Act is not a law \"relating to\" a controlled substance. Second, he protests the classification of his Travel Act conviction as an aggravated felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider the applicable standard of review. This case hinges in substantial part on the proper determination of what constitutes a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1101-1537. The petitioner argues that the BIA incorrectly construed the relevant section of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), to include the Travel Act violation. In his view, that statute cannot be deemed sufficiently related to a controlled substance because the crime (traveling in interstate commerce) is separate and distinct from the underlying (drug-related) activity. For essentially the same reason, the petitioner challenges the BIA's determination that the Travel Act violation constituted \"illicit trafficking,\" as that term is used in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B) &#8212; a determination that not only converted the offense into an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) but also eliminated any chance for the petitioner to obtain discretionary relief (an adjustment of status and withholding of deportation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So viewed, this case turns on a pure question of law: whether a particular crime (here, a violation of the Travel Act) is a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance within the purview of the INA. That question, as framed, does not implicate the INS's exercise of administrative discretion. Consequently, the question engenders de novo review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See INS v.

The BIA rejected this argument.

In interpreting the phrase \"relating to,\" the BIA looks to the degree to which the violation in question is connected to underlying (drug-related) activity. <i>In re Espinoza-Gonzalez,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 889 (BIA 1999). If the violation and the underlying activity are \"so closely related\" that the two could not be considered \"separate or distinct,\" then the two are essentially one and the violation is of a law \"relating to\" the underlying activity. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Matter of Beltran,</i> 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 521, 528 (BIA 1992)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the Travel Act, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce ... with intent to ... promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter performs or attempts to perform [any of the acts specified] shall be [punished as provided].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952(a)(3). The Travel Act defines the term \"unlawful activity\" to include, among other things, \"any business enterprise involving ... narcotics or controlled substances....\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1952(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the case at hand. As said, the petitioner pleaded guilty to traveling in interstate commerce to promote a business enterprise involving cocaine (a controlled substance). The conduct underlying the proscribed travel (the promotion of a business enterprise involving cocaine) was tantamount to aiding and abetting the distribution of narcotics. The plea agreement makes manifest the petitioner's admission of his involvement in that underlying conduct (and, thus, his culpability for it). <i>Cf. United States v. Salerno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705080\"><a href=\"/opinion/705080/united-states-v-louis-salerno-gaetano-digirolamo-sr/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 550 (2d Cir.1995) (pleading guilty to interstate travel in furtherance of drug trafficking is tantamount to pleading to a felony drug offense). We see nothing separate or distinct, as a practical matter, between the Travel Act violation and the petitioner's involvement in the cocaine trade. Thus, common sense indicates that the petitioner's violation of the Travel Act was a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the petitioner makes a number of counter-arguments. None has merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, he suggests that a violation of the Travel Act cannot be a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance because the Travel Act covers a myriad of criminal activities, many of them non-drug-related (e.g., gambling, bribery). As he sees it, the Travel Act fundamentally relates to racketeering rather than to drug trafficking (indeed, the Travel Act's placement in the United States Code so indicates). For this reason, he likens his offense to misprision of a conspiracy to possess an illegal narcotic &#8212; an offense that the Sixth Circuit once ruled was not a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance, <i>see Castaneda De Esper v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"346711\"><a href=\"/opinion/346711/carlota-castaneda-de-esper-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span> (6th Cir.1977) &#8212; and to the illegal carriage of a firearm during the commission of a felony &#8212; an offense that the BIA once ruled was not a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance notwithstanding that the felony in question was itself drug-related, <i>see Matter of Carrillo,</i> 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 625 (BIA 1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not regard these quarter-century-old precedents as persuasive authority here. In the first place, both cases were decided under an earlier version of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(11) (1956) (repealed), which was not as sweeping in its definition of a drug-related offense as is the current version. The Ninth Circuit, in refusing to follow <i>Castaneda De Esper</i> and <i>Carrillo</i> on facts very much like those of the case at bar, found this change in the statutory language significant. <i>See Johnson v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587700\"><a href=\"/opinion/587700/brigette-karin-johnson-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span>, 342 n. 4 (9th Cir.1992). We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second &#8212; and more important &#8212; the petitioners in <i>Castaneda De Esper</i> and <i>Carrillo</i> were both found guilty of violating general statutes that made no specific reference to drug-related activity. Thus, in <i>Castaneda De Esper,</i> 557 F.2d at 84, the petitioner was convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4 for \"having knowledge of ... a felony\" and concealing that fact. Similarly, in <i>Carrillo,</i> 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 625, the petitioner was convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) for illegally \"carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony.\" In both cases the statute of conviction was a generic statute that did not mention controlled substances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Unlike those statutes, the Travel Act specifically refers to drug-related activity. It criminalizes, inter alia, travel in interstate commerce with the intent to promote, carry on, or facilitate an unlawful activity, and specifically defines the term \"unlawful activity\" to include business enterprises involving controlled substances. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952(a)(3)-(b)(1). This congressional targeting of drug-related activity furnishes a much closer nexus than is afforded by the generic statutes involved in <i>Castaneda De Esper</i> and <i>Carrillo.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that Congress passed the Travel Act in an effort to deny individuals who act for criminal purposes, such as interstate drug trafficking, \"access to the channels of commerce.\" <i>Erlenbaugh v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108645\"><a href=\"/opinion/108645/erlenbaugh-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span>, 246, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108645\"><a href=\"/opinion/108645/erlenbaugh-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span> (1972). The Travel Act is simply the mechanism that Congress chose to accomplish regulation of the channels of commerce. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952 (1970) (adding \"controlled substances\" to the list of unlawful activities contained in the Travel Act). The petitioner, by traveling in interstate commerce to promote a narcotics enterprise, thus violated a law specifically aimed at the regulation of the narcotics trade. The fact that the Travel Act also targets other types of interstate travel does not disqualify it from service, in an appropriate case, as a law relating to controlled substances. <i>Accord Johnson,</i> 971 F.2d at 342.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also tries to analogize his Travel Act conviction to a conviction for being an accessory after the fact. <i>See, e.g., In re Batista-Hernandez,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 955 (BIA 1997) (holding that the crime of being an accessory after the fact, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3, does not relate to an antecedent controlled substance offense because it \"takes place subsequent to the completion of the underlying felony\" and is not \"punishable equally as the underlying substantive crime\"). He argues that because the penalties for a Travel Act violation and a narcotics violation are so different,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> a Travel Act violation cannot amount to a deportable offense. This course of ratiocination does not journey far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Batista-Hernandez,</i> the BIA focused its analysis of the offense not merely on the penalties that it carried, but also \"on the historical treatment of the crime in question.\" <i>Id.</i> at 959. The question there was to what extent the generic offense of accessory after the fact related to the underlying (drug-related) conduct. The BIA noted that the crime of accessory after the fact takes place <i>after</i> the completion of the principal crime, and, as such, \"does not aid in the commission of the [principal] offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 960. This is a far cry from the petitioner's case, in which the Travel Act violation was part and parcel of his drug-trafficking activity. The fact that the penalties differ, without more, lacks the talismanic significance that the petitioner attaches to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the petitioner insists that his Travel Act violation must be separate and distinct from his underlying activity because one can be prosecuted simultaneously for both a Travel Act infraction and for a specific drug-trafficking offense (say, possession with intent to distribute). <i>Cf. United States v. Stafford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496624\"><a href=\"/opinion/496624/united-states-v-james-marty-stafford/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1479</span></a></span>, 1481 (9th Cir.1987) (a case in which the defendant pleaded guilty both to traveling interstate to commit bribery and to the underlying offense of bribery). That plaint misses the point. The issue here is not whether the Travel Act sometimes overlaps with other criminal statutes, but, rather, whether a Travel Act violation is, in particular circumstances, a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance. For purposes of this inquiry, the fact that the elements of different crimes may partially coincide is meaningless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the petitioner strives to convince us that the BIA reads the relevant section of the INA too broadly. We are not persuaded. While adjudicators are bound in certain circumstances to interpret the Travel Act narrowly, <i>see Rewis v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108306\"><a href=\"/opinion/108306/rewis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span>, 812-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108306\"><a href=\"/opinion/108306/rewis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770876\"><a href=\"/opinion/770876/antonia-trinidad-aybar-alejo-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span>, 489 (1st Cir.2000), neither principle is apposite here. The question in this case is whether section 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) covers offenses such as the petitioner's Travel Act violation. That is a question of law, and the BIA answered it correctly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we hold that the Travel Act is a law relating to controlled substances as long as there is a sufficiently close nexus between the violation and the furtherance of a drug-related enterprise. <i>See Johnson,</i> 971 F.2d at 342. Because such a nexus exists here, the petitioner's Travel Act violation amounted to a deportable offense under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's remaining point goes to the BIA's determination that his Travel Act violation constituted a drug-trafficking crime, and, as such, an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B). In the last analysis, this argument also depends on whether the Travel Act violation can be construed as relating to a controlled substance. Consequently, what we already have said controls here. Courts define \"illicit trafficking\" as illegally \"trading, selling or dealing\" in specified goods. <i>Kuhali v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774992\"><a href=\"/opinion/774992/alawi-kuhali-v-janet-reno-attorney-general-of-the-united-states-john-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 107 (2d Cir.2001). Carrying on a business enterprise that deals in narcotics is within this rubric. Thus, the BIA correctly ruled that the petitioner's Travel Act violation constituted an aggravated felony. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B) (listing illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as an aggravated felony).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.
