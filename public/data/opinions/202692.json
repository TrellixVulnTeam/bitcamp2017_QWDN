Petitioner Selim Rroshi\n\npetitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals's (BIA)\n\naffirmance of an immigration judge's (IJ) denial of his application\n\nfor asylum.1   We find that Rroshi's petition is precluded by Tota\n\nv. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 161 (1st Cir. 2006), and we therefore affirm.\n\n           Rroshi is a native and citizen of Albania who arrived in\n\nthe United States on March 3, 2002, on a false passport.        The\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS)2 issued a Notice to\n\nAppear, and at a hearing on September 11, 2002, Rroshi conceded\n\nremovability, but applied for relief based on his experiences in\n\nAlbania.    The IJ denied relief, and the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) affirmed and adopted the IJ's decision.\n\n           Rroshi was born in 1966 in Durres, Albania, into a family\n\nof \"Kulaks,\"3 who were considered opponents of the Communist regime\n\nthen in power.    Some of Rroshi's family members spent time in\n\nprison, presumably for political reasons.    Rroshi became involved\n\nwith the Democratic Party in 1990, and participated in party\n\n\n     1\n      Rroshi was also denied withholding of removal and protection\nunder the Convention Against Torture, but does not appeal those\ndenials here.\n     2\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, §\n471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. §\n291(a)), abolished the INS and transferred its duties to the\nDepartment of Homeland Security. See Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d\n8, 13 n.2 (1st Cir. 2004).\n     3\n      \"Kulak\" seems to be a generic term for landowners and others\nwith wealth who were disfavored during the Communist regime.\n\n                                -2-\n\frallies and organizing activities. In 1991, Rroshi was shot in the\n\nleg on his way home from a demonstration.           He believes that he was\n\ntargeted by the Communist Party because of his Democratic Party\n\nactivities.\n\n            The Democratic Party took power in 1992, and Rroshi\n\ncontinued   to   be   active   in   the    party.    The   Socialist   Party,\n\napparently made up largely of former Communist Party members,\n\nreturned to power in 1997.          In the period leading up to that\n\nelection, Rroshi again became the subject of physical attacks.\n\n            On June 22, 1997, Rroshi visited the village of Rreth to\n\ncampaign for the Democratic Party.          There, he spoke to a group of\n\nabout 40 or 50 people in the town center and advocated, among other\n\nthings, that the Socialist Party should be outlawed.              Socialist\n\nParty members hit and swore at Rroshi and his companions as they\n\nleft town that evening.\n\n            When Rroshi and his companions returned to Durres, they\n\nparked near the Democratic Party office and went for a walk on the\n\ntown’s promenade.     As they walked, a car pulled up in front of them\n\nand three men got out and began to beat Rroshi and his companions.\n\nThe men forced Rroshi and the others into their car, blindfolded\n\nthem, and took them to a house 45 minutes away, where the beatings\n\ncontinued and the captors told them to leave the Democratic Party.\n\nThey were held captive in the house for two weeks, until the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\felection had passed.      When Rroshi was released, his captors told\n\nhim that if they caught him again, they would kill him.\n\n            After the election, Democratic Party members continued to\n\nbe harassed and threatened.          Socialist Party members entered\n\nRroshi's house and mistreated his mother and brother.            Rroshi was\n\nalso   arrested   on    two   occasions   and   held   without   charge   or\n\nexplanation for several hours.\n\n            In January 2002, Rroshi was at a bar in Durres, when a\n\nperson in a military-looking uniform approached him and left a\n\nbullet on his table, and warned him that he would have the same\n\nfate as his friends, presumably referring to Democratic Party\n\nmembers who had been killed.       Two days after that, Rroshi went to\n\nTirane, where he procured a false passport.             He then left the\n\ncountry through Italy, traveled to Spain, and then to the United\n\nStates, entering in Chicago. Upon entry, he disclosed to a customs\n\nofficial that his passport was false and that he was seeking\n\nasylum.\n\n            In order to qualify for asylum, Rroshi must show that he\n\nis a \"refugee.\"        8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A), (B)(i); 8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.13(a).   A \"refugee\" is a person outside his or her home country\n\nwho is \"unable or unwilling to return . . . because of persecution\n\nor a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).         If a person can show past\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fpersecution, this creates a presumption that the person has a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution.                     8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).\n\nHowever, this presumption can be rebutted by a preponderance of\n\nevidence      that   \"[t]here       has     been    a    fundamental     change    in\n\ncircumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution.\"          8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A).\n\n              The IJ found Rroshi credible, and agreed that he had\n\nsuffered      past   persecution.         This     shifted    the   burden   to   the\n\ngovernment to show that, despite this past persecution, Rroshi did\n\nnot have a well-founded fear of future persecution. The government\n\npresented evidence of changed circumstances in Albania, primarily\n\nthrough the U.S. State Department's 2004 report, Albania: Profile\n\nof   Asylum     Claims   and    Country     Conditions       (\"Country   Conditions\n\nReport\").      The report noted that there had been no major outbreaks\n\nof political violence since 1998, that neither party any longer\n\nengaged    in    policies      of   abuse    or    coercion    against    political\n\nopponents, and that many former opposition members had returned to\n\nthe country without reprisal.\n\n              Relying on the Country Conditions Report, the IJ held\n\nthat changed circumstances were such that Rroshi did not have a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.                   The BIA affirmed in a\n\nshort opinion adopting the decision of the IJ.\n\n              We review the decision of the BIA directly, but \"[w]here\n\nthe BIA deferred to or adopted the IJ's reasons for denying [the\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fpetitioner's] claims, we review those portions of the IJ's decision\n\nas part of the final decision of the BIA.\"             Hernandez-Barrera v.\n\nAshcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2004).                   We review the IJ's\n\nfactual   findings    under   the    deferential     \"substantial     evidence\"\n\nstandard.      Dhima v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir. 2005).            The\n\nIJ's determination must stand \"unless any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"                    8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b)(4)(B).      This same standard applies to an IJ's finding of\n\nchanged circumstances, where such a finding is based on factual\n\ndeterminations, as this one was.              Tota, 457 F.3d at 165 n.8;\n\nMehilli v. Gonzales, 433 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            While the State Department's Country Conditions Reports\n\nare not binding, Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir. 1998),\n\nthey are \"generally probative of country conditions\" and \"may be\n\nsufficient . . . to rebut the presumption of future persecution,\"\n\nPalma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2005).                 In\n\nthe case of Albania, we have recently addressed the applicability\n\nof the Country Conditions Report under circumstances remarkably\n\nsimilar to those here.        See Tota, 457 F.3d at 162-65; see also\n\nAlibeaj   v.    Gonzales,   469,    F.3d    188,   192-93    (1st   Cir.   2006);\n\nBollanos v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir. 2006).                        The\n\npetitioner in Tota, Gen Tota, also worked for the Democratic Party\n\nduring the same period, and was beaten and accosted by Socialist\n\nParty members (although he was not kidnapped as Rroshi was).\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fFollowing      the    Socialists'      return    to   power    in    1997,     he   was\n\nfrequently arrested and held without charge, once for 20 hours.\n\nTota ultimately left Albania in 2000 and sought asylum in the\n\nUnited States.\n\n              As in this case, the IJ found Tota credible as to past\n\npersecution, but found that the Country Conditions Report provided\n\nsufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of future persecution.\n\nOn   appeal,    Tota    challenged      the    IJ's   reliance      on   the   Country\n\nConditions Report, but we held that \"substantial evidence culled\n\nfrom the [Country Conditions Report], specifically tailored to the\n\ndiscussion of political persecution of [Democratic Party] members\n\nby the Socialist government, supports the IJ's finding that the\n\ngovernment      met    its    burden    of     rebutting      Tota's     presumptive\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution.\"              Tota, 457 F.3d at 168.          Only a\n\nshort period of time has passed since our decision in Tota, and\n\nthere   has    been    no    evidence   presented      that   the    situation      has\n\nworsened in Albania in that period.                   Therefore, we follow our\n\ndecision in Tota and deny the petition for review.\n\n              The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f",

The BIA affirmed in a\n\nshort opinion adopting the decision of the IJ.\n\n              We review the decision of the BIA directly, but \"[w]here\n\nthe BIA deferred to or adopted the IJ's reasons for denying [the\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fpetitioner's] claims, we review those portions of the IJ's decision\n\nas part of the final decision of the BIA.\"             Hernandez-Barrera v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786695\"><a href=\"/opinion/786695/fidel-angel-hernandez-barrera-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1st Cir. 2004).

The\n\npetitioner in Tota, Gen Tota, also worked for the Democratic Party\n\nduring the same period, and was beaten and accosted by Socialist\n\nParty members (although he was not kidnapped as Rroshi was).\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fFollowing      the    Socialists'      return    to   power    in    1997,     he   was\n\nfrequently arrested and held without charge, once for 20 hours.\n\nTota ultimately left Albania in 2000 and sought asylum in the\n\nUnited States.\n\n              As in this case, the IJ found Tota credible as to past\n\npersecution, but found that the Country Conditions Report provided\n\nsufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of future persecution.\n\nOn   appeal,    Tota    challenged      the    IJ's   reliance      on   the   Country\n\nConditions Report, but we held that \"substantial evidence culled\n\nfrom the [Country Conditions Report], specifically tailored to the\n\ndiscussion of political persecution of [Democratic Party] members\n\nby the Socialist government, supports the IJ's finding that the\n\ngovernment      met    its    burden    of     rebutting      Tota's     presumptive\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution.\"              Tota, 457 F.3d at 168.          Only a\n\nshort period of time has passed since our decision in Tota, and\n\nthere   has    been    no    evidence   presented      that   the    situation      has\n\nworsened in Albania in that period.                   Therefore, we follow our\n\ndecision in Tota and deny the petition for review.\n\n              The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f</pre>",
