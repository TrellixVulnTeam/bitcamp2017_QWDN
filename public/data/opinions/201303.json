James M. Knott, Sr.\n\nand the Riverdale Power & Electric Co. (“Knott”) petition for\n\nreview of three orders by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n\n(“FERC”).    The orders assert mandatory licensing authority over\n\nKnott’s hydroelectric project, require him to install gages to\n\nmeasure stream flow at the project, and direct him to submit\n\nproject design revisions on microfiche cards.    Knott alleges that\n\nFERC improperly asserted jurisdiction over the project, that the\n\nrequired compliance would effect a Fifth Amendment taking of his\n\nproperty, that FERC improperly denied him an evidentiary hearing,\n\nand that FERC unreasonably ordered gages and microfiche cards. For\n\nthe reasons stated, we deny Knott’s petition for review.\n\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n            Originally built in the 19th century, Knott’s Riverdale\n\nMills Project (“Project”) is located on the Blackstone River in\n\nWorcester County, Massachusetts.   The Project includes a 142-foot-\n\nlong, 10-foot-high dam, an 11.8-acre water impoundment, and a 150-\n\nkilowatt generator located within a mill building. Knott purchased\n\nthe Project, which had been abandoned since 1976, in 1979. Through\n\na separate entity, the Riverdale Mills Corporation, Knott uses the\n\nhydropower generated by the Project to produce steel wire for use\n\nin lobster traps.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f              The Federal Power Act (“FPA”), 16 U.S.C. §§ 791a–825r,\n\ngrants FERC two types of licensing authority over hydroelectric\n\nprojects.         Section 4(e) of the Act authorizes FERC to grant\n\nvoluntary licenses for any project that develops power in any body\n\nof   water    over    which   Congress     has   Commerce    Clause    authority.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 797(e).           Section 23(b)(1) requires the mandatory\n\nlicensing of projects: (1) located on “any of the navigable waters\n\nof the United States;” or (2) located on a body of water over which\n\nCongress has Commerce Clause authority where project construction\n\noccurred on or after August 26, 1935, and the project affects the\n\ninterests of interstate or foreign commerce.                16 U.S.C. § 817(1).\n\n              In 1985, Knott applied for and received a voluntary\n\nlicense to operate the Project, subject to numerous conditions.\n\nBecause Knott received a voluntary license, FERC had no occasion to\n\ndetermine whether it had mandatory licensing jurisdiction over the\n\nProject.\n\n              In early 1999 FERC received letters alleging extreme\n\nfluctuations in the Blackstone River below the Project and noted a\n\nconcern      by   state   agencies   and    conservation      groups    that   the\n\nfluctuations might be the result of Knott’s failure to operate his\n\nProject to allow a continuous stream flow.            In a series of letters\n\nFERC repeatedly requested stream flow gaging records, and Knott\n\nrepeatedly responded that he had no obligation to install stream\n\nflow gages.          In December 1999 FERC issued a compliance order\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\frequiring Knott to file a plan for installing stream flow gages at\n\nthe Project, in accordance with Article 6 of Knott’s license.1\n\nKnott filed a request for rehearing, which FERC denied on May 22,\n\n2000.\n\n           In November 2000 Knott filed for FERC approval to install\n\nan   unrelated   “flood    flow   modular     gate.”        FERC    approved    the\n\nproposal, but required Knott to file revised drawings of the gate\n\non aperture cards (3 1/4\" x 7\") on silver or gelatin 35 mm\n\nmicrofilm.    Knott sought rehearing of this requirement, which FERC\n\ndenied.   FERC noted that its regulations require exhibit drawings\n\nto be microfilmed onto aperture cards, that aperture cards provide\n\nan inexpensive and durable information medium, and that some of\n\nKnott’s paper drawings were inaccurate.              Knott timely petitioned\n\nfor review.\n\n             During the course of his earlier proceedings, Knott\n\ncontended that FERC had no jurisdiction over the Project and, thus,\n\ncould not compel him to comply with either his license or agency\n\nregulations.      In   response,    FERC      instituted     a     proceeding    to\n\nreexamine the basis for its jurisdiction.              In November 2000 FERC\n\nstaff prepared a supplemental study of the navigability of the\n\nBlackstone    River.      The   study    described     in   detail    a   four-day\n\n\n      1\n      The terms and conditions of the voluntary license provide\nthat “[t]he Licensee shall install and thereafter maintain gages\nand stream-gaging stations for the purpose of determining the stage\nand flow of the stream or streams on which the project is located.”\nApp. 106.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fexpedition      in   September    2000,    organized    by    local    businesses,\n\nenvironmental        groups,     and     governmental        bodies,      in    which\n\napproximately thirty canoeists traversed the river from Worcester,\n\npast the Project, into Rhode Island and then Narragansett Bay.\n\nBased on this expedition, which was accomplished with a minimum of\n\noverland transport, or “portages,” FERC staff concluded that the\n\nBlackstone River is suitable for interstate use by recreational\n\nboaters and is thus a navigable waterway within the meaning of FPA\n\n§ 3(8).    See 16 U.S.C. § 796(8) (defining “navigable waters”).\n\nFERC therefore        concluded    that    the   Project     is   subject      to   its\n\nmandatory licensing authority, and ordered Knott to abide by its\n\norders and all license terms and conditions.\n\n               Knott filed a request for rehearing, which FERC denied.\n\nFERC upheld the finding of the staff navigability report and also\n\nfound,    as    a    separate    basis    for    jurisdiction,     that     (1)      the\n\nBlackstone River has an effect on interstate commerce; (2) the\n\nProject has an effect on interstate commerce; and (3) Project\n\nconstruction had occurred since August 1935 because Knott had\n\nsubstantially rebuilt Project facilities and returned them to\n\noperation after the Project had been abandoned in 1976.                             FERC\n\nadditionally rejected Knott’s takings and due process arguments.\n\nKnott timely petitioned for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f                                 DISCUSSION\n\nI.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          “We review FERC’s findings of fact for ‘substantial\n\nevidence,’ and if so supported, such findings are conclusive.”\n\nThomas Hodgson & Sons v. FERC, 49 F.3d 822, 825 (1st Cir. 1995);\n\n16 U.S.C. § 825l.         We “defer to the agency’s expertise . . . so\n\nlong as its decision is supported by ‘substantial evidence’ in the\n\nrecord and reached by ‘reasoned decisionmaking,’ including an\n\nexamination   of    the    relevant   data   and   a   reasoned   explanation\n\nsupported by a stated connection between the facts found and the\n\nchoice made.”      Northeast Utils. Serv. Co. v. FERC, 993 F.2d 937,\n\n944 (1st Cir. 1993) (citation omitted).\n\n          “‘Pure’ legal errors require no deference to agency\n\nexpertise, and are reviewed de novo.” Id. “Questions involving an\n\ninterpretation of the FPA involve a de novo determination by the\n\ncourt of congressional intent; if that intent is ambiguous, FERC’s\n\nconclusion will only be rejected if it is unreasonable.”                  Id.\n\n(citing Chevron USA v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837,\n\n842-45 (1984)).\n\n          We review FERC orders under the Administrative Procedure\n\nAct, 5 U.S.C. § 551, and must reverse an agency action that is\n\n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\n\naccordance with law.”         Wis. Valley Improvement Co. v. FERC, 236\n\nF.3d 738, 742 (D.C. Cir. 2001).\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fII.   MANDATORY JURISDICTION\n\n           Knott challenges both grounds upon which FERC based its\n\nfinding of mandatory jurisdiction:         (1) that the Blackstone River\n\nis navigable; and (2) that Knott’s reconstruction work after a\n\nperiod of abandonment sufficed to confer jurisdiction.            Because we\n\nhold that FERC properly based its jurisdiction on a finding of\n\nnavigability,    we   do   not   reach   the   issues   of   abandonment   and\n\nreconstruction.\n\n           The FPA, adopted in 1920, defines “navigable waters” as:\n\n           [T]hose parts of streams or other bodies of\n           water over which Congress has [Commerce\n           Clause] jurisdiction . . . and which either in\n           their    natural    or   improved    condition\n           notwithstanding interruptions between the\n           navigable parts of such streams or waters by\n           falls, shallows, or rapids compelling land\n           carriage, are used or suitable for use for the\n           transportation of persons or property in\n           interstate or foreign commerce, including\n           therein all such interrupting falls, shallows,\n           or rapids.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 796(8) (emphases added). Based on this definition, and\n\ncase law interpreting it, FERC correctly found that the September\n\n2000 canoe trip demonstrated that the Blackstone River and Project\n\nsite were “suitable for use” in interstate commerce notwithstanding\n\nthe shallows “compelling land carriage.”\n\n           Knott first argues that FERC’s authority must be limited\n\nto waterways used for actual, ongoing interstate commerce, “not\n\nhypothetical possibilities of unrealized commerce.”            This argument\n\nis unavailing.    The statutory language applies to waters in use or\n\n                                     -7-\n\f“suitable for use” for personal transportation, notwithstanding\n\ninterruptions.     Id. The Supreme Court has held that the absence of\n\nactual   commercial       traffic   does     not   bar    “a    conclusion    of\n\nnavigability where personal or private use by boats demonstrates\n\nthe availability of the stream for the simpler types of commercial\n\nnavigation.”     United States v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311\n\nU.S. 377, 416 (1940); see also United States v. Utah, 283 U.S. 64,\n\n82 (1931) (“The extent of existing commerce is not the test.”).\n\nIrregular canoe trips may support a finding of navigability.                  See\n\nFPL Energy Me. Hydro LLC v. FERC, 287 F.3d 1151, 1157 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2002) (upholding a determination of navigability based on three\n\ncanoe    trips     made     for     the     purpose      of    litigation).\n\n           Nor does the fact that the Blackstone River required\n\nportages defeat a finding of navigability.            The statute explicitly\n\ncontemplates     that   waterways    may    be   navigable     “notwithstanding\n\ninterruptions between the navigable parts of such streams or waters\n\nby falls, shallows, or rapids compelling land carriage.” 16 U.S.C.\n\n§ 796(8). “Such interruptions do not render an otherwise navigable\n\nstream non-navigable.” Consol. Hydro, Inc. v. FERC, 968 F.2d 1258,\n\n1262 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citing cases).2\n\n\n     2\n      Knott’s  selective   citations  do   not  undermine   these\nprinciples. Knott incorrectly relies on Miami Valley Conservancy\nDist. v. Alexander, 692 F.2d 447 (6th Cir. 1982), a case\nchallenging Army Corps of Engineers jurisdiction under the Rivers\nand Harbors Act of 1899, and LeBlanc v. Cleveland, 198 F.3d 353\n(2nd Cir. 1999), a personal injury suit arising under general\nadmiralty law.   Neither case evaluated or applied FPA § 3(8).\n\n                                      -8-\n\f          Given this consensus, FERC’s interpretation of the FPA\n\nconcerning the standard for navigability is reasonable and entitled\n\nto deference.   The D.C. Circuit recently explained that:\n\n          As the [FPA] does not define when a waterway\n          is “suitable for use . . . in . . . commerce,”\n          we assume that Congress intended FERC to\n          address the ambiguity in the statute and\n          develop an appropriate test.       See United\n          States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 229\n          (2001). We find that FERC’s interpretation of\n          navigability under the FPA, which was based on\n          test canoe trips and the Stream’s physical\n          characteristics . . . was reasonable and\n          entitled to deference.\n\nFPL, 287 F.3d at 1156.     FERC thus applied the proper legal test\n\nrequired by the plain language of § 3(8) and the relevant case law.\n\n          Substantial     evidence     supports   FERC’s     factual\n\ndetermination that the Blackstone River is suitable “for the\n\nsimpler types of commercial navigation.”    Appalachian Elec. Power\n\nCo., 311 U.S. at 416.    FERC properly relied on the September 2000\n\ncanoe expedition, which was accomplished with “few problems,”\n\n“relatively easy” portages, and “a minimum of difficulty.”     Knott\n\nasserts that the river is prone to dry or low flows and has many\n\nnatural   and   constructed   obstacles.   However,   the   statutory\n\n\nKnott also relies on Leonard Murphy, 98 F.E.R.C. 61,302 (2002), but\nthat decision reaffirmed that “[s]ection 3(8) provides that the\nstream may be found navigable if it was, is, or could be made\nsuitable for such use.     Such suitability may be shown through\nnon-commercial or recreational uses of the stream.” Id. at 62,295.\nDuke Power, 74 F.E.R.C. 61,291 (1996), does not address the\nnavigability question.    Knott’s remaining citations predate the\nCourt’s landmark decision in Appalachian Electric Power Co., 311\nU.S. 377 (1940), a case Knott does not address.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fdefinition of navigability explicitly allows for “land carriage”\n\naround “interruptions.”           16 U.S.C. § 796(8).         Knott does not\n\notherwise      seriously   dispute    that    the   canoeists      successfully\n\nnavigated the waterway. He questions the participants’ motivation,\n\nbut this is irrelevant; what matters is that the participants\n\ncompleted the journey, regardless of motivation. See FPL, 287 F.3d\n\nat 1157 (affirming jurisdiction based on canoe trips made for the\n\npurpose of litigation).3\n\n            FERC’s finding that the Blackstone River is navigable, as\n\ndefined   by    16   U.S.C.   §   796(8),    is   supported   by   substantial\n\nevidence.      We therefore hold that FERC properly asserted mandatory\n\njurisdiction over the Project.\n\nIII. KNOTT’S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS\n\n            Knott    argues   that   a   finding    of   mandatory   licensing\n\njurisdiction effects a taking of his private property rights, and\n\nthat FERC violated his right to due process by denying him an\n\nevidentiary hearing on the issue of staff bias.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Knott also asserts that FERC has repeatedly reversed itself\nin determining the navigability of the Blackstone River, thus\nundermining its most recent order. This argument lacks foundation.\nFERC’s 1987 order issuing Knott a voluntary license made no finding\non the navigability issue; FERC’s instant order thus presents no\nconflict. FERC did reverse itself with regard to a project located\nupstream from Knott’s facility, but only after the September 2000\ncanoe expedition demonstrated the navigability of the river at both\nlocations.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f     A.     Fifth Amendment Takings Clause\n\n            Knott   alleges    that    mandatory       FERC    jurisdiction    will\n\ndeprive him of all economically viable use of his deeded right to\n\ndivert water from the Blackstone River “as he shall see fit.”                   We\n\nlack jurisdiction to hear Knott’s taking claim because the Tucker\n\nAct, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1), and “Little Tucker Act,” 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1346(a)(2), vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Federal\n\nClaims (the district courts have concurrent jurisdiction over\n\nclaims for $10,000 or less) to render judgment upon any claim\n\nagainst the United States for money damages that “is founded upon\n\nthe Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an\n\nexecutive department.”        28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).            Although Knott’s\n\npetition     for    review    does     not    specifically        seek   monetary\n\ncompensation, the Supreme Court has stated that “taking claims\n\nagainst the Federal Government are premature until the property\n\nowner has availed itself of the process provided by the Tucker\n\nAct.”      Preseault v.      ICC,    494   U.S.   1,   11     (1990).    See   also\n\nRuckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1016 (1984) (“Equitable\n\nrelief is not available to enjoin an alleged taking of private\n\nproperty for public use, duly authorized by law, when a suit for\n\ncompensation can be brought against the sovereign subsequent to the\n\ntaking.”).\n\n            “Accordingly, a claim for just compensation under the\n\nTakings Clause must be brought to the Court of Federal Claims in\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fthe first instance, unless Congress has withdrawn the Tucker Act\n\ngrant of jurisdiction in the relevant statute.”      E. Enters. v.\n\nApfel, 524 U.S. 498, 520 (1998).       The courts have rejected an\n\nargument that the FPA represents such a withdrawal of jurisdiction.\n\nSee Wis. Valley Improvement Co. v. FERC, 236 F.3d 738, 743 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2001) (holding that while petitioner seeking review of FERC\n\norders imposing conditions on its license “may be able to advance\n\na colorable Takings-Clause claim, it is not within our jurisdiction\n\nto adjudicate it”).   Knott may thus file a takings action in the\n\nCourt of Federal Claims, but may not pursue it on a petition for\n\nreview brought under 16 U.S.C. § 825l.\n\n     B.   Evidentiary hearing\n\n          Knott further alleges that FERC improperly denied him a\n\n“true” evidentiary hearing with regard to his “repeated allegations\n\nof official government witness bias and factual inaccuracy.”    We\n\nrecently rejected a similar claim, and explained that:\n\n          The term “hearing” is notoriously malleable,\n          but what petitioners got here was not only a\n          hearing but a species of evidentiary hearing\n          which is now quite common in utility and\n          carrier   regulation.       Very   extensive\n          evidentiary submissions were made by both\n          sides in the form of affidavits from experts\n          and others, together with extensive written\n          argument . . . .\n\nCent. Me. Power Co. v. FERC, 252 F.3d 34, 46 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(citation omitted). We reconfirmed that a “true” hearing before an\n\nadministrative law judge is unnecessary if any genuine issues of\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fmaterial fact can be “adequately resolved on the written record.”\n\nId. (citing cases).\n\n          The factual issues Knott sought to raise are not issues\n\nmaterial to the dispute at hand.            The alleged biases of certain\n\nFERC staff are irrelevant to a finding of navigability or an order\n\nto comply with the terms of Knott’s voluntary license.              Knott does\n\nnot   dispute    that     the   September   2000    canoeists    successfully\n\nnavigated the Blackstone River and Knott’s voluntary license,\n\nexplicitly requiring him to install gages, predates the alleged\n\nbiased acts and, thus, cannot be their result.               Knott’s arguments\n\nwere thus properly addressed by FERC through a paper hearing.\n\nIV.   ORDERS REQUIRING COMPLIANCE WITH LICENSE AND REGULATIONS\n\n           Knott asserts that FERC acted unreasonably in demanding\n\nthat he file project drawings on microfilm.              Under the arbitrary\n\nand capricious standard, we consider whether an agency’s decision\n\nis “based on consideration of the relevant factors” and articulates\n\na “rational connection between the facts found and the choice\n\nmade.”   Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc.,\n\n419 U.S. 281, 285 (1974) (citation omitted).             FERC noted that its\n\nregulations     require    exhibit   drawings      to   be   microfilmed   onto\n\naperture cards, 18 C.F.R. § 4.39, and that “[a]perture cards\n\nprovide a durable medium for storing information about hydropower\n\nproject features and are relatively inexpensive to produce, costing\n\nabout $25-$50 for a set-up fee and one dollar for each original.”\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fFERC also noted that Knott had modified his Project, rendering some\n\nof his previous drawings inaccurate. Knott describes the microfilm\n\nrequirement as “antiquated” and lobbies for an “[i]nfusion of\n\nmodern technology,” but offers nothing further.              FERC’s decision\n\nrequiring records to be submitted on microfilm, in conformity with\n\nits existing record-keeping system and because of the medium’s\n\ndurability     and   relatively     inexpensive    cost,     is    not    overly\n\nburdensome and cannot be considered arbitrary or capricious.\n\n          Knott also argues that FERC acted arbitrarily in ordering\n\nhim to install stream flow gages.        He contends that such gages are\n\nnot necessary because other gages exist, and that the license terms\n\nrequiring such gages do not apply to his Project.            These arguments\n\nare also unpersuasive. FERC specifically rejected Knott’s argument\n\nthat other gages sufficed to address the issue, finding that those\n\ngages were     too   distant   to   measure   impacts     from    the    Project.\n\nKnott’s license explicitly requires him to “install and thereafter\n\nmaintain gages and stream-gaging stations for the purpose of\n\ndetermining the stage and flow of the stream or streams on which\n\nthe project is located” and to minimize fluctuations such that\n\n“flow in the Blackstone River, as measured immediately below the\n\nproject approximates the instantaneous sum of inflow to the project\n\nreservoir” (emphasis added).        39 F.E.R.C. 62,308.      FERC decided to\n\nenforce these conditions after receiving letters alleging extreme\n\nfluctuations    in   the   Blackstone   River     below   the     Project,   and\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fexpressions of concern by state agencies and conservation groups\n\nthat the fluctuations might be the result of Knott’s failure to\n\noperate his Project to allow a continuous stream flow.     Knott’s\n\ncontention that the terms and conditions of the license do not\n\napply to his Project are without merit; the order issuing the\n\nlicense explicitly states that the license is subject to such\n\nterms. 39 F.E.R.C. 62,308. FERC’s orders for compliance with these\n\nterms are reasonable.     See Clifton Power Corp. v. FERC, 88 F.3d\n\n1258, 1262 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“It is simply not unreasonable for\n\nFERC to require [licensee] to install [stream gaging] devices to\n\ndetermine whether the dam is operating in the mode described in its\n\nlicense application.”).\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons stated, we DENY Knott’s petition for\n\nreview.\n\n          PETITION DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f",

James M. Knott, Sr.\n\nand the Riverdale Power & Electric Co. (“Knott”) petition for\n\nreview of three orders by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n\n(“FERC”).    The orders assert mandatory licensing authority over\n\nKnott’s hydroelectric project, require him to install gages to\n\nmeasure stream flow at the project, and direct him to submit\n\nproject design revisions on microfiche cards.    Knott alleges that\n\nFERC improperly asserted jurisdiction over the project, that the\n\nrequired compliance would effect a Fifth Amendment taking of his\n\nproperty, that FERC improperly denied him an evidentiary hearing,\n\nand that FERC unreasonably ordered gages and microfiche cards. For\n\nthe reasons stated, we deny Knott’s petition for review.\n\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n            Originally built in the 19th century, Knott’s Riverdale\n\nMills Project (“Project”) is located on the Blackstone River in\n\nWorcester County, Massachusetts.   The Project includes a 142-foot-\n\nlong, 10-foot-high dam, an 11.8-acre water impoundment, and a 150-\n\nkilowatt generator located within a mill building. Knott purchased\n\nthe Project, which had been abandoned since 1976, in 1979. Through\n\na separate entity, the Riverdale Mills Corporation, Knott uses the\n\nhydropower generated by the Project to produce steel wire for use\n\nin lobster traps.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f              The Federal Power Act (“FPA”), 16 U.S.C. §§ 791a–825r,\n\ngrants FERC two types of licensing authority over hydroelectric\n\nprojects.         Section 4(e) of the Act authorizes FERC to grant\n\nvoluntary licenses for any project that develops power in any body\n\nof   water    over    which   Congress     has   Commerce    Clause    authority.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 797(e).           Section 23(b)(1) requires the mandatory\n\nlicensing of projects: (1) located on “any of the navigable waters\n\nof the United States;” or (2) located on a body of water over which\n\nCongress has Commerce Clause authority where project construction\n\noccurred on or after August 26, 1935, and the project affects the\n\ninterests of interstate or foreign commerce.                16 U.S.C. § 817(1).\n\n              In 1985, Knott applied for and received a voluntary\n\nlicense to operate the Project, subject to numerous conditions.\n\nBecause Knott received a voluntary license, FERC had no occasion to\n\ndetermine whether it had mandatory licensing jurisdiction over the\n\nProject.\n\n              In early 1999 FERC received letters alleging extreme\n\nfluctuations in the Blackstone River below the Project and noted a\n\nconcern      by   state   agencies   and    conservation      groups    that   the\n\nfluctuations might be the result of Knott’s failure to operate his\n\nProject to allow a continuous stream flow.            In a series of letters\n\nFERC repeatedly requested stream flow gaging records, and Knott\n\nrepeatedly responded that he had no obligation to install stream\n\nflow gages.          In December 1999 FERC issued a compliance order\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\frequiring Knott to file a plan for installing stream flow gages at\n\nthe Project, in accordance with Article 6 of Knott’s license.1\n\nKnott filed a request for rehearing, which FERC denied on May 22,\n\n2000.\n\n           In November 2000 Knott filed for FERC approval to install\n\nan   unrelated   “flood    flow   modular     gate.”        FERC    approved    the\n\nproposal, but required Knott to file revised drawings of the gate\n\non aperture cards (3 1/4\" x 7\") on silver or gelatin 35 mm\n\nmicrofilm.    Knott sought rehearing of this requirement, which FERC\n\ndenied.   FERC noted that its regulations require exhibit drawings\n\nto be microfilmed onto aperture cards, that aperture cards provide\n\nan inexpensive and durable information medium, and that some of\n\nKnott’s paper drawings were inaccurate.              Knott timely petitioned\n\nfor review.\n\n             During the course of his earlier proceedings, Knott\n\ncontended that FERC had no jurisdiction over the Project and, thus,\n\ncould not compel him to comply with either his license or agency\n\nregulations.      In   response,    FERC      instituted     a     proceeding    to\n\nreexamine the basis for its jurisdiction.              In November 2000 FERC\n\nstaff prepared a supplemental study of the navigability of the\n\nBlackstone    River.      The   study    described     in   detail    a   four-day\n\n\n      1\n      The terms and conditions of the voluntary license provide\nthat “[t]he Licensee shall install and thereafter maintain gages\nand stream-gaging stations for the purpose of determining the stage\nand flow of the stream or streams on which the project is located.”\nApp. 106.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fexpedition      in   September    2000,    organized    by    local    businesses,\n\nenvironmental        groups,     and     governmental        bodies,      in    which\n\napproximately thirty canoeists traversed the river from Worcester,\n\npast the Project, into Rhode Island and then Narragansett Bay.\n\nBased on this expedition, which was accomplished with a minimum of\n\noverland transport, or “portages,” FERC staff concluded that the\n\nBlackstone River is suitable for interstate use by recreational\n\nboaters and is thus a navigable waterway within the meaning of FPA\n\n§ 3(8).    See 16 U.S.C. § 796(8) (defining “navigable waters”).\n\nFERC therefore        concluded    that    the   Project     is   subject      to   its\n\nmandatory licensing authority, and ordered Knott to abide by its\n\norders and all license terms and conditions.\n\n               Knott filed a request for rehearing, which FERC denied.\n\nFERC upheld the finding of the staff navigability report and also\n\nfound,    as    a    separate    basis    for    jurisdiction,     that     (1)      the\n\nBlackstone River has an effect on interstate commerce; (2) the\n\nProject has an effect on interstate commerce; and (3) Project\n\nconstruction had occurred since August 1935 because Knott had\n\nsubstantially rebuilt Project facilities and returned them to\n\noperation after the Project had been abandoned in 1976.                             FERC\n\nadditionally rejected Knott’s takings and due process arguments.\n\nKnott timely petitioned for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f                                 DISCUSSION\n\nI.

MANDATORY JURISDICTION\n\n           Knott challenges both grounds upon which FERC based its\n\nfinding of mandatory jurisdiction:         (1) that the Blackstone River\n\nis navigable; and (2) that Knott’s reconstruction work after a\n\nperiod of abandonment sufficed to confer jurisdiction.            Because we\n\nhold that FERC properly based its jurisdiction on a finding of\n\nnavigability,    we   do   not   reach   the   issues   of   abandonment   and\n\nreconstruction.\n\n           The FPA, adopted in 1920, defines “navigable waters” as:\n\n           [T]hose parts of streams or other bodies of\n           water over which Congress has [Commerce\n           Clause] jurisdiction . . . and which either in\n           their    natural    or   improved    condition\n           notwithstanding interruptions between the\n           navigable parts of such streams or waters by\n           falls, shallows, or rapids compelling land\n           carriage, are used or suitable for use for the\n           transportation of persons or property in\n           interstate or foreign commerce, including\n           therein all such interrupting falls, shallows,\n           or rapids.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 796(8) (emphases added). Based on this definition, and\n\ncase law interpreting it, FERC correctly found that the September\n\n2000 canoe trip demonstrated that the Blackstone River and Project\n\nsite were “suitable for use” in interstate commerce notwithstanding\n\nthe shallows “compelling land carriage.”\n\n           Knott first argues that FERC’s authority must be limited\n\nto waterways used for actual, ongoing interstate commerce, “not\n\nhypothetical possibilities of unrealized commerce.”            This argument\n\nis unavailing.    The statutory language applies to waters in use or\n\n                                     -7-\n\f“suitable for use” for personal transportation, notwithstanding\n\ninterruptions.     Id. The Supreme Court has held that the absence of\n\nactual   commercial       traffic   does     not   bar    “a    conclusion    of\n\nnavigability where personal or private use by boats demonstrates\n\nthe availability of the stream for the simpler types of commercial\n\nnavigation.”     United States v.

We find that FERC’s interpretation of\n          navigability under the FPA, which was based on\n          test canoe trips and the Stream’s physical\n          characteristics . . . was reasonable and\n          entitled to deference.\n\nFPL, 287 F.3d at 1156.     FERC thus applied the proper legal test\n\nrequired by the plain language of § 3(8) and the relevant case law.\n\n          Substantial     evidence     supports   FERC’s     factual\n\ndetermination that the Blackstone River is suitable “for the\n\nsimpler types of commercial navigation.”    Appalachian Elec. Power\n\nCo., 311 U.S. at 416.    FERC properly relied on the September 2000\n\ncanoe expedition, which was accomplished with “few problems,”\n\n“relatively easy” portages, and “a minimum of difficulty.”     Knott\n\nasserts that the river is prone to dry or low flows and has many\n\nnatural   and   constructed   obstacles.   However,   the   statutory\n\n\nKnott also relies on Leonard Murphy, 98 F.E.R.C. 61,302 (2002), but\nthat decision reaffirmed that “[s]ection 3(8) provides that the\nstream may be found navigable if it was, is, or could be made\nsuitable for such use.     Such suitability may be shown through\nnon-commercial or recreational uses of the stream.” Id. at 62,295.\nDuke Power, 74 F.E.R.C. 61,291 (1996), does not address the\nnavigability question.    Knott’s remaining citations predate the\nCourt’s landmark decision in Appalachian Electric Power Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1940), a case Knott does not address.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fdefinition of navigability explicitly allows for “land carriage”\n\naround “interruptions.”           16 U.S.C. § 796(8).         Knott does not\n\notherwise      seriously   dispute    that    the   canoeists      successfully\n\nnavigated the waterway. He questions the participants’ motivation,\n\nbut this is irrelevant; what matters is that the participants\n\ncompleted the journey, regardless of motivation. See FPL, 287 F.3d\n\nat 1157 (affirming jurisdiction based on canoe trips made for the\n\npurpose of litigation).3\n\n            FERC’s finding that the Blackstone River is navigable, as\n\ndefined   by    16   U.S.C.   §   796(8),    is   supported   by   substantial\n\nevidence.      We therefore hold that FERC properly asserted mandatory\n\njurisdiction over the Project.\n\nIII. KNOTT’S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS\n\n            Knott    argues   that   a   finding    of   mandatory   licensing\n\njurisdiction effects a taking of his private property rights, and\n\nthat FERC violated his right to due process by denying him an\n\nevidentiary hearing on the issue of staff bias.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Knott also asserts that FERC has repeatedly reversed itself\nin determining the navigability of the Blackstone River, thus\nundermining its most recent order. This argument lacks foundation.\nFERC’s 1987 order issuing Knott a voluntary license made no finding\non the navigability issue; FERC’s instant order thus presents no\nconflict. FERC did reverse itself with regard to a project located\nupstream from Knott’s facility, but only after the September 2000\ncanoe expedition demonstrated the navigability of the river at both\nlocations.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f     A.     Fifth Amendment Takings Clause\n\n            Knott   alleges    that    mandatory       FERC    jurisdiction    will\n\ndeprive him of all economically viable use of his deeded right to\n\ndivert water from the Blackstone River “as he shall see fit.”                   We\n\nlack jurisdiction to hear Knott’s taking claim because the Tucker\n\nAct, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1), and “Little Tucker Act,” 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1346(a)(2), vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Federal\n\nClaims (the district courts have concurrent jurisdiction over\n\nclaims for $10,000 or less) to render judgment upon any claim\n\nagainst the United States for money damages that “is founded upon\n\nthe Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an\n\nexecutive department.”        28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).            Although Knott’s\n\npetition     for    review    does     not    specifically        seek   monetary\n\ncompensation, the Supreme Court has stated that “taking claims\n\nagainst the Federal Government are premature until the property\n\nowner has availed itself of the process provided by the Tucker\n\nAct.”      Preseault v.

The courts have rejected an\n\nargument that the FPA represents such a withdrawal of jurisdiction.\n\nSee Wis. Valley Improvement Co. v.

Knott may thus file a takings action in the\n\nCourt of Federal Claims, but may not pursue it on a petition for\n\nreview brought under 16 U.S.C. § 825l.\n\n     B.   Evidentiary hearing\n\n          Knott further alleges that FERC improperly denied him a\n\n“true” evidentiary hearing with regard to his “repeated allegations\n\nof official government witness bias and factual inaccuracy.”    We\n\nrecently rejected a similar claim, and explained that:\n\n          The term “hearing” is notoriously malleable,\n          but what petitioners got here was not only a\n          hearing but a species of evidentiary hearing\n          which is now quite common in utility and\n          carrier   regulation.

We reconfirmed that a “true” hearing before an\n\nadministrative law judge is unnecessary if any genuine issues of\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fmaterial fact can be “adequately resolved on the written record.”\n\nId. (citing cases).\n\n          The factual issues Knott sought to raise are not issues\n\nmaterial to the dispute at hand.            The alleged biases of certain\n\nFERC staff are irrelevant to a finding of navigability or an order\n\nto comply with the terms of Knott’s voluntary license.              Knott does\n\nnot   dispute    that     the   September   2000    canoeists    successfully\n\nnavigated the Blackstone River and Knott’s voluntary license,\n\nexplicitly requiring him to install gages, predates the alleged\n\nbiased acts and, thus, cannot be their result.               Knott’s arguments\n\nwere thus properly addressed by FERC through a paper hearing.\n\nIV.   ORDERS REQUIRING COMPLIANCE WITH LICENSE AND REGULATIONS\n\n           Knott asserts that FERC acted unreasonably in demanding\n\nthat he file project drawings on microfilm.              Under the arbitrary\n\nand capricious standard, we consider whether an agency’s decision\n\nis “based on consideration of the relevant factors” and articulates\n\na “rational connection between the facts found and the choice\n\nmade.”   Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 285 (1974) (citation omitted).             FERC noted that its\n\nregulations     require    exhibit   drawings      to   be   microfilmed   onto\n\naperture cards, 18 C.F.R. § 4.39, and that “[a]perture cards\n\nprovide a durable medium for storing information about hydropower\n\nproject features and are relatively inexpensive to produce, costing\n\nabout $25-$50 for a set-up fee and one dollar for each original.”\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fFERC also noted that Knott had modified his Project, rendering some\n\nof his previous drawings inaccurate. Knott describes the microfilm\n\nrequirement as “antiquated” and lobbies for an “[i]nfusion of\n\nmodern technology,” but offers nothing further.              FERC’s decision\n\nrequiring records to be submitted on microfilm, in conformity with\n\nits existing record-keeping system and because of the medium’s\n\ndurability     and   relatively     inexpensive    cost,     is    not    overly\n\nburdensome and cannot be considered arbitrary or capricious.\n\n          Knott also argues that FERC acted arbitrarily in ordering\n\nhim to install stream flow gages.        He contends that such gages are\n\nnot necessary because other gages exist, and that the license terms\n\nrequiring such gages do not apply to his Project.            These arguments\n\nare also unpersuasive. FERC specifically rejected Knott’s argument\n\nthat other gages sufficed to address the issue, finding that those\n\ngages were     too   distant   to   measure   impacts     from    the    Project.\n\nKnott’s license explicitly requires him to “install and thereafter\n\nmaintain gages and stream-gaging stations for the purpose of\n\ndetermining the stage and flow of the stream or streams on which\n\nthe project is located” and to minimize fluctuations such that\n\n“flow in the Blackstone River, as measured immediately below the\n\nproject approximates the instantaneous sum of inflow to the project\n\nreservoir” (emphasis added).        39 F.E.R.C. 62,308.      FERC decided to\n\nenforce these conditions after receiving letters alleging extreme\n\nfluctuations    in   the   Blackstone   River     below   the     Project,   and\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fexpressions of concern by state agencies and conservation groups\n\nthat the fluctuations might be the result of Knott’s failure to\n\noperate his Project to allow a continuous stream flow.     Knott’s\n\ncontention that the terms and conditions of the license do not\n\napply to his Project are without merit; the order issuing the\n\nlicense explicitly states that the license is subject to such\n\nterms. 39 F.E.R.C. 62,308. FERC’s orders for compliance with these\n\nterms are reasonable.     See Clifton Power Corp. v. FERC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721444\"><a href=\"/opinion/721444/clifton-power-corporation-v-federal-energy-regulatory-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1262 (D.C.
