Ablitt and Ablitt & Caruolo, PC\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         January 16, 2004\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.     Defendant-appellant Gerard S.\n\nReder invites us to set aside a judgment entered in favor of\n\nplaintiff-appellee Gulf Coast Bank & Trust Company (Gulf Coast).\n\nConcluding, as we do, that Reder's appeal lacks merit, we decline\n\nthe invitation.\n\n            This case had its genesis in a $150,000 loan made on\n\nMarch 1, 2000, by Bank of America to Armored Car Services of\n\nFlorida, Inc. (ACS).     The loan was memorialized by a promissory\n\nnote and secured by Reder's personal guarantee.     Bank of America\n\nsubsequently assigned the note and guarantee to Gulf Coast.\n\n            ACS defaulted on the note and Gulf Coast's demands for\n\npayment by the guarantor fell on deaf ears.      Invoking diversity\n\njurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(a), Gulf Coast sued Reder on the\n\nguarantee in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts. Reder answered the complaint. On January 13, 2003,\n\nGulf Coast moved for judgment on the pleadings.    See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 12(c).    It supported the motion with exhibits evidencing the\n\nantecedent transactions and defaults.      Reder failed to file a\n\ntimely response, D. Mass. R. 7.1(B)(2), and the district court\n\ngranted the motion on January 31, 2003.\n\n            The entry of this default order served to awaken Reder\n\nfrom his slumber.      He filed a dual-purpose motion in which he\n\nsought both an extension of the time within which to file an\n\nopposition to Gulf Coast's original motion and reconsideration of\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fthe default order.          On February 21, 2003, the district court\n\ngranted the extension, accepted Reder's opposition, reconsidered\n\nits earlier order in light of the opposition, and again awarded\n\nGulf Coast judgment on the pleadings. Reder's opposition had taken\n\nthe   form   of   a    memorandum   devoid   of    any    affidavits   or   other\n\nevidentiary attachments, and the court found it \"inadequate to\n\ncounter plaintiff's well supported motion.\"\n\n             The February 21 order only resolved the liability aspect\n\nof the case.          Accordingly, the court referred the matter to a\n\nmagistrate judge for an assessment of damages.                  The magistrate\n\njudge held a hearing and made recommended findings.               The district\n\ncourt accepted the findings and, on June 6, 2003, entered final\n\njudgment in favor of Gulf Coast for $217,076.62 (a figure that\n\nincluded     unpaid    principal    and   interest,      attorneys'    fees,   and\n\ncollection costs).        This timely appeal ensued.\n\n             In this venue, Reder does not directly contest the\n\nassessment of damages.        Rather, his appeal stands or falls on his\n\nclaim that the lower court applied an incorrect legal standard in\n\nadjudicating liability.        We believe that it falls.\n\n             Reder's thesis is simple.            In his view, a motion for\n\njudgment on the pleadings may be granted only when the pleadings,\n\ntaken at face value, leave no material facts in dispute.                       That\n\nstandard is not satisfied here, he contends, because his answer to\n\nthe complaint denied several essential elements of Gulf Coast's\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcase (e.g.,     the   authenticity   of    the   note   and   guarantee,   the\n\nrelationship between the two, the validity of the assignment, and\n\nthe fact of non-payment).     He concludes that these denials (along\n\nwith the assertion of a litany of affirmative defenses) sufficed to\n\ncreate factual disputes that precluded the entry of judgment on the\n\npleadings.\n\n           We review a trial court's entry of judgment on the\n\npleadings de novo.      Feliciano v. Rhode Island, 160 F.3d 780, 788\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).      The starting point for our analysis is the text\n\nof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c).1              That rule permits a\n\nparty to move for judgment on the pleadings at any time \"[a]fter\n\nthe pleadings are closed,\" as long as the motion does not delay the\n\ntrial.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).      In the archetypical case, the fate\n\n\n     1\n      In their briefs, the parties sometimes refer to Massachusetts\nstandards for granting or denying judgment on the pleadings. Their\nreliance on state-law standards is misplaced.       As we recently\nexplained:\n\n             Federal courts sitting in diversity apply\n             state substantive law and federal procedural\n             rules. . . .       [Such] classification is\n             generally a straightforward exercise when a\n             Federal Rule of Civil Procedure covers the\n             point.\n\nCorreia v. Fitzgerald, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2003) [No. 02-\n1417, slip op. at 10]. A motion for judgment on the pleadings is\na procedural device directly governed by Civil Rule 12(c).\nAccordingly, federal courts, whether or not sitting in diversity,\nmust look to federal law to deduce the standards for deciding such\nmotions. See, e.g., Enron Oil & Trading Transp. Co. v. Walbrook\nIns. Co., 132 F.3d 526, 528-29 (9th Cir. 1997); Rivera-Gomez v.\nAdolfo de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir. 1988); Repub. Steel\nCorp. v. Pa. Eng'g Corp., 785 F.2d 174, 177-78 (7th Cir 1986).\n\n                                     -4-\n\fof such a motion will depend upon whether the pleadings, taken as\n\na whole, reveal any potential dispute about one or more of the\n\nmaterial facts.   See 5 Charles A. Wright et. al., Federal Practice\n\n& Procedure ยง 1367, at 509-10 (2d ed. 1995) (collecting cases); see\n\nalso Feliciano, 160 F.3d at 788.   This is essentially the test that\n\nReder exhorts us to apply in the instant case.\n\n          We resist Reder's exhortations.      Where a motion for\n\njudgment on the pleadings introduces materials dehors the record\n\nfor the court's consideration, the ground rules change.     In that\n\nevent, the court has broad discretion either to include or to\n\nexclude the proffer.    So long as the court does not exclude the\n\ntendered materials, the summary judgment standard governs the\n\ndisposition of the motion.   See Collier v. City of Chicopee, 158\n\nF.3d 601, 602-03 (1st Cir. 1998); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c)\n\n(\"If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside\n\nthe pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the\n\nmotion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of\n\nas provided in Rule 56.\").   This is a salient distinction because\n\nRule 56 erects a hurdle for the nonmovant that is far more\n\ndifficult to clear than the relatively modest hurdle posed by Rule\n\n12(c) simpliciter. See, e.g., Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d\n\n46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that summary judgment should be\n\ngranted unless the party opposing the motion demonstrates, by\n\ncompetent evidence, a genuine issue of material fact).\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f             The summary judgment standard is controlling here. After\n\nthe pleadings were closed, Gulf Coast filed a Rule 12(c) motion\n\nthat relied upon, and incorporated by reference, a plethora of\n\nevidentiary     submissions.         In     response,       Reder    filed   only   a\n\nmemorandum of law.        The district court elected to convert the\n\nmotion and decide it as one for summary judgment.                     While such a\n\nconversion cannot take place unless \"the party opposing the motion\n\nis   given   adequate    notice   of      the    conversion    and    a   reasonable\n\nopportunity to present material made pertinent to such a motion by\n\nRule 56,\" Collier, 158 F.3d at 603, that protocol was fully\n\nsatisfied here.\n\n             First,    Reder   was     on   notice     of    the     potential   for\n\nconversion.    Although the district court did not give him explicit\n\nnotice of its willingness to indulge Gulf Coast's proffer, the act\n\nof attaching outside materials to a Rule 12(c) motion affords the\n\nnonmovant constructive notice that the court may, if it so chooses,\n\napply the summary judgment standard.               See id.; see also Rodriguez\n\nv. Fullerton Tires Corp., 115 F.3d 81, 83 (1st Cir. 1997).                   Express\n\nnotice is not required.\n\n             Second, Reder had ample time in which to present evidence\n\nin opposition.        Gulf Coast filed its motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings on January 13 and the district court took no action with\n\nrespect thereto until January 31.               This interval exceeded the ten-\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fday period specified in Rule 56(c).            No more was exigible.2    The\n\nconversion, therefore, was well within the compass of the district\n\ncourt's discretion.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c); see also Collier,\n\n158 F.3d at 603.\n\n           Our only remaining task is to determine whether the\n\nrecord supports the entry of judgment under the incorporated Rule\n\n56 standard.      Summary judgment is authorized \"if the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.\"            Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).    Once\n\nthe   movant    has   served   a   properly   supported   motion    asserting\n\nentitlement to summary judgment, the burden is on the nonmoving\n\nparty to present evidence showing the existence of a trialworthy\n\nissue.    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986);\n\nGarside, 895 F.2d at 48.\n\n           In    this   instance,    Gulf   Coast's   evidentiary   proffers\n\ncovered the essential elements of its case.           In other words, Gulf\n\nCoast submitted a motion which, when read in conjunction with the\n\nattachments, showed prima facie that the debt was due and owing;\n\nthat Reder had guaranteed its repayment; that Gulf Coast was a\n\nholder in due course; and that timeous demands for satisfaction had\n\n\n\n      2\n      In all events, Reder also had the benefit of a further\nextension granted by the district court on February 21, 2003.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fbeen ignored.       Reder produced no evidence to the contrary.             He\n\nrelied instead on the denials and affirmative defenses in his\n\nanswer and the arguments in his legal memorandum opposing the\n\nmotion.    It is, however, crystal clear that bare allegations in a\n\nparty's unsworn pleadings or in a lawyer's brief do not carry\n\nweight in the summary judgment calculus.          See, e.g., Rogan v. City\n\nof Boston, 267 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 2001); Maldonado-Denis v.\n\nCastillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir. 1994).               Thus, the\n\ndistrict    court    correctly   treated    the    facts   limned    in    the\n\nattachments to Gulf Coast's motion as uncontradicted.               Anderson,\n\n477 U.S. at 248; Garside, 895 F.2d at 48.           It follows inexorably\n\nthat the lower court did not err in granting Gulf Coast's motion\n\nfor judgment on the issue of liability.           See Collier, 158 F.3d at\n\n604.\n\n           We need go no further.        This case is a textbook example\n\nof the conversion principle embedded in Rule 12(c). Once Reder had\n\nnotice that the court might indulge such a conversion, he had to\n\nshow, by competent evidence, that a trialworthy issue existed.               He\n\nmade no such showing.       In the final analysis, then, this case\n\nreminds us that \"parties who permit the movant to configure the\n\nsummary judgment record do so at their peril.\"             Woods-Leber v.\n\nHyatt Hotels of P.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 47, 51 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Kelly, 924 F.2d 355, 358 (1st Cir. 1991)).               Under\n\nthe circumstances, Reder has no cognizable grounds for appeal.\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -9-\n\f",

On January 13, 2003, Gulf Coast moved for judgment on the pleadings. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). It supported the motion with exhibits evidencing the antecedent transactions and defaults.

No more was exigible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The conversion, therefore, was well within the compass of the district court's discretion. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(c); <i>see also Collier,</i> 158 F.3d at 603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our only remaining task is to determine whether the record supports the entry of judgment under the incorporated Rule 56 standard. Summary judgment is authorized \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Once the movant has served a properly supported motion asserting entitlement to summary judgment, the burden is on the nonmoving party to present evidence showing the existence of a trialworthy issue. <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <i>Garside,</i> 895 F.2d at 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, Gulf Coast's evidentiary proffers covered the essential elements of its case. In other words, Gulf Coast submitted a motion which, when read in conjunction with the attachments, showed prima facie that the debt was due and owing; that Reder had guaranteed its repayment; that Gulf Coast was a holder in due course; and that timeous demands for satisfaction had been ignored. Reder produced no evidence to the contrary. He relied instead on the denials and affirmative defenses in his answer and the arguments in his legal memorandum opposing the motion. It is, however, crystal clear that bare allegations in a party's unsworn pleadings or in a lawyer's brief do not carry weight in the summary judgment calculus. <i>See, e.g., Rogan v. City of Boston,</i> 267 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez,</i> 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir.1994). Thus, the district court correctly treated the facts limned in the attachments to Gulf Coast's motion as uncontradicted. <i>Anderson,</i> 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505; <i>Garside,</i> 895 F.2d at 48. It follows inexorably that the lower court did not err in granting Gulf Coast's motion for judgment on the issue of liability. <i>See Collier,</i> 158 F.3d at 604.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. This case is a textbook example of the conversion principle embedded in Rule 12(c). Once Reder had notice that the court might indulge such a conversion, he had to show, by competent evidence, that a trialworthy issue existed. He made no such showing. In the final analysis, then, this case reminds us that \"parties who permit the movant to configure the summary judgment record do so at their peril.\" <i>Woods-Leber v. Hyatt Hotels of P.R., Inc.,</i> 124 F.3d 47, 51 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>Kelly v. United States,</i> 924 F.2d 355, 358 (1st Cir. 1991)).

Reder invites us to set aside a judgment entered in favor of plaintiff-appellee Gulf Coast Bank &amp; Trust Company (Gulf Coast). Concluding, as we do, that Reder's appeal lacks merit, we decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case had its genesis in a $150,000 loan made on March 1, 2000, by Bank of America to Armored Car Services of Florida, Inc. (ACS). The loan was memorialized by a promissory note and secured by Reder's personal guarantee. Bank of America subsequently assigned the note and guarantee to Gulf Coast.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ACS defaulted on the note and Gulf Coast's demands for payment by the guarantor fell on deaf ears. Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), Gulf Coast sued Reder on the guarantee in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Reder answered the complaint. On January 13, 2003, Gulf Coast moved for judgment on the pleadings. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). It supported the motion with exhibits evidencing the antecedent transactions and defaults. Reder failed to file a timely response, D. Mass. R. 7.1(B)(2), and the district court granted the motion on January 31, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entry of this default order served to awaken Reder from his slumber. He filed a dual-purpose motion in which he sought both an extension of the time within which to file an opposition to Gulf Coast's original motion and reconsideration of the default order. On February 21, 2003, the district court granted the extension, accepted Reder's opposition, reconsidered its earlier order in light of the opposition, and again awarded Gulf Coast judgment on the pleadings. Reder's opposition had taken the form of a memorandum devoid of any affidavits or other evidentiary attachments, and the court found it \"inadequate to counter plaintiff's well supported motion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The February 21 order only resolved the liability aspect of the case. Accordingly, the court referred the matter to a magistrate judge for an assessment of damages. The magistrate judge held a hearing and made recommended findings. The district court accepted the findings and, on June 6, 2003, entered final judgment in favor of Gulf Coast for $217,076.62 (a figure that included unpaid principal and interest, attorneys' fees, and collection costs). This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, Reder does not directly contest the assessment of damages. Rather, his appeal stands or falls on his claim that the lower court applied an incorrect legal standard in adjudicating liability. We believe that it falls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reder's thesis is simple. In his view, a motion for judgment on the pleadings may be granted only when the pleadings, taken at face value, leave no material facts in dispute. That standard is not satisfied here, he contends, because his answer to the complaint denied several essential elements of Gulf Coast's case (e.g., the authenticity of the note and guarantee, the relationship between the two, the validity of the assignment, and the fact of non-payment). He concludes that these denials (along with the assertion of a litany of affirmative defenses) sufficed to create factual disputes that precluded the entry of judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a trial court's entry of judgment on the pleadings de novo. <i>Feliciano v. Rhode Island,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759220\"><a href=\"/opinion/759220/rosemary-feliciano-v-state-of-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span>, 788 (1st Cir.1998). The starting point for our analysis is the text of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> That rule permits a party to move for judgment on the pleadings at any time \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed,\" as long as the motion does not delay the trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). In the archetypical case, the fate of such a motion will depend upon whether the pleadings, taken as a whole, reveal any potential dispute about one or more of the material facts. <i>See</i> 5 Charles A. Wright et. al., Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 1367, at 509-10 (2d ed.1995) (collecting cases); <i>see also Feliciano,</i> 160 F.3d at 788. This is essentially the test that Reder exhorts us to apply in the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We resist Reder's exhortations. Where a motion for judgment on the pleadings introduces materials dehors the record for the court's consideration, the ground rules change. In that event, the court has broad discretion either to include or to exclude the proffer. So long as the court does not exclude the tendered materials, the summary judgment standard governs the disposition of the motion. <i>See Collier v. City of Chicopee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198170\"><a href=\"/opinion/198170/collier-v-city-of-chicopee/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 602-03 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(c) (\"If, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56.\"). This is a salient distinction because Rule 56 erects a hurdle for the nonmovant that is far more difficult to clear than the relatively modest hurdle posed by Rule 12(c) simpliciter. <i>See, e.g., Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that summary judgment should be granted unless the party opposing the motion demonstrates, <i>by competent evidence,</i> a genuine issue of material fact).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The summary judgment standard is controlling here. After the pleadings were closed, Gulf Coast filed a Rule 12(c) motion that relied upon, and incorporated by reference, a plethora of evidentiary submissions. In response, Reder filed only a memorandum of law. The district court elected to convert the motion and decide it as one for summary judgment. While such a conversion cannot take place unless \"the party opposing the motion is given adequate notice of the conversion and a reasonable opportunity to present material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56,\" <i>Collier,</i> 158 F.3d at 603, that protocol was fully satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Reder was on notice of the potential for conversion. Although the district court did not give him explicit notice of its willingness to indulge Gulf Coast's proffer, the act of attaching outside materials to a Rule 12(c) motion affords the nonmovant constructive notice that the court may, if it so chooses, apply the summary judgment standard. <i>See id.; see also Rodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197406\"><a href=\"/opinion/197406/alers-rodriguez-v-national-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.1997). Express notice is not required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Reder had ample time in which to present evidence in opposition. Gulf Coast filed its motion for judgment on the pleadings on January 13 and the district court took no action with respect thereto until January 31. This interval exceeded the ten-day period specified in Rule 56(c). No more was exigible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The conversion, therefore, was well within the compass of the district court's discretion. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(c); <i>see also Collier,</i> 158 F.3d at 603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our only remaining task is to determine whether the record supports the entry of judgment under the incorporated Rule 56 standard. Summary judgment is authorized \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Once the movant has served a properly supported motion asserting entitlement to summary judgment, the burden is on the nonmoving party to present evidence showing the existence of a trialworthy issue. <i>Anderson v.
