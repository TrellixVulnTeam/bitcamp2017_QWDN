In this petition for review,\n\nJohnny Frits Mewengkang contests the decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying his request for withholding of\n\nremoval.     After careful consideration, we deny the petition for\n\nreview and affirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n             Mewengkang is an Indonesian national.            He entered the\n\nUnited States on a B1/B2 visa on June 24, 1996, but remained in the\n\nUnited States past the time permitted by his visa.                 In May 2002,\n\nMewengkang filed an application for asylum.             On March 11, 2003,\n\nMewengkang was served with a Notice to Appear, charging him with\n\nremovability.       Mewengkang conceded that he was removable, but\n\npetitioned for withholding of removal on the ground that he would\n\nbe subject to persecution on account of his religion if he was\n\nreturned to Indonesia.        Mewengkang presented his claim before an\n\nimmigration judge (\"IJ\").\n\n             The gist of Mewengkang's claim is that he is a Christian,\n\nand   that   upon   return    to   Indonesia,   he    would   be    subject   to\n\npersecution by members of the predominant religion there, which is\n\nIslam. Mewengkang claims that his cousin was killed because he had\n\norganized a Christian proselytizing trip to a majority-Muslim area.\n\nFurthermore,     Mewengkang    claims    that   his    general      contracting\n\nbusiness suffered because of his refusal to join a Muslim builders'\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\funion known as the ISNI, and that he was violently harassed after\n\nhe complained about its interference in the contracting process.\n\n           The IJ rendered a decision on the day of the hearing,\n\nfinding that Mewengkang was not credible because (1) he initially\n\nlisted one child on his asylum application when in fact he had two;\n\n(2) there were discrepancies in Mewengkang's account of the violent\n\nincident with the ISNI; (3) Mewengkang testified that he had not\n\napplied for asylum until 2002 because he was unfamiliar with the\n\nprocess despite familiarity with other immigration procedures; and\n\n(4) there was a discrepancy in Mewengkang's testimony about his\n\nemployment in the United States.           Furthermore, the IJ found that\n\neven if Mewengkang's account of past persecution was credible, it\n\nwas   unlikely   that   he   would   be    persecuted   if   he   returned   to\n\nIndonesia, and that Mewengkang's real motivation was economic\n\ngain.1\n\n           Mewengkang appealed to the BIA, which affirmed by per\n\ncuriam order, stating that the inconsistencies identified by the IJ\n\nprovided a reasonable basis for rejecting Mewengkang's testimony.\n\nThe BIA order further held that Mewengkang had not established a\n\nclear probability that he would be persecuted upon his return to\n\n\n\n\n1\n  The IJ also noted that Mewengkang's asylum application was time-\nbarred under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), which provides that asylum\napplications must be filed within one year of the alien's arrival\nin the United States.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fIndonesia.      Therefore, the BIA ordered Mewengkang removed, but\n\ngranted him sixty days to depart voluntarily.\n\n                              II. Discussion\n\n                           A. Standard of Review\n\n            The attorney general may not remove an alien whose life\n\nor freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.    8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A).         The alien bears the burden of\n\nproving that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted.\n\nSharari v. Gonzáles, 407 F.3d 467, 474 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Where   the    BIA    has     adopted   the   IJ's    credibility\n\ndetermination, as here, we review the determination of the IJ.\n\nChen v. Gonzáles, 418 F.3d 110, 113-14 (1st Cir. 2005).              The BIA\n\nhas previously stated that an alien may be found incredible based\n\non discrepancies in testimony where \"(1) the discrepancies and\n\nomissions described by the Immigration Judge are actually present;\n\n(2) these discrepancies and omissions provide specific and cogent\n\nreasons    to   conclude   that   the     respondent   provided   incredible\n\ntestimony; and (3) the respondent has not provided a convincing\n\nexplanation for the discrepancies and omissions.\"           Matter of A-S-,\n\n21 I. & N. Dec. 1106, 1109 (BIA 1998); see also Hoxha v. Gonzáles,\n\n446 F.3d 210, 216-17 (1st Cir. 2006) (applying test from Matter of\n\nA-S-).    However, \"an adverse credibility determination cannot rest\n\non trivia but must be based on discrepancies that 'involved the\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fheart of the asylum claim.'\" Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d\n\n14, 16 (1st Cir. 1999) (citation omitted).\n\n           We then review an IJ's overall findings of fact to see if\n\nthey are supported by \"substantial evidence.\" Sharari, 407 F.3d at\n\n473.   \"We afford de novo review to the BIA's legal conclusions, but\n\ncede some deference to its interpretations of the [Immigration and\n\nNationality Act].\"   Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n       B. Was the IJ's credibility determination supported by\n                        substantial evidence?\n\n           The IJ based his adverse credibility determination on\n\nfour discrepancies in Mewengkang's testimony.     First, Mewengkang\n\nstated on his asylum application that he only had one child, but\n\nlater testified that he had two.   Mewengkang's explanation for the\n\ndiscrepancy was that his immigration consultant, \"Mr. Poppy,\" told\n\nhim that he did not have to list married children.       Mewengkang\n\ncould not produce Mr. Poppy to testify.       The IJ stated in his\n\nopinion that he did not find this explanation convincing given the\n\npossibility of an alternative explanation, namely, that the child\n\nnot listed on the asylum application had applied and been rejected\n\nfor a visa to visit the United States, and that Mewengkang thought\n\nthat listing the child would hurt his chances to obtain withholding\n\nof removal.    Because Mewengkang provides no evidence that would\n\nsupport his explanation for the discrepancy in testimony and\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fbecause we find the IJ's alternative explanation convincing, we do\n\nnot disturb the IJ's conclusion.\n\n           In addition, Mewengkang stated on his asylum application\n\nthat he had not been employed in the United States prior to 1997.\n\nHowever, Mewengkang testified before the IJ that he had been\n\nemployed in a retirement home in 1996.         Mewengkang provided no\n\nexplanation for this discrepancy at the hearing, and does not\n\nattempt to do so now.     Accordingly, we do not disturb the IJ's\n\ndetermination that Mewengkang had not been forthcoming on his\n\nasylum application.\n\n           Although it is unclear whether these two discrepancies go\n\nto the heart of Mewengkang's asylum claim, the IJ did not rely on\n\nthem alone.   The IJ identified two other discrepancies, one that\n\ndirectly bears on the events giving rise to Mewengkang's asylum\n\nclaim, and one relating to Mewengkang's asylum application. First,\n\nMewengkang stated in his asylum application that when he confronted\n\nthe ISNI, \"the outcome was worst.      My complaint make the [ISNI]\n\ngroup become violent.   They attacked me and broke my right hand.\"\n\nHowever, when testifying before the IJ, Mewengkang explained that\n\nin fact he had lost his temper and began fighting with an ISNI\n\nmember, and that his hand was lacerated, not broken.        Mewengkang\n\nexplains   this   discrepancy   by   stating   that   his   immigration\n\nconsultant's language skills were poor, and that the confusion\n\nresulted from a mistranslation.      Again, Mewengkang did not offer\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fevidence that his statements had been mistranslated.               Furthermore,\n\nwe agree with the IJ that the fact that Mewengkang's asylum\n\napplication made no mention of Mewengkang's role in inciting the\n\naltercation with the ISNI seems calculated to mislead rather than\n\nthe product of an innocent mistranslation. Thus, we do not disturb\n\nthe IJ's finding that Mewengkang's explanation for the discrepancy\n\nwas not convincing.2\n\n           In addition, Mewengkang testified that he did not apply\n\nfor asylum immediately upon his arrival to the United States\n\nbecause   he   was    not   aware    that    such   a   claim   could   be   made.\n\nMewengkang testified that he first became aware that he could make\n\nan asylum claim in 2000.           However, although Mewengkang testified\n\nthat he was ignorant of the asylum procedures, he also testified\n\nthat he was aware of other and availed himself of other immigration\n\nprocedures,    such    as    the    visa    lottery.       Moreover,    although\n\nMewengkang claims to have learned about asylum in 2000, he did not\n\n\n\n2\n   The IJ also noted that Mewengkang had stated in his asylum\napplication that he had made a complaint to the Indonesian\ngovernment regarding discrimination, but that this was misleading\nbecause it referred not to discrimination by the ISNI, but to\nsomething having to do with an agricultural business he owned at\none point.    Mewengkang explains that the statements were not\ninconsistent, and that he made two separate complaints of\ndiscrimination. It is not clear whether this confusion resulted\nfrom an effort by Mewengkang to mislead the IJ or from the IJ's\nmisunderstanding of Mewengkang's admittedly confusing allegations,\nbut in either case, it is clear that the IJ listed this discrepancy\nas only one example of Mewengkang's lack of candor. Thus, this\nargument does not alter our conclusion that the IJ's credibility\ndetermination was supported by substantial evidence.\n\n                                       -7-\n\ffile    his    asylum   application     until     two    years   later,    in   2002.\n\nMewengkang explained that this delay was caused by his immigration\n\nconsultant, but offered no further details.                  We agree with the IJ\n\nthat     Mewengkang's      explanation      for     these      discrepancies      was\n\nunconvincing,      especially      in   light     of    his    age   and   apparent\n\nsophistication.         Mewengkang can point to no evidence that would\n\nsupport his explanation for the discrepancy, and as such, we do not\n\ndisturb the IJ's conclusion.\n\n              These discrepancies in Mewengkang's testimony, including\n\nthose regarding the events giving rise to his claim for withholding\n\nand regarding his application for asylum and withholding provide\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the IJ's credibility determination.\n\nAs such, we conclude that the IJ did not err in determining that\n\nMewengkang was not credible.\n\nC. Did the IJ err in determining that Mewengkang was not entitled\n                    to withholding of removal?\n\n              Mewengkang is entitled to withholding of removal only if\n\nhe can show that it is more likely than not that he will be\n\npersecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in\n\na particular social group, or political opinion. Sharari, 407 F.3d\n\nat 474.       The IJ determined that Mewengkang's testimony that he\n\nwould be persecuted was not credible, and that his desire to remain\n\nin     the    United    States    was   motivated       by    economic     concerns.\n\nMewengkang      suggests   that    even    if   the     IJ   determined    that   his\n\nallegations of past persecution were not credible, he might still\n\n                                          -8-\n\fbe entitled to withholding of removal if he can show a likelihood\n\nof future persecution.      See 8 C.F.R. 208.16(b)(2) (\"An applicant\n\nwho has not suffered past persecution may demonstrate that his or\n\nher life or freedom would be threatened in the future in a country\n\nif he or she can establish that it is more likely than not that he\n\nor   she   would   be   persecuted   on    account   of    race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion upon removal to that country.\").         Although Mewengkang is\n\ncorrect in this assertion, he ultimately fails to point to any\n\nevidence in the record that suggests that he would be persecuted on\n\naccount of his religion if he were returned to Indonesia; an\n\nunsupported statement alone will not support Mewengkang's burden in\n\nlight of the IJ's adverse credibility finding.            In the absence of\n\nsuch evidence, we conclude that the IJ did not err in denying\n\nMewengkang's claim for withholding of removal.\n\n                             III. Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we deny the petition for\n\nreview and affirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

Mewengkang explains this discrepancy by stating that his immigration consultant's language skills were poor, and that the confusion resulted from a mistranslation. Again, Mewengkang did not offer evidence that his statements had been mistranslated. Furthermore, we agree with the IJ that the fact that Mewengkang's asylum application made no mention of Mewengkang's role in inciting the altercation with the ISNI seems calculated to mislead rather than the product of an innocent mistranslation. Thus, we do not disturb the IJ's finding that Mewengkang's explanation for the discrepancy was not convincing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Mewengkang testified that he did not apply for asylum immediately upon his arrival to the United States because he was not aware that such a claim could be made. Mewengkang testified that he first became aware that he could make an asylum claim in 2000. However, although Mewengkang testified that he was ignorant of the asylum procedures, he also testified that he was aware of other and availed himself of other immigration procedures, such as the visa lottery. Moreover, although Mewengkang claims to have learned about asylum in 2000, he did not file his asylum application until two years later, in 2002. Mewengkang explained that this delay was caused by his immigration consultant, but offered no further details. We agree with the IJ that Mewengkang's explanation for these discrepancies was unconvincing, especially in light of his age and apparent sophistication. Mewengkang can point to no evidence that would support his explanation for the discrepancy, and as such, we do not disturb the IJ's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These discrepancies in Mewengkang's testimony, including those regarding the events giving rise to his claim for withholding and regarding his application for asylum and withholding provide substantial evidence to support the IJ's credibility determination.

The IJ determined that Mewengkang's testimony that he would be persecuted was not credible, and that his desire to remain in the United States was motivated by economic concerns. Mewengkang suggests that even if the IJ determined that his allegations of past persecution were not credible, he might still be entitled to withholding of removal if he can show a likelihood of future persecution. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. 208.16(b)(2) (\"An applicant who has not suffered past persecution may demonstrate that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the future in a country if he or she can establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion upon removal to that country.\"). Although Mewengkang is correct in this assertion, he ultimately fails to point to any evidence in the record that suggests that he would be persecuted on account of his religion if he were returned to Indonesia; an unsupported statement alone will not support Mewengkang's burden in light of the IJ's adverse credibility finding.

Mewengkang explains that the statements were not inconsistent, and that he made two separate complaints of discrimination. It is not clear whether this confusion resulted from an effort by Mewengkang to mislead the IJ or from the IJ's misunderstanding of Mewengkang's admittedly confusing allegations, but in either case, it is clear that the IJ listed this discrepancy as only one example of Mewengkang's lack of candor. Thus, this argument does not alter our conclusion that the IJ's credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

After careful consideration, we deny the petition for review and affirm the decision of the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mewengkang is an Indonesian national. He entered the United States on a B1/B2 visa on June 24, 1996, but remained in the United States past the time permitted by his visa. In May 2002, Mewengkang filed an application for asylum. On March 11, 2003, Mewengkang was served with a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability. Mewengkang conceded that he was removable, but petitioned for withholding of removal on the ground that he would be subject to persecution on account of his religion if he was returned to Indonesia. Mewengkang presented his claim before an immigration judge (\"IJ\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gist of Mewengkang's claim is that he is a Christian, and that upon return to Indonesia, he would be subject to persecution by members of the predominant religion there, which is Islam. Mewengkang claims that his cousin was killed because he had organized a Christian proselytizing trip to a majority-Muslim area. Furthermore, Mewengkang claims that his general contracting business suffered because of his refusal to join a Muslim builders' union known as the ISNI, and that he was violently harassed after he complained about its interference in the contracting process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ rendered a decision on the day of the hearing, finding that Mewengkang was not credible because (1) he initially listed one child on his asylum application when in fact he had two; (2) there were discrepancies in Mewengkang's account of the violent incident with the ISNI; (3) Mewengkang testified that he had not applied for asylum until 2002 because he was unfamiliar with the process despite familiarity with other immigration procedures; and (4) there was a discrepancy in Mewengkang's testimony about his employment in the United States. Furthermore, the IJ found that even if Mewengkang's account of past persecution was credible, it was unlikely that he would be persecuted if he returned to Indonesia, and that Mewengkang's real motivation was economic gain.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mewengkang appealed to the BIA, which affirmed by per curiam order, stating that the inconsistencies identified by the IJ provided a reasonable basis for rejecting Mewengkang's testimony. The BIA order further held that Mewengkang had not established a clear probability that he would be persecuted upon his return to Indonesia. Therefore, the BIA ordered Mewengkang removed, but granted him sixty days to depart voluntarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p>A.

First, Mewengkang stated on his asylum application that he only had one child, but later testified that he had two. Mewengkang's explanation for the discrepancy was that his immigration consultant, \"Mr. Poppy,\" told him that he did not have to list married children. Mewengkang could not produce Mr. Poppy to testify. The IJ stated in his opinion that he did not find this explanation convincing given the possibility of an alternative explanation, namely, that the child not listed on the asylum application had applied and been rejected for a visa to visit the United States, and that Mewengkang thought that listing the child would hurt his chances to obtain withholding of removal. Because Mewengkang provides no evidence that would support his explanation for the discrepancy in testimony and because we find the IJ's alternative explanation convincing, we do not disturb the IJ's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Mewengkang stated on his asylum application that he had not been employed in the United States prior to 1997. However, Mewengkang testified before the IJ that he had been employed in a retirement home in 1996. Mewengkang provided no explanation for this discrepancy at the hearing, and does not attempt to do so now. Accordingly, we do not disturb the IJ's determination that Mewengkang had not been forthcoming on his asylum application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is unclear whether these two discrepancies go to the heart of Mewengkang's asylum claim, the IJ did not rely on them alone. The IJ identified two other discrepancies, one that directly bears on the events giving rise to Mewengkang's asylum claim, and one relating to Mewengkang's asylum application. First, Mewengkang stated in his asylum application that when he confronted the ISNI, \"the outcome was worst. My complaint make the [ISNI] group become violent. They attacked me and broke my right hand.\" However, when testifying before the IJ, Mewengkang explained that in fact he had lost his temper and began fighting with an ISNI member, and that his hand was lacerated, not broken. Mewengkang explains this discrepancy by stating that his immigration consultant's language skills were poor, and that the confusion resulted from a mistranslation. Again, Mewengkang did not offer evidence that his statements had been mistranslated. Furthermore, we agree with the IJ that the fact that Mewengkang's asylum application made no mention of Mewengkang's role in inciting the altercation with the ISNI seems calculated to mislead rather than the product of an innocent mistranslation. Thus, we do not disturb the IJ's finding that Mewengkang's explanation for the discrepancy was not convincing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Mewengkang testified that he did not apply for asylum immediately upon his arrival to the United States because he was not aware that such a claim could be made.
