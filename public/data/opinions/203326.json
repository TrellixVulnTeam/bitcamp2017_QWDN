Hamilton and Jackson Walker\nL.L.P., on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                               June 11, 2008\n\f           Per Curiam.      Darlene Tracy has appealed the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of her complaint for failure to state a claim.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).       We review such a dismissal de novo.\n\nGagliardi v. Sullivan, 513 F.3d 301, 305 (1st Cir. 2008).            Upon de\n\nnovo review, we affirm.\n\n           By order dated October 11, 2007, we rejected Tracy's\n\ncontentions that this court lacks jurisdiction because no final\n\njudgment entered.     Tracy has reiterated those contentions in her\n\nappellate brief.    We rest on our order of October 11, 2007 and need\n\nnot discuss those contentions further.\n\n           We    reject   Tracy's   claim   that    the   district   court's\n\ndismissal was, in substance, a dismissal for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).           It clearly was\n\nnot.   Nor are we persuaded that the district court was misled by\n\nany alleged mischaracterization of the jurisdictional basis for the\n\ncomplaint appearing on the civil cover sheet.\n\n           The district court dismissed Tracy's complaint because\n\nthe \"complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to support a claim\n\nof   copyright   infringement   or    any   other   claim   against   these\n\ndefendants.\"     This is a dismissal for failure to state a claim,\n\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and, contrary to Tracy's allegation, it\n\nadequately explains the basis for the court's ruling.\n\n           \"Dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate if\n\nthe complaint fails to set forth factual allegations, either direct\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\for inferential, respecting each material element necessary to\n\nsustain   recovery    under   some   actionable   legal   theory.\"         Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Upon our de novo\n\nreview, neither copyright nor misappropriation of trade secret are\n\napt legal theories for the facts as pled by Tracy, which, even\n\nconstrued in her favor, reveal that Tracy voluntarily and without\n\nreservation submitted her material to the defendants.              Nor would\n\nthe defendants' refusal to return her material constitute a claim\n\nof fraud.\n\n            Tracy's contention that the district court failed to\n\npermit her an opportunity to amend her complaint or to file\n\nsupplemental or new pleadings is misplaced.        The court's dismissal\n\nwas not sua sponte.      Cf. Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States, 257\n\nF.3d 31, 36-37 (1st Cir. 2001).        Based on the defendants' motions\n\nto dismiss to which she responded, Tracy was on notice of the\n\ndefects in her complaint.      Nothing in Tracy's opposition sufficed\n\nto overcome these defects.     Her motion to amend, filed after entry\n\nof judgment, which simply reiterated these inadequate arguments was\n\nsimilarly deficient.     There was no abuse of discretion in denying\n\nthe   motion   to   amend.    See    Trans-Spec   Truck   Serv.,    Inc.   v.\n\nCaterpillar Inc., No. 07-1476, slip op. at 21 (1st Cir. Apr. 30,\n\n2008) (reciting the standard of review).          Similarly misplaced is\n\nTracy's suggestion that this court can provide relief pursuant to\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).   Any such motion is properly filed in the\n\nfirst instance in the district court.\n\n          Finally, assuming without deciding that a request for\n\nenforcement of a statutory attorney's lien, pursuant to Mass. Gen.\n\nL. c.221, ยง 50, is properly initiated by motion filed in this\n\ncourt, we deny the motion filed by Tracy's counsel, as the statute\n\nrequires that a judgment have entered in the client's favor and no\n\nsuch judgment has entered in this case.\n\n          The district court judgment of dismissal entered on March\n\n14, 2007 is summarily affirmed.    Loc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
