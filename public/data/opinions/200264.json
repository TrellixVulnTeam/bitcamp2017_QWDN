Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n                               Before\n                       LYNCH, Circuit Judge,\n                   FARRIS,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.\n\n     Irwin Kwiat for appellant.\n     Leonard H.

Drury brought this 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 action\n\nagainst police officers alleging wrongful arrest and excessive\n\nforce.     He appeals the district court's order denying his motion\n\nfor a judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial, and the\n\ndistrict    court's     entry   of    judgment    on    the   defense     verdict,\n\nfollowing a nine-day jury trial.             We affirm.\n\n     We reject Drury's argument that he proved all allegations in\n\nhis complaint as a matter of law.             We review this claim de novo.\n\nSee Cigna Ins. Co. v. Saunatec, Ltd., 241 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   Judgment as a matter of law should be granted only if \"the\n\nevidence, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nverdict, could lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion,\n\nnamely, that the moving party was entitled to judgment.\"                   Marrero\n\nv. Goya of P.R., Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 22 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).       Drury had the burden of proof.            At best,\n\nhe demonstrated only that there is disputed evidence regarding the\n\nofficers'    actions.      He   has   failed     to    establish   his    case   by\n\n\"testimony that the jury is not at liberty to disbelieve\" and by\n\nevidence that is \"uncontradicted and unimpeached.\"                 Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d\n\n196, 205 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n     We reject Drury's contention that the court erred by denying\n\nhis motion for a new trial and motion for a mistrial.                    We review\n\nthis claim for abuse of discretion.              See Cigna, 241 F.3d at 8;\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fUnited States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir. 1994).                To the\n\nextent    this   contention   is    premised    on    the   district    court's\n\nadmission of evidence, Drury bears the double burden of showing\n\nabuse of discretion as to the admission of evidence and as to the\n\ndenial of the mistrial/new trial.           See Tamko Roofing Prods., Inc.\n\nv. Ideal Roofing Co., 282 F.3d 23, 39 (1st Cir. 2002).             The record\n\nshows both sufficient evidence and sufficient reasons for admitting\n\nthis evidence.     Drury has not and cannot show that the outcome of\n\nthe trial \"is against the clear weight of the evidence such that\n\nupholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nCigna, 241 F.3d at 8 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     We also reject Drury's argument that the district court erred\n\nby failing to instruct the jury regarding his First Amendment\n\nrights related to disorderly conduct, and by failing to discuss his\n\nFirst Amendment rights in response to a jury question.                 We review\n\njury instructions de novo.         See Gifford v. Am. Canadian Carribean\n\nLine, Inc., 276 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 2002).                The trial court's\n\nrefusal    to    give   Drury's    instruction       on   disorderly    conduct\n\nconstitutes reversible error only \"if the requested instruction was\n\n(1) correct as a matter of substantive law, (2) not substantially\n\nincorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3) integral to an\n\nimportant point in the case.\"           Cigna, 241 F.3d at 8 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).         Drury's requested instruction is not a\n\ncorrect statement of Massachusetts law. \"Fighting words\" can be an\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\felement of disturbing the peace in Massachusetts.     Commonwealth v.\n\nRichards, 340 N.E.2d 892, 897 (Mass. 1976).     The court did not err\n\nby instructing on disorderly conduct with that in mind.     It gave a\n\ncorrect statement of Massachusetts law.\n\n       Jury instructions given during the course of deliberations\n\ncome \"at a particularly delicate juncture\" and require the court to\n\nconstruct its wording carefully.      Sheek v. Asia Badger, Inc., 235\n\nF.3d 687, 690 (1st Cir. 2000).        However, as long as the court\n\ncorrectly addresses the issue submitted by the jury, it may amplify\n\nthe instruction at its discretion.      See Testa v. Wal-Mart Stores,\n\nInc., 144 F.3d 173, 176 (1st Cir. 1998).          We have carefully\n\nreviewed the record.   The judge considered Drury's arguments and\n\nrejected them for adequate reasons consonant with Massachusetts\n\nlaw.\n\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
