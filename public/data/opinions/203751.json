Before us are cross-appeals\n\nstemming from a well known incident: the theft from TJX computers\n\nof customer credit and debit card information and the subsequent\n\nfraudulent use of the information.       See generally In re TJX Cos.\n\nRetail Sec. Breach Litig., 493 F. Supp. 2d 1382 (D. Mass. 2007);\n\nMcMorris v. TJX, 493 F. Supp. 2d 158 (D. Mass. 2007).         Law suits\n\nensued, this case--involving banks injured in the debacle--among\n\nthem.\n\n            In   January   2007,   TJX    Companies,   Inc.    (\"TJX\"),\n\nheadquartered in Massachusetts and a major operator of discount\n\nstores, revealed that its computer systems had been hacked. Credit\n\nor debit card data for millions of its customers had been stolen.\n\nHarm resulted not only to customers but, it appears, also to banks\n\nthat had issued the cards (\"issuing banks\"), which were forced to\n\nreimburse customers for fraudulent use of the cards and incurred\n\nother expenses.\n\n            In May 2007, AmeriFirst Bank, based in Alabama, filed\n\nsuit in the federal district court in Massachusetts against TJX\n\nand, in addition, against an Ohio bank and its parent--Fifth Third\n\nBank and Fifth Third Bancorp (collectively     \"Fifth Third\").1   Fifth\n\n\n\n        1\n      The suit against TJX included other named plaintiffs who have\nsince settled.    A second AmeriFirst suit, with another named\nplaintiff (SELCO--a credit union in Oregon), was filed against\nFifth Third in the district court. The two cases were consolidated\nand, as allegations against Fifth Third in the second suit mirror\nthose in the first, we refer only to \"the complaint.\"\n\n                                   -2-\n\fThird served as \"processing bank\" for TJX transactions, receiving\n\nthe data from the customer's initial charge for a purchase and,\n\nafter high-speed verification from the issuing bank, authorizing\n\nthe charge.     Visa and Mastercard each had a network and regime for\n\nsuch purposes.\n\n           AmeriFirst's complaint, seeking class action status for\n\nissuing banks, charged that both TJX and Fifth Third were variously\n\nat fault: that TJX and Fifth Third failed to follow security\n\nprotocols prescribed by Visa and MasterCard to safeguard personal\n\nand financial information; that the breaches occurred from July\n\n2005 onward but were discovered and disclosed only later; and that\n\nthe issuing banks suffered losses from reimbursing customers for\n\nfraud losses, monitoring customers accounts, and cancelling and\n\nreissuing cards.\n\n           The multi-count complaint charged (1) negligence, (2)\n\nbreach of contract, (3) negligent misrepresentation, and (4) unfair\n\nor deceptive practices under chapter 93A, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A\n\n(2008).    The defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a\n\nclaim.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).        On October 12, 2007, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the negligence and breach of contract\n\nclaims    but   refused   to   dismiss   claims   based   on   negligent\n\nmisrepresentation and chapter 93A. (A fifth claim, for \"negligence\n\nper se,\" was dismissed and is not at issue.)      In re TJX Cos. Retail\n\nSec. Breach Litig., 524 F. Supp. 2d 83.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f            Plaintiffs then moved to amend their complaint, seeking\n\nto add a claim for conversion and also new facts to the chapter 93A\n\nclaim.    On November 29, 2007, the district court provisionally\n\ndenied class status; if made final, this denial would in turn\n\ndefeat subject matter jurisdiction based on the minimal diversity\n\nprovisions of the Class Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332\n\n(2006).   The court invited briefing as to whether, if class action\n\nstatus were ultimately denied, it should transfer the case to state\n\ncourt.    In re TJX Cos. Retail Sec. Breach Litig., 246 F.R.D. 389.\n\n            On December 18, 2007, the court denied the motion to\n\namend the complaint, it made the denial of class status final, and\n\nit ordered the transfer of the case to the Massachusetts Superior\n\nCourt.    Although all but two of the claims had been dismissed, the\n\ndistrict court designated its pre-transfer rulings as \"without\n\nprejudice\" to reconsideration by the state court.    At defendants'\n\nrequest, this court stayed the transfer pending review on appeal.\n\n            TJX and Fifth Third now appeal to this court, urging\n\nprincipally that all claims against them should have been dismissed\n\nwith prejudice and that in any event transfer to the state court\n\nwas precluded by governing precedent.    AmeriFirst and SELCO raise\n\nstanding and finality objections to defendants' appeal and ask for\n\naffirmance of the transfer order; but by cross appeal, they say\n\nthat dismissal of their other claims was error and that both class\n\naction status and the motion to amend should have been allowed.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f            Jurisdiction, Standing and Finality.                 Although no party\n\nhas questioned it, we are compelled to consider first an oddity\n\nthat     might    seem   to    imperil         subject    matter        jurisdiction.\n\nJurisdiction in the district court rested on the minimum diversity\n\nprovision available only for class actions, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332, and\n\nultimately the district court ruled that class certification was\n\nimproper.    So one might ask: how do the parties now get to litigate\n\non the merits whether specific counts did or did not state claims?\n\n            The    answer     is   the   district        judge    had    provisional\n\njurisdiction to decide those merits issues--because whether class\n\naction status was sustainable depended in part on what claims were\n\non the table.      \"In such cases it is both proper and necessary for\n\nthe trial court first to resolve the merits of the claim to the\n\nextent necessary to allow the court to properly determine its own\n\njurisdiction.\"      Augustine v. United States, 704 F.2d 1074, 1079\n\n(9th Cir. 1983).     See generally Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678 (1946).\n\n            In the end, after disposing of standing and finality\n\nobjections, our analysis of the claims--both those sustained and\n\nthose dismissed--leads us to agree for the most part with the able\n\ndistrict judge's analysis (although not with the transfer order)\n\nbut to disagree in one respect that reopens the class action issue.\n\nWe therefore end by remanding for further proceedings as explained\n\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f            The standing and finality objections are directed to bar\n\ndefendants' argument that two remaining counts of the complaint--\n\nnegligent    misrepresentation     and   chapter   93A--should   have    been\n\ndismissed.      Plaintiffs   say    that   because   the   district     court\n\ndismissed other counts and thereafter transferred the case, the\n\nmerits rulings against the defendants on the remaining counts\n\ncaused no harm to them, beyond speculative collateral estoppel\n\neffects that might flow from the rulings in future litigation.\n\n            Because the district court ruled that the two counts\n\nstated viable claims, the defendants were plainly and concretely\n\ndisadvantaged: instead of an end to the liability claims, they now\n\nface further litigation of these claims (indeed, in this very case,\n\nbecause the transfer turns out to be invalid and the claims may\n\nstill end up going forward in the district court).          They are thus\n\nentitled to appeal from the adverse ruling--assuming that the\n\nruling is embodied in a final judgment.        28 U.S.C. ยง 1291.\n\n            Ordinarily a defendant may not appeal from a denial of\n\na Rule 12(b)(6) motion because the litigation in the trial court\n\nwill not have concluded.     But here the district court brought the\n\ncase before it to an end by the class action ruling and purported\n\ntransfer.     Appeals from transfers between federal courts are\n\nsometimes immediately appealable and sometimes not; but where the\n\ntransfer court lacks power to transfer, an order purporting to do\n\nso can hardly defeat review of an otherwise final judgment.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            Plaintiffs also argue that the defendants' appeal is\n\nbarred because the district court said that its merits rulings were\n\nwithout     prejudice     to     reconsideration     by    the    state       courts.\n\nDismissals without prejudice are sometimes deemed to prevent an\n\nimmediate appeal where they represent an invitation to a plaintiff\n\nto cure some technical deficiency by re-filing in the same court.\n\nE.g., Umbenhauer v. Woog, 969 F.2d 25, 30 (3rd Cir. 1992).                    In this\n\ncase, no such invitation was extended by the district court.\n\n            Finally      plaintiffs      invoke   Balcom    v.    Lynn    Ladder    &\n\nScaffolding Co., 806 F.2d 1127 (1st Cir. 1986), which refused to\n\nallow a third-party defendant, vindicated by a jury, to appeal from\n\na judgment in its favor.          This defendant wanted to challenge jury\n\nfindings,      fearing    that    they    would    prejudice      it     in    future\n\nlitigation.     This court said that the findings were not essential\n\nto the judgment and thus would have no collateral estoppel effect.\n\nId. at 1127.     Balcom is clearly not on point.\n\n            Negligent misrepresentation.            We therefore turn to the\n\nmerits    of    defendants'       appeal,      starting    with   the     negligent\n\nmisrepresentation claim which the district court found adequately\n\nalleged for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6).               Review of Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nrulings is de novo. First Medical Health Plan, Inc. v. Vega-Ramos,\n\n479 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 2007).                  At the outset, one has to\n\nunderstand the nature of the claim as stated in the complaint and\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fas thereafter clarified by the plaintiffs in resisting the motion\n\nto dismiss.\n\n            The complaint alleged that Fifth Third has contracts with\n\nMasterCard     and    Visa     that   require        compliance    with       operating\n\nregulations adopted by each credit card organization and that TJX\n\nand Fifth Third similarly have a contract that requires TJX to\n\ncomply with such regulations.                It further alleged that TJX and\n\nFifth Third ignored security measures required by the operating\n\nregulations--for      examples,       that    signatories    deploy       a    firewall\n\nconfiguration,       protect    stored       data,    encrypt     transmission      of\n\ncardholder data, and track access to cardholder data and network\n\nresources.\n\n            But although TJX and Fifth Third are charged in the\n\ncomplaint     with    misrepresentations,         the    plaintiffs'          claim--as\n\nelaborated their district court filings and brief on appeal--\n\nappears to rest (with one doubtful exception as to Fifth Third2) on\n\na flimsier foundation than actual misrepresentation.                           Rather,\n\nplaintiffs argue that by accepting credit cards and processing\n\npayment authorizations, defendants impliedly represented that they\n\n\n\n     2\n      The possible exception is that the complaint alleges that\nFifth Third is a member of an organization that promotes security\nmeasures and is so listed on its website and that, in context, this\namounts to an affirmative representation of compliance with various\nstandards; but it is not apparent that the website contains the\nmissing affirmative representations implied by the complaint, and\nplaintiffs' brief to us does not rely on this allegation in\ndefending the claim but rather on the conduct theory just noted.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fwould comply with MasterCard and Visa regulations and this was the\n\nnegligent misrepresentation.\n\n           Massachusetts law defines negligent misrepresentation\n\nusing the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977), which in section\n\n552 requires the following elements:\n\n           One who, in the course of his business,\n           profession or employment, or in any other\n           transaction in which he has a pecuniary\n           interest, supplies false information for the\n           guidance   of   others  in   their   business\n           transactions, is subject to liability for\n           pecuniary loss caused to them by their\n           justifiable reliance upon the information, if\n           he fails to exercise reasonable care or\n           competence in obtaining or communicating the\n           information.\n\nNycal   Corp. V. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, 426 Mass. 491, 495-96\n\n(1998)(quoting the Restatement).\n\n           It would almost surely stretch Massachusetts law too far\n\nto say that merely doing credit card transactions with issuing\n\nbanks, whether directly (Fifth Third) or indirectly (TJX), is a\n\nrepresentation   implied   by   conduct   to   third   parties   that   the\n\ndefendants were complying with detailed security specifications of\n\nVisa and MasterCard.   The implication is implausible and converts\n\nthe cause of action into liability for negligence--without the\n\nlimitations otherwise applicable to negligence claims.\n\n           Conduct can be part of a representation, but the link\n\nbetween the conduct and the implication is typically tight.         Thus,\n\nin Danca v. Taunton Sav. Bank, 385 Mass. 1, 9 (1982), the court\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fupheld an implied representation claim where plaintiffs, in applying\n\nfor a mortgage, were told by the bank that it needed to assure\n\ncompliance with a zoning requirement; later by a combination of\n\nwords and action, the bank led the plaintiffs to believe that the\n\nbank had found compliance.       More recently the SJC said of Danca:\n\n           We emphasized the importance to our decision\n           of the defendant's \"conduct and words\" and\n           \"response to the plaintiffs' inquiry,\" holding\n           it sufficient \"that the representation was\n           reasonably understood as a statement that the\n           bank employees had looked at the plan and\n           found no problems.\"\n\nPage v. Frazier, 388 Mass. 55, 66-67 (1983) (quoting Danca, 385\n\nMass. at 9).\n\n           Yet we stop short of holding that the district court had\n\nto dismiss the misrepresentation claim in this case on the face of\n\na complaint that explicitly alleged misrepresentation.            Recently\n\nthe Massachusetts trial court refused to dismiss virtually the same\n\nclaim brought by credit unions against Fifth Third and another\n\ndefendant for credit card losses resulting from a security breach.\n\nCUMIS Ins. Soc., Inc. v. BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc., 23 Mass. L. Rep.\n\n550   (Mass.   Super.   2005).    Plaintiffs   naturally   rely   on   this\n\ndecision, as did the district court.\n\n           Then, on summary judgment in CUMIS, it became crystal\n\nclear that the charge of \"misrepresentation\" rested simply on the\n\ndoing of credit card business--the same implication from conduct\n\nargument that plaintiffs offer in this case.       The CUMIS court then\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fgranted summary judgment for defendants because inter alia such\n\nconduct was not a misrepresentation under Massachusetts law.         CUMIS\n\nIns. Soc., Inc. v. BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc., 24 Mass. L. Rep. 117,\n\n*11-12 (Mass. Super. 2008).      The ultimate disposition is therefore\n\nfar more helpful to defendants.\n\n             Ordinarily a district court does not have to look behind\n\nthe complaint and grant a motion to dismiss because later statements\n\nby the plaintiff offer a narrower picture of what plaintiff expects\n\nto prove at trial.      Had the second CUMIS decision been available,\n\nthe district court might well have granted the motion,       but summary\n\njudgment is the more common method of disposing of claims that are\n\nfacially valid but prove (usually after discovery) to be unsupported\n\nby evidence.    The present claim thus survives, but on life support.\n\n             Chapter 93A. The provisions of chapter 93A invoked by\n\nplaintiffs, M.G.L. ch. 93A ยงยง 2, 11, pertinently provide for a claim\n\nfor \"unfair\" or \"deceptive\" trade practices as between businesses--\n\nthe unfairness label in these provisions being a cross-reference to\n\nmore specific standards borrowed from an appropriate source of law.\n\nCiardi v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., 436 Mass. 53, 70-72 (2002).\n\nPlaintiffs    offered   three   different   theories   invoking   specific\n\nstandards:\n\n             โขnegligent misrepresentation (already alleged\n             as a separate tort) under Massachusetts law,\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f             โขviolation of section 5 of the Federal Trade\n             Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 45(a)(1) (2006),\n             which chapter 93A cross-references,3 and\n\n             โขviolation of a federal statute that protects\n             information   that   customers   confide   to\n             financial institutions, Gramm-Leach-Bliley\n             Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 6801 (2006).\n\nThe district court sustained only the first of these theories and\n\nit rejected the other two.\n\n             The negligent misrepresentation claim is likely to have\n\nno future in this case for reasons just explained and, if it falls,\n\nso too does its use under chapter 93A.         Townsends, Inc. v. Beaupre,\n\n47 Mass. App. Ct. 747, 755 (1999).            Further, the district court\n\nfound--and    we   below   uphold     its     ruling--that   the    negligent\n\nmisrepresentation claim, whether standing alone or under chapter\n\n93A, is not certifiable under the class action rubric.             This brings\n\nus to the second theory (plaintiffs have abandoned the third).\n\n             Plaintiffs    contend     that     their second theory--that\n\ndefendants' lack of security measures was \"unfair\" under the Federal\n\nTrade Commission Act--provides an alternative basis for its chapter\n\n93A claim. The district court disagreed, saying that the unfairness\n\ncharacterization rested on consent decrees of the Federal Trade\n\n\n     3\n      M.G.L. ch. 93A ยง 2 (\"It is the intent of the legislature that\nin construing paragraph (a) of this section . . . courts will be\nguided by the interpretations given by the [FTC] and the Federal\nCourts to section 5(a)(1) of the [FTCA].\"), as well as case law,\nsee PMP Associates, Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 366 Mass. 593, 595\n(1975) (Chapter 93A \"directs us to consider the interpretations of\nunfair acts and practices under s.5 of the Federal Trade Commission\nAct . . . .\").\n\n                                     -12-\n\fCommission and (the court said) a consent decree is not under\n\nMassachusetts law an authoritative determination for purposes of\n\nchapter 93A. Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. v. Kotseas, 378 Mass. 85, 101\n\n(1979).   Plaintiffs read the case more narrowly.\n\n           However Whitinsville may be read, plaintiffs' claim here\n\nrests on far more than consent decrees, which sometimes do go beyond\n\nlegal obligations.   Specifically, they invoke (1) an FTC complaint\n\nagainst TJX based on the very security lapse charged here and (2)\n\nat least two other cases in which the FTC ruled that similar conduct\n\nviolated the Federal Trade Commission Act.4      The FTC complaint\n\nagainst TJX states (in paragraph 12):\n\n           [R]espondent's failure to employ reasonable\n           and appropriate security measures to protect\n           personal information caused or is likely to\n           cause substantial injury to consumers that is\n           not offset by countervailing benefits to\n           consumers or competition and is not reasonably\n           avoidable by consumers. This practice was and\n           is an unfair act or practice.\n\n           Use of FTC precedent--certainly as to decided cases like\n\nDSW and BJ's--is directly supported by chapter 93A itself. Further,\n\nMassachusetts case law treats FTC complaints as an expression of the\n\n\n\n     4\n      FTC Complaint, In the Matter of The TJX Companies, File No.\n072-3055; Press Release, Fed. Trade Comm'n, Agency Announces\nSettlement of Separate Actions Against Retailer TJX, and Data\nBrokers Reed Elsevier and Seisint for Failing to Provide Adequate\nSecurity for Consumers' Data (Mar. 27, 2008) (the release says that\nover twenty FTC complaints have been brought against similar\nconduct by other companies); In re DSW Inc., Docket C-4157, 2006 WL\n752215 (F.T.C. Mar. 7, 2006); In re BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc.,\nDocket C-4148, 2005 WL 2395788 (F.T.C. Sept. 20, 2005).\n\n                               -13-\n\fFTC's views, Schubach v. Household Fin. Corp., 375 Mass. 133, 135\n\n(1978) (relying in part on โseveral complaintsโ issued by the FTC),\n\nand adjudicated FTC complaints are even more potent. So the chapter\n\n93A claim can go forward on this second theory unless derailed by\n\ntwo TJX counter-arguments--to which we now turn.\n\n             The first--that chapter 93A requires a closer association\n\nthan its indirect connection with AmeriFirst--was answered by the\n\ndistrict court.        Case law does require a business relationship,\n\ne.g., Imprimis Investors, LLC v. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, 69 Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 218, 230-31 (2007), but here a jury might say that TJX was\n\nregularly    seeking      payment     from     the    issuing    banks    through   an\n\nintermediary       (Fifth    Third)     and    that    this    is   a   close   enough\n\nconnection.    At least at the complaint stage, this seems enough.\n\n             TJX next argues correctly that chapter 93A is intended\n\nexclusively for egregious conduct, see Ahern v. Scholz, 85 F.3d 774,\n\n797-98 (1st Cir. 1996), and--it contends--that either deliberate\n\nwrongdoing or personal benefit is present in virtually all of the\n\nsound case law. Perhaps policy might make this a desirable stopping\n\npoint,   given      the     vagueness     of    the    unfairness       standard    and\n\navailability     of   a     private   damages        remedy   unchecked    by   agency\n\nprudence.\n\n             But Massachusetts decisions do not say that deliberate\n\nwrongdoing    or    self-benefit        are    required;      seemingly    systematic\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\frecklessness may suffice.5   Knowing so little about the extent of\n\nTJX's or Fifth Third's fault at the complaint stage, we think that\n\nat best TJX's argument is one that would have to await discovery and\n\nperhaps a summary judgment motion.    The procedural caution shown in\n\nCUMIS is easily justified on this issue.\n\n           Finally, Fifth Third argues that the chapter 93A claim\n\nmust fail against it because none of its acts occurred โprimarilyโ\n\nor โsubstantiallyโ within Massachusetts.    See M.G.L. ch. 93A, ยง 11.\n\nBut again, the allegations are sufficient at this stage.       Fifth\n\nThird is alleged to have an office or offices in Massachusetts,\n\nwhich under CUMIS is arguably sufficient, 23 Mass. L. Rep. 550, at\n\n*16-17; and presumably Fifth Third's communicating to and from TJX's\n\nservers in Massachusetts is part of the causal chain.\n\n           One final point as to the unfairness-based claim under\n\nchapter 93A.   The district court indicated, in its decision on\n\nOctober 12, 2007, that federal subject matter jurisdiction might\n\nindependently attach to such a claim--regardless of class action\n\nstatus--because a federal issue might be deemed embedded in the\n\n\n\n     5\n      See Briggs v. Carol Cars, Inc., 407 Mass. 391, 396-97 (1990)\n(\"We also reject the argument that the judge erred in concluding\nthat the defendant's representation was recklessly made. It is\nenough that the judge found on adequate evidence that the defects\nin the vehicle were readily ascertainable by the defendant. If a\nstatement of fact which is susceptible of knowledge is made as of\none's knowledge and is false, it may be the basis of an action for\ndeceit); Pietrazak v. McDermott, 341 Mass. 107, 109-10 (1960). See\nalso Kozdras v. Land/Vest Properties, Inc., 382 Mass. 34, 43\n(1980); Glickman v. Brown, 21 Mass.

It did not pursue the issue because it rejected\n\nthe theory; but we are now reinstating that theory and class action\n\nstatus is at best uncertain.\n\n                The embedded issue theory, associated with Smith v.\n\nKansas City, 255 U.S. 180 (1921), raises a complicated and much\n\nmooted problem as to the proper construction of the \"federal\n\nquestion\" statute.          28 U.S.C. ยง 1331.    The answer may not matter in\n\nthis case: the district court's class-action analysis suggested that\n\nbecause individual bank recoveries may be small, the plaintiffs may\n\nhave       no   practical     interest    in    pursuing   this   case   unless\n\ncertification is granted.\n\n                But if the Smith theory becomes critical, jurisdiction\n\nshould not be assumed merely because the state claim resorts to\n\nfederal precedent; nor is it perfectly clear that Massachusetts\n\nregards the section 5 standard as binding (as opposed to merely\n\ninformative precedent to be considered)--which would arguably not\n\nsuffice even under Smith.            It is enough to warn that there is\n\nprecedent and commentary that would have to be consulted and briefed\n\nif and when necessary.6\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      See Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction ยง 5.2, at 289-95\n(5th ed. 2007); Grable & Sons Metal Prod., Inc. v.

Plaintiffs say that the district court erred\n\nin dismissing their simple negligence claim, a ruling that it based\n\nupon the so called economic loss doctrine.            Massachusetts, which is\n\nnot alone, holds that โpurely economic losses are unrecoverable in\n\ntort and strict liability actions in the absence of personal injury\n\nor property damage.\"       Aldrich v. ADD Inc., 437 Mass. 213, 222\n\n(2002). Like \"duty\" and \"proximate cause,\" the doctrine cabins what\n\ncould   otherwise   be   open-ended       negligence    liability    to   anyone\n\naffected by a negligent act.\n\n           AmeriFirst    says     that    it   did   suffer   property    damage\n\nbecause it had a property interest in the payment card information,\n\nwhich the security breach rendered worthless.              Electronic data can\n\nhave value and the value can be lost, but the loss here is not a\n\nresult of physical destruction of property.            Indeed, a reduction in\n\nreal property value, by dumping of contaminants in the neighborhood\n\nbut not on plaintiff's property was held to be economic loss. Lewis\n\nv. General Electric, 37 F.Supp.2d 55 (D. Mass. 1999).\n\n           Plaintiffs     offer    policy      arguments    for   limiting   the\n\neconomic loss doctrine, but the physical injury requirement reflects\n\nexisting precedent, Lewis; Am. Tel. & Tel. Co. v. IMR Capital Corp.,\n\n888 F. Supp. 221, 247 (D. Mass. 1995).               CUMIS itself invoked the\n\neconomic loss doctrine to bar a negligence claim on the same facts.\n\n23 Mass. L. Rptr. 550, at *8-9.          Accord, Pa. State Employees Credit\n\nUnion v. Fifth Third Bank, 398 F. Supp. 2d. 317, 326 (M.D. Pa.\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f2005).   Nor will we certify an issue where state law is clear.\n\nCantwell v. Univ. of Mass., 551 F.2d 879, 880 (1st Cir. 1977).\n\n             Breach of contract.     Plaintiffs also do not persuade us\n\nthat the district court erred in dismissing their contract claims.\n\nHere, Visa and Mastercard bound participating banks like Fifth Third\n\nto certain security procedures and approving banks like Fifth Third\n\nbound sellers like TJX for whom they processed payments; but the\n\nissuing banks were not parties to either of these contracts and can\n\ntherefore bring claims only if they were third-party beneficiaries.\n\n             Massachusetts law follows the third-party beneficiary\n\ntest of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 302 (1981), see Rae\n\nv. Air-Speed, Inc., 386 Mass. 187, 195 (1982), which is relatively\n\nhospitable    to   claims    by   those   purporting   to   be   third-party\n\nbeneficiaries--except where the direct parties to the contract have\n\n\"otherwise agreed.\"     Section 302(1) states:\n\n             Unless otherwise agreed between promisor and\n             promisee, a beneficiary of a promise is an\n             intended beneficiary if recognition of a right\n             to   performance   in   the   beneficiary   is\n             appropriate to effectuate the intention of the\n             parties and . . . the circumstances indicate\n             that the promisee intends to give the\n             beneficiary the benefit of the promised\n             performance.\n\n             The parties to the contracts in this case appear to have\n\n\"otherwise agreed.\"         The agreement between Fifth Third and TJX\n\nprovides: \"This Agreement is for the benefit of, and may be enforced\n\nonly by, Bank and Merchant . . . and is not for the benefit of, and\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fmay not be enforced by any third party.\" Plaintiffs argue that this\n\nexpress language is superceded by provisions in the Mastercard and\n\nVisa Operating Regulations.          The regulations do say that they\n\nprevail   where   they    conflict   with   provisions    in    the    merchant\n\nagreements, but here the regulations do not conflict.\n\n             Instead, the MasterCard Operating Regulations state that\n\nMasterCard \"shall have the sole right to interpret and enforce\" its\n\nregulations, and the Visa Operating Regulations say that they \"do\n\nnot constitute a third-party beneficiary contract as to any entity\n\nor person . . . or confer any rights, privileges, or claims of any\n\nkind as to any third parties.\"        CUMIS is in accord.           23 Mass. L.\n\nRptr. 550, at *5-6.      See also Pa. State Employees Credit Union, 398\n\nF. Supp.2d at 323-26.\n\n             Conversion.     Plaintiffs     did   not   plead   a     claim   for\n\nconversion in their original or amended complaint but sought to add\n\nit on October 25, 2007, a month after submitting the amended\n\ncomplaint.    The district court denied the motion on the ground that\n\nthe claim was not viable, saying that conversion related only to\n\ninterference with tangible property, and that plaintiffs claim\n\nconcerned intangible property.        We review this denial for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R., 445 F.3d 50, 58 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f          Whether or not Massachusetts limits conversion claims to\n\ntangible property is debatable,7 but even if it does not, such a\n\nclaim is less than a neat fit.    Conversion implies appropriation,\n\nwhich is hardly the first word that comes to mind--to describe the\n\nstore's behavior--when a customer gives a store a credit card and\n\nthe data is then filched from the store by a third party.     Still,\n\nthe conversion concept is loosely defined, under Massachusetts law\n\nas elsewhere, e.g., Kelley v. LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 11-12 (1st Cir.\n\n2002); so perhaps this too is a debatable issue.\n\n          In all events, the claim is not straightforward, could\n\nhave been presented in the original complaint, and does not depend\n\non newly discovered facts.   The district court's decision not to\n\nentertain a belated claim on top of numerous ones already pled and\n\nunder consideration, was not an abuse of discretion.     Nor did the\n\ncourt have to allow belated amendment of the chapter 93A claim to\n\nadd facts that could have been asserted earlier.\n\n          Class certification.      After determining which claims\n\nsurvived, the district court then applied the customary tests to\n\ndecide whether class action status could be sustained for the case,\n\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), (b), and provisionally concluded that\n\ncertification was not justified.        This judgment was explicitly\n\nlimited to the two claims that survived.     Ultimately, the district\n\n\n     7\n      Compare John G. Danielson, Inc. v. Winchester-Conant Props.,\nInc., 186 F. Supp. 2d 1, 28 (D. Mass. 2002), with Discover Realty\nCorp. v. David, 2003 Mass. App. Div. 172, 175 (2003).\n\n                                 -20-\n\fcourt denied the request to amend and made final its denial of class\n\nstatus.\n\n            Plaintiffs expressly decline to appeal from the denial of\n\nclass certification of the two claims in question--the negligent\n\nrepresentation claim and the chapter 93A claim resting on the same\n\ntheory.    But arguing that some of the district court's discussion\n\nis mistaken, or overcome by proffered amendments to the class\n\ndefinition, they express concern that some of the discussion might\n\nimperil certification on remand of any other claim that we might\n\nreinstate on appeal--which is just what we are doing.\n\n            Conversely, TJX (although for intricate reasons not Fifth\n\nThird)    appears   to   agree   that   the   district   court's   denial   of\n\ncertification is mooted by plaintiffs' failure to appeal it; but\n\ndefendants themselves urge that--should we reinstate any of the\n\ndismissed claims--we \"affirm\"           the   denial of certification and\n\n\"conclude that it precluded class certification of any revived\n\nclaims(s).\"    In other words, both sides suggest that we resolve,\n\nalthough in opposite ways, a question not reached by the district\n\ncourt.\n\n            The district court's resolution of the certification\n\nissue before it--not to certify the negligent misrepresentation\n\nclaim--turned primarily on its conclusion that that claim required\n\nproof of individual reliance on the misrepresentation--directly so\n\nfor the tort claim and at least indirectly so for the chapter 93A\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fclaim.     On this basis, the district court found that class issues\n\nwould not predominate over individual-party issues, defeating the\n\nonly Rule 23(b) precondition that the court deemed viable.\n\n            It is not clear to us whether a chapter 93A claim based\n\non an unfairness theory would necessarily raise the same problem or\n\nbe barred on the same basis.     The unfairness theory appears to look\n\nto what the defendants did (or failed to do) rather than on the\n\nbanks' reliance on supposed misrepresentations; but the district\n\ncourt's discussion of proof of causation of loss as a separate\n\nindividual-party issue may (or may not) apply to unfairness claims\n\nas well.    Neither side has briefed this issue and obviously the\n\ndistrict court has not decided it.\n\n            The district court also expressed concern about whether\n\nthe putative class was properly defined by plaintiffs and about\n\nwhether plaintiffs could provide fair and adequate representation,\n\nalso a precondition for class status. Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). But\n\nthe   former   concern   might   perhaps   be   cured   by   the   proffered\n\namendments; and the latter directly related to the claims against\n\nFifth Third and the conflicting economic interests of banks that are\n\nboth issuers and acquirers; claims against TJX might be unaffected.\n\n            The district court showed an enviable mastery of class\n\naction law and analysis, and the wisest course is to let it decide\n\nin the first instance whether the chapter 93A unfairness theory\n\nmerits class status.      To pick apart an integrated analysis and\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fcomment on specific reasons, as plaintiffs urge, would be unsound;\n\nit would be even more unsound to decide, as defendants urge, the\n\nclass status of the revived claim unless and until the district\n\ncourt considers the issue and it is properly briefed to us.\n\n           Transfer.   Having denied certification, the district\n\ncourt concluded that the case could not proceed in federal court,\n\npartly because too little was at stake for the individual plaintiffs\n\nbut primarily because ordinary diversity is lacking once the minimal\n\ndiversity provided for a qualified class action fails.   Defendants\n\nattack, and plaintiffs defend, the transfer order--authority to\n\ntransfer being \"a legal question we review de novo.\"       Mills v.\n\nMaine, 118 F.3d 37, 51 (1st Cir. 1997) (citation omitted).\n\n           Mills squarely decided \"that, in the absence of any\n\nspecialized state statute, 'it is the duty of the trial court, if\n\nit finds that jurisdiction does not exist, to proceed no further but\n\nto dismiss the suit.'\" Id. at 52 (emphasis in original) (quoting Joy\n\nv. Hague, 175 F.2d 395, 396 (1st Cir. 1949)).       Most of Mills'\n\nreasoning would apply even if there were a Massachusetts statute\n\nauthorizing such a transfer, compare Weaver v. Marine Bank, 683 F.2d\n\n744 (3rd Cir. 1982); anyway, no such statute is invoked.\n\n           Mills' ruling on transfers to state courts was not, as\n\nhas been suggested, merely dictum. In Mills, the district court had\n\nrefused to transfer to state court a suit that fell outside its own\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction and on appeal appellants insisted that\n\n\n                               -23-\n\fthe district court should have transferred the case to state court.\n\nThis court then considered the claim and decided that the district\n\ncourt had no authority to make such a transfer.   This holding binds\n\ndistrict courts and, indeed, this panel.   Muskat v. United States,\n\n554 F.3d 183, 189 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           In ordering transfer, the district court said that its\n\nprior merits rulings were \"'without prejudice' to reexamination in\n\nthe courts of the Commonwealth.\"   TJX says that this too was error.\n\nThe \"without prejudice\" label has different meanings in different\n\ncontexts, e.g., In re Sonus Networks, Inc., 499 F.3d 47, 60 n.6 (1st\n\nCir. 2007); perhaps the district judge meant only that a transferee\n\ncourt can revisit its prior rulings in the same case.       Rio Mar\n\nAssocs., LP v. UHS of P.R., Inc., 522 F.3d 159, 167 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           It would be quite another matter to decide a merits issue\n\nbut then purport to deprive the decision of res judicata effect in\n\nfuture cases--a matter governed by established rules. E.g., Ramallo\n\nBros. Printing, Inc. v. El Dia, Inc., 490 F.3d 86 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nBut the \"without prejudice\" gloss here was commentary incident to\n\nthe transfer order and, as we are vacating that order and remanding\n\nthe case, we treat the characterization as falling with the order.\n\n           Accordingly, we affirm (1) the district court's dismissal\n\nof the negligence and breach of contract claims, (2) its denial of\n\nthe motion to amend the complaint, and (3) its sustaining of the\n\nnegligent misrepresentation claim (and use as a theory under chapter\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f93A, but without prejudice to a motion by defendants for summary\n\njudgment), but we vacate (4) its dismissal of the chapter 93A claim\n\nbased on the unfairness theory and (5) its transfer order and no-\n\nprejudice ruling, and we remand for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this decision.   Each party will bear its own costs on the\n\nappeal.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f",

Law suits\n\nensued, this case--involving banks injured in the debacle--among\n\nthem.\n\n            In   January   2007,   TJX    Companies,   Inc.    (\"TJX\"),\n\nheadquartered in Massachusetts and a major operator of discount\n\nstores, revealed that its computer systems had been hacked. Credit\n\nor debit card data for millions of its customers had been stolen.\n\nHarm resulted not only to customers but, it appears, also to banks\n\nthat had issued the cards (\"issuing banks\"), which were forced to\n\nreimburse customers for fraudulent use of the cards and incurred\n\nother expenses.\n\n            In May 2007, AmeriFirst Bank, based in Alabama, filed\n\nsuit in the federal district court in Massachusetts against TJX\n\nand, in addition, against an Ohio bank and its parent--Fifth Third\n\nBank and Fifth Third Bancorp (collectively     \"Fifth Third\").1   Fifth\n\n\n\n        1\n      The suit against TJX included other named plaintiffs who have\nsince settled.    A second AmeriFirst suit, with another named\nplaintiff (SELCO--a credit union in Oregon), was filed against\nFifth Third in the district court. The two cases were consolidated\nand, as allegations against Fifth Third in the second suit mirror\nthose in the first, we refer only to \"the complaint.\"\n\n                                   -2-\n\fThird served as \"processing bank\" for TJX transactions, receiving\n\nthe data from the customer's initial charge for a purchase and,\n\nafter high-speed verification from the issuing bank, authorizing\n\nthe charge.     Visa and Mastercard each had a network and regime for\n\nsuch purposes.\n\n           AmeriFirst's complaint, seeking class action status for\n\nissuing banks, charged that both TJX and Fifth Third were variously\n\nat fault: that TJX and Fifth Third failed to follow security\n\nprotocols prescribed by Visa and MasterCard to safeguard personal\n\nand financial information; that the breaches occurred from July\n\n2005 onward but were discovered and disclosed only later; and that\n\nthe issuing banks suffered losses from reimbursing customers for\n\nfraud losses, monitoring customers accounts, and cancelling and\n\nreissuing cards.\n\n           The multi-count complaint charged (1) negligence, (2)\n\nbreach of contract, (3) negligent misrepresentation, and (4) unfair\n\nor deceptive practices under chapter 93A, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A\n\n(2008).    The defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a\n\nclaim.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).        On October 12, 2007, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the negligence and breach of contract\n\nclaims    but   refused   to   dismiss   claims   based   on   negligent\n\nmisrepresentation and chapter 93A. (A fifth claim, for \"negligence\n\nper se,\" was dismissed and is not at issue.)      In re TJX Cos. Retail\n\nSec. Breach Litig., 524 F. Supp. 2d 83.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f            Plaintiffs then moved to amend their complaint, seeking\n\nto add a claim for conversion and also new facts to the chapter 93A\n\nclaim.    On November 29, 2007, the district court provisionally\n\ndenied class status; if made final, this denial would in turn\n\ndefeat subject matter jurisdiction based on the minimal diversity\n\nprovisions of the Class Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332\n\n(2006).   The court invited briefing as to whether, if class action\n\nstatus were ultimately denied, it should transfer the case to state\n\ncourt.    In re TJX Cos. Retail Sec. Breach Litig., 246 F.R.D. 389.\n\n            On December 18, 2007, the court denied the motion to\n\namend the complaint, it made the denial of class status final, and\n\nit ordered the transfer of the case to the Massachusetts Superior\n\nCourt.    Although all but two of the claims had been dismissed, the\n\ndistrict court designated its pre-transfer rulings as \"without\n\nprejudice\" to reconsideration by the state court.    At defendants'\n\nrequest, this court stayed the transfer pending review on appeal.\n\n            TJX and Fifth Third now appeal to this court, urging\n\nprincipally that all claims against them should have been dismissed\n\nwith prejudice and that in any event transfer to the state court\n\nwas precluded by governing precedent.    AmeriFirst and SELCO raise\n\nstanding and finality objections to defendants' appeal and ask for\n\naffirmance of the transfer order; but by cross appeal, they say\n\nthat dismissal of their other claims was error and that both class\n\naction status and the motion to amend should have been allowed.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f            Jurisdiction, Standing and Finality.                 Although no party\n\nhas questioned it, we are compelled to consider first an oddity\n\nthat     might    seem   to    imperil         subject    matter        jurisdiction.\n\nJurisdiction in the district court rested on the minimum diversity\n\nprovision available only for class actions, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332, and\n\nultimately the district court ruled that class certification was\n\nimproper.    So one might ask: how do the parties now get to litigate\n\non the merits whether specific counts did or did not state claims?\n\n            The    answer     is   the   district        judge    had    provisional\n\njurisdiction to decide those merits issues--because whether class\n\naction status was sustainable depended in part on what claims were\n\non the table.      \"In such cases it is both proper and necessary for\n\nthe trial court first to resolve the merits of the claim to the\n\nextent necessary to allow the court to properly determine its own\n\njurisdiction.\"      Augustine v.

Plaintiffs   say    that   because   the   district     court\n\ndismissed other counts and thereafter transferred the case, the\n\nmerits rulings against the defendants on the remaining counts\n\ncaused no harm to them, beyond speculative collateral estoppel\n\neffects that might flow from the rulings in future litigation.\n\n            Because the district court ruled that the two counts\n\nstated viable claims, the defendants were plainly and concretely\n\ndisadvantaged: instead of an end to the liability claims, they now\n\nface further litigation of these claims (indeed, in this very case,\n\nbecause the transfer turns out to be invalid and the claims may\n\nstill end up going forward in the district court).          They are thus\n\nentitled to appeal from the adverse ruling--assuming that the\n\nruling is embodied in a final judgment.        28 U.S.C. ยง 1291.\n\n            Ordinarily a defendant may not appeal from a denial of\n\na Rule 12(b)(6) motion because the litigation in the trial court\n\nwill not have concluded.     But here the district court brought the\n\ncase before it to an end by the class action ruling and purported\n\ntransfer.     Appeals from transfers between federal courts are\n\nsometimes immediately appealable and sometimes not; but where the\n\ntransfer court lacks power to transfer, an order purporting to do\n\nso can hardly defeat review of an otherwise final judgment.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            Plaintiffs also argue that the defendants' appeal is\n\nbarred because the district court said that its merits rulings were\n\nwithout     prejudice     to     reconsideration     by    the    state       courts.\n\nDismissals without prejudice are sometimes deemed to prevent an\n\nimmediate appeal where they represent an invitation to a plaintiff\n\nto cure some technical deficiency by re-filing in the same court.\n\nE.g., Umbenhauer v. Woog, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586845\"><a href=\"/opinion/586845/richard-a-umbenhauer-trustee-in-bankruptcy-of-xouth-inc-dba-woog/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30 (3rd Cir. 1992).                    In this\n\ncase, no such invitation was extended by the district court.\n\n            Finally      plaintiffs      invoke   Balcom    v.

This defendant wanted to challenge jury\n\nfindings,      fearing    that    they    would    prejudice      it     in    future\n\nlitigation.     This court said that the findings were not essential\n\nto the judgment and thus would have no collateral estoppel effect.\n\nId. at 1127.     Balcom is clearly not on point.\n\n            Negligent misrepresentation.

At the outset, one has to\n\nunderstand the nature of the claim as stated in the complaint and\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fas thereafter clarified by the plaintiffs in resisting the motion\n\nto dismiss.\n\n            The complaint alleged that Fifth Third has contracts with\n\nMasterCard     and    Visa     that   require        compliance    with       operating\n\nregulations adopted by each credit card organization and that TJX\n\nand Fifth Third similarly have a contract that requires TJX to\n\ncomply with such regulations.                It further alleged that TJX and\n\nFifth Third ignored security measures required by the operating\n\nregulations--for      examples,       that    signatories    deploy       a    firewall\n\nconfiguration,       protect    stored       data,    encrypt     transmission      of\n\ncardholder data, and track access to cardholder data and network\n\nresources.\n\n            But although TJX and Fifth Third are charged in the\n\ncomplaint     with    misrepresentations,         the    plaintiffs'          claim--as\n\nelaborated their district court filings and brief on appeal--\n\nappears to rest (with one doubtful exception as to Fifth Third2) on\n\na flimsier foundation than actual misrepresentation.                           Rather,\n\nplaintiffs argue that by accepting credit cards and processing\n\npayment authorizations, defendants impliedly represented that they\n\n\n\n     2\n      The possible exception is that the complaint alleges that\nFifth Third is a member of an organization that promotes security\nmeasures and is so listed on its website and that, in context, this\namounts to an affirmative representation of compliance with various\nstandards; but it is not apparent that the website contains the\nmissing affirmative representations implied by the complaint, and\nplaintiffs' brief to us does not rely on this allegation in\ndefending the claim but rather on the conduct theory just noted.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fwould comply with MasterCard and Visa regulations and this was the\n\nnegligent misrepresentation.\n\n           Massachusetts law defines negligent misrepresentation\n\nusing the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977), which in section\n\n552 requires the following elements:\n\n           One who, in the course of his business,\n           profession or employment, or in any other\n           transaction in which he has a pecuniary\n           interest, supplies false information for the\n           guidance   of   others  in   their   business\n           transactions, is subject to liability for\n           pecuniary loss caused to them by their\n           justifiable reliance upon the information, if\n           he fails to exercise reasonable care or\n           competence in obtaining or communicating the\n           information.\n\nNycal   Corp.

The implication is implausible and converts\n\nthe cause of action into liability for negligence--without the\n\nlimitations otherwise applicable to negligence claims.\n\n           Conduct can be part of a representation, but the link\n\nbetween the conduct and the implication is typically tight.

More recently the SJC said of Danca:\n\n           We emphasized the importance to our decision\n           of the defendant's \"conduct and words\" and\n           \"response to the plaintiffs' inquiry,\" holding\n           it sufficient \"that the representation was\n           reasonably understood as a statement that the\n           bank employees had looked at the plan and\n           found no problems.\"\n\nPage v.

Recently\n\nthe Massachusetts trial court refused to dismiss virtually the same\n\nclaim brought by credit unions against Fifth Third and another\n\ndefendant for credit card losses resulting from a security breach.\n\nCUMIS Ins. Soc., Inc. v. BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc., 23 Mass. L. Rep.\n\n550   (Mass.   Super.   2005).    Plaintiffs   naturally   rely   on   this\n\ndecision, as did the district court.\n\n           Then, on summary judgment in CUMIS, it became crystal\n\nclear that the charge of \"misrepresentation\" rested simply on the\n\ndoing of credit card business--the same implication from conduct\n\nargument that plaintiffs offer in this case.       The CUMIS court then\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fgranted summary judgment for defendants because inter alia such\n\nconduct was not a misrepresentation under Massachusetts law.         CUMIS\n\nIns. Soc., Inc. v. BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc., 24 Mass. L. Rep. 117,\n\n*11-12 (Mass. Super. 2008).      The ultimate disposition is therefore\n\nfar more helpful to defendants.\n\n             Ordinarily a district court does not have to look behind\n\nthe complaint and grant a motion to dismiss because later statements\n\nby the plaintiff offer a narrower picture of what plaintiff expects\n\nto prove at trial.      Had the second CUMIS decision been available,\n\nthe district court might well have granted the motion,       but summary\n\njudgment is the more common method of disposing of claims that are\n\nfacially valid but prove (usually after discovery) to be unsupported\n\nby evidence.    The present claim thus survives, but on life support.\n\n             Chapter 93A. The provisions of chapter 93A invoked by\n\nplaintiffs, M.G.L. ch. 93A ยงยง 2, 11, pertinently provide for a claim\n\nfor \"unfair\" or \"deceptive\" trade practices as between businesses--\n\nthe unfairness label in these provisions being a cross-reference to\n\nmore specific standards borrowed from an appropriate source of law.\n\nCiardi v.

Plaintiffs read the case more narrowly.\n\n           However Whitinsville may be read, plaintiffs' claim here\n\nrests on far more than consent decrees, which sometimes do go beyond\n\nlegal obligations.   Specifically, they invoke (1) an FTC complaint\n\nagainst TJX based on the very security lapse charged here and (2)\n\nat least two other cases in which the FTC ruled that similar conduct\n\nviolated the Federal Trade Commission Act.4      The FTC complaint\n\nagainst TJX states (in paragraph 12):\n\n           [R]espondent's failure to employ reasonable\n           and appropriate security measures to protect\n           personal information caused or is likely to\n           cause substantial injury to consumers that is\n           not offset by countervailing benefits to\n           consumers or competition and is not reasonably\n           avoidable by consumers. This practice was and\n           is an unfair act or practice.\n\n           Use of FTC precedent--certainly as to decided cases like\n\nDSW and BJ's--is directly supported by chapter 93A itself.

So the chapter\n\n93A claim can go forward on this second theory unless derailed by\n\ntwo TJX counter-arguments--to which we now turn.\n\n             The first--that chapter 93A requires a closer association\n\nthan its indirect connection with AmeriFirst--was answered by the\n\ndistrict court.        Case law does require a business relationship,\n\ne.g., Imprimis Investors, LLC v. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, 69 Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 218, 230-31 (2007), but here a jury might say that TJX was\n\nregularly    seeking      payment     from     the    issuing    banks    through   an\n\nintermediary       (Fifth    Third)     and    that    this    is   a   close   enough\n\nconnection.    At least at the complaint stage, this seems enough.\n\n             TJX next argues correctly that chapter 93A is intended\n\nexclusively for egregious conduct, see Ahern v. Scholz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196795\"><a href=\"/opinion/196795/ahern-v-scholz/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n797-98 (1st Cir. 1996), and--it contends--that either deliberate\n\nwrongdoing or personal benefit is present in virtually all of the\n\nsound case law. Perhaps policy might make this a desirable stopping\n\npoint,   given      the     vagueness     of    the    unfairness       standard    and\n\navailability     of   a     private   damages        remedy   unchecked    by   agency\n\nprudence.\n\n             But Massachusetts decisions do not say that deliberate\n\nwrongdoing    or    self-benefit        are    required;      seemingly    systematic\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\frecklessness may suffice.5   Knowing so little about the extent of\n\nTJX's or Fifth Third's fault at the complaint stage, we think that\n\nat best TJX's argument is one that would have to await discovery and\n\nperhaps a summary judgment motion.    The procedural caution shown in\n\nCUMIS is easily justified on this issue.\n\n           Finally, Fifth Third argues that the chapter 93A claim\n\nmust fail against it because none of its acts occurred โprimarilyโ\n\nor โsubstantiallyโ within Massachusetts.    See M.G.L. ch. 93A, ยง 11.\n\nBut again, the allegations are sufficient at this stage.       Fifth\n\nThird is alleged to have an office or offices in Massachusetts,\n\nwhich under CUMIS is arguably sufficient, 23 Mass. L.

But arguing that some of the district court's discussion\n\nis mistaken, or overcome by proffered amendments to the class\n\ndefinition, they express concern that some of the discussion might\n\nimperil certification on remand of any other claim that we might\n\nreinstate on appeal--which is just what we are doing.\n\n            Conversely, TJX (although for intricate reasons not Fifth\n\nThird)    appears   to   agree   that   the   district   court's   denial   of\n\ncertification is mooted by plaintiffs' failure to appeal it; but\n\ndefendants themselves urge that--should we reinstate any of the\n\ndismissed claims--we \"affirm\"           the   denial of certification and\n\n\"conclude that it precluded class certification of any revived\n\nclaims(s).\"    In other words, both sides suggest that we resolve,\n\nalthough in opposite ways, a question not reached by the district\n\ncourt.\n\n            The district court's resolution of the certification\n\nissue before it--not to certify the negligent misrepresentation\n\nclaim--turned primarily on its conclusion that that claim required\n\nproof of individual reliance on the misrepresentation--directly so\n\nfor the tort claim and at least indirectly so for the chapter 93A\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fclaim.     On this basis, the district court found that class issues\n\nwould not predominate over individual-party issues, defeating the\n\nonly Rule 23(b) precondition that the court deemed viable.\n\n            It is not clear to us whether a chapter 93A claim based\n\non an unfairness theory would necessarily raise the same problem or\n\nbe barred on the same basis.     The unfairness theory appears to look\n\nto what the defendants did (or failed to do) rather than on the\n\nbanks' reliance on supposed misrepresentations; but the district\n\ncourt's discussion of proof of causation of loss as a separate\n\nindividual-party issue may (or may not) apply to unfairness claims\n\nas well.    Neither side has briefed this issue and obviously the\n\ndistrict court has not decided it.\n\n            The district court also expressed concern about whether\n\nthe putative class was properly defined by plaintiffs and about\n\nwhether plaintiffs could provide fair and adequate representation,\n\nalso a precondition for class status. Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). But\n\nthe   former   concern   might   perhaps   be   cured   by   the   proffered\n\namendments; and the latter directly related to the claims against\n\nFifth Third and the conflicting economic interests of banks that are\n\nboth issuers and acquirers; claims against TJX might be unaffected.\n\n            The district court showed an enviable mastery of class\n\naction law and analysis, and the wisest course is to let it decide\n\nin the first instance whether the chapter 93A unfairness theory\n\nmerits class status.

United States,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203649\"><a href=\"/opinion/203649/muskat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 189 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           In ordering transfer, the district court said that its\n\nprior merits rulings were \"'without prejudice' to reexamination in\n\nthe courts of the Commonwealth.\"   TJX says that this too was error.\n\nThe \"without prejudice\" label has different meanings in different\n\ncontexts, e.g., In re Sonus Networks, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202895\"><a href=\"/opinion/202895/in-re-sonus-networks-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 n.6 (1st\n\nCir. 2007); perhaps the district judge meant only that a transferee\n\ncourt can revisit its prior rulings in the same case.       Rio Mar\n\nAssocs., LP v. UHS of P.R., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 167 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           It would be quite another matter to decide a merits issue\n\nbut then purport to deprive the decision of res judicata effect in\n\nfuture cases--a matter governed by established rules. E.g., Ramallo\n\nBros. Printing, Inc. v. El Dia, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202805\"><a href=\"/opinion/202805/ramallo-brothers-v-el-dia-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nBut the \"without prejudice\" gloss here was commentary incident to\n\nthe transfer order and, as we are vacating that order and remanding\n\nthe case, we treat the characterization as falling with the order.\n\n           Accordingly, we affirm (1) the district court's dismissal\n\nof the negligence and breach of contract claims, (2) its denial of\n\nthe motion to amend the complaint, and (3) its sustaining of the\n\nnegligent misrepresentation claim (and use as a theory under chapter\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f93A, but without prejudice to a motion by defendants for summary\n\njudgment), but we vacate (4) its dismissal of the chapter 93A claim\n\nbased on the unfairness theory and (5) its transfer order and no-\n\nprejudice ruling, and we remand for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this decision.   Each party will bear its own costs on the\n\nappeal.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f</pre>",
