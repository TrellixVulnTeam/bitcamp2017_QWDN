García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                     and Fusté,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     William A.

This appeal is a sequel to\n\nevents that have already been litigated before this court. See Pan\n\nAm. Grain Mfg. Co., Inc. v. P.R. Ports Auth., 295 F.3d 108 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).   In that case we ruled that the loss of the integrated\n\ntug and barge ZORRA (\"ITB ZORRA\") came about because of the\n\nnegligence of its crew in straying from the charted navigation\n\nchannel, and not -- as claimed by the ITB ZORRA's owner, the Pan\n\nAmerican Grain Company (\"Pan American\") -- because of underwater\n\nobstructions in the docking area.1\n\n          The starting point to the present appeal, however, is the\n\nissuance of a marine hull insurance policy (\"the policy\") by\n\nplaintiff-appellant the Home Insurance Company (\"Home\") to Pan\n\nAmerican that provided coverage up to $6,500,000 in the event the\n\nITB ZORRA was lost as a result of any of a variety of casualties.\n\nPan American filed a claim on this policy for losses sustained when\n\nthe ITB ZORRA caught fire on April 24, 1995.       Home denied the\n\nclaim, alleging that the casualty was the result of the vessel's\n\nunseaworthiness,2 a condition which is excepted under the terms of\n\n\n1\n    The ITB ZORRA's propellers hit the embankment, and during\nattempts to extricate it, a fire broke out in the engine room,\nresulting in the loss of the vessel. See Pan Am. Grain, 295 F.3d\nat 113.\n2\n   A vessel is unseaworthy if it is not fit and \"is unable to\nwithstand the perils of an ordinary voyage.\" Black's Law Dictionary\n1539 (6th ed. 1990). This includes a vessel that is not manned by\na competent crew.    Id.; see also Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas\nCorp., 400 U.S. 494, 517 (1971) (listing \"unfit crew\" as one form\nof unseaworthiness).\n\n                                -2-\n\fthe policy.         Thereafter, Home filed suit seeking a declaratory\n\njudgment of non-coverage, to which Pan American responded with a\n\ncounterclaim seeking recovery under the policy for the full amount\n\nof $6,500,000, in addition to various other damages. The Home Ins.\n\nCo. v. Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co., Inc., No 95-1794 (D. P.R. Aug. 21,\n\n1995) (\"Answer and Counter-Claim\").                 Three years of litigation\n\nfollowed, at the end of which Home and Pan American entered into a\n\nsettlement agreement, The Home Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co.,\n\nInc.,   No   95-1794     (D.    P.R.   Apr.    30,    1998)     (\"H/P    Settlement\n\nAgreement\"), the interpretation of which is the central issue of\n\nthis appeal.3\n\n             Pursuant to the terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement,\n\nHome paid     Pan    American    $3,333,000     in    exchange    for    which   Pan\n\nAmerican agreed that Home would receive one third of any future\n\nrecovery     from    third   parties   by     Pan    American    until    Home   had\n\nrecovered $1,333,000, and one third of all additional Pan American\n\nrecoveries over a total of $10,000,000 until Home recouped its full\n\n$3,333,000.     H/P Settlement Agreement at para. 6.               At that time,\n\nPan American was immersed in several attempts to recover damages\n\nfor this casualty, including an arbitration proceeding in New York,\n\nfive additional lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico\n\n\n\n\n3\n    The pertinent parts of the H/P Settlement                      Agreement     are\nreproduced as Appendix I of this opinion.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fagainst various private parties, and an action against the U.S.\n\nCoast Guard in Miami.\n\n             The H/P Settlement Agreement further provided that until\n\nsuch time as Home recouped an initial sum of $1,333,000, Pan\n\nAmerican was required to notify Home of any proposed third party\n\nsettlement of ITB ZORRA claims, and to receive Home's written\n\napproval before effectuating any such settlement.              Id. at para. 7.\n\nHowever, once the first $1,333,000 were recovered by Home, although\n\nHome   was    entitled     to   share    in    additional    settlements     over\n\n$10,000,000, up to the $3,333,000 total paid to Pan American, prior\n\nnotice to Home and its approval were not required.\n\n             One further provision of the H/P Settlement Agreement is\n\nof relevance; indeed, it is at the crux of the present dispute:\n\nAlthough Home was to share in all recoveries of third party ITB\n\nZORRA claims up to the total paid by Home to Pan American, Home was\n\nnot entitled to share in any \"verdict or award in favor of Pan\n\nAmerican that specifically and separately award(s) Pan American a\n\nrecovery for punitive damages and/or loss of use.\"              Id. at para. 6\n\n(emphasis supplied).\n\n             Approximately one year after the parties entered into the\n\nH/P Settlement Agreement, Home learned that Pan American had\n\nsettled   one   of   its    outstanding       ITB   ZORRA   suits,   with   Ochoa\n\nFertilizer, Inc., for $800,000 (\"the Ochoa settlement\").                      Pan\n\nAmerican gave no prior notice of this settlement to Home, nor did\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fHome give approval for Pan American to enter into the Ochoa\n\nsettlement. Pan American claimed that the Ochoa settlement was for\n\ndamages for \"loss of use\" of the ITB ZORRA, and thus specifically\n\nexcluded from the H/P Settlement Agreement. Home, however, was not\n\nso easily put off.           It contended that, irrespective of the label\n\ngiven to the amounts recovered under the Ochoa agreement, these\n\nsums could not constitute a recovery for \"loss of use\" of the ITB\n\nZORRA,    since      under    maritime     law   a    shipowner      is   barred   from\n\nrecovering for loss of use where the insured vessel was a total\n\nloss,    as    was   the     case   of   the    ITB   ZORRA.      See     2   Thomas   J.\n\nSchoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law, § 14-6, at 118-119 (4th ed.\n\n2004) (\"Only in a partial loss situation is there liability for\n\n[loss of use] damages.\").                Home further alleged that the Ochoa\n\nsettlement was not the result of a \"verdict or award,\" and thus was\n\nalso not excluded from coverage of the H/P Settlement Agreement.\n\nHome therefore insisted on entitlement to one third of the $800,000\n\nOchoa settlement pursuant to the H/P Settlement Agreement, to be\n\ncredited towards the amounts Home had paid to Pan American.                            Pan\n\nAmerican rejected this demand and Home responded by filing this\n\naction,       seeking   to    recover     one    third   of    the   $800,000      Ochoa\n\nsettlement, plus interest and attorneys' fees.\n\n               In the course of the proceedings, Home filed for summary\n\njudgment alleging (1) breach of the H/P Settlement Agreement, and\n\n(2) fraudulent inducement of the H/P Settlement Agreement.                             Pan\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fAmerican cross-motioned on Home's claim of breach of the H/P\n\nSettlement     Agreement,    and   opposed      the   claim   of    fraudulent\n\ninducement, moving for summary judgment on both issues.\n\n             The motions were initially argued before a magistrate\n\njudge who ruled that there existed no genuine issues of material\n\nfact because the H/P Settlement Agreement was clear on its face as\n\nexcluding Home from recovering for damages for loss of use of the\n\nITB ZORRA.      Home Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain & Mfg. Co., Inc.,\n\nNo. 00-1184 (D. P.R. Apr. 19, 2002) (\"Report and Recommendation\").\n\nThus, the magistrate judge concluded that, as a matter of law, Pan\n\nAmerican did not breach the terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement\n\nwhen it failed to notify Home, or seek Home's approval, of the\n\nOchoa settlement.       The magistrate judge further found that the\n\nOchoa   settlement     constituted    an    \"award\"   because      it   was   \"an\n\nagreement granted by a formal process -- a mutually agreed upon\n\nresolution to negotiation bound by voluntary signatures of the\n\ninvolved parties.\"     Report and Recommendation at 7.          In so ruling,\n\nthe magistrate judge relied on Black's Law Dictionary, Pocket\n\nEdition 54 (Bryan Garner et al., ed. 1996), which defines \"award\"\n\nas \"to grant by formal process or by judicial decree.\"              See Report\n\nand   Recommendation    at   7.      The    magistrate   judge,    in   effect,\n\nconsidered that if the term \"award\" referred only to the result of\n\na formal judicial process, it would be redundant to the alternative\n\nterm, \"verdict,\" contained in the H/P Settlement Agreement, which\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\falso encompasses a judicial decision.        Id. at 7-8.     He thus found\n\nthat the Ochoa settlement was an \"award,\" and that therefore Home\n\nwas not entitled to share in that settlement under the terms of the\n\nH/P Settlement Agreement.           Additionally, the magistrate judge\n\ndecided that because the Ochoa settlement \"plainly states that the\n\npayment of $800,000 is to settle 'claims or future claims for loss\n\nof use of property,'\" id. at 10, the recovery of such damages was\n\nexcluded by the specific terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement.\n\n             The magistrate judge's reasoning and recommendation that\n\nsummary judgment be granted in favor of Pan American was adopted in\n\nessence by the district court, see Home Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain\n\n& Mfg. Co., Inc., 286 F. Supp. 2d 190 (D. P.R. 2003), and this\n\nappeal was taken from that decision.\n\n             The standard of review of a district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment is de novo.        Tum v. Barber Foods, Inc., 360 F.3d\n\n274,   279   (1st   Cir.   2004).    The   same   standard   of   review   is\n\napplicable to a district court's interpretation of a settlement\n\nagreement, because it essentially involves the revisiting of a\n\nquestion of law.     See Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &\n\nMarine Ins. Co., 311 F.3d 450, 451-52 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                      I.\n\n             We disagree with the district court's interpretation of\n\nthe term \"award.\"      Under Puerto Rican law, \"[i]f the terms of a\n\ncontract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fcontracting parties, the literal sense of its stipulations shall be\n\nobserved.\"         31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3471 (1991).                       This court has\n\nendorsed the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's conclusion that \"clear\"\n\nterms   are       those   that    \"in    themselves         are   lucid    enough   to   be\n\nunderstood in one sense alone, without leaving any room for doubt,\n\ncontroversies or difference of interpretation . . . .\" Heirs of\n\nRamírez v. Superior Court, 81 P.R.R. 347, 351 (1959) (internal\n\ncitation omitted), quoted in Catullo v. Metzner, 834 F.2d 1075,\n\n1079 (1st Cir. 1987); see also Borschow Hosp. & Med. Supplies, Inc.\n\nv.   César    Castillo,       Inc.,     96    F.3d    10,    15-16   (1st    Cir.   1996)\n\n(espousing same standard).                   Our disagreement with the district\n\ncourt about the meaning of \"award\" does not suggest that the term\n\nitself admits of ambiguity. It is our view that the interpretation\n\nbelow went beyond the clear meaning of the term as used in legal\n\nwriting      in    general,      and    in    the    H/P    Settlement     Agreement     in\n\nparticular, by misconstruing the voluntary settlement negotiation\n\nbetween parties as the kind of \"formal process\" referred to in the\n\nBlack's pocket edition definition.\n\n              Black's Law Dictionary 137 (6th ed. 1990) defines \"award\"\n\nin keeping with our understanding of what that term means in\n\neveryday legal parlance:\n\n              award, vb. To grant, concede or adjudge to.\n              To give or assign by sentence or judicial\n              determination or after careful weighing of\n              evidence.   Thus, a jury awards damages; the\n              court awards an injunction; one awards a\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\f          contract to a bidder.            To confer as being\n          deserved or merited.\n\n          award, n.     The decision or determination\n          rendered by arbitrators or commissioners, or\n          other private or extrajudicial deciders, upon\n          a controversy submitted to them; also the\n          writing or document embodying such decision.\n\n          Clearly, the Ochoa settlement does not come within the\n\ndefinition    of   \"award\"   when   used   as   a   noun,   as   it   is   not   a\n\nextrajudicial determination by third party decision makers such as\n\nwould be the case of an award by an arbitrator.             Furthermore, the\n\nOchoa settlement certainly is not a \"document embodying\" such a\n\ndecision. Rather, the Ochoa settlement is the product of a private\n\nnegotiation between parties to a lawsuit.            Neither does the Ochoa\n\nsettlement come within the principal definition of \"award\" when\n\nused as verb, which connotes judicial or quasi-judicial action\n\n\"after careful weighing of evidence.\"           Even the secondary meaning\n\nof its use as a verb, as \"[t]o confer as being deserved or\n\nmerited,\" which refers to events such as the granting of an honor,\n\ntitle, or medal, implies unilateral action by the grantor, rather\n\nthan a multi-party negotiation of the sort which takes place in the\n\nsettlement of a dispute.      Such a definition does not encompass the\n\nOchoa settlement.\n\n             Most important to our view, and a factor apparently not\n\nconsidered by the district court, is that it is difficult to\n\ncountenance that sophisticated parties such as those involved in\n\nthe H/P Settlement Agreement, represented by counsel, would not\n\n                                     -9-\n\fhave used the term \"settlement\" rather than \"award\" had they\n\nintended to also exclude negotiated settlements, as the term is\n\nnormally used,         from    the    H/P    Settlement       Agreement.       The   term\n\n\"settlement\"      is    well    known       to   attorneys,      and   its    meaning   is\n\ndistinctly different from what is normally understood to be meant\n\nby the term \"award.\"           See id. at 1372 (defining \"settlement\").\n\n            Indeed, the text of Paragraph (6) of the H/P Settlement\n\nAgreement, when read as a whole, further supports the common-sense\n\ninterpretation that an \"award\" is distinct from a \"settlement.\" It\n\nindicates that Home will obtain \"the lesser of $1,333,000 or one-\n\nthird of . . . [any] recovery made, whether obtained by way of\n\nsuit,    arbitration,          claim,       verdict,      award,       settlement,      or\n\notherwise,\" but excludes from such recoverable amounts only \"any\n\nverdict or award in favor of Pan American that specifically and\n\nseparately award(s) Pan American a recovery for punitive damages\n\nand/or loss of use.\" H/P Settlement Agreement at para. 6 (emphasis\n\nsupplied).        It then goes on to allow Home to also share in\n\nadditional       recoveries       \"whether         obtained       by   way     of    suit,\n\narbitration, claim, verdict, award, settlement, or otherwise, in\n\nexcess of $10,000,000 (excluding any recovery for punitive damages\n\nand/or loss of use as described above).\"                   Id. (emphasis supplied).\n\nThe    omission    of    \"settlement\"            from   the     description    of    those\n\nrecoveries of punitive damages and loss of use that are not subject\n\nto    sharing,    in    the    same   paragraph         where    the   term   was    twice\n\n\n                                            -10-\n\fexplicitly included elsewhere, strongly suggests a recognition that\n\nthe   types    of    recoveries    that   were    described    --    \"award\"      and\n\n\"verdict\" - do not themselves incorporate a settlement.\n\n              We have no doubt that the Ochoa settlement was not an\n\n\"award\" from which Home was excluded in participating under the H/P\n\nSettlement Agreement.\n\n                                       II.\n\n              The district court also erred in concluding that the\n\nOchoa settlement was excluded from the terms of the H/P Settlement\n\nAgreement as a recovery for loss of use of the ITB ZORRA.                      We are\n\ninevitably     led    to   this   conclusion     by   the   text    of   the    Ochoa\n\nsettlement itself.\n\n              As a result of a complaint filed against Ochoa and others\n\nin which Pan American claimed \"extensive fire damage to the tug\"\n\nand sought compensation for \"damages, losses, and expenses to the\n\ntug\" in the amount of $31,000,000, Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co. v.\n\nContinental Grain Co., Inc., No. 97-7748 (D. P.R. filed Aug. 19,\n\n1997), Ochoa entered into a settlement agreement with Pan American.\n\nThat agreement states, in relevant part:\n\n              1. SETTLEMENT. The undersigned, Pan American\n              . . ., for and in consideration of the payment\n              of $800,000, as more particularly described in\n              paragraph 2 below, . . .does hereby remise,\n              release and discharge . . .

[Pan\n           American] acknowledges that this SETTLEMENT\n           . . . is expressly intended to be a full and\n           complete settlement of all disputed claim(s)\n           made or which could be made between [Pan\n           American] and [Ochoa] arising out of the\n           April 24, 1995 incident described above\n           . . . .\n\nOchoa settlement at 3-4 (emphasis supplied).\n\n           The district court determined that a reading of Pan\n\nAmerican's   claims   against   Ochoa,   combined   with   the   Ochoa\n\nsettlement, did not provide \"sufficient evidence to determine that\n\nsaid agreement was not for loss of use.        On the contrary the\n\nsettlement agreement specifically states that it is in settlement\n\nof 'claims or future claims for loss of use of property.'\"        Home\n\nIns. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain & Mfg. Co., Inc., 286 F. Supp. 2d at 196-\n\n97.   This analysis leaves aside the contents of paragraphs 1 and 4\n\nof the Ochoa settlement, which make explicit that the $800,000 was\n\npaid in consideration not only for Ochoa's release from any claims\n\nof loss of use, but for its release from all possible claims, on\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fthe basis of any cause of action, which arose from the fire on the\n\nITB ZORRA.4   Thus, even were negotiated settlements for loss of use\n\n-- as opposed to verdicts or awards for loss of use -- excluded\n\nfrom the notice, approval, and sharing provisions of the H/P\n\nSettlement Agreement, the Ochoa settlement, insofar as it also\n\nsettled other claims, was not so excluded.\n\n                                III.\n\n          From the record before us it is clear that the Ochoa\n\nsettlement is neither an \"award\" nor a \"verdict.\"      Furthermore,\n\nirrespective of how the proceeds of that settlement may have been\n\nlabeled by Pan American, they cannot properly be construed as\n\nexclusively for loss of use of the ITB ZORRA.5\n\n          We thus must conclude that the district court erred in\n\nnot finding that Pan American breached the H/P Settlement Agreement\n\nwhen it failed to notify Home of the Ochoa settlement prior to\n\nentering into the same, and when it refused to share in the\n\n\n4\n   In this respect it is noteworthy that the claims Pan American\nfiled against Ochoa did not include a demand for damages for \"loss\nof use,\" but rather for \"damages, losses, and expenses to the tug.\"\n5\n  Indeed, there is little reason to believe that the proceeds have\nany connection to loss of use; we earlier described the event as\none in which the ITB ZORRA \"caught fire and thereafter was lost as\na result of the conflagration.\" See Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co., Inc.\nv. P.R. Ports Auth., 295 F.3d at 113. If the tub was a total loss,\nthen under maritime law there could be no recovery for loss of use,\nsee A & S Transp. Co., Inc. v. Tug Fajardo, 688 F.2d 1,2 (1st Cir.\n1982), and labeling any part of the payment as for loss of use\nwould be nothing more than an attempt on Pan Am's part to keep all\nof the Ochoa settlement by purporting to bring the payment within\nthe H/P Settlement Agreement.\n\n                                -13-\n\frecovered proceeds in the manner specified by the H/P Settlement\n\nAgreement.\n\n             We have considered all other arguments of the parties,\n\nand determined that they are without substance.\n\n             The judgment of the district court is reversed and the\n\ncase is remanded with instruction that judgment be entered on\n\nbehalf of Home, in the manner consistent with this opinion.\n\n             Considering that this is an action brought pursuant to\n\nour diversity jurisdiction, Home shall be entitled to recover\n\nreasonable attorney fees and costs.\n\n             Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f                            Appendix I\n\n          (6) Pan American and/or the ZORRA and/or Zorra Transport\nInc.(\"Zorra Transport\") will pay The Home the lesser of $1,333,000\nor one third of the gross aggregate recovery made, whether obtained\nby way of suit, arbitration, claim, verdict, award, settlement, or\notherwise, from or against any and all person(s) for damage to Pan\nAmerican and/or the ZORRA, and/or Zorra Transport arising out of or\nrelating to the Fire, excluding only that portion, if any, of any\nverdict or award in favor of Pan American that specifically and\nseparately award(s) Pan American a recovery for punitive damages\nand/or loss of use. If Pan American and/or the ZORRA and/or Zorra\nTransport make a gross aggregate recovery, whether obtained by way\nof suit, arbitration, claim, verdict, award, settlement, or\notherwise, in excess of $10,000,000,(excluding any recovery for\npunitive damages and/or loss of use as described above) then Pan\nAmerican and/or the ZORRA and/or Zorra Transport will pay The Home\none-third of any gross amount in excess of $10,000,000 up to\n$2,000,000, in addition to the above $1,333,000.\n\n          (7) The Home's written approval of any settlement by Pan\nAmerican and/or the ZORRA and/or Zorra transport of any claim\nagainst any person for damage arising out of or relating to the the\nFire, out of which The Home is to receive all or part of the above\namount of $1,333,000 is a condition precedent to any agreement to\nany such settlement. The Home agrees that it will not unreasonably\nwithhold its written approval. The Home's approval is not a\ncondition precedent to any settlement out of which The Home is not\nto receive any part of the above amount of $1,333,000.\n\n          (8) Prior to requesting any required approval from The\nHome of any settlement, and prior to agreeing to any settlement or\nsatisfaction of any judgment or award out of which The Home is to\nmake a recovery under this agreement, Pan American will advise the\nprospective settling or paying party that The Home has an economic\ninterest in the settlement or satisfaction if Pan American and The\nHome jointly agree that such information will maximize the recovery\nor will obtain some other mutually advantageous result. The payment\nof any such settlement or satisfaction shall be made by check(s) or\nbank draft(s) made payable to both Pan American and The Home. In\nthe event the information is not disclosed, Pan American agrees and\nundertakes that payment of any settlement or satisfaction shall be\nmade by check(s), bank draft(s), or wire transfer(s) to Chaffe,\nMcCall, Phillips, Toler & Sarpy, L.L.P., as attorneys for Pan\nAmerican Grain Manufacturing Co., Inc., and that such funds will be\nheld in trust or escrow by Chaffe McCall, to be disbursed pursuant\nto the terms and conditions of this agreement only after\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fdisbursement has been agreed to, approved, and authorized in\nwriting to Chaffe McCall by Pan American and The Home.\n\n\n\n\n                            -16-\n\f",

Grain Mfg. Co., Inc. v. P.R. Ports Auth.,</i> 295 F.3d 108 (1st Cir.2002). In that case we ruled that the loss of the integrated tug and barge ZORRA (\"ITB ZORRA\") came about because of the negligence of its crew in straying from the charted navigation channel, and not &#8212; as claimed by the ITB ZORRA's owner, the Pan American Grain Company (\"Pan American\") &#8212; because of underwater obstructions in the docking area.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The starting point to the present appeal, however, is the issuance of a marine hull insurance policy (\"the policy\") by plaintiff-appellant the Home Insurance Company (\"Home\") to Pan American that provided coverage up to $6,500,000 in the event the ITB ZORRA was lost as a result of any of a variety of casualties. Pan American filed a claim on this policy for losses sustained when the ITB ZORRA caught fire on April 24, 1995. Home denied the claim, alleging that the casualty was the result of the vessel's unseaworthiness,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> a condition which is excepted under the terms of the policy. Thereafter, Home filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment of non-coverage, to which Pan American responded with a counterclaim seeking recovery under the policy for the full amount of $6,500,000, in addition to various other damages. <i>The Home Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co., Inc.,</i> No 95-1794 (D.P.R. Aug. 21, 1995) (\"Answer and Counter-Claim\"). Three years of litigation followed, at the end of which Home and Pan American entered into a settlement agreement, <i>The Home Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co., Inc.,</i> No 95-1794 (D.P.R. Apr. 30, 1998) (\"H/P Settlement Agreement\"), the interpretation of which is the central issue of this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement, Home paid Pan American $3,333,000 in exchange for which Pan American agreed that Home would receive one third of any future recovery from third parties by Pan American until Home had recovered $1,333,000, and one third of all additional Pan American recoveries over a total of $10,000,000 until Home recouped its full $3,333,000. H/P Settlement Agreement at para. 6. At that time, Pan American was immersed in several attempts to recover damages for this casualty, including an arbitration proceeding in New York, five additional lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico against various private parties, and an action against the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The H/P Settlement Agreement further provided that until such time as Home recouped an initial sum of $1,333,000, Pan American was required to notify Home of any proposed third party settlement of ITB ZORRA claims, and to receive Home's written approval before effectuating any such settlement. <i>Id.</i> at para. 7. However, once the first $1,333,000 were recovered by Home, although Home was entitled to share in additional settlements over $10,000,000, up to the $3,333,000 total paid to Pan American, prior notice to Home and its approval were not required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One further provision of the H/P Settlement Agreement is of relevance; indeed, it is at the crux of the present dispute: Although Home was to share in all recoveries of third party ITB ZORRA claims up to the total paid by Home to Pan American, Home was not entitled to share in any \"<i>verdict or award</i> in favor of Pan American that specifically and separately award(s) Pan American a recovery for punitive damages and/or <i>loss of use.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at para. 6 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately one year after the parties entered into the H/P Settlement Agreement, Home learned that Pan American had settled one of its outstanding ITB ZORRA suits, with Ochoa Fertilizer, Inc., for $800,000 (\"the Ochoa settlement\"). Pan American gave no prior notice of this settlement to Home, nor did Home give approval for Pan American to enter into the Ochoa settlement. Pan American claimed that the Ochoa settlement was for damages for \"loss of use\" of the ITB ZORRA, and thus specifically excluded from the H/P Settlement Agreement. Home, however, was not so easily put off. It contended that, irrespective of the label given to the amounts recovered under the Ochoa agreement, these sums could not constitute a recovery for \"loss of use\" of the ITB ZORRA, since under maritime law a shipowner is barred from recovering for loss of use where the insured vessel was a total loss, as was the case of the ITB ZORRA. <i>See</i> 2 Thomas J. Schoenbaum, <i>Admiralty and Maritime Law,</i> &#167; 14-6, at 118-119 (4th ed. 2004) (\"Only in a partial loss situation is there liability for [loss of use] damages.\"). Home further alleged that the Ochoa settlement was not the result of a \"verdict or award,\" and thus was also not excluded from coverage of the H/P Settlement Agreement. Home therefore insisted on entitlement to one third of the $800,000 Ochoa settlement pursuant to the H/P Settlement Agreement, to be credited towards the amounts Home had paid to Pan American. Pan American rejected this demand and Home responded by filing this action, seeking to recover one third of the $800,000 Ochoa settlement, plus interest and attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of the proceedings, Home filed for summary judgment alleging (1) breach of the H/P Settlement Agreement, and (2) fraudulent inducement of the H/P Settlement Agreement. Pan American cross-motioned on Home's claim of breach of the H/P Settlement Agreement, and opposed the claim of fraudulent inducement, moving for summary judgment on both issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motions were initially argued before a magistrate judge who ruled that there existed no genuine issues of material fact because the H/P Settlement Agreement was clear on its face as excluding Home from recovering for damages for loss of use of the ITB ZORRA. <i>Home Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc.,</i> No. 00-1184 (D.P.R. Apr. 19, 2002) (\"Report and Recommendation\"). Thus, the magistrate judge concluded that, as a matter of law, Pan American did not breach the terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement when it failed to notify Home, or seek Home's approval, of the Ochoa settlement. The magistrate judge further found that the Ochoa settlement constituted an \"award\" because it was \"an agreement granted by a formal process &#8212; a mutually agreed upon resolution to negotiation bound by voluntary signatures of the involved parties.\" Report and Recommendation at 7. In so ruling, the magistrate judge relied on <i>Black's Law Dictionary, Pocket Edition</i> 54 (Bryan Garner et al., ed.1996), which defines \"award\" as \"to grant by formal process or by judicial decree.\" <i>See</i> Report and Recommendation at 7. The magistrate judge, in effect, considered that if the term \"award\" referred only to the result of a formal judicial process, it would be redundant to the alternative term, \"verdict,\" contained in the H/P Settlement Agreement, which also encompasses a judicial decision. <i>Id.</i> at 7-8. He thus found that the Ochoa settlement was an \"award,\" and that therefore Home was not entitled to share in that settlement under the terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement. Additionally, the magistrate judge decided that because the Ochoa settlement \"plainly states that the payment of $800,000 is to settle `claims or future claims for loss of use of property,'\" <i>id.</i> at 10, the recovery of such damages was excluded by the specific terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge's reasoning and recommendation that summary judgment be granted in favor of Pan American was adopted in essence by the district court, <i>see Home Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc.,</i> 286 F.Supp.2d 190 (D.P.R.2003), and this appeal was taken from that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review of a district court's grant of summary judgment is <i>de novo. Tum v. Barber Foods, Inc.,</i> 360 F.3d 274, 279 (1st Cir.2004). The same standard of review is applicable to a district court's interpretation of a settlement agreement, because it essentially involves the revisiting of a question of law. <i>See Alternative Energy, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> 311 F.3d 450, 451-52 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the district court's interpretation of the term \"award.\" Under Puerto Rican law, \"[i]f the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intentions of the contracting parties, the literal sense of its stipulations shall be observed.\" 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 3471 (1991). This court has endorsed the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's conclusion that \"clear\" terms are those that \"in themselves are lucid enough to be understood in one sense alone, without leaving any room for doubt, controversies or difference of interpretation....\" <i>Heirs of Ram&#237;rez v. Superior Court,</i> 81 P.R.R. 347, 351 (1959) (internal citation omitted), <i>quoted in Catullo v. Metzner,</i> 834 F.2d 1075, 1079 (1st Cir.1987); <i>see also Borschow Hosp. &amp; Med. Supplies, Inc. v. C&#233;sar Castillo, Inc.,</i> 96 F.3d 10, 15-16 (1st Cir.1996) (espousing same standard). Our disagreement with the district court about the meaning of \"award\" does not suggest that the term itself admits of ambiguity. It is our view that the interpretation below went beyond the clear meaning of the term as used in legal writing in general, and in the H/P Settlement Agreement in particular, by misconstruing the voluntary settlement negotiation between parties as the kind of \"formal process\" referred to in the Black's pocket edition definition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 137 (6th ed.1990) defines \"award\" in keeping with our understanding of what that term means in everyday legal parlance:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">award, <i>vb.</i> To grant, concede or adjudge to. To give or assign by sentence or judicial determination or after careful weighing of evidence. Thus, a jury <i>awards</i> damages; the court <i>awards</i> an injunction; one <i>awards</i> a contract to a bidder. To confer as being deserved or merited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">award, <i>n.</i> The decision or determination rendered by arbitrators or commissioners, or other private or extrajudicial deciders, upon a controversy submitted to them; also the writing or document embodying such decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, the Ochoa settlement does not come within the definition of \"award\" when used as a noun, as it is not a extrajudicial determination by third party decision makers such as would be the case of an award by an arbitrator. Furthermore, the Ochoa settlement certainly is not a \"document embodying\" such a decision. Rather, the Ochoa settlement is the product of a private negotiation between parties to a lawsuit. Neither does the Ochoa settlement come within the principal definition of \"award\" when used as verb, which connotes judicial or quasi-judicial action \"after careful weighing of evidence.\" Even the secondary meaning of its use as a verb, as \"[t]o confer as being deserved or merited,\" which refers to events such as the granting of an honor, title, or medal, implies unilateral action by the grantor, rather than a multi-party negotiation of the sort which takes place in the settlement of a dispute. Such a definition does not encompass the Ochoa settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most important to our view, and a factor apparently not considered by the district court, is that it is difficult to countenance that sophisticated parties such as those involved in the H/P Settlement Agreement, represented by counsel, would not have used the term \"settlement\" rather than \"award\" had they intended to also exclude negotiated settlements, as the term is normally used, from the H/P Settlement Agreement. The term \"settlement\" is well known to attorneys, and its meaning is distinctly different from what is normally understood to be meant by the term \"award.\" <i>See id.</i> at 1372 (defining \"settlement\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the text of Paragraph (6) of the H/P Settlement Agreement, when read as a whole, further supports the common-sense interpretation that an \"award\" is distinct from a \"settlement.\" It indicates that Home will obtain \"the lesser of $1,333,000 or one-third of ... [any] recovery made, whether obtained by way of suit, arbitration, claim, <i>verdict, award, settlement,</i> or otherwise,\" but excludes from such recoverable amounts only \"any <i>verdict</i> or <i>award</i> in favor of Pan American that specifically and separately award(s) Pan American a recovery for punitive damages and/or loss of use.\" H/P Settlement Agreement at para. 6 (emphasis supplied). It then goes on to allow Home to also share in additional recoveries \"whether obtained by way of suit, arbitration, claim, <i>verdict, award, settlement,</i> or otherwise, in excess of $10,000,000 (excluding any recovery for punitive damages and/or loss of use <i>as described above</i>).\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied). The omission of \"settlement\" from the description of those recoveries of punitive damages and loss of use that are not subject to sharing, in the same paragraph where the term was twice explicitly included elsewhere, strongly suggests a recognition that the types of recoveries that <i>were</i> described &#8212; \"award\" and \"verdict\" &#8212; do not themselves incorporate a settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no doubt that the Ochoa settlement was not an \"award\" from which Home was excluded in participating under the H/P Settlement Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also erred in concluding that the Ochoa settlement was excluded from the terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement as a recovery for loss of use of the ITB ZORRA. We are inevitably led to this conclusion by the text of the Ochoa settlement itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of a complaint filed against Ochoa and others in which Pan American claimed \"extensive fire damage to the tug\" and sought compensation for \"damages, losses, and expenses to the tug\" in the amount of $31,000,000, <i>Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co. v. Continental Grain Co., Inc.,</i> No. 97-7748 (D.P.R. filed Aug. 19, 1997), Ochoa entered into a settlement agreement with Pan American.

In that case we ruled that the loss of the integrated tug and barge ZORRA (\"ITB ZORRA\") came about because of the negligence of its crew in straying from the charted navigation channel, and not &#8212; as claimed by the ITB ZORRA's owner, the Pan American Grain Company (\"Pan American\") &#8212; because of underwater obstructions in the docking area.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The starting point to the present appeal, however, is the issuance of a marine hull insurance policy (\"the policy\") by plaintiff-appellant the Home Insurance Company (\"Home\") to Pan American that provided coverage up to $6,500,000 in the event the ITB ZORRA was lost as a result of any of a variety of casualties. Pan American filed a claim on this policy for losses sustained when the ITB ZORRA caught fire on April 24, 1995. Home denied the claim, alleging that the casualty was the result of the vessel's unseaworthiness,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> a condition which is excepted under the terms of the policy. Thereafter, Home filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment of non-coverage, to which Pan American responded with a counterclaim seeking recovery under the policy for the full amount of $6,500,000, in addition to various other damages. <i>The Home Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co., Inc.,</i> No 95-1794 (D.P.R. Aug. 21, 1995) (\"Answer and Counter-Claim\"). Three years of litigation followed, at the end of which Home and Pan American entered into a settlement agreement, <i>The Home Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co., Inc.,</i> No 95-1794 (D.P.R. Apr. 30, 1998) (\"H/P Settlement Agreement\"), the interpretation of which is the central issue of this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement, Home paid Pan American $3,333,000 in exchange for which Pan American agreed that Home would receive one third of any future recovery from third parties by Pan American until Home had recovered $1,333,000, and one third of all additional Pan American recoveries over a total of $10,000,000 until Home recouped its full $3,333,000. H/P Settlement Agreement at para. 6. At that time, Pan American was immersed in several attempts to recover damages for this casualty, including an arbitration proceeding in New York, five additional lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico against various private parties, and an action against the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The H/P Settlement Agreement further provided that until such time as Home recouped an initial sum of $1,333,000, Pan American was required to notify Home of any proposed third party settlement of ITB ZORRA claims, and to receive Home's written approval before effectuating any such settlement. <i>Id.</i> at para. 7. However, once the first $1,333,000 were recovered by Home, although Home was entitled to share in additional settlements over $10,000,000, up to the $3,333,000 total paid to Pan American, prior notice to Home and its approval were not required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One further provision of the H/P Settlement Agreement is of relevance; indeed, it is at the crux of the present dispute: Although Home was to share in all recoveries of third party ITB ZORRA claims up to the total paid by Home to Pan American, Home was not entitled to share in any \"<i>verdict or award</i> in favor of Pan American that specifically and separately award(s) Pan American a recovery for punitive damages and/or <i>loss of use.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at para. 6 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately one year after the parties entered into the H/P Settlement Agreement, Home learned that Pan American had settled one of its outstanding ITB ZORRA suits, with Ochoa Fertilizer, Inc., for $800,000 (\"the Ochoa settlement\"). Pan American gave no prior notice of this settlement to Home, nor did Home give approval for Pan American to enter into the Ochoa settlement. Pan American claimed that the Ochoa settlement was for damages for \"loss of use\" of the ITB ZORRA, and thus specifically excluded from the H/P Settlement Agreement. Home, however, was not so easily put off. It contended that, irrespective of the label given to the amounts recovered under the Ochoa agreement, these sums could not constitute a recovery for \"loss of use\" of the ITB ZORRA, since under maritime law a shipowner is barred from recovering for loss of use where the insured vessel was a total loss, as was the case of the ITB ZORRA. <i>See</i> 2 Thomas J. Schoenbaum, <i>Admiralty and Maritime Law,</i> &#167; 14-6, at 118-119 (4th ed. 2004) (\"Only in a partial loss situation is there liability for [loss of use] damages.\"). Home further alleged that the Ochoa settlement was not the result of a \"verdict or award,\" and thus was also not excluded from coverage of the H/P Settlement Agreement. Home therefore insisted on entitlement to one third of the $800,000 Ochoa settlement pursuant to the H/P Settlement Agreement, to be credited towards the amounts Home had paid to Pan American. Pan American rejected this demand and Home responded by filing this action, seeking to recover one third of the $800,000 Ochoa settlement, plus interest and attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of the proceedings, Home filed for summary judgment alleging (1) breach of the H/P Settlement Agreement, and (2) fraudulent inducement of the H/P Settlement Agreement. Pan American cross-motioned on Home's claim of breach of the H/P Settlement Agreement, and opposed the claim of fraudulent inducement, moving for summary judgment on both issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motions were initially argued before a magistrate judge who ruled that there existed no genuine issues of material fact because the H/P Settlement Agreement was clear on its face as excluding Home from recovering for damages for loss of use of the ITB ZORRA. <i>Home Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc.,</i> No. 00-1184 (D.P.R. Apr. 19, 2002) (\"Report and Recommendation\"). Thus, the magistrate judge concluded that, as a matter of law, Pan American did not breach the terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement when it failed to notify Home, or seek Home's approval, of the Ochoa settlement. The magistrate judge further found that the Ochoa settlement constituted an \"award\" because it was \"an agreement granted by a formal process &#8212; a mutually agreed upon resolution to negotiation bound by voluntary signatures of the involved parties.\" Report and Recommendation at 7. In so ruling, the magistrate judge relied on <i>Black's Law Dictionary, Pocket Edition</i> 54 (Bryan Garner et al., ed.1996), which defines \"award\" as \"to grant by formal process or by judicial decree.\" <i>See</i> Report and Recommendation at 7. The magistrate judge, in effect, considered that if the term \"award\" referred only to the result of a formal judicial process, it would be redundant to the alternative term, \"verdict,\" contained in the H/P Settlement Agreement, which also encompasses a judicial decision. <i>Id.</i> at 7-8. He thus found that the Ochoa settlement was an \"award,\" and that therefore Home was not entitled to share in that settlement under the terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement. Additionally, the magistrate judge decided that because the Ochoa settlement \"plainly states that the payment of $800,000 is to settle `claims or future claims for loss of use of property,'\" <i>id.</i> at 10, the recovery of such damages was excluded by the specific terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge's reasoning and recommendation that summary judgment be granted in favor of Pan American was adopted in essence by the district court, <i>see Home Ins.

Our disagreement with the district court about the meaning of \"award\" does not suggest that the term itself admits of ambiguity. It is our view that the interpretation below went beyond the clear meaning of the term as used in legal writing in general, and in the H/P Settlement Agreement in particular, by misconstruing the voluntary settlement negotiation between parties as the kind of \"formal process\" referred to in the Black's pocket edition definition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 137 (6th ed.1990) defines \"award\" in keeping with our understanding of what that term means in everyday legal parlance:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">award, <i>vb.</i> To grant, concede or adjudge to. To give or assign by sentence or judicial determination or after careful weighing of evidence. Thus, a jury <i>awards</i> damages; the court <i>awards</i> an injunction; one <i>awards</i> a contract to a bidder. To confer as being deserved or merited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">award, <i>n.</i> The decision or determination rendered by arbitrators or commissioners, or other private or extrajudicial deciders, upon a controversy submitted to them; also the writing or document embodying such decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, the Ochoa settlement does not come within the definition of \"award\" when used as a noun, as it is not a extrajudicial determination by third party decision makers such as would be the case of an award by an arbitrator. Furthermore, the Ochoa settlement certainly is not a \"document embodying\" such a decision. Rather, the Ochoa settlement is the product of a private negotiation between parties to a lawsuit. Neither does the Ochoa settlement come within the principal definition of \"award\" when used as verb, which connotes judicial or quasi-judicial action \"after careful weighing of evidence.\" Even the secondary meaning of its use as a verb, as \"[t]o confer as being deserved or merited,\" which refers to events such as the granting of an honor, title, or medal, implies unilateral action by the grantor, rather than a multi-party negotiation of the sort which takes place in the settlement of a dispute. Such a definition does not encompass the Ochoa settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most important to our view, and a factor apparently not considered by the district court, is that it is difficult to countenance that sophisticated parties such as those involved in the H/P Settlement Agreement, represented by counsel, would not have used the term \"settlement\" rather than \"award\" had they intended to also exclude negotiated settlements, as the term is normally used, from the H/P Settlement Agreement. The term \"settlement\" is well known to attorneys, and its meaning is distinctly different from what is normally understood to be meant by the term \"award.\" <i>See id.</i> at 1372 (defining \"settlement\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the text of Paragraph (6) of the H/P Settlement Agreement, when read as a whole, further supports the common-sense interpretation that an \"award\" is distinct from a \"settlement.\" It indicates that Home will obtain \"the lesser of $1,333,000 or one-third of ... [any] recovery made, whether obtained by way of suit, arbitration, claim, <i>verdict, award, settlement,</i> or otherwise,\" but excludes from such recoverable amounts only \"any <i>verdict</i> or <i>award</i> in favor of Pan American that specifically and separately award(s) Pan American a recovery for punitive damages and/or loss of use.\" H/P Settlement Agreement at para. 6 (emphasis supplied). It then goes on to allow Home to also share in additional recoveries \"whether obtained by way of suit, arbitration, claim, <i>verdict, award, settlement,</i> or otherwise, in excess of $10,000,000 (excluding any recovery for punitive damages and/or loss of use <i>as described above</i>).\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied). The omission of \"settlement\" from the description of those recoveries of punitive damages and loss of use that are not subject to sharing, in the same paragraph where the term was twice explicitly included elsewhere, strongly suggests a recognition that the types of recoveries that <i>were</i> described &#8212; \"award\" and \"verdict\" &#8212; do not themselves incorporate a settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no doubt that the Ochoa settlement was not an \"award\" from which Home was excluded in participating under the H/P Settlement Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also erred in concluding that the Ochoa settlement was excluded from the terms of the H/P Settlement Agreement as a recovery for loss of use of the ITB ZORRA. We are inevitably led to this conclusion by the text of the Ochoa settlement itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of a complaint filed against Ochoa and others in which Pan American claimed \"extensive fire damage to the tug\" and sought compensation for \"damages, losses, and expenses to the tug\" in the amount of $31,000,000, <i>Pan Am. Grain Mfg. Co. v. Continental Grain Co., Inc.,</i> No. 97-7748 (D.P.R. filed Aug. 19, 1997), Ochoa entered into a settlement agreement with Pan American. That agreement states, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>SETTLEMENT.</i> The undersigned, Pan American ..., for and in consideration of the payment of $800,000, as more particularly described in paragraph 2 below, ... does hereby remise, release and discharge ... [Ochoa] ... of and from <i>all</i> actions, causes of action, suits, claims, damages, covenants, contracts, agreements, judgments, costs and demands, whatsoever in law or in equity, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, known or unknown, accrued or not accrued, in connection with the incident that occurred on the 24th day of April, 1995, ... which allegedly caused loss of use of property <i>and damage to property</i> of [Pan American]....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>PAYMENT TO RELEASING PARTY.</i> By express agreement of the parties hereto, the $800,000 payment made by the [Pan American] ... is allocated ... in settlement of [Ochoa's] claims or future claims for loss of use of property</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>FULL AND COMPLETE SETTLEMENT.</i> [Pan American] acknowledges that this SETTLEMENT ... is expressly intended to be a <i>full and complete settlement of all disputed claim(s) made or which could be made</i> between [Pan American] and [Ochoa] arising out of the April 24, 1995 incident described above....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ochoa settlement at 3-4 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that a reading of Pan American's claims against Ochoa, combined with the Ochoa settlement, did not provide \"sufficient evidence to determine that said agreement was not for loss of use. On the contrary the settlement agreement specifically states that it is in settlement of `claims or future claims for loss of use of property.'\" <i>Home Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Grain &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc.,</i> 286 F.Supp.2d at 196-97. This analysis leaves aside the contents of paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Ochoa settlement, which make explicit that the $800,000 was paid in consideration not only for Ochoa's release from any claims of loss of use, but for its release from <i>all</i> possible claims, on the basis of any cause of action, which arose from the fire on the ITB ZORRA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, even were negotiated settlements for loss of use &#8212; as opposed to verdicts or awards for loss of use &#8212; excluded from the notice, approval, and sharing provisions of the H/P Settlement Agreement, the Ochoa settlement, insofar as it also settled other claims, was not so excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the record before us it is clear that the Ochoa settlement is neither an \"award\" nor a \"verdict.\" Furthermore, irrespective of how the proceeds of that settlement may have been labeled by Pan American, they cannot properly be construed as exclusively for loss of use of the ITB ZORRA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus must conclude that the district court erred in not finding that Pan American breached the H/P Settlement Agreement when it failed to notify Home of the Ochoa settlement prior to entering into the same, and when it refused to share in the recovered proceeds in the manner specified by the H/P Settlement Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered all other arguments of the parties, and determined that they are without substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded with instruction that judgment be entered on behalf of Home, in the manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering that this is an action brought pursuant to our diversity jurisdiction, Home shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Appendix I</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) Pan American and/or the ZORRA and/or Zorra Transport Inc.(\"Zorra Transport\") will pay The Home the lesser of $1,333,000 or one third of the gross aggregate recovery made, whether obtained by way of suit, arbitration, claim, verdict, award, settlement, or otherwise, from or against any and all person(s) for damage to Pan American and/or the ZORRA, and/or Zorra Transport arising out of or relating to the Fire, excluding only that portion, if any, of any verdict or award in favor of Pan American that specifically and separately award(s) Pan American a recovery for punitive damages and/or loss of use.
