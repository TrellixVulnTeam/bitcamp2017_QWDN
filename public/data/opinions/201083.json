Raymond L. Acosta, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Miguel A. Rivera-Santiago on brief pro se.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-Sosa,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Sonia I. Torres-Pabon, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              June 25, 2004\n\f           Per Curiam.   Appellant Miguel Rivera-Santiago was\n\nconvicted of drug offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nHe appeals pro se from a district court order that denied his\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion. See Rivera-Santiago v. United States,\n\n219 F. Supp. 2d 186 (D.P.R. 2002).   The district court granted\n\nappellant a certificate appealability (COA) on an issue which\n\nthe parties have interpreted differently in their respective\n\nbriefs.   We interpret the issue as being whether the district\n\ncourt erred in failing to address the following constitutional\n\nclaims:\n\n           (1) that a conflict of interest arose from\n           the defense attorneys' fee arrangement,\n\n           (2) that due to this conflict of interest,\n           appellant's counsel failed to relay the\n           government's plea offer to him,\n\n           (3) that appellant's sentence violates\n           Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n           (2000), and\n\n           (4)   that   defense   counsel    rendered\n           ineffective assistance by failing to argue\n           properly Rivera's Rule 29(c) motion for\n           acquittal.\n\n           At the outset, we put to one side the third and\n\nfourth of these constitutional claims. The Apprendi issue that\n\nRivera seeks to raise is barred by Sepulveda v. United States,\n\n330 F.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir. 2003).     The ineffective assistance\n\nclaim in paragraph (4), although encompassed by the COA, was\n\nnot raised by Rivera in the district court and so we decline to\n\n\n                              -2-\n\faddress it.   See David v. United States, 134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n            The conflict of interest claim set forth in the first\n\ntwo   paragraphs   was       expressed    in    vague   terms   in    Rivera's\n\noriginal pro se section 2255 petition and more fully elaborated\n\nin his first motion to amend that petition.             In its ruling, the\n\ndistrict court asserted that this motion to amend had been\n\ndenied, and Rivera on this appeal claims that the denial was\n\nitself error; but so far as we can tell, the district court\n\nnever ruled on the motion to amend one way or the other; there\n\nis certainly no docket entry reflecting a denial of the motion.\n\n            A party is ordinarily entitled to amend his initial\n\ncomplaint   once   as    a    matter     of   right   before    a   responsive\n\npleading is filed, see Acosta-Mestre v. Hilton Intern. of\n\nPuerto Rico, 158 F.3d 49, 51 (1st Cir. 1998), and we have\n\npreviously assumed without deciding that this applied as well\n\nto a motion under section 2255.               See Rogers v. United States,\n\n180 F.3d 349, 356 (1st Cir. 1999); 1 Liebman and Hertz, Federal\n\nHabeas Corpus Practice and Procedure, §17.2, at 730 (4th ed.\n\n2001).   Since in this case the motion to amend seemingly did no\n\nmore than flesh out a basic conflict of interest claim already\n\nmade in the petition itself, it is unclear why the district\n\njudge would have denied the motion to amend.               And, of course,\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fno reason has been given for such a denial, there being no\n\ndenial reflected in the record.\n\n             Curiously, the district court itself correctly noted\n\nthat a \"conflict of interest among counsel\" was one of several\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claims made by Rivera in his\n\noriginal section 2255 petition.            See 219 F. Supp. 2d at 190.\n\nYet the district court did not address or resolve this claim in\n\nits own decision.       If we were satisfied that the claim was\n\nwithout merit, we would nevertheless affirm without requiring\n\na remand.    But on the present record it appears to us possible\n\nthat there may have been a conflict of interest and also that\n\nit is possible (although far from certain) that Rivera can show\n\nthat it affected counsel’s performance.\n\n             The gist of the conflict claim derives from Rivera's\n\nassertion that his own lawyer and several other defense counsel\n\nwere paid their fees by counsel for one of the other co-\n\ndefendants and that this was done on the express condition that\n\nthe parties present a unified defense and not testify at trial.\n\nAnother co-defendant made similar allegations and in allowing\n\na   motion   for    judgment   for   acquittal,    the   district   court\n\nindicated that it would have granted a motion for a new trial\n\nbased   on   such   conflict   if    the   court   had   not   ordered   an\n\nacquittal.    We do not know whether the allegation is true, nor\n\nare we prepared to say whether there was or was not a conflict\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f  of interest in whatever arrangement existed; but the claim\n\n  cannot be casually disregarded.\n\n              Another question with no clear answer on this record\n\n  is whether such a conflict, if it existed, adversely affected\n\n  counsel's    performance.     Under    governing   Supreme   Court\n\n  precedent, prejudice is automatic if a defendant has no counsel\n\n  at all, see Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 166 (2002); but\n\n  where the claim is that counsel labored under the burden of\n\n  dual allegiance, the defendant who raised no objection at trial\n\n  must demonstrate that counsel might plausibly have pursued an\n\n  alternative defense strategy that counsel forsook because of\n\n  his conflicting loyalties, see, e.g., Familia-Consoro v. United\n\n  States, 160 F.3d 761, 764 (1st Cir. 1998).1\n\n              In   this   instance,     Rivera's   second   numbered\n\n  constitutional claim, listed above, says that his own counsel\n\n  failed to relay to him a government plea offer.      Although the\n\n  record on this point is unclear, there is a suggestion that an\n\n\n\n     1\n      Rivera raised no conflict of interest objection at trial nor\non direct appeal based on the alleged fee arrangement, which does\nnot in itself bar its presentation in a section 2255 motion. See\nMassaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 509 (2003); United States\nv. Burgos-Chaparro, 309 F.3d 50, 51 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied,\n537 U.S. 1135 (2003). However, in the district court there was\nsome inquiry into whether Rivera’s counsel should withdraw because\nhe shared office space with a co-defendant’s attorney.         The\ndistrict court found that the office arrangement posed no conflict\nof interest, and we regard the issue as outside the scope of the\ncertificate of appealability, or, alternatively, as waived for\nfailure to raise in Rivera’s opening brief.\n\n                                 -5-\n\finvestigator for another defendant interviewed Rivera's defense\n\ncounsel who confirmed that such an offer had been made by the\n\ngovernment for a plea with a ten-year sentence.     See Aff. of\n\nRivera, D.E. # 20, ¶ 16.   Rivera denied that any such offer was\n\nrelayed to him, see id., although there may be conflicting\n\nevidence on this issue.\n\n          Rivera makes two other claims at different points as\n\nto adverse effects of the supposed conflict:     one is that he\n\nwas prevented from testifying because of the conflict although\n\nhe wished to do so, and the other is that based on the alleged\n\nfee agreement, his own counsel failed to move for a severance.\n\nThis latter claim is less impressive since such severances are\n\nvery rarely granted.   So even assuming that Rivera would have\n\nbeen better off in a severed trial, this may not have been a\n\nplausible strategy.\n\n          In all events, at least two of the three claims of\n\nadverse effect are sufficiently colorable--although the facts\n\nmay not bear them out--to prevent us from summarily affirming.\n\nInstead, we are bound to vacate the district court's denial of\n\nthe section 2255 petition (insofar as it rejected the conflict\n\nof interest claim) and remand for further consideration of that\n\nclaim.   We think that the district court should regard this\n\nconflict claim as adequately presented by the section 2255\n\npetition, as fleshed-out by the first motion to amend (D.E. #\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f5) and Rivera’s affidavit (D.E. # 20), and that no further time\n\nshould be expended on the question whether the first motion to\n\namend was appropriate.         On the other hand, we do not think the\n\ndistrict judge is obliged to grant further motions to amend--a\n\nhabit that Rivera is beginning to abuse.\n\n           On remand, we expect that the district court will\n\ntreat this long-pending petition as a matter of urgency.               This\n\nis not because we are as yet persuaded that it is necessarily\n\na meritorious petition.         Rather, we are quite concerned that\n\nthis case has been pending since 1997 and that several prior\n\nlong periods elapsed in which no action was taken on pending\n\nmatters.   Although some of the delay may have been due to\n\nRivera's amendments, it is important that this case be taken at\n\nhand and resolved promptly.\n\n           To    this   end,    the    district    court    also   ought   to\n\nconsider on remand whether the matter can best be handled by\n\nonce   again    appointing     counsel      for   Rivera.    Short   of    an\n\nevidentiary hearing, this is a decision for the district court.\n\nBut the conflict issue is more than routine; the history\n\nappears to be complicated; and there may be legal questions\n\nthat a lawyer is better qualified to address.\n\n           Rivera's renewed motion for appointment of counsel on\n\nappeal is denied.        The judgment of the district court is\n\nvacated insofar as it rejected the conflict of interest claim,\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fand the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this decision.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -8-\n\f",

The\ndistrict court found that the office arrangement posed no conflict\nof interest, and we regard the issue as outside the scope of the\ncertificate of appealability, or, alternatively, as waived for\nfailure to raise in Rivera’s opening brief.\n\n                                 -5-\n\finvestigator for another defendant interviewed Rivera's defense\n\ncounsel who confirmed that such an offer had been made by the\n\ngovernment for a plea with a ten-year sentence.     See Aff. of\n\nRivera, D.E. # 20, ¶ 16.   Rivera denied that any such offer was\n\nrelayed to him, see id., although there may be conflicting\n\nevidence on this issue.\n\n          Rivera makes two other claims at different points as\n\nto adverse effects of the supposed conflict:     one is that he\n\nwas prevented from testifying because of the conflict although\n\nhe wished to do so, and the other is that based on the alleged\n\nfee agreement, his own counsel failed to move for a severance.\n\nThis latter claim is less impressive since such severances are\n\nvery rarely granted.   So even assuming that Rivera would have\n\nbeen better off in a severed trial, this may not have been a\n\nplausible strategy.\n\n          In all events, at least two of the three claims of\n\nadverse effect are sufficiently colorable--although the facts\n\nmay not bear them out--to prevent us from summarily affirming.\n\nInstead, we are bound to vacate the district court's denial of\n\nthe section 2255 petition (insofar as it rejected the conflict\n\nof interest claim) and remand for further consideration of that\n\nclaim.   We think that the district court should regard this\n\nconflict claim as adequately presented by the section 2255\n\npetition, as fleshed-out by the first motion to amend (D.E. #\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f5) and Rivera’s affidavit (D.E. # 20), and that no further time\n\nshould be expended on the question whether the first motion to\n\namend was appropriate.         On the other hand, we do not think the\n\ndistrict judge is obliged to grant further motions to amend--a\n\nhabit that Rivera is beginning to abuse.\n\n           On remand, we expect that the district court will\n\ntreat this long-pending petition as a matter of urgency.               This\n\nis not because we are as yet persuaded that it is necessarily\n\na meritorious petition.         Rather, we are quite concerned that\n\nthis case has been pending since 1997 and that several prior\n\nlong periods elapsed in which no action was taken on pending\n\nmatters.   Although some of the delay may have been due to\n\nRivera's amendments, it is important that this case be taken at\n\nhand and resolved promptly.\n\n           To    this   end,    the    district    court    also   ought   to\n\nconsider on remand whether the matter can best be handled by\n\nonce   again    appointing     counsel      for   Rivera.    Short   of    an\n\nevidentiary hearing, this is a decision for the district court.\n\nBut the conflict issue is more than routine; the history\n\nappears to be complicated; and there may be legal questions\n\nthat a lawyer is better qualified to address.\n\n           Rivera's renewed motion for appointment of counsel on\n\nappeal is denied.        The judgment of the district court is\n\nvacated insofar as it rejected the conflict of interest claim,\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fand the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this decision.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -8-\n\f</pre>",
