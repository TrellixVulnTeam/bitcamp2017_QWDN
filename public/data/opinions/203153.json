MacDonald on brief for petitioner.\n     Katharine E. Clark, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nDepartment of Justice, Peter Keisler, Assistant Attorney General,\nCivil Division, and Barry Pettinato, Assistant Director, on brief\nfor respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                        February 14, 2008\n\f           BOUDIN,     Chief     Judge.         Rotana        Teng,    a    41-year-old\n\nCambodian national, entered the United States on July 27, 1997,\n\noverstayed    his   extended     visa,    and       in   October      2001,      filed   an\n\napplication for asylum. The Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\nbegan removal proceedings against Teng, who conceded removability,\n\nbut requested asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").                  Hearings were held on his\n\napplication in March 2004 and June 2005.\n\n           Teng said that his father, mother, sister, and two\n\nbrothers were killed under Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime.                              That\n\nregime, as is well known, murderously dominated the country for\n\nseveral years following its take-over in 1975.                             Following an\n\ninvasion by Vietnam in 1978, civil war ensued, slackening in the\n\nearly 1990's and evolving into fierce rivalry between two other\n\nparties.   The grim history to the end of 1998 is recounted in the\n\nState   Department     country    report       of    February      1999     offered      in\n\nevidence by    Teng.\n\n           According to Teng, he participated in a 1991 rally\n\nagainst the Vietnam-supported incumbent Hun Sen government, and in\n\n1992 he joined the opposition FUNCINPEC party. At another rally in\n\nor   around   1992,    Teng    was   attacked            by   police       and     knocked\n\nunconscious; a friend of his was stabbed to death.                               Following\n\nelections in 1993, the FUNCINPEC party and its leader entered a\n\npower-sharing arrangement with Hun Sen's party, and Teng obtained\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fa job at the post office.    In his new job, he found that members of\n\nHun Sen's party were stealing from the post office.      He reported\n\nthe information to the press and was himself accused of stealing\n\nand was fired in May 1997.\n\n          On the day of the firing, a fight broke out between Teng\n\nand some of the members of Hun Sen's party at the post office; Teng\n\nsays that he and his brother, who came to his aid, were threatened\n\nby a man with a gun.   About three weeks later, Teng's brother was\n\nshot and killed.   Although it was classified as a robbery, Teng\n\nbelieved it to be a political murder related to the partisan\n\nfighting at the post office.     The following week, Teng obtained a\n\nvisa to travel to the United States.      On July 5, 1997, military\n\nsupporters of the Hun Sen regime launched a coup.\n\n          During this general period--roughly beginning in March of\n\n1997--Teng was hiding in a nearby temple to avoid the increased\n\nthreat of political violence.     He says that he would occasionally\n\npay short visits to his home to see his wife.    On the night of the\n\ncoup, he returned to his home and found that his wife and three-\n\nmonth-old daughter had been murdered.      Fearing for his life, he\n\nobtained a visa to travel to Thailand.    He went to Thailand on July\n\n12, 1997, returned to Cambodia a few days later to retrieve money\n\nhidden in his home, and on July 26, 1997, flew to the United\n\nStates.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           At the close of the second hearing in June 2005, the\n\nimmigration judge (\"IJ\") delivered a lengthy oral opinion denying\n\nTeng's requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief,\n\nbut granting voluntary departure.         The IJ found that Teng's asylum\n\napplication was untimely, that Teng was not a credible witness, and\n\nthat the evidence did not support his claims that he had been\n\npersecuted or tortured or was likely to suffer persecution or\n\ntorture if he returned to Cambodia.\n\n           On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\naffirmed the IJ.      Teng now seeks review in this court of his\n\nwithholding and CAT claims but not his asylum claim.1               He relies\n\nprimarily upon claims that he was denied procedural due process,\n\nrelegating an attack on the IJ's findings to a few pages at the\n\nclose of the brief. It is true that the latter attack is made\n\ndifficult by the deferential standard of review that applies to the\n\nagency's   findings   of   fact   and   inferences   from   them;    but   the\n\nprocedural claims--relating to allegedly inadequate translation and\n\ntranscription--are quite weak and we begin with the merits.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      An asylum claim must ordinarily be filed within one year of\narrival, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B)(2000), which Teng failed to do.\nThe main difference is that the asylum standard (well founded fear\nof persecution) is less demanding than the showings required to\nsupport withholding or protection under CAT.         8 C.F.R. §§\n1208.13(b) (standard for sustaining asylum claim); 208.16(b),\n(c)(2) (standard for sustaining withholding of removal and CAT\nclaims).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f              To    secure     a    withholding   of    removal       on   grounds    of\n\npersecution, the applicant must show that he would be \"more likely\n\nthan not\" to suffer persecution on one of the statutory grounds--\n\nhere, because of political opinion--a standard that the Supreme\n\nCourt has defined as a \"clear probability.\"2 INS v. Cardoza-\n\nFonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 430 (1987). Further, \"[i]f the applicant is\n\ndetermined to have suffered past persecution in the proposed\n\ncountry of removal . . . it shall be presumed that the applicant's\n\nlife or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of\n\nremoval.\"      8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1)(i).\n\n              Teng offered no direct evidence of his likely treatment\n\nshould   he    return     to       Cambodia;   rather   his    case    rests   on    the\n\npresumption        that   would      be   triggered     if    he   established      past\n\npersecution on political grounds. The deaths of Teng's parents and\n\nother family members under Pol Pot are horrible; but by the time of\n\nTeng's hearings, that regime had been out of power for many years.\n\nTeng's colorable basis for claiming any threat to himself based on\n\na statutory ground focuses on the 1990s.                      Here, four incidents\n\npredominate.\n\n              The first, chronologically, is Teng's beating by soldiers\n\nin 1992 and the second his discharge from his government post in\n\n\n\n     2\n      Alternatively, withholding under CAT can be achieved by\nshowing \"more likely than not\" that torture would occur regardless\nof the ground, 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2), but there is no evidence\nthat Teng has been tortured or would be tortured if he returned.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fMay 1997; assuming Teng's credibility, both could be regarded as\n\ncontributing to a claim of persecution but neither alone nor\n\ntogether would they likely be enough under the precedents.                     See\n\nNelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263-64 (1st Cir. 2000).                  The former\n\nwas a one-time incident; the latter, not a threat to his life or\n\nliberty.   See Alibeaj v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 188, 191-92 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   Much more serious are the deaths of his wife and daughter\n\nand of his brother.\n\n           Possibly these latter deaths were incidents of random\n\nviolence preceding and accompanying the military coup, and do not\n\nevidence political persecution against Teng.              But he was an active\n\nmember of a political party; his brother was murdered in suspicious\n\ncircumstances        shortly    after   a     partisan    battle     within    the\n\ngovernment-run post office; and Teng's wife and daughter were\n\nmurdered during a coup as part of which Hun Sen's forces reportedly\n\nengaged in door-to-door searches for opponents.\n\n           Indeed, the IJ denied Teng's claim not because his story\n\ndid not amount to persecution, but because she did not believe his\n\ntestimony (a matter to which we return).             The BIA, by contrast, did\n\ninclude one sentence in its affirmance suggesting as an alternative\n\nground that \"even if considered credible\", Teng had not shown a\n\nlikelihood     of     persecution   because     he    \"was   never    harmed    in\n\nCambodia.\"        But the murders of Teng's wife and daughter, if\n\nintended     to     retaliate   against     Teng     himself,   could   arguably\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fconstitute persecution of him even though the violence was not\n\ndirected personally at him.         Cf. Jorgji v. Mukasey, ___ F.3d ___,\n\n2008 WL 192323, at *4 (1st Cir. 2008).3\n\n                The question remains whether Teng's story was true.        The\n\nIJ resolved the credibility issue against Teng, and we review that\n\ndetermination for substantial evidence; the findings below are\n\n\"conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to\n\nconclude to the contrary.\"          8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Hincapie v.\n\nGonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 218 (1st Cir. 2007).           Although that is a\n\ndeferential standard, the IJ must provide \"a specific, cogent, and\n\nsupportable explanation\" for rejecting an alien's testimony.              Heng\n\nv. Gonzales, 493 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                The IJ premised her adverse credibility determination in\n\npart       on   Teng's   demeanor   during   the   hearing;   in   part    on\n\ninconsistencies and implausibilities in Teng's description of his\n\nbehavior during the period surrounding the July 1997 coup; and in\n\npart on a series of minor inconsistencies in his testimony, which\n\ntaken alone do not undermine his core narrative, but which could\n\ncall into question Teng's general veracity.             We address these\n\nsubsidiary determinations one by one.\n\n\n\n       3\n      Under the cases, attacks on family can help show fear of\nfuture persecution. Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir.\n1992); Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS, 937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir.\n1991).   We will assume arguendo that such attacks could also\nconstitute past persecution against Teng himself, triggering the\npresumption.\n\n                                       -7-\n\f            The IJ noted during the hearing that Teng's demeanor was\n\nsuspect and referred again to his demeanor in her oral decision.\n\nThe IJ alone saw the witness, such judgments are partly intuitive\n\nand hard to articulate, and the IJ's judgment is entitled to some\n\nweight.       Cf. Heng, 493 F.3d at 48.            Still, a consistent story,\n\nindependently supported in important respects and unmarred by\n\nimplausibilities        or   inconsistencies,       could     not     normally    be\n\ndisregarded merely because the witness--especially one from a\n\ndifferent     culture    and   unversed    in   English--simply        struck    the\n\ndecision-maker as untruthful.\n\n            Certain     aspects    of     Teng's    account     did     have     some\n\nindependent support: that he was a member of the FUNCINPEC party,\n\nand that his brother, wife and daughter were murdered around the\n\ntime of a bloody coup during which the supporters of Hun Sen\n\ntargeted the opposition.        Teng submitted his party membership card\n\nand   death    certificates,      although      those    documents       were    not\n\nauthenticated.     News reports included in the record indicate that\n\npolitical killings and door-to-door searches did take place in July\n\n1997 and many Cambodians fled to Thailand.\n\n            But Teng's testimony was also marked by discrepancies.\n\nTeng indicated that he was in hiding in a temple beginning in March\n\n1997 because he feared political reprisals. Yet he apparently felt\n\nsafe enough to show up to work at the government post office until\n\nhis termination on May 10, 1997, report his brother's death to\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fgovernment officials in June of 1997, travel in and out of the\n\ncountry in July using his Cambodian passport, and visit his house\n\non the night of the coup, and again when he returned from Thailand\n\nto Cambodia on July 15.\n\n          Teng attempted to explain only his ability to travel\n\nthrough airport checks during the time that he was supposedly a\n\ntarget of those associated with the government party.       To this\n\nextent the IJ had a rational basis for suspicion about a key aspect\n\nof Teng's testimony, even though another fact-finder might have\n\nthought that, given the turmoil in Cambodia at the time, Teng felt\n\ncomfortable appearing in some locations--such as the post office--\n\nand not others--such as his home.\n\n          The IJ also relied on a series of inconsistencies or\n\ncontradictions in Teng's testimony.     Some of the inconsistencies\n\ncited by the IJ do not accurately reflect the transcript4 and\n\nothers appear to be very minor.5    In still other instances, Teng's\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      For example, the IJ notes a contradiction as to whether Teng\nspent the time between July 15, 1997 and July 26 of that year\nhiding in his backyard or in a temple. But Teng explained that he\nhid in his backyard when police showed up at his home, and then\nescaped to the temple, where he remained until July 26.\n     5\n      For example, at one point Teng erroneously identified the\ndate of his brother's murder as May 10; but it appears from the\nrecord that he simply confused the date of his firing with the date\nof the subsequent shooting.\n\n                               -9-\n\fplausible   attempts      to   reconcile      alleged     inconsistencies     were\n\nrejected by the IJ without satisfactory explanation.6\n\n            At   the    same   time,   some    of   the   IJ's     concerns   about\n\ninconsistency were legitimate--for example, Teng at one point\n\nclaimed that his trip to Thailand preceded his wife's death but\n\nearlier had indicated that he fled to Thailand after finding the\n\ndead bodies; he also back-tracked when questioned about his reasons\n\nfor renewing his Cambodian passport in 2000, once he was already in\n\nthe United States. Thus, the IJ arguably overstated the number and\n\nimportance of the inconsistencies, but enough remain to let them\n\ncontribute to the overall finding.\n\n            Ultimately, it is not clear precisely which parts of\n\nTeng's testimony the IJ believed and which she discounted. But she\n\nexpressed serious doubts about portions of Teng's testimony that go\n\nto   the   heart   of    his    claim--the     fact     of   and    circumstances\n\nsurrounding the deaths of his wife and child, his travels in and\n\nout of Cambodia around the time of the coup, and the nature and\n\nseverity of the threat that Teng faced during that period.\n\n            At the end of the first hearing, the IJ made clear her\n\ndoubts about his story, yet Teng made no effort to clarify his\n\nstory or provide corroborating evidence from friends or family who\n\n\n\n     6\n      For example, as to why certain documents referred to his\nmother as alive if she had indeed been killed during the Pol Pot\nregime, Teng explained that his widowed aunt had raised him after\nhis mother's death; and that he considers her as a mother.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fmight have bolstered his claim.    Adding together the IJ's judgment\n\nabout demeanor, the arguable oddity of Teng's core story as to on\n\nand off concealments and appearances and the limited but not\n\ntrivial inconsistencies, the IJ's credibility determination finds\n\nadequate although not overwhelming support in the record considered\n\nas a whole.   Tum v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 159, 161 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          We thus turn to Teng's main grounds of appeal, namely,\n\nhis alleged due process claims.        We review a due process claim de\n\nnovo, Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir. 1999), but\n\nnot every procedural misstep or difficulty raises anything like a\n\nconstitutional issue.    Procedural due process protects a right to\n\na fundamentally fair proceeding; but few proceedings are perfect\n\nand one can have real errors, including ones that adversely affect\n\na   party's     interests,   without     automatically   violating   the\n\nConstitution.\n\n          Teng says that he was denied due process first when he\n\nreceived inadequate translation services, and again when the BIA\n\nconducted its review based on an incomplete transcription of the\n\nproceedings before the IJ.     Teng was furnished at the hearing with\n\na translator fluent in Cambodian, Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d\n\n118, 128-29 (1st Cir. 2004); Matter of Tomas, 19 I&N Dec. 464, 465\n\n(BIA 1987), and the claim of incompleteness rests on a modest\n\nnumber of \"indiscernible\" notations in the transcript of the oral\n\ntestimony--a poor predicate for a due process claim.\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f            Even if there were a substantial showing of manifestly\n\ninadequate    translation,     we       would   still     ask   \"whether   a    more\n\nproficient or more accurate interpretation would likely have made\n\na   dispositive   difference    in       the    outcome    of   the   proceeding.\"\n\nHarutyunyan v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 70 (1st Cir. 2005).                      Here,\n\nTeng does not point to any specific parts of his testimony that\n\nwere mistranslated, claiming only generally that the translation\n\nservices were inadequate.       This is hardly enough.            See Irianto v.\n\nGonzales, 221 Fed. Appx. 485, 487 (8th Cir. 2007).\n\n            At one point during the March 2004 hearing, the IJ did\n\nask the translator to enunciate better, but that occurred rather\n\nearly in the proceedings, and does not appear to have been a\n\nrecurring problem.     At a later point the translator told the IJ\n\nthat he was having difficulty understanding Teng, but he indicated\n\nthat it was due to Teng's tendency to testify in incomplete\n\nsentences.     A second translator, present during a subsequent\n\nhearing, expressed the same sentiment.\n\n            Teng's claim of inadequate transcription is similarly\n\nflawed.     Teng was entitled to administrative review of the IJ's\n\ndecision,    which   \"demands       a    'reasonably      accurate,    reasonably\n\ncomplete transcript,' or an adequate substitute, to allow for\n\nmeaningful and adequate appellate review,\" Kheireddine v. Gonzales,\n\n427 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Ortiz-Salas v. INS, 992\n\nF.2d 105, 106 (7th Cir. 1993)); but to succeed on a claim of\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\finadequate or inaccurate transcription, he must at least \"show\n\n'specific prejudice to his ability to perfect an appeal' sufficient\n\nto rise to the level of a due process violation.\"       Id. at 85\n\n(quoting United States v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90, 97 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\n          He has not done so.      The record reveals a complete\n\ntranscription of Teng's testimony before the IJ, with only a\n\nsmattering of \"indiscernibles\" noted throughout the transcripts.\n\nThe isolated ellipses do not prevent the reader from understanding\n\nTeng's testimony.   Indeed, the only specific omission noted in\n\nTeng's brief is a series of eight \"indiscernible notions\" in his\n\ntestimony regarding his termination from a job at the Cambodian\n\npost office; but the transcript provides an essentially complete\n\naccount of that episode.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

MacDonald on brief for petitioner.</p>\n<p>Katharine E. Clark, Office of Immigration Litigation, Department of Justice, Peter Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and Barry Pettinato, Assistant Director, on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, and STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>Rotana Teng, a 41-year-old Cambodian national, entered the United States on July 27, 1997, overstayed his extended visa, and in October 2001, filed an application for asylum. The Immigration and Naturalization Service began removal proceedings against Teng, who conceded removability, but requested asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). Hearings were held on his application in March 2004 and June 2005.</p>\n<p>Teng said that his father, mother, sister, and two brothers were killed under Pol <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> Pot's Khmer Rouge regime. That regime, as is well known, murderously dominated the country for several years following its take-over in 1975. Following an invasion by Vietnam in 1978, civil war ensued, slackening in the early 1990's and evolving into fierce rivalry between two other parties. The grim history to the end of 1998 is recounted in the State Department country report of February 1999 offered in evidence by Teng.</p>\n<p>According to Teng, he participated in a 1991 rally against the Vietnam-supported incumbent Hun Sen government, and in 1992 he joined the opposition FUNCINPEC C party. At another rally in or around 1992, Teng was attacked by police and knocked unconscious; a friend of his was stabbed to death. Following elections in 1993, the FUNCINPEC party and its leader entered a power-sharing arrangement with Hun Sen's party, and Teng obtained a job at the post office. In his new job, he found that members of Hun Sen's party were stealing from the post office. He reported the information to the press and was himself accused of stealing and was fired in May 1997.</p>\n<p>On the day of the firing, a fight broke out between Teng and some of the members of Hun Sen's party at the post office; Teng says that he and his brother, who came to his aid, were threatened by a man with a gun. About three weeks later, Teng's brother was shot and killed. Although it was classified as a robbery, Teng believed it to be a political murder related to the partisan fighting at the post office. The following week, Teng obtained a visa to travel to the United States. On July 5, 1997, military supporters of the Hun Sen regime launched a coup.</p>\n<p>During this general periodroughly beginning in March of 1997Teng was hiding in a nearby temple to avoid the increased threat of political violence. He says that he would occasionally pay short visits to his home to see his wife. On the night of the coup, he returned to his home and found that his wife and three-month-old daughter had been murdered. Fearing for his life, he obtained a visa to travel to Thailand. He went to Thailand on July 12, 1997, returned to Cambodia a few days later to retrieve money hidden in his home, and on July 26, 1997, flew to the United States.</p>\n<p>At the close of the second hearing in June 2005, the immigration judge (\"IJ\") delivered a lengthy oral opinion denying Teng's requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, but granting voluntary departure. The IJ found that Teng's asylum application was untimely, that Teng was not a credible witness, and that the evidence did not support his claims that he had been persecuted or tortured or was likely to suffer persecution or torture if he returned to Cambodia.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed the IJ. Teng now seeks review in this court of his withholding and CAT claims but not his asylum claim.<sup>[1]</sup> He relies primarily upon claims that he was denied procedural due process, relegating an attack on the IJ's findings to a few pages at the close of the brief. It is true that the latter attack is made difficult by the deferential standard of review that applies to the agency's findings of fact and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> inferences from them; but the procedural claimsrelating to allegedly inadequate translation and transcriptionare quite weak and we begin with the merits.</p>\n<p>To secure a withholding of removal on grounds of persecution, the applicant must show that he would be \"more likely than not\" to suffer persecution on one of the statutory groundshere, because of political opiniona standard that the Supreme Court has defined as a \"clear probability.\"<sup>[2]</sup><i>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Further, \"[i]f the applicant is determined to have suffered past persecution in the proposed country of removal . . . it shall be presumed that the applicant's life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal.\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1)(i).</p>\n<p>Teng offered no direct evidence of his likely treatment should he return to Cambodia; rather his case rests on the presumption that would be triggered if he established past persecution on political grounds. The deaths of Teng's parents and other family members under Pol Pot are horrible; but by the time of Teng's hearings, that regime had been out of power for many years. Teng's colorable basis for claiming any threat to himself based on a statutory ground focuses on the 1990s. Here, four incidents predominate.</p>\n<p>The first, chronologically, is Teng's beating by soldiers in 1992 and the second his discharge from his government post in May 1997; assuming Teng's credibility, both could be regarded as contributing to a claim of persecution but neither alone nor together would they likely be enough under the precedents. <i>See </i><i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 263-64 (1st Cir.2000). The former was a one-time incident; the latter, not a threat to his life or liberty. <i>See </i><i>Alibeaj v. Gonzales,</i> 469 F.3d 188, 191-92 (1st Cir.2006). Much more serious are the deaths of his wife and daughter and of his brother.</p>\n<p>Possibly these latter deaths were incidents of random violence preceding and accompanying the military coup, and do not evidence political persecution against Teng. But he was an active member of a political party; his brother was murdered in suspicious circumstances shortly after a partisan battle within the government-run post office; and Teng's wife and daughter were murdered during a coup as part of which Hun Sen's forces reportedly engaged in door-to-door searches for opponents.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the IJ denied Teng's claim not because his story did not amount to persecution, but because she did not believe his testimony (a matter to which we return). The BIA, by contrast, did include one sentence in its affirmance suggesting as an alternative ground that \"even if considered credible\", Teng had not shown a likelihood of persecution because he \"was never harmed in Cambodia.\" But the murders of Teng's wife and daughter, if intended to retaliate against Teng himself, could arguably constitute persecution of him even though the violence was not directed personally at him. <i>Cf. </i><i>Jorgji v. Mukasey,</i> 514 F.3d 53, 57-58 (1st Cfr.2008).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> The question remains whether Teng's story was true. The IJ resolved the credibility issue against Teng, and we review that determination for substantial evidence; the findings below are \"conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>Hincapie v. Gonzales,</i> 494 F.3d 213, 218 (1st Cir.2007). Although that is a deferential standard, the IJ must provide \"a specific, cogent, and supportable explanation\" for rejecting an alien's testimony. <i>Heng v. Gonzales,</i> 493 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The IJ premised her adverse credibility determination in part on Teng's demeanor during the hearing; in part on inconsistencies and implausibilities in Teng's description of his behavior during the period surrounding the July 1997 coup; and in part on a series of minor inconsistencies in his testimony, which taken alone do not undermine his core narrative, but which could call into question Teng's general veracity. We address these subsidiary determinations one by one.</p>\n<p>The IJ noted during the hearing that Teng's demeanor was suspect and referred again to his demeanor in her oral decision. The IJ alone saw the witness, such judgments are partly intuitive and hard to articulate, and the IJ's judgment is entitled to some weight. <i>Cf. </i><i>Heng,</i> 493 F.3d at 48. Still, a consistent story, independently supported in important respects and unmarred by implausibilities or inconsistencies, could not normally be disregarded merely because the witnessespecially one from a different culture and unversed in Englishsimply struck the decision-maker as untruthful.</p>\n<p>Certain aspects of Teng's account did have some independent support: that he was a member of the FUNCINPEC party, and that his brother, wife and daughter were murdered around the time of a bloody coup during which the supporters of Hun Sen targeted the opposition. Teng submitted his party membership card and death certificates, although those documents were not authenticated. News reports included in the record indicate that political killings and door-to-door searches did take place in July 1997 and many Cambodians fled to Thailand.</p>\n<p>But Teng's testimony was also marked by discrepancies. Teng indicated that he was in hiding in a temple beginning in March 1997 because he feared political reprisals. Yet he apparently felt safe enough to show up to work at the government post office until his termination on May 10, 1997, report his brother's death to government officials in June of 1997, travel in and out of the country in July using his Cambodian passport, and visit his house on the night of the coup, and again when he returned from Thailand to Cambodia on July 15.</p>\n<p>Teng attempted to explain only his ability to travel through airport checks during the time that he was supposedly a target of those associated with the government party. To this extent the IJ had a rational basis for suspicion about a key aspect of Teng's testimony, even though another fact-finder might have thought that, given the turmoil in Cambodia at the time, Teng felt comfortable appearing in some locationssuch as the post officeand not otherssuch as his home.</p>\n<p>The IJ also relied on a series of inconsistencies or contradictions in Teng's testimony. Some of the inconsistencies cited by the IJ do not accurately reflect the transcript<sup>[4]</sup> and others appear to be very <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> minor.<sup>[5]</sup> In still other instances, Teng's plausible attempts to reconcile alleged inconsistencies were rejected by the IJ without satisfactory explanation.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>At the same time, some of the IJ's concerns about inconsistency were legitimatefor example, Teng at one point claimed that his trip to Thailand preceded his wife's death but earlier had indicated that he fled to Thailand after finding the dead bodies; he also back-tracked when questioned about his reasons for renewing his Cambodian passport in 2000, once he was already in the United States. Thus, the IJ arguably overstated the number and importance of the inconsistencies, but enough remain to let them contribute to the overall finding.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it is not clear precisely which parts of Teng's testimony the IJ believed and which she discounted. But she expressed serious doubts about portions of Teng's testimony that go to the heart of his claimthe fact of and circumstances surrounding the deaths of his wife and child, his travels in and out of Cambodia around the time of the coup, and the nature and severity of the threat that Teng faced during that period.</p>\n<p>At the end of the first hearing, the IJ made clear her doubts about his story, yet Teng made no effort to clarify his story or provide corroborating evidence from friends or family who might have bolstered his claim. Adding together the IJ's judgment about demeanor, the arguable oddity of Teng's core story as to on and off concealments and appearances and the limited but not trivial inconsistencies, the IJ's credibility determination finds adequate although not overwhelming support in the record considered as a whole. <i>Tum v. Gonzales,</i> 503 F.3d 159, 161 (1st Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p>We thus turn to Teng's main grounds of appeal, namely, his alleged due process claims. We review a due process claim <i>de novo, </i><i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir.1999), but not every procedural misstep or difficulty raises anything like a constitutional issue. Procedural due process protects a right to a fundamentally fair proceeding; but few proceedings are perfect and one can have real errors, including ones that adversely affect a party's interests, without automatically violating the Constitution.</p>\n<p>Teng says that he was denied due process first when he received inadequate translation services, and again when the BIA conducted its review based on an incomplete transcription of the proceedings before the IJ. Teng was furnished at the hearing with a translator fluent in Cambodian, <i>Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft,</i> 358 F.3d 118, 128-29 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Matter of Tomas,</i> 19 I &amp; N Dec. 464, 465 (BIA 1987), and the claim of incompleteness rests on a modest number of \"indiscernible\" notations in the transcript of the oral testimonya poor predicate for a due process claim.</p>\n<p>Even if there were a substantial showing of manifestly inadequate translation, we would still ask \"whether a more proficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> or more accurate interpretation would likely have made a dispositive difference in the outcome of the proceeding.\" <i>Harutyunyan v. Gonzales,</i> 421 F.3d 64, 70 (1st Cir.2005). Here, Teng does not point to any specific parts of his testimony that were mistranslated, claiming only generally that the translation services were inadequate. This is hardly enough. <i>See Irianto v. Gonzales,</i> 221 Fed.Appx. 485, 487 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>At one point during the March 2004 hearing, the IJ did ask the translator to enunciate better, but that occurred rather early in the proceedings, and does not appear to have been a recurring problem. At a later point the translator told the IJ that he was having difficulty understanding Teng, but he indicated that it was due to Teng's tendency to testify in incomplete sentences. A second translator, present during a subsequent hearing, expressed the same sentiment.</p>\n<p>Teng's claim of inadequate transcription is similarly flawed. Teng was entitled to administrative review of the IJ's decision, which \"demands a `reasonably accurate, reasonably complete transcript,' or an adequate substitute, to allow for meaningful and adequate appellate review,\" <i>Kheireddine v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Ortiz-Salas v. INS,</i> 992 F.2d 105, 106 (7th Cir.1993)); but to succeed on a claim of inadequate or inaccurate transcription, he must at least \"show `specific prejudice to his ability to perfect an appeal' sufficient to rise to the level of a due process violation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 85 (quoting <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 292 F.3d 90, 97 (1st Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p>He has not done so. The record reveals a complete transcription of Teng's testimony before the IJ, with only a smattering of \"indiscernibles\" noted throughout the transcripts. The isolated ellipses do not prevent the reader from understanding Teng's testimony. Indeed, the only specific omission noted in Teng's brief is a series of eight \"indiscernible notions\" in his testimony regarding his termination from a job at the Cambodian post office; but the transcript provides an essentially complete account of that episode.</p>\n<p>The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  An asylum claim must ordinarily be filed within one year of arrival, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B)(2000), which Teng failed to do. The main difference is that the asylum standard (well founded fear of persecution) is less demanding than the showings required to support withholding or protection under CAT. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(b) (standard for sustaining asylum claim); 208.16(b), (c)(2) (standard for sustaining withholding of removal and CAT claims).</p>\n<p>[2]  Alternatively, withholding under CAT can be achieved by showing \"more likely than not\" that torture would occur regardless of the ground, 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2), but there is no evidence that Teng has been tortured or would be tortured if he returned.</p>\n<p>[3]  Under the cases, attacks on family can help show fear of <i>future</i> persecution. <i>Ravindran v. INS,</i> 976 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir.1992); <i>Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS,</i> 937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir.1991). We will assume <i>arguendo</i> that such attacks could also constitute <i>past</i> persecution against Teng himself, triggering the presumption.</p>\n<p>[4]  For example, the IJ notes a contradiction as to whether Teng spent the time between July 15, 1997 and July 26 of that year hiding in his backyard or in a temple, But Teng explained that he hid in his backyard when police showed up at his home, and then escaped to the temple, where he remained until July 26.</p>\n<p>[5]  For example, at one point Teng erroneously identified the date of his brother's murder as May 10; but it appears from the record that he simply confused the date of his firing with the date of the subsequent shooting.</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, as to why certain documents referred to his mother as alive if she had indeed been killed during the Pol Pot regime, Teng explained that his widowed aunt had raised him after his mother's death; and that he considers her as a mother.</p>\n\n</div>",

The Immigration and Naturalization Service began removal proceedings against Teng, who conceded removability, but requested asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").

Yet he apparently felt safe enough to show up to work at the government post office until his termination on May 10, 1997, report his brother's death to government officials in June of 1997, travel in and out of the country in July using his Cambodian passport, and visit his house on the night of the coup, and again when he returned from Thailand to Cambodia on July 15.</p>\n<p>Teng attempted to explain only his ability to travel through airport checks during the time that he was supposedly a target of those associated with the government party. To this extent the IJ had a rational basis for suspicion about a key aspect of Teng's testimony, even though another fact-finder might have thought that, given the turmoil in Cambodia at the time, Teng felt comfortable appearing in some locationssuch as the post officeand not otherssuch as his home.</p>\n<p>The IJ also relied on a series of inconsistencies or contradictions in Teng's testimony. Some of the inconsistencies cited by the IJ do not accurately reflect the transcript<sup>[4]</sup> and others appear to be very <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> minor.<sup>[5]</sup> In still other instances, Teng's plausible attempts to reconcile alleged inconsistencies were rejected by the IJ without satisfactory explanation.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>At the same time, some of the IJ's concerns about inconsistency were legitimatefor example, Teng at one point claimed that his trip to Thailand preceded his wife's death but earlier had indicated that he fled to Thailand after finding the dead bodies; he also back-tracked when questioned about his reasons for renewing his Cambodian passport in 2000, once he was already in the United States. Thus, the IJ arguably overstated the number and importance of the inconsistencies, but enough remain to let them contribute to the overall finding.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it is not clear precisely which parts of Teng's testimony the IJ believed and which she discounted. But she expressed serious doubts about portions of Teng's testimony that go to the heart of his claimthe fact of and circumstances surrounding the deaths of his wife and child, his travels in and out of Cambodia around the time of the coup, and the nature and severity of the threat that Teng faced during that period.</p>\n<p>At the end of the first hearing, the IJ made clear her doubts about his story, yet Teng made no effort to clarify his story or provide corroborating evidence from friends or family who might have bolstered his claim. Adding together the IJ's judgment about demeanor, the arguable oddity of Teng's core story as to on and off concealments and appearances and the limited but not trivial inconsistencies, the IJ's credibility determination finds adequate although not overwhelming support in the record considered as a whole. <i>Tum v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202958\"><a href=\"/opinion/202958/tum-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span>, 161 (1st Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p>We thus turn to Teng's main grounds of appeal, namely, his alleged due process claims. We review a due process claim <i>de novo, </i><i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 568 (1st Cir.1999), but not every procedural misstep or difficulty raises anything like a constitutional issue. Procedural due process protects a right to a fundamentally fair proceeding; but few proceedings are perfect and one can have real errors, including ones that adversely affect a party's interests, without automatically violating the Constitution.</p>\n<p>Teng says that he was denied due process first when he received inadequate translation services, and again when the BIA conducted its review based on an incomplete transcription of the proceedings before the IJ. Teng was furnished at the hearing with a translator fluent in Cambodian, <i>Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200854\"><a href=\"/opinion/200854/mekhoukh-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 128-29 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Matter of Tomas,</i> 19 I &amp; N Dec. 464, 465 (BIA 1987), and the claim of incompleteness rests on a modest number of \"indiscernible\" notations in the transcript of the oral testimonya poor predicate for a due process claim.</p>\n<p>Even if there were a substantial showing of manifestly inadequate translation, we would still ask \"whether a more proficient <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> or more accurate interpretation would likely have made a dispositive difference in the outcome of the proceeding.\" <i>Harutyunyan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201799\"><a href=\"/opinion/201799/harutyunyan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 70 (1st Cir.2005). Here, Teng does not point to any specific parts of his testimony that were mistranslated, claiming only generally that the translation services were inadequate. This is hardly enough. <i>See Irianto v. Gonzales,</i> 221 Fed.Appx. 485, 487 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>At one point during the March 2004 hearing, the IJ did ask the translator to enunciate better, but that occurred rather early in the proceedings, and does not appear to have been a recurring problem. At a later point the translator told the IJ that he was having difficulty understanding Teng, but he indicated that it was due to Teng's tendency to testify in incomplete sentences. A second translator, present during a subsequent hearing, expressed the same sentiment.</p>\n<p>Teng's claim of inadequate transcription is similarly flawed. Teng was entitled to administrative review of the IJ's decision, which \"demands a `reasonably accurate, reasonably complete transcript,' or an adequate substitute, to allow for meaningful and adequate appellate review,\" <i>Kheireddine v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201881\"><a href=\"/opinion/201881/kheireddine-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Ortiz-Salas v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605629\"><a href=\"/opinion/605629/jose-ortiz-salas-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 106 (7th Cir.1993)); but to succeed on a claim of inadequate or inaccurate transcription, he must at least \"show `specific prejudice to his ability to perfect an appeal' sufficient to rise to the level of a due process violation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 85 (quoting <i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199997\"><a href=\"/opinion/199997/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 97 (1st Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p>He has not done so. The record reveals a complete transcription of Teng's testimony before the IJ, with only a smattering of \"indiscernibles\" noted throughout the transcripts. The isolated ellipses do not prevent the reader from understanding Teng's testimony. Indeed, the only specific omission noted in Teng's brief is a series of eight \"indiscernible notions\" in his testimony regarding his termination from a job at the Cambodian post office; but the transcript provides an essentially complete account of that episode.</p>\n<p>The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  An asylum claim must ordinarily be filed within one year of arrival, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B)(2000), which Teng failed to do. The main difference is that the asylum standard (well founded fear of persecution) is less demanding than the showings required to support withholding or protection under CAT. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(b) (standard for sustaining asylum claim); 208.16(b), (c)(2) (standard for sustaining withholding of removal and CAT claims).</p>\n<p>[2]  Alternatively, withholding under CAT can be achieved by showing \"more likely than not\" that torture would occur regardless of the ground, 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2), but there is no evidence that Teng has been tortured or would be tortured if he returned.</p>\n<p>[3]  Under the cases, attacks on family can help show fear of <i>future</i> persecution. <i>Ravindran v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592069\"><a href=\"/opinion/592069/valli-kandiah-ravindran-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 759 (1st Cir.1992); <i>Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563859\"><a href=\"/opinion/563859/audelio-arriaga-barrientos-v-us-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 414 (9th Cir.1991). We will assume <i>arguendo</i> that such attacks could also constitute <i>past</i> persecution against Teng himself, triggering the presumption.</p>\n<p>[4]  For example, the IJ notes a contradiction as to whether Teng spent the time between July 15, 1997 and July 26 of that year hiding in his backyard or in a temple, But Teng explained that he hid in his backyard when police showed up at his home, and then escaped to the temple, where he remained until July 26.</p>\n<p>[5]  For example, at one point Teng erroneously identified the date of his brother's murder as May 10; but it appears from the record that he simply confused the date of his firing with the date of the subsequent shooting.</p>\n<p>[6]  For example, as to why certain documents referred to his mother as alive if she had indeed been killed during the Pol Pot regime, Teng explained that his widowed aunt had raised him after his mother's death; and that he considers her as a mother.</p>\n\n</div>",
