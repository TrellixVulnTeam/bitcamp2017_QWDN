These consolidated appeals arise\n\nfrom a drug trafficking conspiracy in Maine in which all the\n\nappellants pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial of conspiracy\n\nto distribute crack cocaine.            Appellants Dale McLean, Manolin\n\nFeliz-Terrero,      Juan   Navarro    and    Mauricio   Berguette-Meran     all\n\nchallenge their sentences.1          Navarro also challenges the partial\n\ndenial of his motion to suppress.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            We present a brief overview of the facts, reserving a\n\nmore detailed discussion for our analysis.\n\nA.       The Conspiracy\n\n            From early summer of 2002 until a November 19, 2002 law\n\nenforcement raid, the appellants and a host of other individuals\n\nparticipated in a crack distribution conspiracy in Sabbattus,\n\nMaine.      Jorge   Mattos   of   Springfield,      Massachusetts,    led   the\n\noperation, along with his lieutenant, Janci Feliz.                  Through an\n\nintermediary named James Birkbeck, Mattos arranged to rent a room\n\nin a trailer belonging to McLean and Debra Schrock in Sabbattus.\n\nMattos agreed to pay McLean, Schrock, and Birkbeck with cash or\n\ndrugs.    The conspiracy operated as follows.\n\n            Mattos would send two individuals to the McLean trailer\n\nto   sell    prepackaged     crack.         The   sellers   would    stay   for\n\n\n\n     1\n      Appellant Jorge Marques dismissed his appeal shortly after\nthis case was argued.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fapproximately one to two weeks.      At the end of the period, they\n\nwould be relieved by a new two-person team, which would also serve\n\na one or two-week shift and then be relieved.    Appellants Feliz and\n\nBerguette comprised one such team.\n\n            The trailer had two bedrooms, each with an adjoining\n\nbathroom.    McLean and Schrock shared what we will label the left\n\nbedroom; the drug-selling teams sent by Mattos stayed in the right\n\nbedroom.    The teams retained control of the drugs and the drug\n\nproceeds, which they typically hid outside the trailer. Generally,\n\nBirkbeck, McLean or Schrock would deal with the drug purchasers and\n\ncollect the purchase price.    They would take the money to a team\n\nmember in the right bedroom or adjoining bathroom and exchange the\n\ncash (or acceptable electronic merchandise such as game systems and\n\ntelevisions) for crack.    Birkbeck, McLean, or Schrock would then\n\ndeliver the crack to the purchaser, keeping an agreed upon portion\n\nof crack or cash for himself or herself.        Birkbeck, McLean, and\n\nSchrock regularly smoked crack during the relevant period, and\n\nMcLean ran up a drug debt beyond his agreed remuneration.     By late\n\nin the conspiracy, McLean became largely incapacitated due to heavy\n\ncrack usage and spent most of his time in the left bedroom.\n\n            Mattos used Navarro, his nephew, as his link with the\n\nconspirators in Maine.    As Mattos' representative, Navarro managed\n\nthe assets of the conspiracy, controlled the local participants,\n\nand resupplied the drug-selling teams.    Upon being notified by the\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fteam that the crack supply was running low, Navarro would go to\n\nMaine with additional supply and take the sales proceeds back to\n\nMattos.   Navarro also managed the communications between the other\n\nparticipants, serving as a translator between the drug-selling\n\nteams   (whose   members   were   Dominican   and   spoke   Spanish)   and\n\nBirkbeck, McLean and Schrock (who spoke English).           In addition,\n\nNavarro directed Birkbeck, McLean and Schrock, instructing Schrock\n\nto keep the operation \"safe\" and to handle the customers (so that\n\nthe drug-selling teams could remain hidden), and McLean to serve in\n\nBirkbeck's stead after Birkbeck's arrest.       Significantly, Navarro\n\nalso served as enforcer, once tracking down an individual who stole\n\ndrugs and cash from the operation, and threatening Schrock with\n\ndeath if she ever \"ratted\" out the conspirators.            Navarro also\n\nthreatened (once at gunpoint) to kill McLean's daughter, Crystal\n\nMcLean, when McLean resisted Navarro's directive that he replace\n\nBirkbeck, and when McLean failed to pay off his mounting drug debt.\n\n           In early November, Marques, Crystal McLean's fiancé, came\n\nto live at the trailer in response to the threats against her.          He\n\nagreed to participate in the conspiracy by helping to service\n\nMcLean's customers until McLean's debt to Navarro was paid. During\n\nthis period, either Marques or Crystal was required to remain at\n\nthe trailer at all times, as security for McLean's debt.        Marques'\n\narrival in November changed the living arrangements in the trailer.\n\nWhile the narcotics transactions still took place in the right\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fbedroom and adjoining bathroom, the drug-selling teams no longer\n\nslept there.    Instead, they permitted Marques and Crystal to use\n\nthe right bedroom (beginning a few days before the raid), while the\n\nteams slept in the living room.\n\n            A cooperating individual (\"CI\") began making purchases\n\nfrom the trailer in October.         These purchases and related phone\n\ncalls were monitored by law enforcement.           During an October 28,\n\n2002 purchase, McLean told the CI that the members of the drug-\n\nselling team were interested in acquiring 9 mm handguns, and that\n\nMcLean himself was interested in the CI's .357 magnum revolver. At\n\na November 4, 2002 purchase, McLean again asked the CI about the 9\n\nmm   pistols   in   which   the   drug-selling   team   had   expressed    an\n\ninterest.\n\n            Law enforcement agents raided the trailer on November 19,\n\n2002.    They arrested Marques, Crystal, and Feliz in the right\n\nbedroom, McLean in the left bedroom, and Berguette outside the\n\ntrailer.    In the right bedroom, the agents found 5 rocks of crack,\n\na .22 caliber handgun, and $1820 in cash.          An additional $7900 in\n\ncash was found in a crawl space under the trailer.\n\nB.      District Court Proceedings\n\n            McLean,   Feliz   and   Berguette    each   pleaded   guilty   to\n\nconspiring to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base and\n\nagreed to cooperate with the government. Marques pleaded guilty to\n\nconspiring to distribute 5 or more grams of cocaine base and also\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fagreed to cooperate.2          McLean was sentenced first, and Marques,\n\nFeliz     and    Berguette    were    sentenced    shortly   thereafter    in   a\n\nconsolidated proceeding.             All received two-level increases for\n\npossession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), and all were\n\ndenied the benefit of safety valve provisions, set forth at 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2, because of the presence of\n\nthe .22 caliber handgun. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(2)(safety valve\n\nunavailable if defendant \"possess[es] a firearm\"); U.S.S.G. §\n\n5C1.2(a)(2)(same).           All   were   the   beneficiaries   of    government\n\nmotions for downward departures for substantial assistance.                  The\n\nsentencing ranges and net sentences after the downward departures\n\nwere as follows: Berguette, a range of               135-168 months, and an\n\nactual sentence of 95 months; Feliz, a range of 168-210 months, and\n\nan actual sentence of 118 months; Marques, a range of 46-57 months,\n\nand an actual sentence of 24 months; and McLean, a range of 108-135\n\nmonths, and an actual sentence of 44 months.\n\n                Navarro went to trial after the district court denied, in\n\npart, his motion to suppress certain statements that he made after\n\nhis   arrest.        At   trial,     McLean,    Schrock,   Marques,    Birkbeck,\n\nBerguette, Feliz, and Crystal McLean testified against him.                  The\n\ngovernment introduced post-arrest statements made by Navarro that\n\nhe had been a driver and translator for the conspiracy, and his\n\n\n\n      2\n      Schrock and Birkbeck also pleaded guilty. Crystal McLean was\nnot charged.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fstatement in which he identified the conspiracy's \"boss.\" The jury\n\nfound him guilty of conspiring to distribute 50 grams or more of\n\ncrack cocaine.        The district court found Navarro's guideline range\n\nto   be    262   to    327    months   and   sentenced   him    to   300   months'\n\nimprisonment.         These appeals followed.\n\n                                         II.\n\n              Navarro challenges the partial denial of his motion to\n\nsuppress his post-arrest statements.               Navarro also challenges a\n\nsentencing enhancement for his role as a manager or supervisor in\n\nthe conspiracy. McLean, Feliz, and Berguette raise a common issue:\n\nwhether the district court erroneously denied them the benefits of\n\nthe \"safety valve\" provision because they possessed a firearm\n\nduring the course of the conspiracy.               Navarro and Berguette also\n\nseek to raise issues based upon Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct.\n\n2531 (2004).\n\nA.        Motion to Suppress\n\n              Navarro argues that the district court erred in failing\n\nto suppress certain of his post-arrest statements.                   The relevant\n\nfacts are as follows.\n\n              Navarro was arrested after the other appellants when he,\n\nalong     with   Mattos      and   another     conspirator,    attended    Feliz's\n\ndetention hearing.           Navarro and his companions were identified to\n\nlaw enforcement officers by Crystal McLean, who was present in the\n\ncourthouse.       As he was led off to be booked, Navarro became\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fhysterical and made unprompted statements about his role as driver\n\nand translator, and about Mattos.           He also offered to cooperate to\n\navoid going to jail.      While being booked by Marshal Folan and DEA\n\nAgent Rousseau, Navarro continued his outbursts and referred to an\n\nindividual named \"Tommy.\"       Rousseau asked Navarro \"Who is Tommy?\"\n\nNavarro identified \"Tommy\" as Janci Feliz. He also volunteered that\n\nMattos owned a restaurant called \"El Creoleo\" in Springfield, and\n\nthat Mattos worked for a Latin King street gang member in New York\n\nnamed \"Tommy.\"      Navarro was not read his Miranda rights during the\n\nbooking procedure.\n\n           Navarro moved to suppress his post-arrest statements and\n\nwas   granted   a   hearing    at   which    Folan,     Rousseau    and   Navarro\n\ntestified.      Navarro    claimed    on     direct     examination     that    the\n\nofficers, in particular Rousseau, were anxious to get him alone and\n\ninterrogate him from the beginning.           But on cross examination, he\n\nconceded that he was sobbing in the booking room and offered\n\ncertain   information     in   an   effort    to    get    released.\n\n             The magistrate judge who conducted the hearing concluded\n\nthat everything said prior to the \"Tommy\" question was voluntarily\n\noffered by Navarro in an attempt to secure his release.                    But he\n\nalso concluded that the \"Who's Tommy?\" question violated Miranda\n\nbecause   it    was    reasonably     likely       to     elicit   incriminating\n\ninformation.     He thus recommended that the answer to the \"Tommy\"\n\nquestion and     the   statements    that    followed       –-   that   Janci   was\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f\"Tommy,\" that Mattos owned a Springfield restaurant called \"El\n\nCreoleo,\" and that Mattos worked for a Latin King called \"Tommy\" --\n\nbe excluded.          The trial judge accepted the recommendation in its\n\nentirety.     Navarro argues that all of his statements should have\n\nbeen suppressed as obtained in violation of Miranda.\n\n            \"We review a district court's findings of fact with\n\nrespect to a suppression motion for clear error.\" United States v.\n\nLopez, 380 F.3d 538, 543 (1st Cir. 2004).                  Our review of the\n\ndistrict court's ultimate application of Miranda is de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Reyes, 225 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             If the defendant is not advised of his Miranda rights and\n\nhas not validly waived them, \"the police are prohibited from\n\ninterrogating him and any statements obtained in violation of this\n\nrule will be excluded from evidence at trial . . . .\"                  Reyes, 225\n\nF.3d   at   76    (internal    citation   omitted).        But   there    are   two\n\nexceptions to the Miranda doctrine which are relevant here. First,\n\nthere is a booking exception, which allows police officers to ask\n\ngeneral background questions (name, date of birth, etc.) while\n\nprocessing a newly arrested individual without advising him of his\n\nMiranda rights.         Id. at 76-77.   Second, \"any statement made freely\n\nand voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course,\n\nadmissible       in    evidence.\"   Lopez,    380   F.3d    at   545     (internal\n\nquotation and citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f                In our view, the district court correctly concluded that\n\nthese Miranda exceptions apply to Navarro's statements prior to\n\nbeing asked \"Who's Tommy?\" The only questions that the officers\n\nasked      before      this    question    were    booking   questions,    and   the\n\nadditional information that Navarro provided before the \"Tommy\"\n\nquestion was thus volunteered.              And, as we have set forth above,\n\nthe district court excluded all the statements made in response to\n\nthe one non-booking question.               The admission of Navarro's other\n\nstatements did not violate Miranda.3\n\nB.         Role in Offense Enhancement\n\n                Navarro argues that the evidence was insufficient to show\n\nthat       he   held    a     managerial   or     supervisory   position   in    the\n\nconspiracy.4        He asserts that the testimony of the Massachusetts\n\nconspirators shows that he was an ordinary participant and that\n\nMattos and Janci Feliz were the only leaders.                He also asserts that\n\nthe Maine conspirators' testimony regarding his threats was not\n\ncredible.\n\n\n\n       3\n      In so ruling, we reject Navarro's entreaty that we disbelieve\nthe officers' testimony as to what happened. The district court\naccepted the officer's testimony and our review of the record\npersuades us that the court's credibility determinations were not\nclearly erroneous.\n       4\n      The relevant section of the guidelines provides that a\ndefendant's offense level be increased by three levels based upon\nhis role as a manager or supervisor in the criminal conduct if the\ncriminal conduct involved five or more participants or was\notherwise extensive. See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b). There is no dispute\nthat there were five or more participants in the conspiracy.\n\n                                           -10-\n\f           The   district   court   concluded   that   a   three-level\n\nenhancement was appropriate because Navarro acted as a manager in\n\nthe conspiracy by controlling its assets and directing at least one\n\nother participant.    We review the district court's application of\n\nan enhancement based upon the defendant's role in the offense for\n\nclear error.     See United States v. May, 343 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2003.\n\n           Navarro's claim that Mattos and Janci Feliz were the true\n\nleaders is a nonstarter.    That Mattos and Janci were higher up the\n\nchain at the conspiracy's Massachusetts \"headquarters\" says nothing\n\nabout whether Navarro acted as a \"local\" supervisor of the Maine\n\nconspirators, as the district court found.      Navarro concedes that\n\nthe Maine conspirators regarded him as a supervisor, and the\n\nevidence overwhelmingly establishes that he supervised them.\n\n           Navarro's claim that the Maine conspirators' testimony\n\nregarding his threats was not credible also goes nowhere.          The\n\ndistrict court was able to observe the witnesses and assess their\n\ncredibility far better than this court can from a cold record.     See\n\ngenerally United States v. Marshall, 348 F.3d 281, 286 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   Moreover, as we have said, the evidence shows that Navarro\n\nmanaged the conspiracy's assets and directed the Maine conspirators\n\nin their duties.     This evidence itself is more than enough to\n\njustify the enhancement.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fC.       Application of the Safety Valve\n\n            McLean, Feliz, and Berguette do not contest the propriety\n\nof the two-level enhancement that they received under U.S.S.G. §\n\n2D1.1(b)(1),5 but they challenge the district court's conclusion\n\nthat they were ineligible for the safety valve.                  The court found,\n\ninsofar as is relevant,6 that the safety valve was unavailable\n\nbecause, in the court's view, each of the three conspirators\n\npossessed   the    .22    caliber   handgun    during      the    course   of   the\n\nconspiracy.        Appellants    contend     that   only    proof     of   \"actual\n\npossession\" is sufficient to foreclose the application of the\n\nsafety    valve,    and   that   even   if    constructive         possession    is\n\nsufficient (as the court found), there was inadequate evidence to\n\nestablish such possession.\n\n            As suggested above, the \"safety valve\" provision allows\n\na defendant to avoid the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence\n\nso long as the defendant and the offense meet certain enumerated\n\n\n\n     5\n      Section 2D1.1(b)(1) provides for a two level increase in the\noffense level \"[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) is\npossessed . . . .\"\n     6\n      Shortly before the sentencing proceedings in this case, we\nheld that a co-conspirator's possession of a firearm will not\nforeclose the application of the safety valve in favor of another\nco-conspirator who did not possess the firearm. See United States\nv. Figueroa-Encarnacion, 343 F.3d 23, 34-5 (1st Cir. 2003). The\ndistrict court partially based its decision to deny McLean the\nsafety valve on a theory of co-conspirator liability foreclosed by\nFigueroa-Encarnacion, but alternatively on the ground of McLean's\nconstructive possession of the firearm. We focus on the court's\nalternative holding for present purposes.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fcriteria.      See 18   U.S.C.   §   3553(f).7   The   safety   valve   is\n\n\n\n    7\n        The statute provides:\n\n    (f) Limitation on applicability of statutory minimums in\n    certain cases.–Notwithstanding any other provisions of\n    law, in the case of an offense under section 401, 404, or\n    406 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 844,\n    846) or section 1010 or 1013 of the Controlled Substances\n    Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 960, 963), the court\n    shall   impose   a  sentence   pursuant   to   guidelines\n    promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission\n    under section 994 of title 28 without regard to any\n    statutory minimum sentence, if the court finds at\n    sentencing, after the Government has been afforded an\n    opportunity to make a recommendation, that --\n\n            (1) the defendant does not have more than 1\n            criminal history point, as determined under\n            the sentencing guidelines;\n            (2) the defendant did not use violence or\n            credible threats of violence or possess a\n            firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce\n            another participant to do so) in connection\n            with the offense;\n            (3) the offense did not result in death or\n            serious bodily injury to any person;\n            (4) the defendant was not an organizer,\n            leader, manager, or supervisor of others in\n            the   offense,   as   determined   under   the\n            sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a\n            continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in\n            section 408 of the Controlled Substances Act;\n            and\n            (5) not later than the time of the sentencing\n            hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided\n            to the Government all information and evidence\n            the defendant has concerning the offense or\n            offenses that were part of the same course of\n            conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the\n            fact that the defendant has no relevant or\n            useful other information to provide or that\n            the Government is already aware of the\n            information shall not preclude a determination\n            by the court that the defendant has complied\n            with this requirement. 18 U.S.C. §3553(f).\n\n                                     -13-\n\freproduced, essentially verbatim, in the guidelines, see U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 5C1.2, which, if applicable, can garner the defendant a two-level\n\nreduction in offense level, see U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(6). But as we\n\nhave stated, the safety valve is unavailable to a defendant who\n\n\"possess[es] a firearm . . . in connection with the offense.\"              See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(2); U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a)(2).8\n\n            The   question     therefore     arises:      What    constitutes\n\n\"possession\" of a firearm within the meaning of the statute and the\n\nguideline?    Appellants contend that only \"actual\" possession9 of a\n\ngun will suffice; the government responds that \"constructive\"\n\npossession is enough.      We think that the government has the better\n\nargument.\n\n             Adoption    of    the   appellants'       position    would     be\n\ninconsistent      with   our   normal       interpretation   of    the     word\n\n\"possession\" in the guidelines. See United States v. McDonald, 121\n\nF.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1997) (for purposes of U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1),\n\n\"any possession – actual or constructive – can trigger the two-\n\nlevel increase.\")        Further, our cases have generally held that\n\n\n\n     8\n      As the government concedes, the fact that McLean, Feliz, and\nBerguette all received downward departures based on their\ncooperation which took them below the statutory minimum does not\nrender this challenge moot. See generally United States v. Emery,\n991 F.2d 907, 910 (1st Cir. 1993). The government also concedes\nthat these appellants were otherwise eligible for the safety valve.\n     9\n       Actual possession is generally defined as \"the state of\nimmediate, hands-on physical possession.\" See United States v.\nZavala Maldonado, 23 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                     -14-\n\feither actual or constructive possession suffices in the context of\n\nfirearms, explosives, and narcotics offenses.       See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Liranzo, 385 F.3d 66, 69 n. 2 (1st Cir. 2004) (18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(g)(1)); United States v. Carlos Cruz, 352 F.3d 499, 510 (1st\n\nCir. 2003)(18 U.S.C. §924); United States v. Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d\n\n1, 19 (1st Cir. 2002)(21 U.S.C. §841(a)(1)); United States v. Van\n\nHorn, 277 F.3d 48, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2002)(18 U.S.C. § 842(i)(1));\n\nUnited States v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90, 99 (1st Cir. 2002)(18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(g)(1)).    Application of this same rule in this context makes\n\nabundant sense, as a defendant who, for example, has a concealed\n\nweapon strategically placed in a room where he conducts his drug\n\nbusiness is no less dangerous than a defendant who conducts his\n\nbusiness with a weapon on his person.        We therefore hold that a\n\ndefendant who has constructively possessed a firearm in connection\n\nwith a drug trafficking offense is ineligible for the safety valve\n\nprovisions set forth at 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2.\n\n          We turn now to whether there was sufficient evidence of\n\nconstructive possession.      This circuit has consistently defined\n\nconstructive    possession   as   follows:   \"Constructive   possession\n\nexists when a person knowingly has the power and intention at a\n\ngiven time to exercise dominion and control over an object either\n\ndirectly or through others.\"       Carlos Cruz, 352 F.3d at 510; see\n\nalso United States v. Nieves-Burgos, 62 F.3d 431, 437-38 (1st Cir.\n\n1995); United States v. Torres-Maldonado, 14 F.3d 95, 102 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f1994); United States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1164 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).   As is true of actual possession, constructive possession\n\ndoes not require actual ownership of the weapon, see Liranzo, 385\n\nF.3d at 69, and can be sole or joint, see Van Horn, 277 F.3d at 54-\n\n55.\n\n          Moreover, the requisite knowledge and intention can be\n\ninferred from circumstances, such as a defendant's control over the\n\narea where the contraband is found (e.g., defendant's home or\n\nautomobile).    See Zavala Maldonado, 23 F.3d at 7-8.   But knowledge\n\nmust be fairly inferable from the circumstances.        See id. at 7;\n\nUnited States v. Booth, 111 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1997)(knowing\n\npossession required); see also United States v. Weems, 322 F.3d 18,\n\n24 (1st Cir. 2003)(mere proximity to a firearm is not enough to\n\nestablish actual or constructive possession); Garcia, 983 F.2d at\n\n1164 (\"Mere presence or association with another who possessed the\n\ncontraband is, however, insufficient to establish constructive\n\npossession.\")    Thus, \"[t]here must be some action, some word, or\n\nsome conduct that links the individual to the contraband and\n\nindicates that he had some stake in it, some power over it.\"    In re\n\nSealed Case, 105 F.3d 1460, 1463 (D.C. 1997).\n\n          We turn now to each appellant's claim that the district\n\ncourt erred in concluding that he constructively possessed the\n\nfirearm. McLean and Berguette primarily argue that the evidence is\n\ninsufficient to ground a finding that they knew of the firearm's\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fexistence.     Feliz concedes that he had knowledge of the firearm,\n\nbut challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to ground a finding\n\nthat he had the intention and power to exercise dominion and\n\ncontrol over the weapon.\n\n             In reviewing a district court's determination that a\n\ndefendant failed to qualify for the safety valve, the standard of\n\nreview varies depending upon whether the determination is based on\n\nconclusions of law or differential fact-finding.            United States v.\n\nMatos, 328 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir. 2003).          If the former, our review\n\nis plenary; if the latter, we review only for clear error.                 Id.\n\nCritical to our determination is the evidence that the district\n\njudge considered as to each appellant.          Appellants bear the burden\n\nof showing their entitlement to a safety valve reduction.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Richardson, 225 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             The evidence concerning the .22 caliber handgun came from\n\nthree primary sources:          Marques' testimony at Navarro's trial;\n\nAgent LaChance's testimony at the consolidated sentencing hearing\n\nfor Marques, Feliz, and Berguette; and Feliz's testimony at both\n\nNavarro's trial and the consolidated sentencing hearing.\n\n             Marques    testified     that   McLean's   brother   traded    the\n\nunloaded gun for crack about two days before the raid.             He further\n\ntestified     that     McLean   and    Feliz   were     present   during    the\n\ntransaction, and that he and McLean physically handled the gun. He\n\nrecounted that, after the exchange, he placed the gun in the closet\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fof the right bedroom.      At Navarro's trial, Feliz testified that he\n\nhad only been shown the gun the night of the raid by Marques, that\n\nit was unloaded, that Marques put it in his bedroom closet, and\n\nthat he did not know who owned it.\n\n           Agent LaChance testified that the unloaded .22 caliber\n\npistol was found in the right bedroom in a small closet on the left\n\nside of the room.    He further testified that a picture of Crystal\n\nMcLean and two suitcases belonging to Berguette and Feliz were also\n\nfound in the closet. On cross-examination, LaChance clarified that\n\nthe gun was not in plain view, and he conceded that at least\n\nFeliz's suitcase was actually found in the living room.                 At the\n\nsentencing hearing, Feliz admitted that Marques had shown him the\n\ngun and that he knew where it was stored, but emphasized that he\n\nand Berguette were staying in the living room rather than the right\n\nbedroom in the days before the raid.       He also testified that, at\n\nthe time of the raid, his suitcase was in the living room in\n\nanticipation of his imminent departure for Springfield.\n\n           1. McLean's Arguments\n\n           McLean   primarily   contends   that    the     district    court's\n\ndecision cannot stand because McLean had no knowledge of the\n\nfirearm.   The government responds that the evidence supports the\n\nruling because the gun was seized from the trailer McLean owned,\n\nthe trailer was the focus of the drug operation, McLean and four\n\nco-conspirators     were    arrested   there,     McLean     knew     his   co-\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fconspirators wanted to acquire guns, and McLean knew that some of\n\nhis co-conspirators were armed because they had threatened his\n\ndaughter at gunpoint.10\n\n            In our view, the record reveals insufficient grounds for\n\nconcluding that McLean had knowledge of the .22 caliber pistol.11\n\nHe did not stay in the room where the weapon was found.    Instead,\n\nat this point in the conspiracy, McLean spent most of his time in\n\nhis room.    Moreover, because the pistol was not acquired until a\n\nfew days before the raid, it could not have been the weapon used to\n\nthreaten Crystal McLean in October. Finally, that McLean was aware\n\nthat his co-conspirators were interested in 9 mm pistols is not\n\nsufficient evidence that McLean knew that his co-conspirators had\n\nactually acquired a .22 caliber pistol.       In sum, we think the\n\ninference of knowledge too tenuous to stand.12\n\n\n     10\n      McLean's presentence report (\"PSR\") recounted how the .22\ncaliber handgun had been found, how McLean had tried to obtain guns\nfor the drug-selling team members and himself from the CI, and that\nNavarro had threatened Crystal at gunpoint.\n     11\n      We recognize that Marques' testimony at Navarro's trial\ntended to establish that McLean knew about and physically possessed\nthe firearm. However, there is no indication in the record that\nthe sentencing judge, who also presided over the Navarro trial,\nconsidered or relied on this evidence in any manner in sentencing\nMcLean. The government did not make this evidence part of McLean's\nsentencing record and did not argue it in any fashion below or on\nappeal; thus defense counsel had no opportunity to challenge it.\nTherefore, we will not consider this evidence in reviewing McLean's\ninstant appeal.\n     12\n      Moreover, even if McLean had knowledge of the gun, we\nquestion whether there is a basis in the record for finding that he\nhad the power to exercise dominion and control over it. We have\n\n                                -19-\n\f          2.   Berguette's Arguments\n\n          Berguette,   like   McLean,   contends   he   did   not   have\n\nconstructive possession of the .22 caliber handgun because he was\n\nunaware that the firearm existed.   The government argues that such\n\nknowledge can be inferred because Berguette stayed in the room in\n\nwhich the gun was found, his suitcase was found in the closet with\n\nthe gun, and (as recounted in the PSR) Birkbeck stated that the\n\nBerguette had acquired the gun for himself.\n\n          As with McLean, there is inadequate evidence to infer\n\nthat Berguette had actual knowledge of the gun.13       That the drug-\n\n\n\nnoted that, when McLean balked at taking Birkbeck's place, Navarro\nthreatened his daughter at gunpoint. Moreover, both his daughter\nand future son-in-law were held as de facto prisoners for McLean's\ndrug debt. Significantly, the district court specifically found\nthat McLean was not in control of the drugs or proceeds located in\nthe same bedroom of the trailer as the gun.       These undisputed\nfacts, coupled with McLean's increased drug use and withdrawal into\nhis room late in the conspiracy, strongly support a conclusion that\nMcLean did not exercise dominion and control over his co-\nconspirators or their property.\n     13\n      As to knowledge, only Birkbeck's statement in the PSR ties\nBerguette directly to the firearm. But Berguette challenged the\nadmissibility of the Birkbeck statement, asserting that the\ngovernment never provided the relevant notes to counsel and that\nthe government represented that it would not rely on the Birkbeck\nstatement at sentencing. Berguette's counsel renewed this\ncontention on appeal. So far as the record discloses, this issue\nwas not expressly resolved in the district court. However, a fair\nreading of the sentencing transcript reveals that the Birkbeck\nstatement was not considered. First, the only statements referred\nto at sentencing were those of LaChance, Marques, and Feliz; it is\nunlikely that Birkbeck's highly incriminating statement would have\nbeen forgotten by both sides. Second, the government only argued\nconstructive possession at sentencing, even though Birkbeck's\nstatement, if credited, demonstrates actual possession.\n\n                                -20-\n\fselling teams sought 9 mm pistols does not by itself mean Berguette\n\nknew about this .22 caliber pistol.                     Further, Berguette did not\n\nlive in the right bedroom during the period the that gun was in the\n\ntrailer, and Agent LaChance's testimony was less than definitive as\n\nto    the    location      of   Berguette's     suitcase.          The   most   relevant\n\ncircumstance is that Berguette participated in drug transactions in\n\nthe right bedroom while the handgun was in the closet.                       But without\n\nmore, this is not enough to show knowledge of the hidden gun.                          As\n\nwe    have    said,    mere     proximity      to   a    firearm    is   inadequate    to\n\nestablish constructive possession.                      See Weems, 322 F.3d at 24.\n\nThis is true even if the defendant is near the gun in a room\n\ndevoted to narcotics activity.                 See Torres-Maldonado, 14 F.3d at\n\n103 (insufficient evidence to support conviction under 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c) where there was no evidence that defendant had knowledge of\n\ngun hidden in tote bag on couch where defendant was sitting);\n\nUnited States v. Pena-Sarabia, 297 F.3d 983, 985 & 989 (10th Cir.\n\n2002)(wife did not possess co-conspirator husband's gun, which he\n\nkept under the couple's bed with cocaine supply, because she had no\n\nknowledge that the gun existed).\n\n              3.      Feliz's Arguments\n\n              Like McLean and Berguette, Feliz argues that the record\n\nfails to establish that he had constructive possession of the\n\nfirearm.      But unlike McLean and Berguette, Feliz concedes that he\n\nhad    knowledge      of    the   gun,   and    focuses      on    whether    there   was\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fsufficient evidence to find that he met the other elements of\n\nconstructive possession.        The government responds that Feliz's\n\nknowledge of the weapon, his role in the conspiracy, and the\n\ncircumstances of his arrest provide ample evidence to ground the\n\ndistrict court's finding.\n\n            It is undisputed that Feliz knew about the gun, knew\n\nwhere it was hidden, engaged in drug sales in the right bedroom in\n\nclose proximity to the hidden weapon, and was arrested in the right\n\nbedroom with crack and drug proceeds around him.          As knowledge is\n\nuncontested, the issue is whether the record establishes that Feliz\n\nhad the power and intention to exert dominion and control over the\n\nfirearm.\n\n            The power component is fairly straightforward. Feliz was\n\nclose enough to the firearm to pick it up at any time.             This is\n\nenough.     See Van Horn, 277 F.3d at 55 (power element established\n\nbecause    defendant   could   reach   into   adjacent   bucket   and   take\n\nphysical possession of the explosives).         That Marques was next to\n\nhim and capable of doing the same is irrelevant, as possession can\n\nbe joint.    See id. at 56 (\"Exclusive access is not a prerequisite\n\nto possession . . . .\")\n\n            There is also a sufficient basis for inferring intent.\n\nAs a practical matter, Feliz could well have intended to use the\n\ngun for protection in the event of trouble with one of the crack\n\nsales. Cf. Carlos-Cruz, 352 F.3d at 510 (defendants \"had power and\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fintention to retrieve the firearms if and when the upcoming drug\n\ntransactions    turned    sour\").       Further,       the   gun    was   among     the\n\nproceeds of the drug sales, which Feliz was obliged to protect for\n\nNavarro.    Cf. Zavala Maldonado, 23 F.3d at 8 (intent to store and\n\ntransfer narcotics to confederate).                In sum, Feliz's proximity to\n\nthe weapon, coupled with his knowledge of the weapon and role in\n\nthe conspiracy, is more than sufficient to establish constructive\n\npossession.      Cf.    Nieves-Burgos,        62    F.3d   at    438    (evidence    of\n\npossession sufficient for conviction under 18 U.S.C. §924(c) where\n\nactive participant in drug conspiracy arrested in hotel room with\n\ncash, narcotics, and firearm in tote bag two feet from where he\n\nsat).\n\nD.   Booker Claims\n\n            Appellants     Berguette     and       Navarro      filed   supplemental\n\nbriefs before this case was argued challenging their sentences on\n\nBlakely grounds.       Subsequent to argument, the Supreme Court issued\n\nits decision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), and\n\nthis court issued its decision in United States v. Antonakopoulos,\n\n399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2005).        As a consequence,            we ordered further\n\nsupplemental briefing.\n\n            Berguette argues that any Booker error should be deemed\n\npreserved     because    he   sought    a     downward       departure     from     the\n\nguidelines sentence, Booker error should be deemed a structural\n\nerror for which prejudice should be presumed, and there was a\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\freasonable probability that he would receive a lower sentence on\n\nremand.    As we have already determined that Berguette's sentence\n\nmust be vacated and remanded, we need not address his claims.\n\n           Navarro argues that he preserved any Booker error, in\n\neffect, by arguing in the district court that the evidence was\n\ninadequate to support an enhancement for Navarro's role in the\n\noffense.     Alternatively, Navarro argues that the plain error\n\nstandard is met because there is a reasonable probability that\n\nNavarro would receive a lower sentence on remand.              In particular,\n\nNavarro argues that the district judge would be free under the new\n\nregime to give more weight to such factors as Navarro's youth, his\n\nprospects for rehabilitation, his lack of guidance, the malignant\n\ninfluence of his uncle, his responsibilities to his children, and\n\nthe much lower sentences received by the other co-conspirators.\n\n           A claim of Booker error is preserved \"if the defendant\n\nbelow argued Apprendi or Blakely error or that the Guidelines were\n\nunconstitutional.\" Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 76. Navarro raised\n\nno such argument below.         Thus, Navarro's only hope is to establish\n\nplain error.\n\n           To make such a showing, a defendant must demonstrate (1)\n\nan error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights,\n\nand (4) that seriously impairs the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.             Id. at 77.

As to the third\n\nprong, the defendant must show a \"reasonable probability that the\n\ndistrict court would impose a different sentence more favorable to\n\nthe defendant under the new 'advisory Guidelines' Booker regime.\"\n\nId. at 75.    The reasonable probability standard \"is not met by the\n\nmere assertion that the court might have given the defendant a more\n\nfavorable sentence.\"      Id. at 80.   One category of claims that might\n\nwarrant remand on plain error review is the one involving arguments\n\nthat   a   mitigating    factor   existed    but   was   not    available    for\n\nconsideration    under    the   \"mandatory\"    Guidelines.        Id.   at   81.\n\nNavarro attempts to locate his argument within this category, but\n\nwe are not persuaded.\n\n             First, Navarro actually made the mitigating arguments\n\nthat he now posits before the district court.                    He does not\n\nelaborate how he could make them more convincingly on remand.\n\nSecond, nothing in the transcript indicates that the court was in\n\nany way moved by these arguments.             We note that Navarro was\n\nsentenced in the middle of the guideline range, rather than at the\n\nbottom, and so the district court could have given him a lower\n\nsentence under the old regime.             That it did not do so speaks\n\nvolumes.     Also, the court stated that it believed the sentence to\n\nbe justified by the vast quantities of drugs that the conspiracy\n\ninjected into society, and by Navarro's \"arrogant and malicious\n\nattitude toward the well-being of others,\" as manifested by his\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\f\"terrible threats.\"     There is nothing here that establishes a\n\nreasonable probability of a lower sentence on remand.\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the reasons stated above, McLean and Berguette's\n\nsentences are vacated and their cases are remanded for resentencing\n\nin accordance with this opinion. Feliz's sentence is affirmed, and\n\nNavarro's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\f",

These consolidated appeals arise\n\nfrom a drug trafficking conspiracy in Maine in which all the\n\nappellants pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial of conspiracy\n\nto distribute crack cocaine.            Appellants Dale McLean, Manolin\n\nFeliz-Terrero,      Juan   Navarro    and    Mauricio   Berguette-Meran     all\n\nchallenge their sentences.1          Navarro also challenges the partial\n\ndenial of his motion to suppress.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            We present a brief overview of the facts, reserving a\n\nmore detailed discussion for our analysis.\n\nA.       The Conspiracy\n\n            From early summer of 2002 until a November 19, 2002 law\n\nenforcement raid, the appellants and a host of other individuals\n\nparticipated in a crack distribution conspiracy in Sabbattus,\n\nMaine.      Jorge   Mattos   of   Springfield,      Massachusetts,    led   the\n\noperation, along with his lieutenant, Janci Feliz.                  Through an\n\nintermediary named James Birkbeck, Mattos arranged to rent a room\n\nin a trailer belonging to McLean and Debra Schrock in Sabbattus.\n\nMattos agreed to pay McLean, Schrock, and Birkbeck with cash or\n\ndrugs.    The conspiracy operated as follows.\n\n            Mattos would send two individuals to the McLean trailer\n\nto   sell    prepackaged     crack.         The   sellers   would    stay   for\n\n\n\n     1\n      Appellant Jorge Marques dismissed his appeal shortly after\nthis case was argued.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fapproximately one to two weeks.      At the end of the period, they\n\nwould be relieved by a new two-person team, which would also serve\n\na one or two-week shift and then be relieved.    Appellants Feliz and\n\nBerguette comprised one such team.\n\n            The trailer had two bedrooms, each with an adjoining\n\nbathroom.    McLean and Schrock shared what we will label the left\n\nbedroom; the drug-selling teams sent by Mattos stayed in the right\n\nbedroom.    The teams retained control of the drugs and the drug\n\nproceeds, which they typically hid outside the trailer. Generally,\n\nBirkbeck, McLean or Schrock would deal with the drug purchasers and\n\ncollect the purchase price.    They would take the money to a team\n\nmember in the right bedroom or adjoining bathroom and exchange the\n\ncash (or acceptable electronic merchandise such as game systems and\n\ntelevisions) for crack.    Birkbeck, McLean, or Schrock would then\n\ndeliver the crack to the purchaser, keeping an agreed upon portion\n\nof crack or cash for himself or herself.        Birkbeck, McLean, and\n\nSchrock regularly smoked crack during the relevant period, and\n\nMcLean ran up a drug debt beyond his agreed remuneration.     By late\n\nin the conspiracy, McLean became largely incapacitated due to heavy\n\ncrack usage and spent most of his time in the left bedroom.\n\n            Mattos used Navarro, his nephew, as his link with the\n\nconspirators in Maine.    As Mattos' representative, Navarro managed\n\nthe assets of the conspiracy, controlled the local participants,\n\nand resupplied the drug-selling teams.    Upon being notified by the\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fteam that the crack supply was running low, Navarro would go to\n\nMaine with additional supply and take the sales proceeds back to\n\nMattos.   Navarro also managed the communications between the other\n\nparticipants, serving as a translator between the drug-selling\n\nteams   (whose   members   were   Dominican   and   spoke   Spanish)   and\n\nBirkbeck, McLean and Schrock (who spoke English).           In addition,\n\nNavarro directed Birkbeck, McLean and Schrock, instructing Schrock\n\nto keep the operation \"safe\" and to handle the customers (so that\n\nthe drug-selling teams could remain hidden), and McLean to serve in\n\nBirkbeck's stead after Birkbeck's arrest.       Significantly, Navarro\n\nalso served as enforcer, once tracking down an individual who stole\n\ndrugs and cash from the operation, and threatening Schrock with\n\ndeath if she ever \"ratted\" out the conspirators.            Navarro also\n\nthreatened (once at gunpoint) to kill McLean's daughter, Crystal\n\nMcLean, when McLean resisted Navarro's directive that he replace\n\nBirkbeck, and when McLean failed to pay off his mounting drug debt.\n\n           In early November, Marques, Crystal McLean's fiancé, came\n\nto live at the trailer in response to the threats against her.          He\n\nagreed to participate in the conspiracy by helping to service\n\nMcLean's customers until McLean's debt to Navarro was paid. During\n\nthis period, either Marques or Crystal was required to remain at\n\nthe trailer at all times, as security for McLean's debt.        Marques'\n\narrival in November changed the living arrangements in the trailer.\n\nWhile the narcotics transactions still took place in the right\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fbedroom and adjoining bathroom, the drug-selling teams no longer\n\nslept there.    Instead, they permitted Marques and Crystal to use\n\nthe right bedroom (beginning a few days before the raid), while the\n\nteams slept in the living room.\n\n            A cooperating individual (\"CI\") began making purchases\n\nfrom the trailer in October.         These purchases and related phone\n\ncalls were monitored by law enforcement.           During an October 28,\n\n2002 purchase, McLean told the CI that the members of the drug-\n\nselling team were interested in acquiring 9 mm handguns, and that\n\nMcLean himself was interested in the CI's .357 magnum revolver. At\n\na November 4, 2002 purchase, McLean again asked the CI about the 9\n\nmm   pistols   in   which   the   drug-selling   team   had   expressed    an\n\ninterest.\n\n            Law enforcement agents raided the trailer on November 19,\n\n2002.    They arrested Marques, Crystal, and Feliz in the right\n\nbedroom, McLean in the left bedroom, and Berguette outside the\n\ntrailer.    In the right bedroom, the agents found 5 rocks of crack,\n\na .22 caliber handgun, and $1820 in cash.          An additional $7900 in\n\ncash was found in a crawl space under the trailer.\n\nB.      District Court Proceedings\n\n            McLean,   Feliz   and   Berguette    each   pleaded   guilty   to\n\nconspiring to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base and\n\nagreed to cooperate with the government. Marques pleaded guilty to\n\nconspiring to distribute 5 or more grams of cocaine base and also\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fagreed to cooperate.2          McLean was sentenced first, and Marques,\n\nFeliz     and    Berguette    were    sentenced    shortly   thereafter    in   a\n\nconsolidated proceeding.             All received two-level increases for\n\npossession of a firearm under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), and all were\n\ndenied the benefit of safety valve provisions, set forth at 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2, because of the presence of\n\nthe .22 caliber handgun. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(2)(safety valve\n\nunavailable if defendant \"possess[es] a firearm\"); U.S.S.G. §\n\n5C1.2(a)(2)(same).           All   were   the   beneficiaries   of    government\n\nmotions for downward departures for substantial assistance.                  The\n\nsentencing ranges and net sentences after the downward departures\n\nwere as follows: Berguette, a range of               135-168 months, and an\n\nactual sentence of 95 months; Feliz, a range of 168-210 months, and\n\nan actual sentence of 118 months; Marques, a range of 46-57 months,\n\nand an actual sentence of 24 months; and McLean, a range of 108-135\n\nmonths, and an actual sentence of 44 months.\n\n                Navarro went to trial after the district court denied, in\n\npart, his motion to suppress certain statements that he made after\n\nhis   arrest.        At   trial,     McLean,    Schrock,   Marques,    Birkbeck,\n\nBerguette, Feliz, and Crystal McLean testified against him.                  The\n\ngovernment introduced post-arrest statements made by Navarro that\n\nhe had been a driver and translator for the conspiracy, and his\n\n\n\n      2\n      Schrock and Birkbeck also pleaded guilty. Crystal McLean was\nnot charged.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fstatement in which he identified the conspiracy's \"boss.\" The jury\n\nfound him guilty of conspiring to distribute 50 grams or more of\n\ncrack cocaine.        The district court found Navarro's guideline range\n\nto   be    262   to    327    months   and   sentenced   him    to   300   months'\n\nimprisonment.         These appeals followed.\n\n                                         II.\n\n              Navarro challenges the partial denial of his motion to\n\nsuppress his post-arrest statements.               Navarro also challenges a\n\nsentencing enhancement for his role as a manager or supervisor in\n\nthe conspiracy. McLean, Feliz, and Berguette raise a common issue:\n\nwhether the district court erroneously denied them the benefits of\n\nthe \"safety valve\" provision because they possessed a firearm\n\nduring the course of the conspiracy.               Navarro and Berguette also\n\nseek to raise issues based upon Blakely v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004).\n\nA.        Motion to Suppress\n\n              Navarro argues that the district court erred in failing\n\nto suppress certain of his post-arrest statements.                   The relevant\n\nfacts are as follows.\n\n              Navarro was arrested after the other appellants when he,\n\nalong     with   Mattos      and   another     conspirator,    attended    Feliz's\n\ndetention hearing.           Navarro and his companions were identified to\n\nlaw enforcement officers by Crystal McLean, who was present in the\n\ncourthouse.       As he was led off to be booked, Navarro became\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fhysterical and made unprompted statements about his role as driver\n\nand translator, and about Mattos.           He also offered to cooperate to\n\navoid going to jail.      While being booked by Marshal Folan and DEA\n\nAgent Rousseau, Navarro continued his outbursts and referred to an\n\nindividual named \"Tommy.\"       Rousseau asked Navarro \"Who is Tommy?\"\n\nNavarro identified \"Tommy\" as Janci Feliz. He also volunteered that\n\nMattos owned a restaurant called \"El Creoleo\" in Springfield, and\n\nthat Mattos worked for a Latin King street gang member in New York\n\nnamed \"Tommy.\"      Navarro was not read his Miranda rights during the\n\nbooking procedure.\n\n           Navarro moved to suppress his post-arrest statements and\n\nwas   granted   a   hearing    at   which    Folan,     Rousseau    and   Navarro\n\ntestified.      Navarro    claimed    on     direct     examination     that    the\n\nofficers, in particular Rousseau, were anxious to get him alone and\n\ninterrogate him from the beginning.           But on cross examination, he\n\nconceded that he was sobbing in the booking room and offered\n\ncertain   information     in   an   effort    to    get    released.\n\n             The magistrate judge who conducted the hearing concluded\n\nthat everything said prior to the \"Tommy\" question was voluntarily\n\noffered by Navarro in an attempt to secure his release.                    But he\n\nalso concluded that the \"Who's Tommy?\" question violated Miranda\n\nbecause   it    was    reasonably     likely       to     elicit   incriminating\n\ninformation.     He thus recommended that the answer to the \"Tommy\"\n\nquestion and     the   statements    that    followed       –-   that   Janci   was\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f\"Tommy,\" that Mattos owned a Springfield restaurant called \"El\n\nCreoleo,\" and that Mattos worked for a Latin King called \"Tommy\" --\n\nbe excluded.          The trial judge accepted the recommendation in its\n\nentirety.     Navarro argues that all of his statements should have\n\nbeen suppressed as obtained in violation of Miranda.\n\n            \"We review a district court's findings of fact with\n\nrespect to a suppression motion for clear error.\" United States v.\n\nLopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201204\"><a href=\"/opinion/201204/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 543 (1st Cir. 2004).

But   there    are   two\n\nexceptions to the Miranda doctrine which are relevant here. First,\n\nthere is a booking exception, which allows police officers to ask\n\ngeneral background questions (name, date of birth, etc.) while\n\nprocessing a newly arrested individual without advising him of his\n\nMiranda rights.         Id. at 76-77.   Second, \"any statement made freely\n\nand voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course,\n\nadmissible       in    evidence.\"   Lopez,    380   F.3d    at   545     (internal\n\nquotation and citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f                In our view, the district court correctly concluded that\n\nthese Miranda exceptions apply to Navarro's statements prior to\n\nbeing asked \"Who's Tommy?\" The only questions that the officers\n\nasked      before      this    question    were    booking   questions,    and   the\n\nadditional information that Navarro provided before the \"Tommy\"\n\nquestion was thus volunteered.              And, as we have set forth above,\n\nthe district court excluded all the statements made in response to\n\nthe one non-booking question.               The admission of Navarro's other\n\nstatements did not violate Miranda.3\n\nB.         Role in Offense Enhancement\n\n                Navarro argues that the evidence was insufficient to show\n\nthat       he   held    a     managerial   or     supervisory   position   in    the\n\nconspiracy.4        He asserts that the testimony of the Massachusetts\n\nconspirators shows that he was an ordinary participant and that\n\nMattos and Janci Feliz were the only leaders.                He also asserts that\n\nthe Maine conspirators' testimony regarding his threats was not\n\ncredible.\n\n\n\n       3\n      In so ruling, we reject Navarro's entreaty that we disbelieve\nthe officers' testimony as to what happened. The district court\naccepted the officer's testimony and our review of the record\npersuades us that the court's credibility determinations were not\nclearly erroneous.\n       4\n      The relevant section of the guidelines provides that a\ndefendant's offense level be increased by three levels based upon\nhis role as a manager or supervisor in the criminal conduct if the\ncriminal conduct involved five or more participants or was\notherwise extensive. See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b). There is no dispute\nthat there were five or more participants in the conspiracy.\n\n                                           -10-\n\f           The   district   court   concluded   that   a   three-level\n\nenhancement was appropriate because Navarro acted as a manager in\n\nthe conspiracy by controlling its assets and directing at least one\n\nother participant.    We review the district court's application of\n\nan enhancement based upon the defendant's role in the offense for\n\nclear error.     See United States v. May, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200626\"><a href=\"/opinion/200626/united-states-v-may/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2003.\n\n           Navarro's claim that Mattos and Janci Feliz were the true\n\nleaders is a nonstarter.    That Mattos and Janci were higher up the\n\nchain at the conspiracy's Massachusetts \"headquarters\" says nothing\n\nabout whether Navarro acted as a \"local\" supervisor of the Maine\n\nconspirators, as the district court found.

Application of the Safety Valve\n\n            McLean, Feliz, and Berguette do not contest the propriety\n\nof the two-level enhancement that they received under U.S.S.G. §\n\n2D1.1(b)(1),5 but they challenge the district court's conclusion\n\nthat they were ineligible for the safety valve.                  The court found,\n\ninsofar as is relevant,6 that the safety valve was unavailable\n\nbecause, in the court's view, each of the three conspirators\n\npossessed   the    .22    caliber   handgun    during      the    course   of   the\n\nconspiracy.        Appellants    contend     that   only    proof     of   \"actual\n\npossession\" is sufficient to foreclose the application of the\n\nsafety    valve,    and   that   even   if    constructive         possession    is\n\nsufficient (as the court found), there was inadequate evidence to\n\nestablish such possession.\n\n            As suggested above, the \"safety valve\" provision allows\n\na defendant to avoid the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence\n\nso long as the defendant and the offense meet certain enumerated\n\n\n\n     5\n      Section 2D1.1(b)(1) provides for a two level increase in the\noffense level \"[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) is\npossessed . . . .\"\n     6\n      Shortly before the sentencing proceedings in this case, we\nheld that a co-conspirator's possession of a firearm will not\nforeclose the application of the safety valve in favor of another\nco-conspirator who did not possess the firearm.

He further\n\ntestified     that     McLean   and    Feliz   were     present   during    the\n\ntransaction, and that he and McLean physically handled the gun. He\n\nrecounted that, after the exchange, he placed the gun in the closet\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fof the right bedroom.      At Navarro's trial, Feliz testified that he\n\nhad only been shown the gun the night of the raid by Marques, that\n\nit was unloaded, that Marques put it in his bedroom closet, and\n\nthat he did not know who owned it.\n\n           Agent LaChance testified that the unloaded .22 caliber\n\npistol was found in the right bedroom in a small closet on the left\n\nside of the room.    He further testified that a picture of Crystal\n\nMcLean and two suitcases belonging to Berguette and Feliz were also\n\nfound in the closet. On cross-examination, LaChance clarified that\n\nthe gun was not in plain view, and he conceded that at least\n\nFeliz's suitcase was actually found in the living room.                 At the\n\nsentencing hearing, Feliz admitted that Marques had shown him the\n\ngun and that he knew where it was stored, but emphasized that he\n\nand Berguette were staying in the living room rather than the right\n\nbedroom in the days before the raid.       He also testified that, at\n\nthe time of the raid, his suitcase was in the living room in\n\nanticipation of his imminent departure for Springfield.\n\n           1. McLean's Arguments\n\n           McLean   primarily   contends   that    the     district    court's\n\ndecision cannot stand because McLean had no knowledge of the\n\nfirearm.   The government responds that the evidence supports the\n\nruling because the gun was seized from the trailer McLean owned,\n\nthe trailer was the focus of the drug operation, McLean and four\n\nco-conspirators     were    arrested   there,     McLean     knew     his   co-\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fconspirators wanted to acquire guns, and McLean knew that some of\n\nhis co-conspirators were armed because they had threatened his\n\ndaughter at gunpoint.10\n\n            In our view, the record reveals insufficient grounds for\n\nconcluding that McLean had knowledge of the .22 caliber pistol.11\n\nHe did not stay in the room where the weapon was found.    Instead,\n\nat this point in the conspiracy, McLean spent most of his time in\n\nhis room.    Moreover, because the pistol was not acquired until a\n\nfew days before the raid, it could not have been the weapon used to\n\nthreaten Crystal McLean in October. Finally, that McLean was aware\n\nthat his co-conspirators were interested in 9 mm pistols is not\n\nsufficient evidence that McLean knew that his co-conspirators had\n\nactually acquired a .22 caliber pistol.       In sum, we think the\n\ninference of knowledge too tenuous to stand.12\n\n\n     10\n      McLean's presentence report (\"PSR\") recounted how the .22\ncaliber handgun had been found, how McLean had tried to obtain guns\nfor the drug-selling team members and himself from the CI, and that\nNavarro had threatened Crystal at gunpoint.\n     11\n      We recognize that Marques' testimony at Navarro's trial\ntended to establish that McLean knew about and physically possessed\nthe firearm. However, there is no indication in the record that\nthe sentencing judge, who also presided over the Navarro trial,\nconsidered or relied on this evidence in any manner in sentencing\nMcLean. The government did not make this evidence part of McLean's\nsentencing record and did not argue it in any fashion below or on\nappeal; thus defense counsel had no opportunity to challenge it.\nTherefore, we will not consider this evidence in reviewing McLean's\ninstant appeal.\n     12\n      Moreover, even if McLean had knowledge of the gun, we\nquestion whether there is a basis in the record for finding that he\nhad the power to exercise dominion and control over it. We have\n\n                                -19-\n\f          2.   Berguette's Arguments\n\n          Berguette,   like   McLean,   contends   he   did   not   have\n\nconstructive possession of the .22 caliber handgun because he was\n\nunaware that the firearm existed.   The government argues that such\n\nknowledge can be inferred because Berguette stayed in the room in\n\nwhich the gun was found, his suitcase was found in the closet with\n\nthe gun, and (as recounted in the PSR) Birkbeck stated that the\n\nBerguette had acquired the gun for himself.\n\n          As with McLean, there is inadequate evidence to infer\n\nthat Berguette had actual knowledge of the gun.13       That the drug-\n\n\n\nnoted that, when McLean balked at taking Birkbeck's place, Navarro\nthreatened his daughter at gunpoint. Moreover, both his daughter\nand future son-in-law were held as de facto prisoners for McLean's\ndrug debt. Significantly, the district court specifically found\nthat McLean was not in control of the drugs or proceeds located in\nthe same bedroom of the trailer as the gun.       These undisputed\nfacts, coupled with McLean's increased drug use and withdrawal into\nhis room late in the conspiracy, strongly support a conclusion that\nMcLean did not exercise dominion and control over his co-\nconspirators or their property.\n     13\n      As to knowledge, only Birkbeck's statement in the PSR ties\nBerguette directly to the firearm. But Berguette challenged the\nadmissibility of the Birkbeck statement, asserting that the\ngovernment never provided the relevant notes to counsel and that\nthe government represented that it would not rely on the Birkbeck\nstatement at sentencing. Berguette's counsel renewed this\ncontention on appeal. So far as the record discloses, this issue\nwas not expressly resolved in the district court. However, a fair\nreading of the sentencing transcript reveals that the Birkbeck\nstatement was not considered. First, the only statements referred\nto at sentencing were those of LaChance, Marques, and Feliz; it is\nunlikely that Birkbeck's highly incriminating statement would have\nbeen forgotten by both sides. Second, the government only argued\nconstructive possession at sentencing, even though Birkbeck's\nstatement, if credited, demonstrates actual possession.\n\n                                -20-\n\fselling teams sought 9 mm pistols does not by itself mean Berguette\n\nknew about this .22 caliber pistol.                     Further, Berguette did not\n\nlive in the right bedroom during the period the that gun was in the\n\ntrailer, and Agent LaChance's testimony was less than definitive as\n\nto    the    location      of   Berguette's     suitcase.          The   most   relevant\n\ncircumstance is that Berguette participated in drug transactions in\n\nthe right bedroom while the handgun was in the closet.                       But without\n\nmore, this is not enough to show knowledge of the hidden gun.                          As\n\nwe    have    said,    mere     proximity      to   a    firearm    is   inadequate    to\n\nestablish constructive possession.                      See Weems, 322 F.3d at 24.\n\nThis is true even if the defendant is near the gun in a room\n\ndevoted to narcotics activity.                 See Torres-Maldonado, 14 F.3d at\n\n103 (insufficient evidence to support conviction under 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c) where there was no evidence that defendant had knowledge of\n\ngun hidden in tote bag on couch where defendant was sitting);\n\nUnited States v. Pena-Sarabia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778493\"><a href=\"/opinion/778493/unites-states-of-america-v-veronica-pena-sarabia/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 985 & 989 (10th Cir.\n\n2002)(wife did not possess co-conspirator husband's gun, which he\n\nkept under the couple's bed with cocaine supply, because she had no\n\nknowledge that the gun existed).\n\n              3.      Feliz's Arguments\n\n              Like McLean and Berguette, Feliz argues that the record\n\nfails to establish that he had constructive possession of the\n\nfirearm.      But unlike McLean and Berguette, Feliz concedes that he\n\nhad    knowledge      of    the   gun,   and    focuses      on    whether    there   was\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fsufficient evidence to find that he met the other elements of\n\nconstructive possession.        The government responds that Feliz's\n\nknowledge of the weapon, his role in the conspiracy, and the\n\ncircumstances of his arrest provide ample evidence to ground the\n\ndistrict court's finding.\n\n            It is undisputed that Feliz knew about the gun, knew\n\nwhere it was hidden, engaged in drug sales in the right bedroom in\n\nclose proximity to the hidden weapon, and was arrested in the right\n\nbedroom with crack and drug proceeds around him.          As knowledge is\n\nuncontested, the issue is whether the record establishes that Feliz\n\nhad the power and intention to exert dominion and control over the\n\nfirearm.\n\n            The power component is fairly straightforward. Feliz was\n\nclose enough to the firearm to pick it up at any time.             This is\n\nenough.     See Van Horn, 277 F.3d at 55 (power element established\n\nbecause    defendant   could   reach   into   adjacent   bucket   and   take\n\nphysical possession of the explosives).         That Marques was next to\n\nhim and capable of doing the same is irrelevant, as possession can\n\nbe joint.    See id. at 56 (\"Exclusive access is not a prerequisite\n\nto possession . . . .\")\n\n            There is also a sufficient basis for inferring intent.\n\nAs a practical matter, Feliz could well have intended to use the\n\ngun for protection in the event of trouble with one of the crack\n\nsales. Cf. Carlos-Cruz, 352 F.3d at 510 (defendants \"had power and\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fintention to retrieve the firearms if and when the upcoming drug\n\ntransactions    turned    sour\").       Further,       the   gun    was   among     the\n\nproceeds of the drug sales, which Feliz was obliged to protect for\n\nNavarro.    Cf. Zavala Maldonado, 23 F.3d at 8 (intent to store and\n\ntransfer narcotics to confederate).                In sum, Feliz's proximity to\n\nthe weapon, coupled with his knowledge of the weapon and role in\n\nthe conspiracy, is more than sufficient to establish constructive\n\npossession.      Cf.    Nieves-Burgos,        62    F.3d   at    438    (evidence    of\n\npossession sufficient for conviction under 18 U.S.C. §924(c) where\n\nactive participant in drug conspiracy arrested in hotel room with\n\ncash, narcotics, and firearm in tote bag two feet from where he\n\nsat).\n\nD.   Booker Claims\n\n            Appellants     Berguette     and       Navarro      filed   supplemental\n\nbriefs before this case was argued challenging their sentences on\n\nBlakely grounds.       Subsequent to argument, the Supreme Court issued\n\nits decision in United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), and\n\nthis court issued its decision in United States v. Antonakopoulos,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2005).        As a consequence,            we ordered further\n\nsupplemental briefing.\n\n            Berguette argues that any Booker error should be deemed\n\npreserved     because    he   sought    a     downward       departure     from     the\n\nguidelines sentence, Booker error should be deemed a structural\n\nerror for which prejudice should be presumed, and there was a\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\freasonable probability that he would receive a lower sentence on\n\nremand.    As we have already determined that Berguette's sentence\n\nmust be vacated and remanded, we need not address his claims.\n\n           Navarro argues that he preserved any Booker error, in\n\neffect, by arguing in the district court that the evidence was\n\ninadequate to support an enhancement for Navarro's role in the\n\noffense.     Alternatively, Navarro argues that the plain error\n\nstandard is met because there is a reasonable probability that\n\nNavarro would receive a lower sentence on remand.              In particular,\n\nNavarro argues that the district judge would be free under the new\n\nregime to give more weight to such factors as Navarro's youth, his\n\nprospects for rehabilitation, his lack of guidance, the malignant\n\ninfluence of his uncle, his responsibilities to his children, and\n\nthe much lower sentences received by the other co-conspirators.\n\n           A claim of Booker error is preserved \"if the defendant\n\nbelow argued Apprendi or Blakely error or that the Guidelines were\n\nunconstitutional.\" Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 76. Navarro raised\n\nno such argument below.         Thus, Navarro's only hope is to establish\n\nplain error.\n\n           To make such a showing, a defendant must demonstrate (1)\n\nan error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights,\n\nand (4) that seriously impairs the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.             Id. at 77.      The first two\n\nprongs are     met   if   the   district     court   treated   the   Sentencing\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fGuidelines as mandatory during sentencing.           Id.       As to the third\n\nprong, the defendant must show a \"reasonable probability that the\n\ndistrict court would impose a different sentence more favorable to\n\nthe defendant under the new 'advisory Guidelines' Booker regime.\"\n\nId. at 75.    The reasonable probability standard \"is not met by the\n\nmere assertion that the court might have given the defendant a more\n\nfavorable sentence.\"      Id. at 80.   One category of claims that might\n\nwarrant remand on plain error review is the one involving arguments\n\nthat   a   mitigating    factor   existed    but   was   not    available    for\n\nconsideration    under    the   \"mandatory\"    Guidelines.        Id.   at   81.\n\nNavarro attempts to locate his argument within this category, but\n\nwe are not persuaded.\n\n             First, Navarro actually made the mitigating arguments\n\nthat he now posits before the district court.                    He does not\n\nelaborate how he could make them more convincingly on remand.\n\nSecond, nothing in the transcript indicates that the court was in\n\nany way moved by these arguments.             We note that Navarro was\n\nsentenced in the middle of the guideline range, rather than at the\n\nbottom, and so the district court could have given him a lower\n\nsentence under the old regime.             That it did not do so speaks\n\nvolumes.     Also, the court stated that it believed the sentence to\n\nbe justified by the vast quantities of drugs that the conspiracy\n\ninjected into society, and by Navarro's \"arrogant and malicious\n\nattitude toward the well-being of others,\" as manifested by his\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\f\"terrible threats.\"     There is nothing here that establishes a\n\nreasonable probability of a lower sentence on remand.\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the reasons stated above, McLean and Berguette's\n\nsentences are vacated and their cases are remanded for resentencing\n\nin accordance with this opinion. Feliz's sentence is affirmed, and\n\nNavarro's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\f</pre>",
