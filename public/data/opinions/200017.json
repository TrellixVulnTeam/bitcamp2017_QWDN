This action arises out of Kaveh Afrasiabi’s\n\narrest by officers of the Harvard University Police Department\n\n(HUPD) on a warrant charging him with extortion and threats.                The\n\nevents that led to the filing of this action relate to a conflict\n\nbetween Afrasiabi and Roy P. Mottahedeh, the director of Harvard\n\nUniversity’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies (CMES). Reza Alavi,\n\na research associate at CMES, received an anonymous hate letter\n\ndescribing    how   the   writer   had       forced   Shobhana   Rana,   Alavi’s\n\nassistant, to withdraw $500 from Alavi’s bank account.                     Rana\ninformed Alavi of this attempted extortion.                Alavi reported the\n\nincident to HUPD, which launched an investigation conducted by\nOfficer Lauren Donahue and Detective Richard Mederos.              As a result\nof this investigation, Mederos obtained an arrest warrant and took\n\nAfrasiabi into custody.        When Rana, presented with an in-court\nphoto array, was unable to identify Afrasiabi as the extortionist,\nhe was released and charges were dropped.                 When Afrasiabi next\n\nappeared at a public lecture at Harvard, he was served with a no-\ntrespass notice signed by Harvard’s Police Chief, Francis Riley,\nexcluding him from the Harvard grounds.               This action followed.\n\n             The amended complaint in counts one and two charged\nHarvard (and CMES), Riley, Mederos, Donahue, Mottahedeh, Alavi and\nRana with conspiring to deprive Afrasiabi of his constitutional\n\nrights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985, by wrongful\narrest. Count three charged Harvard, HUPD, Riley and Mederos with\n\nviolating Afrasiabi’s constitutional rights by excluding him from\n\n                                         2\n\fpublic lectures on Harvard property.\n\n              The    district        court    granted    summary    judgment    to   all\n\ndefendants other than Alavi, Rana and Mederos on counts one and two\nand to the Harvard defendants on count three.                    Following a ten-day\n\ntrial on the remaining claims, the court granted judgment as a\n\nmatter of law in favor of Alavi and Rana and the jury returned a\nverdict for Mederos.\n\n                                        Discussion\n\n              Afrasiabi     cites      principally       three   errors    on   appeal:\n\nfirst,   the       grant   of    judgment      on   counts    one   and   two   to   the\ndefendants other than Mederos; second, the denial of his motion for\n\nnew   trial    premised         on   the     exclusion   of   the   testimony     of   a\nhandwriting expert; and third, the grant of summary judgment on his\nclaim based on the no-trespass notice.\n\n              1.     Judgment for defendants other than Mederos on the\n\nconspiracy claims.          Afrasiabi charged the defendants other than\n\nMederos with having conspired with Mederos to cause his wrongful\n\narrest in violation of § 1983. The jury returned a verdict for\n\nMederos on the substantive § 1983 claim for wrongful arrest.                         This\n\nverdict “fatally eviscerated” Afrasiabi’s conspiracy claim against\n\nthe remaining defendants based on wrongful arrest.                        See Earle v.\n\nBenoit, 850 F.2d 836, 845 (1st Cir. 1988) (jury’s determination\n\nthat State Troopers’ searches and arrests of plaintiff did not\n\nviolate plaintiff’s civil rights “fatally eviscerated” conspiracy\n\nclaims, making the erroneous directed verdict on conspiracy claims\n\n\n                                               3\n\fharmless error).   Thus judgment for defendants on counts one and\n\ntwo was properly granted.\n\n          2.   Denial   of   the   new   trial   motion   based   on   newly\n\ndiscovered evidence.1   Afrasiabi contends that he is entitled to a\n\nnew trial because the district court erroneously excluded the\n\nevidence of his handwriting expert offered on the eighth day of\n\ntrial to support his contention that he was not the author of the\nhate letter.   The court’s ruling excluding this evidence rested on\n\nAfrasiabi’s failure to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n26(a)(2)(C) requiring pretrial disclosure of expert testimony.\nAfrasiabi contended that the envelopes on which the handwriting\nexpert opined were not produced to him until the eve of trial,\nwhile Harvard maintained they were produced twenty months earlier.\n\nThe district court in making its ruling necessarily rejected\nAfrasiabi’s contention. Afrasiabi’s proffer fell short not only\nbecause of his failure to comply with the timing requirements but\n\nalso because the letter from the expert he produced failed woefully\nto meet the rule’s formal requirements of disclosure, i.e., a\nsigned written report by the expert stating his opinion and the\nreasons therefor and providing other specified information.            Given\n\nAfrasiabi’s flouting of the rule, and his failure to produce the\n\nexpert in court to be deposed or testify when given the opportunity\n\nby the district judge, the exclusion of the evidence was well\n\n\n     1\n      Afrasiabi brought his motion under Rule 60(b).       However,\nbecause a motion for a new trial is properly brought under Rule 59,\nwe treat it as such.\n\n                                    4\n\fwithin   the    district    court’s    discretion.        See   Ortiz-Lopez    v.\n\nSociedad Espanola de Auxilio Mutuo, 248 F.3d 29 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nIt follows that the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion was not an\nabuse of discretion.        See Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n            3. Judgment for the Harvard defendants on the no-trespass\n\norder claim.         The district court ruled that as a Massachusetts\n\nproperty owner, Harvard had the right to exclude the plaintiff from\n\nits property.        The Massachusetts no-trespass statute entitles a\n\nproperty owner to summarily revoke a licensee’s right to enter the\n\npremises.      MASS . GEN . LAWS ch. 266 § 120 (West 2002).      See Alexis v.\n\nMcDonald’s Rest. of Mass., 67 F.3d 341, 350-51 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nAfrasiabi advances several arguments:            that the order sweeps too\n\nbroadly by excluding him from premises of Harvard’s lessees, that\n\nthere is no evidence of misconduct warranting the order, that\n\nAfrasiabi has a civil right of access to Harvard, and that the\n\nimplication of the order against him is defamatory.                      However,\n\nAfrasiabi      has   offered   no    facts   evidencing    a    denial    of   his\n\nconstitutional rights.         Thus, on this record, defendants acted\n\nwithin their lawful authority in issuing the no-trespass order\nagainst Afrasiabi.\n            We have considered Afrasiabi’s other contentions and find\n\nthem to be without merit.           Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n                                         5\n\f",

This\n\nverdict “fatally eviscerated” Afrasiabi’s conspiracy claim against\n\nthe remaining defendants based on wrongful arrest.
