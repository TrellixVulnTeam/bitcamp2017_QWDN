Jan-Vinicius Alexandrescu\n\n(\"Alexandrescu\") is a citizen and native of Romania, as are his\n\nwife     Luminita      Alexandrescu    (\"Luminita\")      and        son     Bogdan\n\nAlexandrescu.    Alexandrescu petitions this court for review of the\n\ndenial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").                        An\n\nimmigration    judge     (\"IJ\")    denied   the   application       but    granted\n\nvoluntary departure, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\naffirmed.    We deny the petition for review.\n\n                                      I.\n\n             Alexandrescu first entered the United States in January\n\n1993 on a crewman's visa while working on a cruise ship.                  He stayed\n\npast   the    visa's    expiration    in    February   1993    and    filed     an\n\napplication for asylum in May 1993, listing his wife and son as\n\nderivative applicants.        His wife came to the United States on a\n\nvisitor's visa in June 1993, which expired in December 1993. Their\n\nson did not arrive in the United States until June 1994; he also\n\nentered on a visitor's visa, which expired in December 1994.                   All\n\noverstayed.\n\n             The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued Notices\n\nto Appear to each family member on December 1, 2005.                          At a\n\npreliminary hearing before an IJ on March 14, 2006, they conceded\n\ntheir removability. On June 6, 2006, Alexandrescu filed an updated\n\nasylum    application,     again    listing    his   family    as    derivative\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fapplicants.   We summarize Alexandrescu's statement in his asylum\n\napplication and the testimony received by the IJ on October 30,\n\n2006.\n\n          Alexandrescu graduated as a lieutenant from the Romanian\n\nmilitary's Air Force Academy and flew MIG-16s from 1982 to 1984.\n\nHe was then assigned to fly more advanced aircraft in an elite\n\nsquadron, in which he remained until he was transferred to the\n\nreserves in 1990.\n\n          As a military officer, Alexandrescu was required to join\n\nthe Communist Party and to espouse the party's ideology, even\n\nthough he privately disagreed with it.    At a high-level Communist\n\nParty meeting in 1987, he complained that the emphasis on politics\n\nand ideology in the Air Force was preventing sufficient training\n\nand resulting in unnecessary accidents.    After a superior warned\n\nhim that such statements could hurt his career, he recanted them.\n\n          Alexandrescu met Luminita in 1988. She lived in Macesti,\n\na village near the Yugoslav border, and is of Yugoslav descent.   To\n\nleave his base and visit her, Alexandrescu needed the permission of\n\nhis superiors; they granted the requests even though they were\n\nuneasy because the Yugoslav border was a high-traffic avenue for\n\nescape from Romania.\n\n          That December, Alexandrescu requested permission to marry\n\nLuminita. His superiors warned him against the marriage because of\n\nher Yugoslav descent, yet he was granted the necessary permission.\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fShortly thereafter, he was again called before the base's Communist\n\nParty Secretary, Gheorge Pasc, and the base's intelligence officer,\n\nIon Rusu; they interrogated him about his marriage and asked him to\n\ndivorce his wife because of her ethnic origin, but he refused.\n\n          That same day, Alexandrescu was told he would not fly\n\nagain until further notice, and for the next six months he claims\n\nhe \"suffer[ed] the persecutions\" of his superiors.       He had to\n\nreport on his daily activities, and he concluded that his telephone\n\nwas bugged and his mail checked by the Securitate (the Romanian\n\nsecret police). For example, when his mother received a phone call\n\nin April 1989 from her brother (who had emigrated legally to West\n\nGermany) wishing her a happy Easter, then a prohibited holiday in\n\nRomania, Alexandrescu was summoned to Rusu's office to explain the\n\ncall and answer questions about his uncle.   In September 1989, his\n\nmother sought permission to travel to West Germany to visit this\n\nsame brother; Alexandrescu testified that if he had not been an\n\nofficer in the Air Force and had not signed for her as a sort of\n\nguarantor, she would never have been allowed to leave the country.\n\nHe also testified that she left and returned without further\n\ndifficulties.\n\n          During this time he was also tasked with manual labor\n\nthat he considered beneath his \"quality as an officer,\" including\n\nagricultural work and cleaning toilets.      Alexandrescu felt that\n\nthis \"denigrate[d\" his \"rank and . . . position\" and made him an\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f\"inferior human being.\"           However, in June 1989, he was allowed to\n\nresume his flight duties.\n\n            In October 1989, Alexandrescu was told that he would be\n\nmoved to the Air Force reserves \"through the back door,\" which\n\nmeant that he would not be eligible for \"qualified positions\"\n\n(professional placements) in civilian life.                Around the same time,\n\nAlexandrescu      raised    the    training      issue    again    at     a    big   party\n\nmeeting.    Pasc, the Communist Party representative on the base,\n\ntold him that his remarks at the party meeting \"signed [the]\n\ndecision\" to move him into the reserves and that in civilian life,\n\nAlexandrescu would \"not be more than a Garbage Man.\"\n\n            Alexandrescu remained in the Air Force's employ, however,\n\nduring the Romanian democratic revolution from December 1989 to\n\nMarch 1990.    He claims his formal transfer to the reserves in April\n\n1990 occurred shortly after he spoke out again about inadequate\n\ntraining.     As for why the government would wish to keep him in the\n\nreserves if it was so displeased with his criticisms, Alexandrescu\n\nsurmised that the military had invested millions of dollars in his\n\ntraining    and   that     by   keeping    him    \"next    to     them\"       they   could\n\n\"persecute [him] more for what [he] did in the past.\"\n\n            In civilian life, Alexandrescu obtained a commercial\n\npilot license and a job with the government-run airline.                        That job\n\nwas short-lived, an outcome which Alexandrescu blames on Pasc, who\n\nhad become the human resources office manager for the airline: when\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fAlexandrescu was forced to resign, Pasc told Alexandrescu that\n\nbecause Alexandrescu had been unwilling to support the old regime\n\nduring the revolution, he would \"suffer for the rest of [his] life\n\neven in Democratic Romania.\"     The government-issued commercial\n\npilot's license, however, was never revoked.\n\n           Alexandrescu testified that he \"was surprised in the\n\nbeginning how easy [he] got the [government airline] job knowing\n\n[his] record.\"   He could not explain why he was hired and allowed\n\nto work without harassment for the first few months if his record\n\nwas indeed ruined, guessing that maybe it was because Romania was\n\na \"free country now and more democratic,\" or because \"they play[ed]\n\na game,\" or because he was only flying domestic, not international,\n\nflights.\n\n           Between 1991 and 1993, Luminita worked for an independent\n\nnewspaper opposed to the administration, which was still controlled\n\nby former Communist Party members.    Meanwhile Alexandrescu worked\n\nodd jobs as a security guard.   Alexandrescu's last job in Romania\n\nwas with Air Antares, a new private airline.\n\n           In January 1993, Alexandrescu took a job as a waiter with\n\na cruise line and freely left Romania on a Romanian passport.\n\nAlexandrescu considered returning to Romania in April 1993 after\n\nhis father-in-law's death, but Luminita begged him not to return\n\nbecause people whom she assumed were associated with the military\n\nhad contacted her about his whereabouts and she feared for his\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fsafety.      He testified that as a member of the reserves, he is\n\nrequired to report any changes in address to the military, which he\n\nhas not done.      He also claimed that these visitors had told his\n\nwife they knew he had applied for political asylum in the United\n\nStates, even though that knowledge would appear to predate his\n\nactual application.\n\n             He fears now that on return to Romania, he will be\n\nprosecuted for failing to report his whereabouts to the military,\n\nwhich would result in his imprisonment.                 He testified that his\n\nparents told him that people from the military had come by their\n\nhouse in 2003 or 2004 looking for him, though he had not asked them\n\nto send a corroborating letter to the court and he had not\n\nmentioned this fact in his revised asylum application.\n\n             The IJ issued her oral decision on October 30, 2006. The\n\nIJ   found    no   persecution   in    this     case    and   enumerated   many\n\ninadequately       explained     and         uncorroborated     elements     of\n\nAlexandrescu's story.     The IJ also concluded that Alexandrescu had\n\ntotally   failed    to   establish     a     well-founded     fear   of   future\n\npersecution, noting that it was unclear who the feared persecutor\n\nwas and why, fifteen years later in a democratic Romania, the same\n\npeople would be willing and able to persecute him if he returned.\n\nOn appeal, the BIA affirmed, emphasizing that Alexandrescu had not\n\nalleged events amounting to persecution.               This petition followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f                                            II.\n\n              We start with Alexandrescu's asylum claim.                   To establish\n\nhis eligibility for asylum, Alexandrescu must establish that he\n\neither      suffered    past       persecution     (which      creates    a    rebuttable\n\npresumption of future persecution) or has a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.            8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b).             We must accept the\n\nadministrative findings of fact \"unless any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould    be   compelled       to    conclude      to   the    contrary.\"         8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4)(B).            \"When the BIA adopts the IJ's opinion and\n\ndiscusses      some    of   the     bases   for    the   IJ's        decision,    we   have\n\nauthority to review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions.\"                           Ouk v.\n\nGonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 110 (1st Cir. 2006).                         The BIA's and IJ's\n\nconclusion that Alexandrescu suffered no persecution is amply\n\nsupported by the record.\n\n              Assuming without deciding that all other considerations\n\nare resolved in petitioner's favor -- that his complaints about\n\ninsufficient training constituted political speech and were the\n\ncause of his poor treatment, that his testimony was credible and\n\nfully corroborated, and that asylum can be granted on the basis of\n\neconomic persecution -- Alexandrescu simply has not alleged conduct\n\nsevere enough to constitute persecution.                        There is no serious\n\neconomic deprivation here: Alexandrescu lost his job, not his\n\nability to make a living.            See Khalil v. Ashcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 53,\n\n55   (1st     Cir.    2003)    (denying     petition         where    asylum     applicant\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fdescribed economic hardship not amounting to persecution); see\n\nalso, e.g., Zhuang v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 884, 890 (8th Cir. 2006)\n\n(\"Fears   of    economic      hardship       or   lack   of   opportunity     do    not\n\nestablish a well-founded fear of persecution.\"); Musabelliu v.\n\nGonzales, 442 F.3d 991, 994 (7th Cir. 2006) (denying asylum where\n\napplicant was discharged from military for opposing corruption\n\nbecause \"[l]osing a job is not persecution\" and \"[a]sylum is not a\n\nform of unemployment compensation\").               Further, as both the BIA and\n\nthe IJ emphasized, Alexandrescu was granted permission for his\n\nevery request: to visit and then marry Luminita despite her ethnic\n\nbackground, to allow his mother to travel to West Germany, and to\n\nleave Romania to work abroad on a cruise ship.\n\n              Because      Alexandrescu      has    failed    to   establish       past\n\npersecution, he does not benefit from a presumption of future\n\npersecution and must offer specific proof that his fear of future\n\npersecution is well-founded.           8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).           He argues\n\nthat he will face legal prosecution and imprisonment upon return\n\nbecause he has failed to inform the military of his whereabouts and\n\nwill   thus    be    considered    a   deserter.         Generally,   a     sovereign\n\nnation's normal penalties for avoiding military service are not\n\nconsidered persecution.           Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 118, 126\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).          While there are some exceptions to this general\n\nrule of thumb, none of them apply here.                       See id.       Further,\n\nAlexandrescu        has    provided    no    information      about   the    current\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fpractices of the Romanian military, making it impossible to tell\n\nwhether he would be punished for not reporting his movements,\n\nespecially as he has never been called up for duty.           Cf. Mojsilovic\n\nv. INS, 156 F.3d 743, 747-48 (7th Cir. 1998) (finding no well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution where asylum applicant failed to\n\ndemonstrate that he would in fact be punished for refusing to serve\n\nin Yugoslav army).\n\n           Nor has he clarified who would seek to persecute him on\n\na   protected   ground:   not   only   could   he   provide    no   specifics\n\nregarding which of his former alleged persecutors still hold\n\npositions of power, but he also failed to explain how punishment\n\nfor disobeying a military law could be connected to his political\n\nviews.    See Foroglou v. INS, 170 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(punishment for refusing to serve in a military is generally not\n\npersecution on account of membership in a protected group).\n\n           Because the standard for withholding of removal is more\n\ndifficult to meet than the asylum standard, Alexandrescu's failure\n\nto satisfy the asylum standard means that his withholding of\n\nremoval claim must also fail.          Khalil, 337 F.3d at 56.       We also\n\ndeny the petition as to the CAT claim because Alexandrescu has not\n\nalleged any past or potential future treatment that could possibly\n\nbe considered torture.\n\n           The petition is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

His superiors warned him against the marriage because of\n\nher Yugoslav descent, yet he was granted the necessary permission.\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fShortly thereafter, he was again called before the base's Communist\n\nParty Secretary, Gheorge Pasc, and the base's intelligence officer,\n\nIon Rusu; they interrogated him about his marriage and asked him to\n\ndivorce his wife because of her ethnic origin, but he refused.\n\n          That same day, Alexandrescu was told he would not fly\n\nagain until further notice, and for the next six months he claims\n\nhe \"suffer[ed] the persecutions\" of his superiors.       He had to\n\nreport on his daily activities, and he concluded that his telephone\n\nwas bugged and his mail checked by the Securitate (the Romanian\n\nsecret police). For example, when his mother received a phone call\n\nin April 1989 from her brother (who had emigrated legally to West\n\nGermany) wishing her a happy Easter, then a prohibited holiday in\n\nRomania, Alexandrescu was summoned to Rusu's office to explain the\n\ncall and answer questions about his uncle.   In September 1989, his\n\nmother sought permission to travel to West Germany to visit this\n\nsame brother; Alexandrescu testified that if he had not been an\n\nofficer in the Air Force and had not signed for her as a sort of\n\nguarantor, she would never have been allowed to leave the country.\n\nHe also testified that she left and returned without further\n\ndifficulties.\n\n          During this time he was also tasked with manual labor\n\nthat he considered beneath his \"quality as an officer,\" including\n\nagricultural work and cleaning toilets.      Alexandrescu felt that\n\nthis \"denigrate[d\" his \"rank and . . . position\" and made him an\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f\"inferior human being.\"           However, in June 1989, he was allowed to\n\nresume his flight duties.\n\n            In October 1989, Alexandrescu was told that he would be\n\nmoved to the Air Force reserves \"through the back door,\" which\n\nmeant that he would not be eligible for \"qualified positions\"\n\n(professional placements) in civilian life.                Around the same time,\n\nAlexandrescu      raised    the    training      issue    again    at     a    big   party\n\nmeeting.    Pasc, the Communist Party representative on the base,\n\ntold him that his remarks at the party meeting \"signed [the]\n\ndecision\" to move him into the reserves and that in civilian life,\n\nAlexandrescu would \"not be more than a Garbage Man.\"\n\n            Alexandrescu remained in the Air Force's employ, however,\n\nduring the Romanian democratic revolution from December 1989 to\n\nMarch 1990.    He claims his formal transfer to the reserves in April\n\n1990 occurred shortly after he spoke out again about inadequate\n\ntraining.     As for why the government would wish to keep him in the\n\nreserves if it was so displeased with his criticisms, Alexandrescu\n\nsurmised that the military had invested millions of dollars in his\n\ntraining    and   that     by   keeping    him    \"next    to     them\"       they   could\n\n\"persecute [him] more for what [he] did in the past.\"\n\n            In civilian life, Alexandrescu obtained a commercial\n\npilot license and a job with the government-run airline.                        That job\n\nwas short-lived, an outcome which Alexandrescu blames on Pasc, who\n\nhad become the human resources office manager for the airline: when\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fAlexandrescu was forced to resign, Pasc told Alexandrescu that\n\nbecause Alexandrescu had been unwilling to support the old regime\n\nduring the revolution, he would \"suffer for the rest of [his] life\n\neven in Democratic Romania.\"     The government-issued commercial\n\npilot's license, however, was never revoked.\n\n           Alexandrescu testified that he \"was surprised in the\n\nbeginning how easy [he] got the [government airline] job knowing\n\n[his] record.\"   He could not explain why he was hired and allowed\n\nto work without harassment for the first few months if his record\n\nwas indeed ruined, guessing that maybe it was because Romania was\n\na \"free country now and more democratic,\" or because \"they play[ed]\n\na game,\" or because he was only flying domestic, not international,\n\nflights.\n\n           Between 1991 and 1993, Luminita worked for an independent\n\nnewspaper opposed to the administration, which was still controlled\n\nby former Communist Party members.    Meanwhile Alexandrescu worked\n\nodd jobs as a security guard.   Alexandrescu's last job in Romania\n\nwas with Air Antares, a new private airline.\n\n           In January 1993, Alexandrescu took a job as a waiter with\n\na cruise line and freely left Romania on a Romanian passport.\n\nAlexandrescu considered returning to Romania in April 1993 after\n\nhis father-in-law's death, but Luminita begged him not to return\n\nbecause people whom she assumed were associated with the military\n\nhad contacted her about his whereabouts and she feared for his\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fsafety.      He testified that as a member of the reserves, he is\n\nrequired to report any changes in address to the military, which he\n\nhas not done.      He also claimed that these visitors had told his\n\nwife they knew he had applied for political asylum in the United\n\nStates, even though that knowledge would appear to predate his\n\nactual application.\n\n             He fears now that on return to Romania, he will be\n\nprosecuted for failing to report his whereabouts to the military,\n\nwhich would result in his imprisonment.                 He testified that his\n\nparents told him that people from the military had come by their\n\nhouse in 2003 or 2004 looking for him, though he had not asked them\n\nto send a corroborating letter to the court and he had not\n\nmentioned this fact in his revised asylum application.\n\n             The IJ issued her oral decision on October 30, 2006. The\n\nIJ   found    no   persecution   in    this     case    and   enumerated   many\n\ninadequately       explained     and         uncorroborated     elements     of\n\nAlexandrescu's story.     The IJ also concluded that Alexandrescu had\n\ntotally   failed    to   establish     a     well-founded     fear   of   future\n\npersecution, noting that it was unclear who the feared persecutor\n\nwas and why, fifteen years later in a democratic Romania, the same\n\npeople would be willing and able to persecute him if he returned.\n\nOn appeal, the BIA affirmed, emphasizing that Alexandrescu had not\n\nalleged events amounting to persecution.               This petition followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f                                            II.\n\n              We start with Alexandrescu's asylum claim.                   To establish\n\nhis eligibility for asylum, Alexandrescu must establish that he\n\neither      suffered    past       persecution     (which      creates    a    rebuttable\n\npresumption of future persecution) or has a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.            8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b).             We must accept the\n\nadministrative findings of fact \"unless any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould    be   compelled       to    conclude      to   the    contrary.\"         8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4)(B).            \"When the BIA adopts the IJ's opinion and\n\ndiscusses      some    of   the     bases   for    the   IJ's        decision,    we   have\n\nauthority to review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions.\"                           Ouk v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202443\"><a href=\"/opinion/202443/ouk-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 110 (1st Cir. 2006).

There is no serious\n\neconomic deprivation here: Alexandrescu lost his job, not his\n\nability to make a living.            See Khalil v.

Further, as both the BIA and\n\nthe IJ emphasized, Alexandrescu was granted permission for his\n\nevery request: to visit and then marry Luminita despite her ethnic\n\nbackground, to allow his mother to travel to West Germany, and to\n\nleave Romania to work abroad on a cruise ship.\n\n              Because      Alexandrescu      has    failed    to   establish       past\n\npersecution, he does not benefit from a presumption of future\n\npersecution and must offer specific proof that his fear of future\n\npersecution is well-founded.           8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).           He argues\n\nthat he will face legal prosecution and imprisonment upon return\n\nbecause he has failed to inform the military of his whereabouts and\n\nwill   thus    be    considered    a   deserter.
