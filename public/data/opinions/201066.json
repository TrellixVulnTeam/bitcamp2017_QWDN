Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Christopher C.\nFuller, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Alison Marie Igoe, Senior\nLitigation Counsel, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                             June 15, 2004\n\f            Per Curiam.   Mario Saade, a Lebanese citizen, requested\n\nasylum and other relief on the ground that he feared persecution by\n\nthe   Hezbollah   based   upon   his   political   opinion.       After   an\n\nevidentiary hearing, an immigration judge found him ineligible for\n\nasylum, withholding of deportation, or relief under the United\n\nNations   Convention   Against   Torture.1      Because   Saade    did    not\n\notherwise contest his removability, the immigration judge ordered\n\nhis deportation to Lebanon.        The Board of Immigration Appeals\n\nsummarily affirmed that decision, and this petition for review\n\nfollowed.\n\n            This court's review of the immigration judge's decision2\n\nis narrowly circumscribed.       To reverse the immigration judge's\n\nfactual findings, we \"must find that the evidence not only supports\n\nthat conclusion, but compels it.\"        INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 n.1 (1992); see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). The immigration\n\njudge's application of the relevant legal standards to his factual\n\ncircumstances is entitled to substantial deference as well. INS v.\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 448 (1987); Alverez-Flores v. INS,\n\n909 F.2d 1, 3-4, 5 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      On appeal, Saade does not challenge the immigration judge's\ndenial of relief under the Convention Against Torture.\n      2\n      Because the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the\nimmigration judge's decision without opinion, we review the\ndecision of the immigration judge. Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365,\n373 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            Under those standards, the immigration judge's decision\n\nin this case easily survives review.            To be eligible for asylum,\n\nSaade had to prove that he \"is unable or unwilling to return to .\n\n. . [his] country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of . . . political opinion.\"                   8 U.S.C.\n\n§§   1101(a)(42),     1158(b)(1);    see   also   8   C.F.R.   §   1208.13(b);\n\nRavindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992).               Even putting\n\ncredibility issues aside and viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the petitioner, we are not \"compelled\" to conclude\n\nthat Saade was persecuted in the past or has a well-founded fear of\n\nbeing   persecuted     in   the   future   on   account   of   his   political\n\nopinions.\n\n            Further    assuming,    without     deciding,   that     Saade   had\n\naccomplished the \"daunting task,\" Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15\n\n(1st Cir. 2003), of proving past persecution or a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution, the immigration judge still would have been\n\njustified in finding him ineligible for asylum based on his failure\n\nto demonstrate the required nexus between the alleged persecution\n\nand his political opinions.         See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(b)(1) and (2)(i)(A); Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 483;\n\nGuzman, 327 F.3d at 15. The immigration judge's conclusion that no\n\nsuch nexus had been shown is amply supported by the evidence.\n\n            Like the alien in Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 483, Saade\n\nhas failed to show that his alleged persecutors \"will persecute him\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fbecause of [his] political opinion, rather than because of his\n\nrefusal to fight [or work] with them.\"   Under those circumstances,\n\nthe immigration judge correctly found him ineligible for asylum,\n\nand Saade has shown no compelling basis for us to reverse that\n\nresult.\n\n           Because the standard for withholding of deportation is\n\neven more stringent than that for granting asylum, INS v. Stevic,\n\n467 U.S. 407, 428-29 (1984), the immigration judge correctly\n\nconcluded that if Saade was not eligible for asylum, then, a\n\nfortiori, he was not eligible for withholding of deportation\n\neither.   See Guzman, 327 F.3d at 15.\n\n          Accordingly, the petition for review is denied and the\n\norder of the Board of Immigration Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
