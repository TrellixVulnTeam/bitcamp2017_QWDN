Torres-Pabón, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, Chief, Criminal Division, and Jenifer Y.\nHernández-Vega, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 12, 2004\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.    Keila Medina-Román (\"Medina\")\n\nseeks an opportunity to withdraw her plea of guilty to the charge\n\nof aiding and abetting the carrying of a firearm in the commission\n\nof a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924\n\n(c)(1).1   Medina challenges the district court's colloquy under\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11, arguing that she was inadequately informed of\n\nthe elements of the crime to which she pleaded guilty.       Because\n\nMedina did not object to the Rule 11 proceedings below, we review\n\nunder the plain error standard.       See United States v. Vonn, 535\n\nU.S. 55, 59 (2002).      After careful review, we affirm Medina's\n\nconviction.\n\n                                 I.\n\n           Medina was a police officer for the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico when she became involved in a conspiracy to distribute\n\ncontrolled substances.    The operation involved the transport for\n\npayment of what Medina and her co-defendants believed to be a\n\n\n\n1\n    This sub-section enhances the sentences of\n\n           any person who, during and in relation to any\n           crime of violence or drug trafficking crime\n           (including a crime of violence or drug\n           trafficking crime that provides for an\n           enhanced punishment if committed by the use of\n           a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for\n           which the person may be prosecuted in a court\n           of the United States, uses or carries a\n           firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such\n           crime, possesses a firearm . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A).\n\n                                -2-\n\fquantity of cocaine.   On November 11, 2001, Medina was indicted on\n\nseven counts along with three co-defendants, including her husband\n\nRichard Díaz-Baerga. Arrested on November 27th, Medina pleaded not\n\nguilty to all counts at her arraignment three days later.    After\n\nthe government filed motions designating evidence, Medina filed for\n\na change of plea hearing, which was granted.\n\n          During the plea colloquy at issue, Medina pleaded guilty\n\nto Counts One, Two, and Seven, pursuant to a written plea agreement\n\nwith the government filed that day.2    With respect to Count Two,\n\ncharging Medina and Díaz-Baerga with aiding and abetting each other\n\nin carrying firearms in relation to a drug trafficking offense,\n\nMedina informed the district court that although she was aware that\n\nthere were weapons in the conspiracy, she herself never carried a\n\nweapon.\n\n          The question before us is whether the colloquy that\n\nensued demonstrates that the district court \"inform[ed] [Medina]\n\nof, and determine[d] that [she] underst[ood] . . . the nature of\n\nthe charge to which the plea [was] offered,\" Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(c)(1), and if not, whether any error commands the exercise of\n\nour discretion to give Medina an opportunity to withdraw her plea.\n\n\n2\n     Count One charged Medina with conspiracy to distribute\ncontrolled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and\n846.   Count Two, at issue in this appeal, charged aiding and\nabetting the carrying of firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924\n(c)(1)(A), and Count Seven charged forfeiture under 21 U.S.C.\n§ 853. As part of the plea agreement, all other counts against\nMedina were dismissed.\n\n                                -3-\n\f                                           II.\n\n             Rule     11(c)(1)3     establishes     a   procedure    for   district\n\ncourts to ensure that a plea of guilty is constitutionally valid.\n\nAbove all else, a plea must be \"'voluntary' and 'intelligent.'\"\n\nBousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 618 (1998) (quoting Brady\n\nv. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748 (1970)).               The Supreme Court has\n\n\"long held that a plea does not qualify as intelligent unless a\n\ncriminal defendant first receives 'real notice of the true nature\n\nof    the   charge    against     [her],    the   first   and   most    universally\n\nrecognized requirement of due process.'\"                  Id. (quoting Smith v.\n\nO'Grady, 312 U.S. 329, 334 (1941)).               Reading the indictment to the\n\ndefendant     is     not   enough   if     \"the   District   Court     subsequently\n\nmisinformed [her] as to the elements of a § 924(c)(1) offense.\"\n\nId.\n\n             The first step, then, is to ascertain the elements the\n\ngovernment would have to prove to convict Medina under Count Two.\n\nThe parties direct us to superficially divergent circuit authority\n\nwhich we must reconcile in order to proceed.                      The government\n\ncontends that its burden at trial would be to \"prove that the\n\naccomplice must have known 'to a practical certainty' that a\n\n\n\n\n3\n    The colloquy took place on April 26, 2002, prior to the\namendment of Rule 11 on December 1, 2002. The operative language\nfrom the former Rule 11(c)(1) is now found at Rule 11(b)(1)(G).\n\n                                           -4-\n\ffirearm would be used or carried during a qualified offense.\"4        To\n\nsupport this proposition, the government relies primarily on United\n\nStates v. Balsam, 203 F.3d 72 (1st Cir. 2000), and United States v.\n\nDeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306 (1st Cir. 1994).      Medina, on the other hand,\n\ndraws our attention to United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d\n\n1142 (1st Cir. 1995), to support her contention that the government\n\ncarries the burden of not one, but two, elements on this count: it\n\nmust   show    the   defendant's   knowledge   of   the   co-defendant's\n\n\"carrying\" of a firearm and, further, that the defendant has \"taken\n\nsome affirmative action that facilitated violation of § 924(c)(1).\"\n\nId. at 1150.\n\n          Our cases have failed to make transparent the relation\n\nbetween these two articulations, and as we must begin our analysis\n\nof the Rule 11 proceedings with an understanding of what Medina\n\n\n4\n   In its brief, the government states that \"[s]ince a Pinkerton-\ntype of liability is appropriate as an alternative theory in a\n§ 924(c) violation, Keila Medina-Román could be held responsible\nfor a firearm carried by a co-conspirator in furtherance of a drug\ntrafficking crime, if she was a member of the conspiracy, and if it\nwas reasonably foreseeable to her that a firearm would be carried\nin relation to the drug trafficking offense.\" It is true that a\njury may be instructed to consider the liability theory established\nin Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946), as an\nalternative ground for conviction under § 924(c)(1) in addition to\nan aiding and abetting theory under 18 U.S.C. § 2. United States\nv. Shea, 150 F.3d 44, 49-51 (1st Cir. 1998). During the colloquy,\nhowever, the government stated before the district court that\n\"Count Two is charged under the aiding and abetting theory.\"\nBecause Medina was not informed that she was chargeable with Díaz-\nBaerga's carrying of a firearm under the Pinkerton reasonable\nforeseeability standard, our review of the adequacy of the Rule 11\nproceedings tracks the aiding and abetting charge and its burdens\nof proof.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fshould have understood the government to be required to prove at\n\ntrial, we will take the opportunity to discuss the matter here.\n\nThe roots of modern doctrines of aiding and abetting liability can\n\nbe traced to Judge Learned Hand's famous formulation in United\n\nStates v. Peoni, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2d Cir. 1938), and the Supreme\n\nCourt's endorsement of that formulation in Nye & Nissen v. United\n\nStates, 336 U.S. 613, 619 (1949).    As stated by the Court:\n\n          In order to aid and abet another to commit a\n          crime it is necessary that a defendant \"in\n          some sort associate himself with the venture,\n          that he participate in it as in something that\n          he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his\n          action to make it succeed.\"\n\nId. (quoting Peoni, 100 F.2d at 402).   That concise expression has\n\nbeen the source of multifarious approaches to the difficult task of\n\ndetermining what the law requires to convict an accomplice as a\n\nprincipal.   See generally Baruch Weiss, What Were They Thinking?:\n\nThe Mental States of the Aider and Abettor and the Causer under\n\nFederal Law, 70 Fordham L. Rev. 1341 (2002).    We have recognized\n\nthat the requisite burden of proof can vary from one aiding and\n\nabetting crime to another. See, e.g., United States v. Spinney, 65\n\nF.3d 231, 236-37 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that conviction for aiding\n\nand abetting firearm charge under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(d) requires\n\nlesser degree of knowledge than under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)).     We are\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fconcerned here with the crime of aiding and abetting the use or\n\ncarrying of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).5\n\n             Our cases treating the subject have generally involved a\n\nclaim that the government introduced insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport a conviction.         In United States v. Torres-Maldonado, 14\n\nF.3d 95 (1st Cir. 1994), we began our analysis by stating that,\n\n\"[i]t   is   well   settled    in   the   case   law   interpreting   section\n\n924(c)(1) that an 'accomplice must have known to a practical\n\ncertainty that the principal would be [using] a gun.'\"           Id. at 103\n\n(quoting United States v. Powell, 929 F.2d 724, 728 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1991)). The D.C. Circuit's holding in Powell, which we followed in\n\nTorres-Maldonado, explains that the \"[practical certainty] standard\n\nputs the accomplice on a level with the principal, requiring the\n\nsame knowledge for both.\"           Powell, 929 F.2d at 727 (citations\n\nomitted).     By recognizing that when an accomplice is practically\n\ncertain the principal will be carrying or using a gun he bears\n\nguilt for the carrying or use of that weapon as if he were the\n\n\n\n5\n   We follow circuit precedent in requiring the same standard of\nculpability for conviction for aiding and abetting the use of a\nfirearm in violation of § 924(c)(1) as for aiding and abetting the\ncarrying of a firearm in violation of § 924(c)(1).      See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Bennett, 75 F.3d 40, 45 (1st Cir. 1996); United\nStates v. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 747-48 (1st Cir. 1996); United\nStates v. Otero-Méndez, 273 F.3d 46, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2001). But\nsee Note, A Question of Intent: Aiding and Abetting Law and the\nRule of Accomplice Liability Under 924(c), 96 Mich. L. Rev. 783,\n799 (1997) (recommending a more stringent burden of proof for\nconviction for aiding and abetting the carrying of a firearm as\nopposed to its use).\n\n                                      -7-\n\fprincipal, Powell invokes the Peoni principle: if this accomplice\n\nis participating in the predicate crime with a practical certainty\n\nthat his co-defendant is also violating § 924(c)(1), then the\n\nelements are present to infer that regarding the carrying or use of\n\nthe firearm the abettor has \"in some sort associate[d] himself with\n\nthe venture . . . , he participate[d] in it as in something that he\n\nwishe[d] to bring about, [and] that he [sought] by his action to\n\nmake it succeed.\"    Nye & Nissen, 336 U.S. at 619.\n\n           In Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, we were faced with\n\nseveral defendants challenging, inter alia, the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence on aiding and abetting § 924(c) charges.                   The case\n\ninvolved a major drug delivery to a Puerto Rico beach.               After a\n\nraid,   officers   arrested   a   number   of   men   and   found   an   M-16\n\nunderneath a jeep where several of them were hiding.          After citing\n\nto the Peoni formulation (as expressed in First Circuit case law),\n\nwe explained that\n\n           [m]ere association with the principal, or mere\n           presence at the scene of a crime, even when\n           combined with knowledge that a crime will be\n           committed, is not sufficient to establish\n           aiding and abetting liability. The defendant\n           must have taken some affirmative action that\n           facilitated violation of § 924(c)(1).\n\nId. at 1150 (emphasis supplied) (citation omitted).          This language\n\nindicates that proof of aiding and abetting the carrying of a\n\nfirearm includes a distinct facilitation element.              \"Of course,\n\nknowledge that a gun would be carried is also required.\"                 Id.\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f(citing Torres-Maldonado, 14 F.3d at 103, and DeMasi, 40 F.3d at\n\n1316).\n\n           The circumstances in Luciano-Mosquera required us to\n\ndelimit a reasonable factfinder's capacity to infer aiding and\n\nabetting the carrying or use of a firearm based on involvement in\n\na drug or violent conspiracy.   As to defendant Lugo-Maya, we could\n\nnot find the basis for the necessary inferences:\n\n           There was no evidence . . . showing that\n           [Lugo-Maya] took any step to assist the\n           carrying of the M-16 in relation to the drug\n           offense.   Lugo-Maya was not at the meeting\n           where the M-16 was shown.      The government\n           presented no evidence that Lugo-Maya took any\n           steps to procure or otherwise supply the\n           weapons or ammunition.    He was also nowhere\n           near the weapon at the time of his arrest.\n           There was simply insufficient evidence to show\n           beyond a reasonable doubt that he either\n           carried or aided and abetted the carrying of\n           the M-16.\n\nId.   Without addressing whether Lugo-Maya possessed the requisite\n\nknowledge, we determined that his conviction had to be reversed\n\ngiven the dearth of evidence associating Lugo-Maya in any way with\n\nthat part of the drug conspiracy which involved the M-16.\n\n           The \"practical certainty\" test for aiding and abetting\n\nliability is not applied in a vacuum: a defendant's knowledge that\n\nhis confederate would carry or use a firearm can only support\n\naiding and abetting liability if the defendant somehow facilitated\n\nthat carrying.    In the ordinary drug or violent crime, that\n\nfacilitation is part and parcel of the involvement in the drug or\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fviolent scheme.       Cf. DeMasi, 40 F.3d at 1316 n.10 (distinguishing\n\nUnited States v. Medina, 32 F.3d 40 (2d Cir. 1994), in which Second\n\nCircuit reversed conviction on insufficient evidence that defendant\n\n\"consciously and affirmatively assisted\" in § 924(c) violation,\n\nbecause   the      DeMasi   defendant     \"was   present     at    and      played   a\n\nsignificant part in the attempted armed robbery\").                          In United\n\nStates v. Bennett, 75 F.3d 40 (1st Cir. 1996), we rejected a\n\nchallenge     to   the   sufficiency      of   the   evidence      and      observed,\n\nreflecting on Luciano-Mosquera, that \"once knowledge on the part of\n\nthe aider and abettor is established, it does not take much to\n\nsatisfy the facilitation element.\"             Id. at 45.\n\n              Since Luciano-Mosquera, we have sometimes referenced the\n\ntwo-part scheme defined there.          See United States v. Otero-Méndez,\n\n273 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"prosecution must prove that\n\nappellant knew a firearm would be carried or used in a crime of\n\nviolence and that he willingly took some action to facilitate that\n\ncarriage or use\"); United States v. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 748 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (\"evidence was sufficient to show that [defendant] knew\n\nthe shotgun would be used or carried during the robbery and that he\n\ntook   some    action    intending   to    cause     the   gun    to   be    used    or\n\ncarried\"); Bennett, 75 F.3d at 45 (\"conviction can be sustained\n\n. . . if [defendant] knew a firearm would be carried or used by a\n\nco-conspirator in the drug trafficking offense and willingly took\n\nsome action to facilitate the carriage or use\").                  In other cases,\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fwe have applied the uniform \"practical certainty\" test. See United\n\nStates v. Balsam, 203 F.3d 72, 83 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[T]he evidence\n\nsupported    a    rational     inference    that    [defendant]   knew   to   a\n\n'practical certainty' that [co-conspirator] would use a gun in the\n\nsecond robbery.\"); United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 239-40\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (\"This is the rare case in which the evidence . . .\n\nfails the practical certainty test and, therefore, does not justify\n\nthe appellant's conviction for aiding and abetting the principal's\n\nuse of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.\").\n\n             While we acknowledge that the inconsistent expressions\n\nmay engender some confusion, we fail to find any contradiction in\n\nthe law.     Knowledge is the central element of the crime of aiding\n\nand abetting the carrying or use of a firearm in violation of § 924\n\n(c)(1). To support aiding and abetting criminal liability under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2, that knowledge cannot be mere knowledge of a likelihood\n\nthat a firearm will be carried or used but rather must amount to a\n\npractical certainty of the other's carrying or use.               See Spinney,\n\n65 F.3d at 238 (\"'practical certainty' is a rubric that calls for\n\nproof verging on actual knowledge\").          That level of knowledge will\n\nin many instances stem from such an intimate involvement in the\n\nenterprise that the requirement for an affirmative action to\n\nfacilitate       the   crime   inevitably    will     be   met.     In   other\n\ncircumstances, however, a showing of knowledge to a \"practical\n\ncertainty\" may be insufficient on its own.           That is to say, when an\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\faccomplice's affirmative link to a principal's carrying or use of\n\na firearm is not implicit by virtue of participation in the\n\npredicate crime, even where knowledge of the carrying or use of a\n\nfirearm could be inferred by a rational factfinder, the prosecution\n\nmust present evidence permitting the inference that the defendant\n\nwillingly took some step to facilitate the carrying or use in order\n\nto convict of aiding and abetting in violation of § 924(c)(1).   See\n\nLuciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d at 1150-51.\n\n           Accordingly, to convict Medina on a charge of aiding and\n\nabetting a violation of § 924(c) \"[t]he evidence [at trial would\n\nbe] sufficient [only if the government could] show that [Medina]\n\nknew [to a practical certainty] the [firearm] would be used or\n\ncarried during the [drug trafficking offense] and that [she] took\n\nsome action intending to cause the gun to be used or carried.\"\n\nSullivan, 85 F.3d at 748 (citing Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d at\n\n1150).   Therefore, Rule 11(c)(1) entitled Medina to be informed by\n\nthe district court, and to understand, that the government would\n\nhave to prove to a practical certainty her knowledge of Díaz-\n\nBaerga's carrying of a firearm and that she willingly facilitated\n\nthat carrying.\n\n                                III.\n\n           The district court told Medina that as to Count Two \"the\n\ngovernment has to prove that the two defendants that I have\n\nmentioned, yourself and your husband, were aiding and abetting each\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fother or helping each other to commit a crime.\"     When asked, Medina\n\nreplied that she understood.    The court added that \"in the context\n\nof that criminal conduct you knew that firearms would be used or\n\ncarried.\"    When asked, Medina replied that she understood.      The\n\ncourt next stated: \"And it's not necessarily determined whether you\n\nhad it in your pocket or in your holster or not -- do you\n\nunderstand that -- as long as you people, the two of you, were\n\nusing firearms to commit the offense, that is enough for you to be\n\nguilty of this crime.    Do you understand that?\"    Medina responded\n\nthat she did.   The district court then informed Medina of a further\n\ncomponent of the charge, with language that directly recalls Peoni:\n\n\"Here the government also has to prove that you knowingly did -- in\n\nother words, that you had a bad purpose to disobey the law in using\n\n[a firearm] in the context of aiding and abetting firearms during\n\nthe commission of a drug trafficking [offense].\"          When asked,\n\nMedina replied that she understood.\n\n            While we have not explicitly emphasized the \"bad purpose\"\n\ningredient of a § 924(c)(1) aiding and abetting offense in our case\n\nlaw, the foundation for Luciano-Mosquera's recognition of the\n\nwilling facilitation element was that mere knowledge does not make\n\na defendant an aider and abettor unless he has willingly done\n\nsomething to bring about the other's carrying or use of a firearm.\n\nSee Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d at 1149-50 (\"Aiding and abetting\n\nrequires that 'the defendant [have] associated himself with the\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fventure, participated in it as in something he wished to bring\n\nabout, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.'\") (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Álvarez, 987 F.2d 77, 83 (1st Cir. 1993).                      In\n\nother words, by informing Medina that the government had to prove\n\nthat she had a bad purpose as to Díaz-Baerga's carrying of a\n\nfirearm in the execution of the drug trafficking offense, the\n\ndistrict court took steps to ensure that Medina understood (1) that\n\nmere knowledge of the carrying was insufficient for conviction; and\n\n(2) that the additional element involved the demonstration of her\n\nbad purpose as to that carrying.\n\n           The   district   court   did    not   inform    Medina   that    the\n\ngovernment would carry the burden, however slight it might have\n\nbeen under the circumstances, of proving that Medina willingly took\n\naction   facilitating   co-defendant       Díaz-Baerga's       carrying    of   a\n\nfirearm.   However, because Medina did not raise her claim of error\n\nbelow, we can only grant her an opportunity to withdraw her plea if\n\nshe shows with \"reasonable probability that, but for the error,\n\n[s]he would not have entered the plea.\" United States v. Domínguez\n\nBenítez, __ U.S. __, 2004 U.S. Lexis 4177, at *6 (June 14, 2004)\n\n(articulating standard for determining whether a violation of Rule\n\n11   constitutes   reversible   plain      error).        In   conjuring    the\n\ncounterfactual colloquy that would have complied with Rule 11, we\n\nmust be mindful that the \"intelligence\" requirement of a plea of\n\nguilty cuts both ways for a defendant: Rule 11 is disserved if a\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fdefendant chooses trial based on a misappreciation of the weight --\n\nlight or heavy -- of the government's burden as to a charge and its\n\nelements.    The question is whether Medina has persuaded us to a\n\n\"reasonable probability\" that had she understood \"the nature of the\n\ncharge to which the plea [was] offered,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1),\n\nshe would have chosen trial.       Given that Medina pleaded guilty\n\nafter being informed that her knowledge alone would not suffice for\n\nguilt absent proof that she harbored a bad purpose toward the\n\ncarrying of the firearm, she bears a heavy burden indeed.\n\n            To reach our judgment, we review the entire record.\n\nDomínguez Benítez, __ U.S. at __, 2004 U.S. Lexis 4177, at *18;\n\nVonn, 535 U.S. at 74-75. Before the district court's recitation of\n\nthe elements of Count Two, Medina had already stated that \"I was\n\naware there were weapons in this conspiracy, and I told the\n\nundercover agent that a weapon was going to be taken.    That is why\n\nI am accepting this weapons charge.\" The undercover agent referred\n\nto here initiated the drug operation by paying Medina and her\n\nhusband $10,000 as an initial payment for the transportation of the\n\ncocaine. Even before carrying out the operation, therefore, Medina\n\nknew about the carrying of the firearm and talked about it as part\n\nof the plan in which she played a pivotal role.    On the day of the\n\noperation, as admitted to during the colloquy, Medina provided\n\nescort and protection to the vehicle driven by her husband, whom\n\nshe knew was carrying a firearm.    This conduct would easily permit\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fa reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that she\n\naided and abetted the carrying of a firearm.               See, e.g., Bennett,\n\n75 F.3d at 45 (\"[F]acilitation is essentially undisputed since\n\nBennett provided his car to transport himself, his co-conspirators,\n\nand the gun to execute the raid.\").             If the district court had\n\ncorrectly informed Medina of the elements of the crime, we believe\n\nshe would have pleaded guilty.            Medina has failed to persuade us\n\notherwise to a reasonable probability.\n\n              The district court's recitation of the elements of the\n\ncrime   may    have   been   less   than    ideal,   but    the   colloquy   was\n\nconstitutionally      sufficient     to     ensure   that    Medina   made    an\n\nintelligent plea and thereby did not prejudice \"the fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                Olano,\n\n507 U.S. at 736 (quotations and citations omitted).\n\n                                      IV.\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, we find no reversible error in\n\nthe Rule 11 proceedings.       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

Because Medina did not object to the Rule 11 proceedings below, we review under the plain error standard. <i>See United States v. Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002).

The operation involved the transport for payment of what Medina and her co-defendants believed to be a quantity of cocaine. On November 11, 2001, Medina was indicted on seven counts along with three co-defendants, including her husband Richard D&#237;az-Baerga. Arrested on November 27th, Medina pleaded not guilty to all counts at her arraignment three days later.

Above all else, a plea must be \"`voluntary' and `intelligent.'\" <i>Bousley v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 614, 618, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (quoting <i>Brady v. United States,</i> 397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970)). The Supreme Court has \"long held that a plea does not qualify as intelligent unless a criminal defendant first receives `real notice of the true nature of the charge against [her], the first and most universally recognized requirement of due process.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Smith v. O'Grady,</i> 312 U.S. 329, 334, 61 S.Ct. 572, 85 L.Ed. 859 (1941)). Reading the indictment to the defendant is not enough if \"the District Court subsequently misinformed [her] as to the elements of a &#167; 924(c)(1) offense.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first step, then, is to ascertain the elements the government would have to prove to convict Medina under Count Two. The parties direct us to superficially divergent circuit authority which we must reconcile in order to proceed. The government contends that its burden at trial would be to \"prove that the accomplice must have known `to a practical certainty' that a firearm would be used or carried during a qualified offense.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> To support this proposition, the government relies primarily on <i>United States v. Balsam,</i> 203 F.3d 72 (1st Cir.2000), and <i>United States v. DeMasi,</i> 40 F.3d 1306 (1st Cir.1994). Medina, on the other hand, draws our attention to <i>United States v. Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d 1142 (1st Cir.1995), to support her contention that the government carries the burden of not one, but two, elements on this count: it must show the defendant's knowledge of the co-defendant's \"carrying\" of a firearm <i>and,</i> further, that the defendant has \"taken some affirmative action that facilitated violation of &#167; 924(c)(1).\" <i>Id.</i> at 1150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our cases have failed to make transparent the relation between these two articulations, and as we must begin our analysis of the Rule 11 proceedings with an understanding of what Medina should have understood the government to be required to prove at trial, we will take the opportunity to discuss the matter here. The roots of modern doctrines of aiding and abetting liability can be traced to Judge Learned Hand's famous formulation in <i>United States v. Peoni,</i> 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2d Cir.1938), and the Supreme Court's endorsement of that formulation in <i>Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States,</i> 336 U.S. 613, 619, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949). As stated by the Court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to aid and abet another to commit a crime it is necessary that a defendant \"in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Peoni,</i> 100 F.2d at 402). That concise expression has been the source of multifarious approaches to the difficult task of determining what the law requires to convict an accomplice as a principal. <i>See generally</i> Baruch Weiss, <i>What Were They Thinking?: The Mental States of the Aider and Abettor and the Causer under Federal Law,</i> 70 Fordham L.Rev. 1341 (2002). We have recognized that the requisite burden of proof can vary from one aiding and abetting crime to another. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Spinney,</i> 65 F.3d 231, 236-37 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that conviction for aiding and abetting firearm charge under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113(d) requires lesser degree of knowledge than under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)). We are concerned here with the crime of aiding and abetting the use or carrying of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our cases treating the subject have generally involved a claim that the government introduced insufficient evidence to support a conviction. In <i>United States v. Torres-Maldonado,</i> 14 F.3d 95 (1st Cir.1994), we began our analysis by stating that, \"[i]t is well settled in the case law interpreting section 924(c)(1) that an `accomplice must have known to a practical certainty that the principal would be [using] a gun.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 103 (quoting <i>United States v. Powell,</i> 929 F.2d 724, 728 (D.C.Cir.1991)). The D.C. Circuit's holding in <i>Powell,</i> which we followed in <i>Torres-Maldonado,</i> explains that the \"[practical certainty] standard puts the accomplice on a level with the principal, requiring the same knowledge for both.\" <i>Powell,</i> 929 F.2d at 727 (citations omitted). By recognizing that when an accomplice is practically certain the principal will be carrying or using a gun he bears guilt for the carrying or use of that weapon as if he were the principal, <i>Powell</i> invokes the <i>Peoni</i> principle: if this accomplice is participating in the predicate crime with a practical certainty that his co-defendant is also violating &#167; 924(c)(1), then the elements are present to infer that regarding the carrying or use of the firearm the abettor has \"in some sort associate[d] himself with the venture ..., he participate[d] in it as in something that he wishe[d] to bring about, [and] that he [sought] by his action to make it succeed.\" <i>Nye &amp; Nissen,</i> 336 U.S. at 619, 69 S.Ct. 766.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d 1142, we were faced with several defendants challenging, <i>inter alia,</i> the sufficiency of the evidence on aiding and abetting &#167; 924(c) charges. The case involved a major drug delivery to a Puerto Rico beach. After a raid, officers arrested a number of men and found an M-16 underneath a jeep where several of them were hiding. After citing to the <i>Peoni</i> formulation (as expressed in First Circuit case law), we explained that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[m]ere association with the principal, or mere presence at the scene of a crime, even when combined with knowledge that a crime will be committed, is not sufficient to establish aiding and abetting liability. <i>The defendant must have taken some affirmative action that facilitated violation of &#167; 924(c)(1).</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1150 (emphasis supplied) (citation omitted). This language indicates that proof of aiding and abetting the carrying of a firearm includes a distinct facilitation element. \"Of course, knowledge that a gun would be carried is also required.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Torres-Maldonado,</i> 14 F.3d at 103, and <i>DeMasi,</i> 40 F.3d at 1316).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances in <i>Luciano-Mosquera</i> required us to delimit a reasonable factfinder's capacity to infer aiding and abetting the carrying or use of a firearm based on involvement in a drug or violent conspiracy. As to defendant Lugo-Maya, we could not find the basis for the necessary inferences:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no evidence ... showing that [Lugo-Maya] took any step to assist the carrying of the M-16 in relation to the drug offense. Lugo-Maya was not at the meeting where the M-16 was shown. The government presented no evidence that Lugo-Maya took any steps to procure or otherwise supply the weapons or ammunition. He was also nowhere near the weapon at the time of his arrest. There was simply insufficient evidence to show beyond a reasonable doubt that he either carried or aided and abetted the carrying of the M-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Without addressing whether Lugo-Maya possessed the requisite knowledge, we determined that his conviction had to be reversed given the dearth of evidence associating Lugo-Maya in any way with that part of the drug conspiracy which involved the M-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"practical certainty\" test for aiding and abetting liability is not applied in a vacuum: a defendant's knowledge that his confederate would carry or use a firearm can only support aiding and abetting liability if the defendant somehow facilitated that carrying. In the ordinary drug or violent crime, that facilitation is part and parcel of the involvement in the drug or violent scheme. <i>Cf. DeMasi,</i> 40 F.3d at 1316 n. 10 (distinguishing <i>United States v. Medina,</i> 32 F.3d 40 (2d Cir.1994), in which Second Circuit reversed conviction on insufficient evidence that defendant \"consciously and affirmatively assisted\" in &#167; 924(c) violation, because the <i>DeMasi</i> defendant \"was present at and played a significant part in the attempted armed robbery\"). In <i>United States v. Bennett,</i> 75 F.3d 40 (1st Cir.1996), we rejected a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence and observed, reflecting on <i>Luciano-Mosquera,</i> that \"once knowledge on the part of the aider and abettor is established, it does not take much to satisfy the facilitation element.\" <i>Id.</i> at 45.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Luciano-Mosquera,</i> we have sometimes referenced the two-part scheme defined there. <i>See United States v. Otero-M&#233;ndez,</i> 273 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir.2001) (\"prosecution must prove that appellant knew a firearm would be carried or used in a crime of violence and that he willingly took some action to facilitate that carriage or use\"); <i>United States v. Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d 743, 748 (1st Cir.1996) (\"evidence was sufficient to show that [defendant] knew the shotgun would be used or carried during the robbery and that he took some action intending to cause the gun to be used or carried\"); <i>Bennett,</i> 75 F.3d at 45 (\"conviction can be sustained... if [defendant] knew a firearm would be carried or used by a co-conspirator in the drug trafficking offense and willingly took some action to facilitate the carriage or use\"). In other cases, we have applied the uniform \"practical certainty\" test. <i>See United States v. Balsam,</i> 203 F.3d 72, 83 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[T]he evidence supported a rational inference that [defendant] knew to a `practical certainty' that [co-conspirator] would use a gun in the second robbery.\"); <i>United States v. Spinney,</i> 65 F.3d 231, 239-40 (1st Cir.1995) (\"This is the rare case in which the evidence ... fails the practical certainty test and, therefore, does not justify the appellant's conviction for aiding and abetting the principal's use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we acknowledge that the inconsistent expressions may engender some confusion, we fail to find any contradiction in the law. Knowledge is the central element of the crime of aiding and abetting the carrying or use of a firearm in violation of &#167; 924(c)(1). To support aiding and abetting criminal liability under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, that knowledge cannot be mere knowledge of a likelihood that a firearm will be carried or used but rather must amount to a practical certainty of the other's carrying or use. <i>See Spinney,</i> 65 F.3d at 238 (\"`practical certainty' is a rubric that calls for proof verging on actual knowledge\"). That level of knowledge will in many instances stem from such an intimate involvement in the enterprise that the requirement for an affirmative action to facilitate the crime inevitably will be met. In other circumstances, however, a showing of knowledge to a \"practical certainty\" may be insufficient on its own. That is to say, when an accomplice's affirmative link to a principal's carrying or use of a firearm is not implicit by virtue of participation in the predicate crime, even where knowledge of the carrying or use of a firearm could be inferred by a rational factfinder, the prosecution must present evidence permitting the inference that the defendant willingly took some step to facilitate the carrying or use in order to convict of aiding and abetting in violation of &#167; 924(c)(1). <i>See Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d at 1150-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, to convict Medina on a charge of aiding and abetting a violation of &#167; 924(c) \"[t]he evidence [at trial would be] sufficient [only if the government could] show that [Medina] knew [to a practical certainty] the [firearm] would be used or carried during the [drug trafficking offense] and that [she] took some action intending to cause the gun to be used or carried.\" <i>Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d at 748 (citing <i>Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d at 1150). Therefore, Rule 11(c)(1) entitled Medina to be informed by the district court, and to understand, that the government would have to prove to a practical certainty her knowledge of D&#237;az-Baerga's carrying of a firearm and that she willingly facilitated that carrying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court told Medina that as to Count Two \"the government has to prove that the two defendants that I have mentioned, yourself and your husband, were aiding and abetting each other or helping each other to commit a crime.\" When asked, Medina replied that she understood. The court added that \"in the context of that criminal conduct you knew that firearms would be used or carried.\" When asked, Medina replied that she understood. The court next stated: \"And it's not necessarily determined whether you had it in your pocket or in your holster or not &#8212; do you understand that &#8212; as long as you people, the two of you, were using firearms to commit the offense, that is enough for you to be guilty of this crime. Do you understand that?\" Medina responded that she did. The district court then informed Medina of a further component of the charge, with language that directly recalls <i>Peoni:</i>\"Here the government also has to prove that you knowingly did &#8212; in other words, that you had a bad purpose to disobey the law in using [a firearm] in the context of aiding and abetting firearms during the commission of a drug trafficking [offense].\" When asked, Medina replied that she understood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have not explicitly emphasized the \"bad purpose\" ingredient of a &#167; 924(c)(1) aiding and abetting offense in our case law, the foundation for <i>Luciano-Mosquera's</i> recognition of the willing facilitation element was that mere knowledge does not make a defendant an aider and abettor unless he has willingly done something to bring about the other's carrying or use of a firearm. <i>See Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d at 1149-50 (\"Aiding and abetting requires that `the defendant [have] associated himself with the venture, participated in it as in something he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. &#193;lvarez,</i> 987 F.2d 77, 83 (1st Cir.1993)). In other words, by informing Medina that the government had to prove that she had a bad purpose as to D&#237;az-Baerga's carrying of a firearm in the execution of the drug trafficking offense, the district court took steps to ensure that Medina understood (1) that mere knowledge of the carrying was insufficient for conviction; and (2) that the additional element involved the demonstration of her bad purpose as to that carrying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not inform Medina that the government would carry the burden, however slight it might have been under the circumstances, of proving that Medina willingly took action facilitating co-defendant D&#237;az-Baerga's carrying of a firearm. However, because Medina did not raise her claim of error below, we can only grant her an opportunity to withdraw her plea if she shows with \"reasonable probability that, but for the error, [s]he would not have entered the plea.\" <i>United States v. Dom&#237;nguez Ben&#237;tez,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2336, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) (articulating standard for determining whether a violation of Rule 11 constitutes reversible plain error). In conjuring the counterfactual colloquy that would have complied with Rule 11, we must be mindful that the \"intelligence\" requirement of a plea of guilty cuts both ways for a defendant: Rule 11 is disserved if a defendant chooses trial based on a misappreciation of the weight &#8212; light or heavy &#8212; of the government's burden as to a charge and its elements. The question is whether Medina has persuaded us to a \"reasonable probability\" that had she understood \"the nature of the charge to which the plea [was] offered,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1), she would have chosen trial. Given that Medina pleaded guilty after being informed that her knowledge alone would not suffice for guilt absent proof that she harbored a bad purpose toward the carrying of the firearm, she bears a heavy burden indeed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To reach our judgment, we review the entire record. <i>Dom&#237;nguez Ben&#237;tez,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2340; <i>Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. at 74-75, 122 S.Ct. 1043. Before the district court's recitation of the elements of Count Two, Medina had already stated that \"I was aware there were weapons in this conspiracy, and I told the undercover agent that a weapon was going to be taken. That is why I am accepting this weapons charge.\" The undercover agent referred to here initiated the drug operation by paying Medina and her husband $10,000 as an initial payment for the transportation of the cocaine. Even before carrying out the operation, therefore, Medina knew about the carrying of the firearm and talked about it as part of the plan <i>in which she played a pivotal role.</i> On the day of the operation, as admitted to during the colloquy, Medina provided escort and protection to the vehicle driven by her husband, whom she knew was carrying a firearm. This conduct would easily permit a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that she aided and abetted the carrying of a firearm. <i>See, e.g., Bennett,</i> 75 F.3d at 45 (\"[F]acilitation is essentially undisputed since Bennett provided his car to transport himself, his co-conspirators, and the gun to execute the raid.\").

By recognizing that when an accomplice is practically certain the principal will be carrying or using a gun he bears guilt for the carrying or use of that weapon as if he were the principal, <i>Powell</i> invokes the <i>Peoni</i> principle: if this accomplice is participating in the predicate crime with a practical certainty that his co-defendant is also violating &#167; 924(c)(1), then the elements are present to infer that regarding the carrying or use of the firearm the abettor has \"in some sort associate[d] himself with the venture ..., he participate[d] in it as in something that he wishe[d] to bring about, [and] that he [sought] by his action to make it succeed.\" <i>Nye &amp; Nissen,</i> 336 U.S. at 619, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104655\"><a href=\"/opinion/104655/nye-nissen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In the ordinary drug or violent crime, that facilitation is part and parcel of the involvement in the drug or violent scheme. <i>Cf.

Knowledge is the central element of the crime of aiding and abetting the carrying or use of a firearm in violation of &#167; 924(c)(1). To support aiding and abetting criminal liability under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, that knowledge cannot be mere knowledge of a likelihood that a firearm will be carried or used but rather must amount to a practical certainty of the other's carrying or use. <i>See Spinney,</i> 65 F.3d at 238 (\"`practical certainty' is a rubric that calls for proof verging on actual knowledge\"). That level of knowledge will in many instances stem from such an intimate involvement in the enterprise that the requirement for an affirmative action to facilitate the crime inevitably will be met. In other circumstances, however, a showing of knowledge to a \"practical certainty\" may be insufficient on its own. That is to say, when an accomplice's affirmative link to a principal's carrying or use of a firearm is not implicit by virtue of participation in the predicate crime, even where knowledge of the carrying or use of a firearm could be inferred by a rational factfinder, the prosecution must present evidence permitting the inference that the defendant willingly took some step to facilitate the carrying or use in order to convict of aiding and abetting in violation of &#167; 924(c)(1). <i>See Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d at 1150-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, to convict Medina on a charge of aiding and abetting a violation of &#167; 924(c) \"[t]he evidence [at trial would be] sufficient [only if the government could] show that [Medina] knew [to a practical certainty] the [firearm] would be used or carried during the [drug trafficking offense] and that [she] took some action intending to cause the gun to be used or carried.\" <i>Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d at 748 (citing <i>Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d at 1150). Therefore, Rule 11(c)(1) entitled Medina to be informed by the district court, and to understand, that the government would have to prove to a practical certainty her knowledge of D&#237;az-Baerga's carrying of a firearm and that she willingly facilitated that carrying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court told Medina that as to Count Two \"the government has to prove that the two defendants that I have mentioned, yourself and your husband, were aiding and abetting each other or helping each other to commit a crime.\" When asked, Medina replied that she understood. The court added that \"in the context of that criminal conduct you knew that firearms would be used or carried.\" When asked, Medina replied that she understood. The court next stated: \"And it's not necessarily determined whether you had it in your pocket or in your holster or not &#8212; do you understand that &#8212; as long as you people, the two of you, were using firearms to commit the offense, that is enough for you to be guilty of this crime. Do you understand that?\" Medina responded that she did. The district court then informed Medina of a further component of the charge, with language that directly recalls <i>Peoni:</i>\"Here the government also has to prove that you knowingly did &#8212; in other words, that you had a bad purpose to disobey the law in using [a firearm] in the context of aiding and abetting firearms during the commission of a drug trafficking [offense].\" When asked, Medina replied that she understood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have not explicitly emphasized the \"bad purpose\" ingredient of a &#167; 924(c)(1) aiding and abetting offense in our case law, the foundation for <i>Luciano-Mosquera's</i> recognition of the willing facilitation element was that mere knowledge does not make a defendant an aider and abettor unless he has willingly done something to bring about the other's carrying or use of a firearm. <i>See Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d at 1149-50 (\"Aiding and abetting requires that `the defendant [have] associated himself with the venture, participated in it as in something he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. &#193;lvarez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601487\"><a href=\"/opinion/601487/united-states-v-victor-manuel-alvarez-united-states-v-diana-matos/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.1993)). In other words, by informing Medina that the government had to prove that she had a bad purpose as to D&#237;az-Baerga's carrying of a firearm in the execution of the drug trafficking offense, the district court took steps to ensure that Medina understood (1) that mere knowledge of the carrying was insufficient for conviction; and (2) that the additional element involved the demonstration of her bad purpose as to that carrying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not inform Medina that the government would carry the burden, however slight it might have been under the circumstances, of proving that Medina willingly took action facilitating co-defendant D&#237;az-Baerga's carrying of a firearm. However, because Medina did not raise her claim of error below, we can only grant her an opportunity to withdraw her plea if she shows with \"reasonable probability that, but for the error, [s]he would not have entered the plea.\" <i>United States v.

In conjuring the counterfactual colloquy that would have complied with Rule 11, we must be mindful that the \"intelligence\" requirement of a plea of guilty cuts both ways for a defendant: Rule 11 is disserved if a defendant chooses trial based on a misappreciation of the weight &#8212; light or heavy &#8212; of the government's burden as to a charge and its elements. The question is whether Medina has persuaded us to a \"reasonable probability\" that had she understood \"the nature of the charge to which the plea [was] offered,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1), she would have chosen trial. Given that Medina pleaded guilty after being informed that her knowledge alone would not suffice for guilt absent proof that she harbored a bad purpose toward the carrying of the firearm, she bears a heavy burden indeed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To reach our judgment, we review the entire record. <i>Dom&#237;nguez Ben&#237;tez,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2340; <i>Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. at 74-75, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118487\"><a href=\"/opinion/118487/united-states-v-vonn/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Before the district court's recitation of the elements of Count Two, Medina had already stated that \"I was aware there were weapons in this conspiracy, and I told the undercover agent that a weapon was going to be taken. That is why I am accepting this weapons charge.\" The undercover agent referred to here initiated the drug operation by paying Medina and her husband $10,000 as an initial payment for the transportation of the cocaine. Even before carrying out the operation, therefore, Medina knew about the carrying of the firearm and talked about it as part of the plan <i>in which she played a pivotal role.</i> On the day of the operation, as admitted to during the colloquy, Medina provided escort and protection to the vehicle driven by her husband, whom she knew was carrying a firearm. This conduct would easily permit a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that she aided and abetted the carrying of a firearm. <i>See, e.g., Bennett,</i> 75 F.3d at 45 (\"[F]acilitation is essentially undisputed since Bennett provided his car to transport himself, his co-conspirators, and the gun to execute the raid.\").
