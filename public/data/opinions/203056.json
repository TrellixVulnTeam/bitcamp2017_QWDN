Bourget, for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, U.S. Attorney’s\nOffice, with whom Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on\nbrief for the appellee.\n\n\n\n                           December 6, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f     BARBADORO, District Judge.             Defendant-Appellant, Augustus\n\nEdgerton, was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6) by\n\nmaking a false statement to a firearms dealer during an attempt to\n\npurchase a firearm. Edgerton argues on appeal that the trial judge\n\nerred when he instructed the jury that it could convict Edgerton if\n\nthe government proved that he knowingly made a false statement\n\nwhile attempting to purchase a firearm and either “the statement\n\nwas intended to or was likely to deceive the firearms dealer about\n\na fact material to the lawfulness of the sale.”             Edgerton argues\n\nthat the instruction was improper because it permitted the jury to\n\nconvict without proof that he made the false statement with the\n\nintention to deceive.      We affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n     The facts are recited in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict because this appeal follows a conviction. United States v.\n\nO’Shea, 426 F.3d 475, 477 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n     On January 14, 2004, Lieutenant Daniel Pelletier of the\n\nHoulton (Maine) police department personally served Edgerton with\n\na Temporary Order for Protection from Abuse issued by a local state\n\ncourt   judge.      The   temporary    order   prohibited    Edgerton   from\n\nthreatening, molesting, harassing, or otherwise disturbing the\n\npeace of Victoria French, his intermittent girlfriend and mother of\n\nhis child.       The temporary order notified Edgerton of a hearing\n\nscheduled for February 2, 2004.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f     At the hearing, which Edgerton did not attend, the state court\n\njudge entered a permanent Order for Protection from Abuse, which\n\nprohibited   Edgerton    from   “threatening,   assaulting,   molesting,\n\nattacking, harassing or otherwise abusing” French.       The permanent\n\norder stated that it was effective immediately and would remain in\n\neffect until February 1, 2006.       The order contained a notice, in\n\ncapital letters and underlined, bold type: “POSSESSION OF A FIREARM\n\nOR AMMUNITION WHILE THIS ORDER IS IN EFFECT IS PROHIBITED UNDER\n\nFEDERAL AND/OR STATE LAW IF ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING BOXES\n\nHAVE BEEN CHECKED:      A-1, A-2, OR F.”   The judge checked boxes A-1\n\nand A-2.\n\n     Corporal Thomas Donahue of the Houlton Police Department\n\nserved the permanent order on Edgerton at his home on February 15,\n\n2004.   Donahue told Edgerton when he served the order that it\n\nwould remain in effect for two years.      Donahue pointed out various\n\naspects of the order to Edgerton, including the bold, underlined,\n\ncapitalized language set forth above.\n\n     On April 1, 2004, Edgerton attempted to acquire a .45 caliber\n\nsemi-automatic handgun from a federally licensed firearms dealer,\n\nMACS Trading Post, in Houlton, Maine.           As with any attempted\n\npurchase of a firearm from a licensed dealer, Edgerton was required\n\nto fill out ATF Form 4473.        Edgerton answered “No” to Question\n\n12(h), which asks:      “Are you subject to a court order restraining\n\nyou from harassing, stalking, or threatening your child or an\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fintimate partner or child of such partner? (See Important Notice\n\n7).”   Notice 7 defined “intimate partner” as including individuals\n\nwho are parents of the purchaser’s child and individuals with whom\n\nthe defendant had ever cohabited.\n\n       In accordance with federal law, the firearms dealer contacted\n\nthe National Instant Criminal Background Check System to verify\n\nthat Edgerton was authorized to purchase the handgun. The dealer’s\n\nrequest for approval was initially placed on delay status and was\n\nultimately denied six days later.               A criminal investigation ensued\n\nand Edgerton was indicted on July 12, 2005.\n\n       At     trial,    the    government      and     Edgerton    entered    into    a\n\nstipulation agreeing that Victoria French and the defendant had\n\ncohabited together in the past and that French is a parent of the\n\ndefendant’s child.            The government also offered the testimony of\n\nErik Tall, a detective with the Bangor Police Department, and\n\nMatthew Cox, the firearms dealer.                 Tall testified that Edgerton\n\nadmitted during his initial interview that he completed the entire\n\nATF    Form    4473    himself,    that    he    was    aware     of   the   permanent\n\nprotective order, and that he “just did not read the form.”                          The\n\nfirearms      dealer    testified       that    Edgerton   filled      out   the   form\n\nhimself, that he provided no assistance to Edgerton, and that he\n\ngave Edgerton unlimited time to complete the application.\n\n       Edgerton       testified    in    his    own   defense,     stating    that    he\n\nreceived the temporary protection order on January 15, 2004, but\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fthat French told him the matter had been dropped.                   Edgerton\n\nadmitted that he filled out the top of ATF Form 4473, but claimed\n\nthat Cox rushed him through the second part of the form, and that\n\nCox, not he, had filled out the answer to Question 12.              Edgerton\n\nnevertheless admitted that he signed the form and certified that\n\nhis answers on the form were correct.\n\n     The trial judge instructed the jury as follows on the elements\n\nof a Section 922(a)(6) violation:\n\n     For you to find Mr. Edgerton guilty of the offense, you\n     must be satisfied that the government has proven each of\n     the following things beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          First, that Mr. Edgerton knowingly made a false\n          statement as charged in the indictment.\n\n          Second, that at the time he made the statement, Mr.\n          Edgerton was trying to buy a firearm from a\n          licensed dealer.\n\n          Third, that the statement was intended to or was\n          likely to deceive the firearm dealer about a fact\n          material to the lawfulness of the sale.\n\nAfter charging the jury, the judge asked counsel if there were any\n\nobjections to the instructions, and both parties answered “No.”\n\n     Edgerton   was   convicted   on   March    8,   2006,   and   was   later\n\nsentenced to a 14-month prison term.\n\n                                   II.\n\n     Edgerton argues on appeal that the jury charge was improper\n\nbecause it permitted the jury to convict without proof that he\n\nacted with the intention to deceive.           Because Edgerton failed to\n\nregister his objection with the trial court, we typically would\n\n                                   -5-\n\freview the charge only for plain error. United States v. Roberson,\n\n459 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1261\n\n(2007).    Here, however, the standard of review is inconsequential\n\nbecause the trial judge’s instructions correctly describe the\n\nrequisite mens rea.\n\n     Section 922(a)(6) requires proof that the defendant knowingly\n\nmade a false or fictitious statement.   This requirement, however,\n\ndoes not presuppose deceptive intent or even knowledge that one’s\n\nconduct is unlawful.     As this court noted in United States v.\n\nCurrier, “[s]ection 922(a)(6) does not require a showing that\n\nappellant ‘knowingly’ violated the law; it simply requires proof\n\nthat appellant knowingly made a false statement.”   621 F.2d 7, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 1980) (quoting Cody v. United States, 460 F.2d 34, 38\n\n(8th Cir. 1972)) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Edgerton nevertheless argues that the statutory requirement\n\nthat a defendant must act knowingly is somehow undermined if a\n\ndefendant could be convicted of violating Section 922(a)(6) without\n\nproof that he also acted with the intention to deceive.        This\n\nargument is belied by the statute’s plain language. In addition to\n\nrequiring that a defendant must knowingly make a false statement,\n\nSection 922(a)(6) requires either that the defendant act with the\n\nintention to deceive or that his false statement is likely to\n\ndeceive.   Edgerton has not explained why Congress cannot choose to\n\npunish a defendant who knowingly makes a false statement that is\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\flikely to deceive, regardless of whether the defendant is acting\n\nwith deceptive intent, and this is precisely what Congress has done\n\nin Section 922(a)(6).\n\n     The trial judge’s instructions closely tracked the language of\n\nSection 922(a)(6) and properly informed the jury that it could\n\nconvict if Edgerton knowingly made a false statement to a licensed\n\nfirearms dealer and his statement was likely to deceive. Deceptive\n\nintent is not required if this standard is met.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

This requirement, however, does not presuppose deceptive intent or even knowledge that one's conduct is unlawful. As this court noted in <i>United States v. Currier,</i> \"[s]ection 922(a)(6) does not require a showing that appellant `knowingly' violated the law; it simply requires proof that appellant knowingly made a false statement.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377946\"><a href=\"/opinion/377946/united-states-v-raymond-leon-currier/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1980) (quoting <i>Cody v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"303403\"><a href=\"/opinion/303403/james-cody-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 38 (8th Cir.1972)) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Edgerton nevertheless argues that the statutory requirement that a defendant must act knowingly is somehow undermined if a defendant could be convicted of violating Section 922(a)(6) without proof that he also acted with the intention to deceive. This argument is belied by the statute's plain language. In addition to requiring that a defendant must knowingly make a false statement, Section 922(a)(6) requires <i>either</i> that the defendant act with the intention to deceive <i>or</i> that his false statement is likely to deceive. Edgerton has not explained why Congress cannot choose to punish a defendant who knowingly makes a false statement that is likely to deceive, regardless of whether the defendant is acting with deceptive intent, and this is precisely what Congress has done in Section 922(a)(6).</p>\n<p>The trial judge's instructions closely tracked the language of Section 922(a)(6) and properly informed the jury that it could convict if Edgerton knowingly made a false statement to a licensed firearms dealer and his statement was likely to deceive. Deceptive intent is not required if this standard is met.</p>\n<p>AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n\n</div>",
