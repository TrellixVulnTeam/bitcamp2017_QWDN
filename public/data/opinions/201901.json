Gene Carter, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Thomas J. Connolly for appellant.\n     James R. Erwin with whom Katharine I. Rand and Pierce Atwood\nLLP, were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        October 31, 2005\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.    Plaintiff Elaine Connolly brings\n\nthis appeal to challenge the district court's dismissal under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) of her federal constitutional claims under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, and her claims under RICO, the federal anti-\n\nracketeering statute, see 18 U.S.C. § 1962.            The claims were\n\nasserted against Connolly's employer, H.D. Goodall Hospital, Inc.,\n\nand three of its managing employees.        In a clear and well reasoned\n\nwritten order, the district court granted defendants' motion to\n\ndismiss   because   the   facts   alleged   in   support   of   Connolly's\n\nconstitutional claims could not conceivably support a finding of\n\nstate action on the part of the named defendants, see Lugar v.\n\nEdmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 924 (1982), and because the facts\n\nalleged in support of Connolly's RICO claim could not conceivably\n\nlead to a determination that defendants functioned as a RICO\n\nenterprise and engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity,\n\nsee 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d); Doyle v. Hasbro, Inc., 103 F.3d 186, 190\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           Connolly's appellate brief does not come close to calling\n\ninto question the correctness of the district court's reasoning, so\n\nwe are content to affirm on the merits without saying anything\n\nmore.   See, e.g., Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc., 368 F.3d\n\n1, 2 (1st Cir. 2004).       Instead, we confine our remarks to the\n\nquestion of appellate jurisdiction, which the procedural history of\n\nthe case has put into question.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            This case, which contains supplemental state law claims\n\nin addition to the federal claims just discussed, was originally\n\nfiled in Maine Superior Court.          Defendants timely removed and, as\n\nexplained, prevailed on their motion to dismiss the federal claims.\n\nIn its dismissal order, the district court declined to exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims, see 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1367(c)(3), and, instead of simply dismissing without prejudice,\n\nordered   that    those   claims   be   remanded   to   state   court,   see,\n\ne.g., St. John v. Int'l Assoc. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,\n\nLocal No. 1010, Dist. No. 118, Local Lodge No. 254, 139 F.3d 1214,\n\n1217   (8th     Cir.    1998)   (endorsing    a    remand   under   similar\n\ncircumstances).        After Connolly filed her notice of appeal, the\n\ncourt issued a procedural order vacating its already-effectuated\n\nremand as \"premature\" -- the court apparently wished to avoid any\n\nduplicative litigation problems that might arise were we to vacate\n\nthe judgment dismissing Connolly's federal claims and reinstate\n\nthis case as a live action on its docket -- and directing its clerk\n\nto recall the case from the state court \"for purposes of further\n\nproceedings in connection with\" the appeal. The clerk complied and\n\nthe state court cooperated.\n\n            Two questions arise in connection with this course of\n\nevents.     Did the district court have the power to vacate its\n\nremand?     Compare Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Santiago Plaza, 598\n\nF.2d 634,     636 (1st Cir. 1979) (per curiam) (construing the text of\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f28 U.S.C. § 1447(d) -- a statute not at issue where, as here,\n\nremand is not premised on the jurisdictional or procedural defects\n\nspecified in 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c)), see Thermston Prods., Inc. v.\n\nHermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 345-52 (1976) -- as divesting the\n\ndistrict court of jurisdiction to take any further action once a\n\ndistrict court \"has decided to remand a case and has so notified\n\nthe state court\"), with Vargas v. Geologistics Americas, Inc., 284\n\nF.3d 232, 235 (1st Cir. 2002) (tacitly assuming that a district\n\ncourt has the power to enter a judgment with prejudice on claims\n\nerroneously remanded to state court).   And if so, did the court's\n\nactions render non-final its remand order and convert the present\n\nproceedings into an unauthorized interlocutory appeal over which we\n\nwould lack jurisdiction?   See Nichols v. Cadle Co., 101 F.3d 1448,\n\n1449 n.1 (1st Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (\"Ordinarily, a judgment is\n\nfinal (and, thus, appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291) only if it\n\nconclusively determines all claims of all parties to the action.\"\n\n(citation omitted)).\n\n          On our reading of the record, there is jurisdiction to\n\nreach the merits of Connolly's appeal.      If the district court\n\nlacked the power to vacate its remand (a matter that has not been\n\nadequately briefed and that we will not decide), there is no\n\njurisdictional problem because no live claims remain pending in\n\nfederal court.   But if the court had the power to vacate the\n\nremand, it is clear to us that the court did not intend to revisit\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fthe merits of its judgment that the supplemental state claims ought\n\nto be remanded.    Rather, the court intended only to undo the\n\nexecution of the remand so as to avoid the duplicative litigation\n\nissue we have noted.   Cf. Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517\n\nU.S. 706, 712 (1996) (\"[A] decision is ordinarily considered final\n\n. . . if it 'ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing\n\nfor the court to do but execute the judgment.'\") (quoting Catlin v.\n\nUnited States, 324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945)).   In these circumstances,\n\nthe remand order, although not yet executed, remains final.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",

But if the court had the power to vacate the remand, it is clear to us that the court did not intend to revisit the merits of its judgment that the supplemental state claims ought to be remanded. Rather, the court intended only to undo the <i>execution</i> of the remand so as to avoid the duplicative litigation issue we have noted. <i>Cf. Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 712, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In these circumstances, the remand order, although not yet executed, remains final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
