This case is part of a continuing\n\nsaga of Puerto Rico's attempts to avoid paying money owed to a\n\nmedical provider under federal Medicaid law. Plaintiff Dr. José S.\n\nBelaval, Inc. is a federally-qualified health center (\"FQHC\") under\n\nthe federal Medicaid statute.        Federal law entitles Belaval to\n\ncertain payments from Puerto Rico, see 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb), and\n\nwhen Puerto Rico failed to set up a system for making those\n\npayments, Belaval successfully obtained a preliminary injunction in\n\n2004 requiring Puerto Rico to do so prospectively.           Much of the\n\nbackground behind this case is set out in our two earlier opinions\n\npertaining to this litigation.      See Dr. José S. Belaval, Inc. v.\n\nPérez-Perdomo,   465   F.3d   33   (1st   Cir.   2006)   (reinstating   an\n\ninjunction that required payment to Belaval and that had been\n\nerroneously modified); Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc. v.\n\nRullan, 397 F.3d 56 (1st Cir. 2005) (affirming an order of relief\n\nrequiring prospective payment to one of Belaval's co-plaintiffs).\n\n          The Commonwealth's third appearance before us stems from\n\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision in Municipality of San\n\nJuan v. Board of the José S. Belaval Community Health Center, Inc.,\n\nNo. CC-2005-716 (P.R. Oct. 10, 2006). In that decision, the Puerto\n\nRico Supreme Court determined that Belaval had been operating its\n\nfacilities   without   a   valid   contract   with   its   landlord,    the\n\nMunicipality of San Juan.      The Commonwealth sought to use this\n\ndecision as a basis for avoiding its obligation to make the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\ffederally required payments.           The federal district court decided\n\nthat Belaval lacked \"clean hands,\" and the court deprived Belaval\n\nof over a year's worth of payments it had been owed under the\n\nearlier injunction. The district court erred in its application of\n\nthe unclean hands doctrine and in the relief it granted the\n\nCommonwealth.     We reverse and remand to the district court.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           We recount only the key points from the history of this\n\nlitigation, supplemented with the facts that arose after our\n\nOctober 2, 2006 decision in Belaval.\n\n           Because of Puerto Rico's failure to make the statutorily\n\nrequired Medicaid payments, three FQHCs filed suit in June 2003\n\nseeking prospective injunctive relief from the federal district\n\ncourt.   Belaval, the sole appellant now before us, was one of the\n\nthree FQHC plaintiffs.         The defendant was the Secretary of the\n\nDepartment of Health of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n           On    November    1,   2004,     the   district   court   adopted   a\n\nmagistrate judge's report and recommendation, and it granted the\n\nplaintiffs a preliminary injunction.                Under the terms of the\n\ninjunction, the defendants were required (among other things) to\n\nmake quarterly \"wraparound\" payments starting from the second\n\nquarter of 2004.       Several months later, we issued our decision in\n\nRio Grande, which pertained to a similar injunction previously\n\nissued   for    one   of   Belaval's   co-plaintiffs.        We   rejected   the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fCommonwealth's arguments that it was improper for a federal court\n\nto issue such an injunction.          See Rio Grande, 397 F.3d at 68-75.\n\n            Yet by August 12, 2005, Puerto Rico still had failed to\n\nmake a single payment to Belaval, and so on that date Belaval asked\n\nthe district court to issue an order to show cause why the\n\ndefendant Secretary should not be held in contempt. The magistrate\n\njudge issued the order, and then after receiving the defendant's\n\nresponse, issued a report and recommendation finding that the\n\ndefendant was not in compliance with the November 1, 2004 order.\n\nThe magistrate judge also acknowledged that Belaval's August 12\n\nmotion requested that defendant be held in contempt, and the judge\n\nrecommended that this request be held in abeyance so that the\n\ndefendant   could     be    given    several   weeks    to   comply   with   the\n\ninjunction.\n\n            In an opinion issued October 6, 2005, the district court\n\nadopted   the   key    parts    of   the   magistrate    judge's    report   and\n\nrecommendation.       But the district court also sua sponte modified\n\nthe preliminary injunction so that it would only take effect\n\nbeginning with the third quarter of 2005.                This erroneous sua\n\nsponte modification relieved the defendant of several quarters'\n\nworth of payments.         When Belaval took an interlocutory appeal, we\n\nreversed this modification because, inter alia, it had been made\n\nwithout providing notice and a hearing for Belaval.                See Belaval,\n\n465 F.3d at 37-38.      Our Belaval opinion issued on October 2, 2006.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f            The next day, and in light of our decision, the district\n\ncourt (under a different judge to whom the case had been assigned)\n\nreleased a two-part order.           First, the court ordered Belaval to\n\nsubmit, by October 18, 2006, a memorandum with supporting evidence\n\nexplaining how much it was owed under the terms of the original\n\ninjunction.      Second, the court ordered the Secretary to respond to\n\nBelaval's filing by October 30, 2006. Belaval timely submitted its\n\nmemorandum and accompanying evidence.           However, the Secretary did\n\nnot respond by the required date.            Thus, on October 31, 2006, the\n\ndistrict court ordered the defendant to pay Belaval $6,772,549, and\n\nfurther ordered the defendant to deposit this amount with the Clerk\n\nof Court by November 9, 2006.\n\n            On November 8, 2006, the defendant asked for an extension\n\nof time to deposit the required funds, and also filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration of the court's October 31 order.                    Most of the\n\nmotion was geared towards arguments that the $6.7 million figure\n\nwas too high, that more discovery was needed to determine the\n\ncorrect amount, and that in any event a hearing was needed on\n\nwhether    the    district    court    should    reinstate    the    injunction\n\nmodification     that   had   been    imposed   prior   to   our    decision   in\n\nBelaval.      The motion also briefly noted that the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme Court had, on October 10, 2006, issued an (apparently\n\nunpublished) opinion in a case about a landlord-tenant dispute\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fbetween Belaval and the Municipality of San Juan (the \"San Juan\n\nopinion\").\n\n          As that opinion recounts, San Juan owns the physical\n\nstructure, and the equipment, at the location where Belaval had\n\nbeen providing its health services. Since 1986, Belaval had leased\n\nits space from the municipality, but the lease expired on June 30,\n\n2002. Belaval nonetheless continued to operate and provide medical\n\nservices at that location, beyond the period of occupancy under the\n\nterms of the lease.    After unsuccessfully attempting to evict\n\nBelaval, San Juan filed suit against Belaval in the Puerto Rico\n\nCourt of First Instance.     The municipality sought a declaratory\n\njudgment that there was \"no contract or valid title that would\n\nallow [Belaval] to continue operating\" the facilities, and it also\n\nsought damages.   The Court of First Instance issued a partial\n\ndeclaratory judgment that the contract between the parties had\n\nexpired on June 30, 2002.     The Puerto Rico Supreme Court upheld\n\nthat partial judgment on appeal, pointing out that because this was\n\na government contract with a municipality, Puerto Rico law required\n\nany contract to be in writing, which precluded Belaval from arguing\n\nthat there had been an implicit renewal of the agreement.   That is\n\nall that the case decided.   No assessment of damages was made, and\n\nthe case was remanded to the Court of First Instance to continue\n\nproceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f            Back in federal court, on November 13, 2006, the district\n\ncourt denied the Secretary's motion for reconsideration, pointing\n\nout that the Secretary's arguments should have been raised before\n\nthe filing deadline had passed.     However, the court did grant the\n\nrequested extension of time to deposit the funds (although it\n\nexpressed some frustration with the defendants).     It also directed\n\nthe parties to discuss the effect of the San Juan opinion -- if any\n\n-- on the payments owed to Belaval.     The court further ordered that\n\nSan Juan be given notice in case it wished to try to intervene in\n\nthe case, and the court indicated that once the Secretary in fact\n\npaid the funds to the court, those funds would remain with the\n\ncourt pending further order.    The Secretary did eventually deposit\n\nthe funds.1\n\n            Perhaps prompted by the district court's order, San Juan\n\nfiled a motion to intervene on December 11, 2006.    San Juan alleged\n\nthat Belaval owed it over $5 million, and it asked the federal\n\ncourt to order the attachment of $5,276,127.06 out of the funds to\n\nbe deposited with the federal court.       The district court ordered\n\nall parties to show cause why Belaval's funds should not be\n\nattached as requested, and deposited with the Court of First\n\nInstance.     The parties filed their responses on December 20, 2006.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       The actual deposit did not occur until December 22, 2006,\nand it came only after the defendant sought additional extensions.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f          The same day, and reacting to the district court's\n\nearlier order from November 13, the defendant Secretary filed a\n\nmemorandum of law regarding the effect of the San Juan opinion.\n\nEight days later, and apparently in response to this memorandum,\n\nthe district court dismissed Belaval as a party to the case and\n\nauthorized the Commonwealth to withdraw the funds it had deposited\n\nwith the court.   In a short order, and without citing any case law\n\nor other authority (beyond the San Juan opinion), the district\n\ncourt determined that Belaval \"should not have been operating at\n\nthe time this federal action was commenced,\" and so Belaval did not\n\nhave \"clean hands\" to seek the equitable remedy of a preliminary\n\ninjunction.   Because the court had dismissed Belaval from the\n\naction, it denied as moot San Juan's motion to intervene.    Later\n\nthat same day, the Secretary withdrew the funds she had deposited.\n\n          The December 28 order was entered without the benefit of\n\na response from Belaval.   The next day, Belaval filed a motion for\n\nreconsideration, and it asked that it be able to file an opposition\n\nto the Secretary's arguments.     Then, before the district court\n\nruled on this motion, Belaval submitted an opposition \"on the\n\nassumption the Court grants our request for reconsideration.\"   The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion for reconsideration, stating that\n\nit had considered Belaval's opposition, and that the court would\n\nnonetheless reaffirm its earlier order.\n\n          Belaval appeals.\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f                                    II.\n\n           Belaval's appeal challenges both the substance and the\n\nprocedure of the district court's decision.            We bypass Belaval's\n\nprocedural arguments.\n\n           Our merits analysis goes straight to evaluating the\n\ndistrict court's use of the unclean hands doctrine.           Our review is\n\nfor abuse of discretion, see K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc.,\n\n875 F.2d 907, 912 (1st Cir. 1989), and an error of law constitutes\n\nan abuse of discretion, see Top Entm't, Inc. v. Torrejon, 351 F.3d\n\n531, 533 (1st Cir. 2003).         On the facts presented, the district\n\ncourt both committed an error of law and abused its discretion in\n\nfinding that the unclean hands doctrine was applicable, and then in\n\ndismissing Belaval's case and releasing the deposited funds.\n\n           The doctrine of unclean hands, or, more archaically, the\n\nmaxim that \"[h]e who comes into equity must come with clean hands,\"\n\nKeystone Driller Co. v. Gen. Excavator Co., 290 U.S. 240, 241\n\n(1933), finds its roots in traditions of equity jurisprudence that\n\npredated the merger of law and equity.        See id. at 244-45; see also\n\nShondel   v.   McDermott,   775    F.2d    859,   867-68   (7th   Cir.   1985)\n\n(discussing the relationship of the doctrine to the \"moralistic\n\n. . . jurisprudence created by the Lord Chancellors of England when\n\nthe office was filled by clerics\") (Posner, J.). The basic premise\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fis that when a district court considers whether or not to award\n\nequitable relief, one factor that it must consider is the extent to\n\nwhich the plaintiff has engaged in certain misconduct.           See Texaco\n\nP.R., Inc. v. Dep't of Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d 867, 880 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n            The doctrine has limits, and not all misconduct by a\n\nplaintiff will soil that plaintiff's hands.           Among other things,\n\nthe doctrine \"only applies when the claimant's misconduct is\n\ndirectly related to the merits of the controversy between the\n\nparties, that is, when the tawdry acts 'in some measure affect the\n\nequitable relations between the parties in respect of something\n\nbrought   before   the    court   for   adjudication.'\"       Id.    (quoting\n\nKeystone, 290 U.S. at 245).        The mere fact that the \"misconduct\"\n\narises    from   some    overlapping    facts   is   not   enough.     Since\n\n\"relatively few plaintiffs are wholly free from any trace of\n\narguable misconduct at least tangentially related to the objective\n\nof their suit, the right to injunctive relief . . . would have\n\nlittle value if the defendant could divert the proceeding into the\n\nbyways of collateral misconduct.\"          Shondel, 775 F.3d at 869.\n\n            In this case, there was no relationship between Belaval's\n\nunderlying suit against Puerto Rico for payment for services\n\nprovided under the federal Medicaid statute, and Belaval's Puerto\n\nRico law contract dispute with San Juan.         Belaval's entitlement to\n\npayment from the Secretary turns on whether or not it meets the\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fdefinition of an FQHC, and whether or not it provides medical\n\nservices. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(bb), 1396d(l)(2)(B). There is no\n\ndispute that Belaval was an FQHC during the relevant time, and that\n\nBelaval   provided     the   relevant      services.        The   district      court\n\nnevertheless justified its actions on the ground that Belaval\n\n\"should not have been operating\" at the time this federal action\n\ncommenced.    That justification is error, and the two questions are\n\nunrelated.     At most, the Commonwealth's argument could be that\n\nBelaval should not have been operating at the specific facility\n\nowned by San Juan.       But Belaval's entitlement to payment does not\n\nturn on whether it operated at that specific facility.                     The fact\n\nthat Belaval may have overstayed its lease does not directly relate\n\nto the controversy between the parties in the federal case.\n\n             The    Secretary     nonetheless     protests        that    Belaval's\n\noperation     was    \"illegal,\"     and     defendant       worries      that     \"the\n\npossibilities of fomenting illegal operations would be encouraged\n\nif Belaval is allowed to receive any amount for their illegal\n\noperation.\" Defendant contends that Puerto Rico will be injured if\n\n\"public funds [are] disbursed to an entity that carried on an\n\nillegal operation.\"\n\n             This    argument    still    fails   to   establish      relatedness.\n\nAlthough the Secretary says that Belaval operated \"illegally,\" she\n\ndoes   not    even     suggest    that     payment     to    Belaval      would    be\n\nimpermissible under the federal Medicaid statute. Rather, her main\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fpoint is that under Puerto Rico law, Belaval was required to have\n\na   written    contract   with   San    Juan   if   it   wished   to   have   an\n\nenforceable lease.        This \"illegality\" is not related to Puerto\n\nRico's failure to make statutorily required Medicaid payments.2\n\nThere is no reason to think that these federally required payments\n\ncan be displaced by local landlord-tenant law.3\n\n              As we observed in our prior opinion, Belaval has been\n\npushed to \"the brink of financial ruin\" because of Puerto Rico's\n\ncontinuing failure to make the required payments.                 Belaval, 465\n\nF.3d at 36 n.2.       We note that San Juan, as amicus on appeal,\n\nopposes the relief granted the Commonwealth and supports Belaval.\n\n                                       III.\n\n              Notwithstanding all of the above, the Secretary appears\n\nto make a last ditch argument that the San Juan opinion has somehow\n\ntransformed Belaval's collection efforts into attempts to obtain\n\nretroactive monetary relief, which would then be barred by the\n\nEleventh Amendment.       This confusing claim is without merit.         As we\n\ndetermined in Rio Grande, the plaintiffs in this case face no\n\n\n      2\n       Defendant briefly speculates that if another entity had\noccupied San Juan's premises, it might have operated more\nefficiently, thereby requiring Puerto Rico to spend less money in\nreimbursements. This is sheer speculation and irrelevant.\n      3\n       Defendant also briefly asserts, without any citation to any\nsources of law, that it would violate Puerto Rico law if the\nCommonwealth paid funds to an entity that operated without a\nwritten contract. \"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\nwaived.\" United States v. Zannino, 895 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                       -13-\n\fEleventh    Amendment   bar       because    they     have    sought   prospective\n\ninjunctive relief.      397 F.3d at 75-76; cf. Edelman v. Jordan, 415\n\nU.S. 651, 668-71 (1974).          Neither the fact that the Commonwealth\n\nhas managed to avoid its obligations under an injunction that was\n\nissued prospectively, nor the fact that Belaval has been operating\n\nwithout a contract with San Juan, affects this in any way.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n            The   district    court's       December    28,    2006    judgment   is\n\nreversed.

Plaintiff Dr. Jos&#233; S. Belaval, Inc. is a federally-qualified health center (\"FQHC\") under the federal Medicaid statute. Federal law entitles Belaval to certain payments from Puerto Rico, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb), and when Puerto Rico failed to set up a system for making those payments, Belaval successfully obtained a preliminary injunction in 2004 requiring Puerto Rico to do so prospectively. Much of the background behind this case is set out in our two earlier opinions pertaining to this litigation. <i>See Dr. Jos&#233; S. Belaval, Inc. v. P&#233;rez-Perdomo,</i> 465 F.3d 33 (1st Cir.2006) (reinstating an injunction that required payment to Belaval and that had been erroneously modified); <i>Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc. v. Rullan,</i> 397 F.3d 56 (1st Cir.2005) (affirming an order of relief requiring prospective payment to one of Belaval's co-plaintiffs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth's third appearance before us stems from the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision in <i>Municipality of San Juan v. Board of the Jos&#233; S. Belaval Community Health Center, Inc.,</i> No. CC-2005-716 (P.R. Oct. 10, 2006). In that decision, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court determined that Belaval had been operating its facilities without a valid contract with its landlord, the Municipality of San Juan. The Commonwealth sought to use this decision as a basis for avoiding its obligation to make the federally required payments. The federal district court decided that Belaval lacked \"clean hands,\" and the court deprived Belaval of over a year's worth of payments it had been owed under the earlier injunction. The district court erred in its application of the unclean hands doctrine and in the relief it granted the Commonwealth. We reverse and remand to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount only the key points from the history of this litigation, supplemented with the facts that arose after our October 2, 2006 decision in <i>Belaval.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of Puerto Rico's failure to make the statutorily required Medicaid payments, three FQHCs filed suit in June 2003 seeking prospective injunctive relief from the federal district court. Belaval, the sole appellant now before us, was one of the three FQHC plaintiffs. The defendant was the Secretary of the Department of Health of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 1, 2004, the district court adopted a magistrate judge's report and recommendation, and it granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction. Under the terms of the injunction, the defendant was required (among other things) to make quarterly \"wraparound\" payments starting from the second quarter of 2004. Several months later, we issued our decision in <i>Rio Grande,</i> which pertained to a similar injunction previously issued for one of Belaval's co-plaintiffs. We rejected the Commonwealth's arguments that it was improper for a federal court to issue such an injunction. <i>See Rio Grande,</i> 397 F.3d at 68-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet by August 12, 2005, Puerto Rico still had failed to make a single payment to Belaval, and so on that date Belaval asked the district court to issue an order to show cause why the defendant Secretary should not be held in contempt. The magistrate judge issued the order, and then after receiving the defendant's response, issued a report and recommendation finding that the defendant was not in compliance with the November 1, 2004 order. The magistrate judge also acknowledged that Belaval's August 12 motion requested that defendant be held in contempt, and the judge recommended that this request be held in abeyance so that the defendant could be given several weeks to comply with the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an opinion issued October 6, 2005, the district court adopted the key parts of the magistrate judge's report and recommendation. But the district court also sua sponte modified the preliminary injunction so that it would only take effect beginning with the third quarter of 2005. This erroneous sua sponte modification relieved the defendant of several quarters' worth of payments. When Belaval took an interlocutory appeal, we reversed this modification because, inter alia, it had been made without providing notice and a hearing for Belaval. <i>See Belaval,</i> 465 F.3d at 37-38. Our <i>Belaval</i> opinion issued on October 2, 2006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, and in light of our decision, the district court (under a different judge to whom the case had been assigned) released a two-part order. First, the court ordered Belaval to submit, by October 18, 2006, a memorandum with supporting evidence explaining how much it was owed under the terms of the original injunction. Second, the court ordered the Secretary to respond to Belaval's filing by October 30, 2006. Belaval timely submitted its memorandum and accompanying evidence. However, the Secretary did not respond by the required date. Thus, on October 31, 2006, the district court ordered the defendant to pay Belaval $6,772,549, and further ordered the defendant to deposit this amount with the Clerk of Court by November 9, 2006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 2006, the defendant asked for an extension of time to deposit the required funds, and also filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's October 31 order. Most of the motion was geared towards arguments that the $6.7 million figure was too high, that more discovery was needed to determine the correct amount, and that in any event a hearing was needed on whether the district court should reinstate the injunction modification that had been imposed prior to our decision in <i>Belaval.</i> The motion also briefly noted that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court had, on October 10, 2006, issued an (apparently unpublished) opinion in a case about a landlord-tenant dispute between Belaval and the Municipality of San Juan (the \"<i>San Juan</i> opinion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As that opinion recounts, San Juan owns the physical structure, and the equipment, at the location where Belaval had been providing its health services. Since 1986, Belaval had leased its space from the municipality, but the lease expired on June 30, 2002. Belaval nonetheless continued to operate and provide medical services at that location, beyond the period of occupancy under the terms of the lease. After unsuccessfully attempting to evict Belaval, San Juan filed suit against Belaval in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance. The municipality sought a declaratory judgment that there was \"no contract or valid title that would allow [Belaval] to continue operating\" the facilities, and it also sought damages. The Court of First Instance issued a partial declaratory judgment that the contract between the parties had expired on June 30, 2002. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court upheld that partial judgment on appeal, pointing out that because this was a government contract with a municipality, Puerto Rico law required any contract to be in writing, which precluded Belaval from arguing that there had been an implicit renewal of the agreement. That is all that the case decided. No assessment of damages was made, and the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance to continue proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Back in federal court, on November 13, 2006, the district court denied the Secretary's motion for reconsideration, pointing out that the Secretary's arguments should have been raised before the filing deadline had passed. However, the court did grant the requested extension of time to deposit the funds (although it expressed some frustration with the defendants). It also directed the parties to discuss the effect of the <i>San Juan</i> opinion&#8212;if any&#8212;on the payments owed to Belaval. The court further ordered that San Juan be given notice in case it wished to try to intervene in the case, and the court indicated that once the Secretary in fact paid the funds to the court, those funds would remain with the court pending further order. The Secretary did eventually deposit the funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps prompted by the district court's order, San Juan filed a motion to intervene on December 11, 2006. San Juan alleged that Belaval owed it over $5 million, and it asked the federal court to order the attachment of $5,276,127.06 out of the funds to be deposited with the federal court. The district court ordered all parties to show cause why Belaval's funds should not be attached as requested, and deposited with the Court of First Instance. The parties filed their responses on December 20, 2006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same day, and reacting to the district court's earlier order from November 13, the defendant Secretary filed a memorandum of law regarding the effect of the <i>San Juan</i> opinion. Eight days later, and apparently in response to this memorandum, the district court dismissed Belaval as a party to the case and authorized the Commonwealth to withdraw the funds it had deposited with the court. In a short order, and without citing any case law or other authority (beyond the <i>San Juan</i> opinion), the district court determined that Belaval \"should not have been operating at the time this federal action was commenced,\" and so Belaval did not have \"clean hands\" to seek the equitable remedy of a preliminary injunction. Because the court had dismissed Belaval from the action, it denied as moot San Juan's motion to intervene. Later that same day, the Secretary withdrew the funds she had deposited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The December 28 order was entered without the benefit of a response from Belaval. The next day, Belaval filed a motion for reconsideration, and it asked that it be able to file an opposition to the Secretary's arguments. Then, before the district court ruled on this motion, Belaval submitted an opposition \"on the assumption the Court grants our request for reconsideration.\" The district court denied the motion for reconsideration, stating that it had considered Belaval's opposition, and that the court would nonetheless reaffirm its earlier order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Belaval appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Belaval's appeal challenges both the substance and the procedure of the district court's decision. We bypass Belaval's procedural arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our merits analysis goes straight to evaluating the district court's use of the unclean hands doctrine. Our review is for abuse of discretion, <i>see K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc.,</i> 875 F.2d 907, 912 (1st Cir.1989), and an error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion, <i>see Top Entm't, Inc. v. Torrejon,</i> 351 F.3d 531, 533 (1st Cir.2003). On the facts presented, the district court both committed an error of law and abused its discretion in finding that the unclean hands doctrine was applicable, and then in dismissing Belaval's case and releasing the deposited funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine of unclean hands, or, more archaically, the maxim that \"[h]e who comes into equity must come with clean hands,\" <i>Keystone Driller Co. v. Gen. Excavator Co.,</i> 290 U.S. 240, 241, 54 S.Ct. 146, 78 L.Ed. 293 (1933), finds its roots in traditions of equity jurisprudence that predated the merger of law and equity. <i>See id.</i> at 244-45, 54 S.Ct. 146; <i>see also Shondel v. McDermott,</i> 775 F.2d 859, 867-68 (7th Cir.1985) (discussing the relationship of the doctrine to the \"moralistic . . . jurisprudence created by the Lord Chancellors of England when the office was filled by clerics\") (Posner, J.). The basic premise is that when a district court considers whether or not to award equitable relief, one factor that it must consider is the extent to which the plaintiff has engaged in certain misconduct. <i>See Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Dep't of Consumer Affairs,</i> 60 F.3d 867, 880 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine has limits, and not all misconduct by a plaintiff will soil that plaintiff's hands. Among other things, the doctrine \"only applies when the claimant's misconduct is directly related to the merits of the controversy between the parties, that is, when the tawdry acts `in some measure affect the equitable relations between the parties in respect of something brought before the court for adjudication.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Keystone,</i> 290 U.S. at 245, 54 S.Ct. 146). The mere fact that the \"misconduct\" arises from some overlapping facts is not enough. Since \"relatively few plaintiffs are wholly free from any trace of arguable misconduct at least tangentially related to the objective of their suit, the right to injunctive relief . . . would have little value if the defendant could divert the proceeding into the byways of collateral misconduct.\" <i>Shondel,</i> 775 F.2d at 869.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there was no relationship between Belaval's underlying suit against Puerto Rico for payment for services provided under the federal Medicaid statute, and Belaval's Puerto Rico law contract dispute with San Juan. Belaval's entitlement to payment from the Secretary turns on whether or not it meets the definition of an FQHC, and whether or not it provides medical services. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1396a(bb), 1396d(<i>l</i>)(2)(B). There is no dispute that Belaval was an FQHC during the relevant time, and that Belaval provided the relevant services. The district court nevertheless justified its actions on the ground that Belaval \"should not have been operating\" at the time this federal action commenced. That justification is error, and the two questions are unrelated. At most, the Commonwealth's argument could be that Belaval should not have been operating <i>at the specific facility owned by San Juan.</i> But Belaval's entitlement to payment does not turn on whether it operated at that specific facility. The fact that Belaval may have overstayed its lease does not directly relate to the controversy between the parties in the federal case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary nonetheless protests that Belaval's operation was \"illegal,\" and defendant worries that \"the possibilities of fomenting illegal operations would be encouraged if Belaval is allowed to receive any amount for their illegal operation.\" Defendant contends that Puerto Rico will be injured if \"public funds [are] disbursed to an entity that carried on an illegal operation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument still fails to establish relatedness. Although the Secretary says that Belaval operated \"illegally,\" she does not even suggest that payment to Belaval would be impermissible under the federal Medicaid statute. Rather, her main point is that under Puerto Rico law, Belaval was required to have a written contract with San Juan if it wished to have an enforceable lease. This \"illegality\" is not related to Puerto Rico's failure to make statutorily required Medicaid payments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> There is no reason to think that these federally required payments can be displaced by local landlord-tenant law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we observed in our prior opinion, Belaval has been pushed to \"the brink of financial ruin\" because of Puerto Rico's continuing failure to make the required payments. <i>Belaval,</i> 465 F.3d at 36 n. 2. We note that San Juan, as amicus on appeal, opposes the relief granted the Commonwealth and supports Belaval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding all of the above, the Secretary appears to make a last ditch argument that the <i>San Juan</i> opinion has somehow transformed Belaval's collection efforts into attempts to obtain retroactive monetary relief, which would then be barred by the Eleventh Amendment. This confusing claim is without merit. As we determined in <i>Rio Grande,</i> the plaintiffs in this case face no Eleventh Amendment bar because they have sought prospective injunctive relief. 397 F.3d at 75-76; <i>cf. Edelman v. Jordan,</i> 415 U.S. 651, 668-71, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). Neither the fact that the Commonwealth has managed to avoid its obligations under an injunction that was issued prospectively, nor the fact that Belaval has been operating without a contract with San Juan, affects this in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's December 28, 2006 judgment is <i>reversed.</i> The case is <i>remanded,</i> and the district court is instructed promptly to reinstate the case, to restore and enforce the payment obligation created by its October 31, 2006 order, and to supplement the payment amount from the Commonwealth with an increase to reflect lost interest to Belaval at the appropriate rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of whether San Juan may seek to attach funds in the federal proceeding after remand, even though (as we understand it) the municipality is not yet a judgment creditor, is not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costs are awarded to Belaval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The actual deposit did not occur until December 22, 2006, and it came only after the defendant sought additional extensions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Defendant briefly speculates that if another entity had occupied San Juan's premises, it might have operated more efficiently, thereby requiring Puerto Rico to spend less money in reimbursements.

In that decision, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court determined that Belaval had been operating its facilities without a valid contract with its landlord, the Municipality of San Juan.

We reverse and remand to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount only the key points from the history of this litigation, supplemented with the facts that arose after our October 2, 2006 decision in <i>Belaval.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of Puerto Rico's failure to make the statutorily required Medicaid payments, three FQHCs filed suit in June 2003 seeking prospective injunctive relief from the federal district court. Belaval, the sole appellant now before us, was one of the three FQHC plaintiffs. The defendant was the Secretary of the Department of Health of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 1, 2004, the district court adopted a magistrate judge's report and recommendation, and it granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction. Under the terms of the injunction, the defendant was required (among other things) to make quarterly \"wraparound\" payments starting from the second quarter of 2004. Several months later, we issued our decision in <i>Rio Grande,</i> which pertained to a similar injunction previously issued for one of Belaval's co-plaintiffs. We rejected the Commonwealth's arguments that it was improper for a federal court to issue such an injunction. <i>See Rio Grande,</i> 397 F.3d at 68-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet by August 12, 2005, Puerto Rico still had failed to make a single payment to Belaval, and so on that date Belaval asked the district court to issue an order to show cause why the defendant Secretary should not be held in contempt. The magistrate judge issued the order, and then after receiving the defendant's response, issued a report and recommendation finding that the defendant was not in compliance with the November 1, 2004 order. The magistrate judge also acknowledged that Belaval's August 12 motion requested that defendant be held in contempt, and the judge recommended that this request be held in abeyance so that the defendant could be given several weeks to comply with the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an opinion issued October 6, 2005, the district court adopted the key parts of the magistrate judge's report and recommendation. But the district court also sua sponte modified the preliminary injunction so that it would only take effect beginning with the third quarter of 2005. This erroneous sua sponte modification relieved the defendant of several quarters' worth of payments. When Belaval took an interlocutory appeal, we reversed this modification because, inter alia, it had been made without providing notice and a hearing for Belaval. <i>See Belaval,</i> 465 F.3d at 37-38. Our <i>Belaval</i> opinion issued on October 2, 2006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, and in light of our decision, the district court (under a different judge to whom the case had been assigned) released a two-part order. First, the court ordered Belaval to submit, by October 18, 2006, a memorandum with supporting evidence explaining how much it was owed under the terms of the original injunction. Second, the court ordered the Secretary to respond to Belaval's filing by October 30, 2006. Belaval timely submitted its memorandum and accompanying evidence. However, the Secretary did not respond by the required date. Thus, on October 31, 2006, the district court ordered the defendant to pay Belaval $6,772,549, and further ordered the defendant to deposit this amount with the Clerk of Court by November 9, 2006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 8, 2006, the defendant asked for an extension of time to deposit the required funds, and also filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's October 31 order. Most of the motion was geared towards arguments that the $6.7 million figure was too high, that more discovery was needed to determine the correct amount, and that in any event a hearing was needed on whether the district court should reinstate the injunction modification that had been imposed prior to our decision in <i>Belaval.</i> The motion also briefly noted that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court had, on October 10, 2006, issued an (apparently unpublished) opinion in a case about a landlord-tenant dispute between Belaval and the Municipality of San Juan (the \"<i>San Juan</i> opinion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As that opinion recounts, San Juan owns the physical structure, and the equipment, at the location where Belaval had been providing its health services. Since 1986, Belaval had leased its space from the municipality, but the lease expired on June 30, 2002. Belaval nonetheless continued to operate and provide medical services at that location, beyond the period of occupancy under the terms of the lease. After unsuccessfully attempting to evict Belaval, San Juan filed suit against Belaval in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance. The municipality sought a declaratory judgment that there was \"no contract or valid title that would allow [Belaval] to continue operating\" the facilities, and it also sought damages. The Court of First Instance issued a partial declaratory judgment that the contract between the parties had expired on June 30, 2002. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court upheld that partial judgment on appeal, pointing out that because this was a government contract with a municipality, Puerto Rico law required any contract to be in writing, which precluded Belaval from arguing that there had been an implicit renewal of the agreement. That is all that the case decided. No assessment of damages was made, and the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance to continue proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Back in federal court, on November 13, 2006, the district court denied the Secretary's motion for reconsideration, pointing out that the Secretary's arguments should have been raised before the filing deadline had passed. However, the court did grant the requested extension of time to deposit the funds (although it expressed some frustration with the defendants). It also directed the parties to discuss the effect of the <i>San Juan</i> opinion&#8212;if any&#8212;on the payments owed to Belaval. The court further ordered that San Juan be given notice in case it wished to try to intervene in the case, and the court indicated that once the Secretary in fact paid the funds to the court, those funds would remain with the court pending further order. The Secretary did eventually deposit the funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps prompted by the district court's order, San Juan filed a motion to intervene on December 11, 2006. San Juan alleged that Belaval owed it over $5 million, and it asked the federal court to order the attachment of $5,276,127.06 out of the funds to be deposited with the federal court. The district court ordered all parties to show cause why Belaval's funds should not be attached as requested, and deposited with the Court of First Instance. The parties filed their responses on December 20, 2006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same day, and reacting to the district court's earlier order from November 13, the defendant Secretary filed a memorandum of law regarding the effect of the <i>San Juan</i> opinion. Eight days later, and apparently in response to this memorandum, the district court dismissed Belaval as a party to the case and authorized the Commonwealth to withdraw the funds it had deposited with the court. In a short order, and without citing any case law or other authority (beyond the <i>San Juan</i> opinion), the district court determined that Belaval \"should not have been operating at the time this federal action was commenced,\" and so Belaval did not have \"clean hands\" to seek the equitable remedy of a preliminary injunction. Because the court had dismissed Belaval from the action, it denied as moot San Juan's motion to intervene. Later that same day, the Secretary withdrew the funds she had deposited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The December 28 order was entered without the benefit of a response from Belaval. The next day, Belaval filed a motion for reconsideration, and it asked that it be able to file an opposition to the Secretary's arguments. Then, before the district court ruled on this motion, Belaval submitted an opposition \"on the assumption the Court grants our request for reconsideration.\" The district court denied the motion for reconsideration, stating that it had considered Belaval's opposition, and that the court would nonetheless reaffirm its earlier order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Belaval appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Belaval's appeal challenges both the substance and the procedure of the district court's decision. We bypass Belaval's procedural arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our merits analysis goes straight to evaluating the district court's use of the unclean hands doctrine. Our review is for abuse of discretion, <i>see K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524046\"><a href=\"/opinion/524046/k-mart-corporation-v-oriental-plaza-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 912 (1st Cir.1989), and an error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion, <i>see Top Entm't, Inc. v. Torrejon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200737\"><a href=\"/opinion/200737/top-entertainment-v-torrejon/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, 533 (1st Cir.2003). On the facts presented, the district court both committed an error of law and abused its discretion in finding that the unclean hands doctrine was applicable, and then in dismissing Belaval's case and releasing the deposited funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine of unclean hands, or, more archaically, the maxim that \"[h]e who comes into equity must come with clean hands,\" <i>Keystone Driller Co. v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></span>; <i>see also Shondel v.

The basic premise is that when a district court considers whether or not to award equitable relief, one factor that it must consider is the extent to which the plaintiff has engaged in certain misconduct. <i>See Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Dep't of Consumer Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196188\"><a href=\"/opinion/196188/texaco-pr-inc-v-daco/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>, 880 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine has limits, and not all misconduct by a plaintiff will soil that plaintiff's hands. Among other things, the doctrine \"only applies when the claimant's misconduct is directly related to the merits of the controversy between the parties, that is, when the tawdry acts `in some measure affect the equitable relations between the parties in respect of something brought before the court for adjudication.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Keystone,</i> 290 U.S. at 245, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></span>). The mere fact that the \"misconduct\" arises from some overlapping facts is not enough. Since \"relatively few plaintiffs are wholly free from any trace of arguable misconduct at least tangentially related to the objective of their suit, the right to injunctive relief . . . would have little value if the defendant could divert the proceeding into the byways of collateral misconduct.\" <i>Shondel,</i> 775 F.2d at 869.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there was no relationship between Belaval's underlying suit against Puerto Rico for payment for services provided under the federal Medicaid statute, and Belaval's Puerto Rico law contract dispute with San Juan. Belaval's entitlement to payment from the Secretary turns on whether or not it meets the definition of an FQHC, and whether or not it provides medical services. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1396a(bb), 1396d(<i>l</i>)(2)(B). There is no dispute that Belaval was an FQHC during the relevant time, and that Belaval provided the relevant services. The district court nevertheless justified its actions on the ground that Belaval \"should not have been operating\" at the time this federal action commenced. That justification is error, and the two questions are unrelated. At most, the Commonwealth's argument could be that Belaval should not have been operating <i>at the specific facility owned by San Juan.</i> But Belaval's entitlement to payment does not turn on whether it operated at that specific facility. The fact that Belaval may have overstayed its lease does not directly relate to the controversy between the parties in the federal case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary nonetheless protests that Belaval's operation was \"illegal,\" and defendant worries that \"the possibilities of fomenting illegal operations would be encouraged if Belaval is allowed to receive any amount for their illegal operation.\" Defendant contends that Puerto Rico will be injured if \"public funds [are] disbursed to an entity that carried on an illegal operation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument still fails to establish relatedness. Although the Secretary says that Belaval operated \"illegally,\" she does not even suggest that payment to Belaval would be impermissible under the federal Medicaid statute. Rather, her main point is that under Puerto Rico law, Belaval was required to have a written contract with San Juan if it wished to have an enforceable lease. This \"illegality\" is not related to Puerto Rico's failure to make statutorily required Medicaid payments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> There is no reason to think that these federally required payments can be displaced by local landlord-tenant law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we observed in our prior opinion, Belaval has been pushed to \"the brink of financial ruin\" because of Puerto Rico's continuing failure to make the required payments. <i>Belaval,</i> 465 F.3d at 36 n. 2. We note that San Juan, as amicus on appeal, opposes the relief granted the Commonwealth and supports Belaval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding all of the above, the Secretary appears to make a last ditch argument that the <i>San Juan</i> opinion has somehow transformed Belaval's collection efforts into attempts to obtain retroactive monetary relief, which would then be barred by the Eleventh Amendment. This confusing claim is without merit. As we determined in <i>Rio Grande,</i> the plaintiffs in this case face no Eleventh Amendment bar because they have sought prospective injunctive relief. 397 F.3d at 75-76; <i>cf. Edelman v. Jordan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108990\"><a href=\"/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 668-71, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108990\"><a href=\"/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Neither the fact that the Commonwealth has managed to avoid its obligations under an injunction that was issued prospectively, nor the fact that Belaval has been operating without a contract with San Juan, affects this in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's December 28, 2006 judgment is <i>reversed.</i> The case is <i>remanded,</i> and the district court is instructed promptly to reinstate the case, to restore and enforce the payment obligation created by its October 31, 2006 order, and to supplement the payment amount from the Commonwealth with an increase to reflect lost interest to Belaval at the appropriate rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of whether San Juan may seek to attach funds in the federal proceeding after remand, even though (as we understand it) the municipality is not yet a judgment creditor, is not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costs are awarded to Belaval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The actual deposit did not occur until December 22, 2006, and it came only after the defendant sought additional extensions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Defendant briefly speculates that if another entity had occupied San Juan's premises, it might have operated more efficiently, thereby requiring Puerto Rico to spend less money in reimbursements.
