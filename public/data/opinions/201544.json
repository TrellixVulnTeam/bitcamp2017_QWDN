Under   the   Immigration   and\n\nNationality Act, an alien who marries a United States citizen is\n\nentitled to petition for permanent residency on a conditional\n\nbasis.   See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1154(a)(1)(A)(i) & (ii),\n\nand 1186a(a)(1).     Within 90 days of the second anniversary of the\n\nconditional admission, the couple (if the citizen is not deceased)\n\nmay jointly petition for the removal of the condition.          See 8\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1186a(c)(1)(A) & 216(d)(2)(A).        Each such petition is\n\nrequired to state, inter alia, that the marriage has not been\n\njudicially annulled or terminated, and that it was not entered into\n\nfor the purpose of procuring the alien spouse's admission as an\n\nimmigrant.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(d)(1)(A)(i)(II) & (III).\n\n           If the couple has divorced within two years of the\n\nconditional admission, the alien spouse may still apply to the\n\nAttorney General to remove the conditional nature of her admission\n\nby granting a \"hardship waiver.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4).   Insofar\n\nas is relevant here, the statute authorizing the Attorney General\n\nto grant such applications provides:\n\n           The   Attorney   General, in  the  Attorney\n           General's    discretion,  may  remove   the\n           conditional basis of the permanent resident\n           status for an alien who fails to meet the\n           [conditions described above] if the alien\n           demonstrates that . . .\n\n                  (B) the qualifying marriage was entered\n             into in good faith by the alien spouse, but\n             the qualifying marriage has been terminated\n             (other than through the death of the spouse)\n\n                                  -3-\n\f            and the alien was not at fault in failing to\n            meet the [conditions described above] . . . .\n\n            In acting under applications under this\n            paragraph, the Attorney General shall consider\n            any   credible   evidence  relevant   to   the\n            application.     The determination of what\n            evidence is credible and the weight to be\n            given that evidence shall be within the sole\n            discretion of the Attorney General . . . .\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B).\n\n            On September 15, 1997, petitioner Agnes Cho, a Chinese\n\ncitizen of Burmese descent, married a United States citizen of\n\nBurmese descent.      Subsequently, Cho secured conditional admission\n\nas a permanent United States resident.             The couple divorced within\n\ntwo years of the marriage, and Cho applied to the Attorney General\n\nfor a hardship waiver.        But the Attorney General, acting first\n\nthrough an INS district director, then through an immigration\n\njudge, and finally through the Board of Immigration Appeals, denied\n\nCho's application on the ground that she failed to establish that\n\nshe   had   married   in   good   faith    and    thus   failed   to   establish\n\neligibility for a hardship waiver.               Cho petitions to vacate the\n\norder of removal that followed these determinations, arguing, inter\n\nalia, that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the\n\nAttorney General's ruling.        The Attorney General responds that we\n\nlack jurisdiction to entertain this petition and, alternatively,\n\nthat the removal order is grounded in substantial evidence.\n\n            We begin with the jurisdictional issue.               The Attorney\n\nGeneral argues that we lack power to consider the petition under a\n\n                                     -4-\n\fpermanent, jurisdiction-stripping statute enacted into law as part\n\nof the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.\n\nIn relevant part, the statute reads:\n\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no\n          court shall have jurisdiction to review --\n\n            (i) any judgment regarding the granting of\n          relief under [certain statutory grants of\n          discretionary   authority  to  the  Attorney\n          General not here relevant], or\n\n             (ii) any other decision or action of the\n          Attorney General the authority for which is\n          specified under this subchapter to be in the\n          discretion of the Attorney General, other than\n          the granting of relief under [another statute\n          not here relevant].\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B).    The parties agree that the Attorney\n\nGeneral's rejection of an application for a hardship waiver under\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B) is a decision made pursuant to the\n\nrelevant statutory \"subchapter\" mentioned in subparagraph (ii).\n\nThey also agree that the Attorney General's general authority to\n\ngrant a hardship waiver under § 1186a(c)(4)(B) is specified to be\n\nwithin the Attorney General's discretion.   But they disagree over\n\nwhether these two facts resolve the jurisdictional issue.\n\n          The Attorney General says that they do.     He primarily\n\nargues that the \"decision or action\" referred to in 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is his final order, which he says is his denial\n\nof the hardship waiver, and not the threshold eligibility ruling --\n\nthat Cho failed to prove that she married in good faith -- on which\n\nthat order was based.     And because this \"decision or action\"\n\n                               -5-\n\finvolves the withholding of discretionary relief, the argument\n\ngoes, we have no power of review.             Cf. Pilch v. Ashcroft, 353 F.3d\n\n585, 587 (7th Cir. 2003) (interpreting a similar jurisdiction-\n\nstripping provision of the IIRIRA's transitional rules, IIRIRA §\n\n309(c)(4)(E),      and    explaining     that,    absent    an   all-or-nothing\n\napproach, \"there would be no jurisdiction if the agency is right\n\nbut jurisdiction when it errs; [and] that would be a back door\n\nassertion    of    jurisdiction    to    review     every   decision,    and     an\n\neffective nullification of the statute\").              Cho counters that the\n\n\"decision or action\" referred to in the statute is not the Attorney\n\nGeneral's discretionary decision to withhold a hardship waiver, but\n\nthe specific and non-discretionary (or so she argues, see infra)\n\nruling upon which that decision depended and which she challenges\n\nin her petition -- i.e., that Cho is not within the class of aliens\n\nentitled    to    apply   to   discretionary      relief    under   8   U.S.C.    §\n\n1186a(c)(4)(B) because she failed to establish that she married in\n\ngood faith.\n\n            We think that Cho has the better of this argument.                   We\n\nstart with the fact that the Attorney General's position proves too\n\nmuch.   Even if we were to accept for the sake of argument that the\n\nfinal agency order at which the petition is directed, and not the\n\neligibility ruling leading to the order, is the \"decision or\n\naction\" to which 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) refers, the final\n\nagency order in this case would not be the Attorney General's\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\frejection of Cho's application for a hardship waiver.           Rather, it\n\nwould be the removal order itself, which is the final decision of\n\nthe Attorney General that we have jurisdiction to review under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(1).       See Subhan v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 591, 594\n\n(7th Cir. 2004).    And the removal order is not a decision or action\n\nthe authority for which is specified by the relevant statute to be\n\nin the discretion of the Attorney General.          See id.\n\n          Accordingly, and contrary to the position he takes in his\n\nbrief, the Attorney General needs us to look to the rationale\n\nunderlying his order, and not simply the nature of the order\n\nitself, if 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is ever to preclude court\n\nreview of a final removal order.          And in this case, the rationale\n\nfor the final removal order was not that the Attorney General, in\n\nan exercise of the discretion conferred upon him by 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1186a(c)(4)(B), saw fit to reject Cho's application for a hardship\n\nwaiver; it was that Cho is ineligible as a matter of law for a\n\ndiscretionary hardship waiver under § 1186a(c)(4)(B) because she\n\nfailed to establish that she married in good faith.           So even if we\n\nassume   arguendo   that    the   \"decision    or   action\"   to   which   §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) refers in the context of this case is not the\n\nremoval order, but is the specific decision leading to the removal\n\norder, we would not accept the Attorney General's characterization\n\nof that decision as involving a discretionary denial of a hardship\n\nwaiver to an eligible alien under § 1186a(c)(4)(B).\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f             Treating the Attorney General's ineligibility ruling as\n\nthe relevant \"decision or action\" (again, assuming for the sake of\n\nargument that the relevant \"decision or action\" is not the removal\n\norder itself) is consistent with the approach we have taken in\n\nother cases interpreting similar jurisdiction-stripping provisions\n\nof the IIRIRA.        In those cases, we have consistently emphasized\n\nthat, in deciding whether a jurisdiction-stripping statute applies,\n\nwe should engage in a precise reading of both the agency decision\n\nand the petition.      See Succar v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 8, 20 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (interpreting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)); Prado v. Reno,\n\n198   F.3d    286,    288   (1st   Cir.    1999)   (also      interpreting   §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(i)); Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 61-62 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (interpreting IIRIRA § 309(c)(4)(E)).\n\n             The reasons for reading precisely provided in those cases\n\npertain here as well.       First, if Congress had intended to preclude\n\nall court review of agency decisions involving hardship waiver\n\napplications, it is hard to see why it would not have said so more\n\nclearly and categorically, using language such as that in, for\n\nexample,     IIRIRA   §   309(c)(4)(G)    (\"[T]here   shall    be   no   appeal\n\npermitted in the case of an alien who is inadmissable or deportable\n\nby reason of having committed [certain criminal offenses]\") -- a\n\ntransitional rule which we have read to preclude all court review\n\nin the case of an alien who was deemed by the agency to be\n\ninadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed one of the\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fspecified criminal offenses.         See Bernal-Vallejo, 195 F.3d at 62;\n\nsee also Ruckbi v. INS, 159 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1998).            And short\n\nof using language of this sort, Congress certainly could have added\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B) to the list of statutes described in 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) as involving \"judgment[s]\" that \"no court\n\nshall have jurisdiction to review.\"           See Prado, 198 F.3d at 290\n\n(suggesting in dicta that the jurisdiction-stripping language of §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(i) prohibits review of a \"broader\" range of agency\n\ndecisions    than    does   IIRIRA    §    309(c)(4)(E),   which,        like   §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), prohibits review of only certain discretionary\n\n\"decisions\"); but see Montero Martinez v. Ashcroft, 277 F.3d 1137,\n\n1141-44 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that the term \"judgment\" in §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(i) encompasses only discretionary decisions by the\n\nAttorney General).\n\n            Second, the IIRIRA's jurisdiction-stripping provisions\n\nhave been interpreted not to preclude judicial review \"of the legal\n\nquestion of interpretation of the statute as to whether an alien is\n\neligible for consideration of relief.\"            Succar, 394 F.3d at 19\n\n(emphasis added); see also Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110, 125\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (\"Analytically, the decision whether an alien is\n\neligible to be considered for a particular discretionary form of\n\nrelief is a statutory question separate from the discretionary\n\ncomponent    of     the   administrative    decision   whether      to     grant\n\nrelief.\").\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            Third, and relatedly, the eligibility ruling challenged\n\nhere is not one that historically has been regarded as entirely\n\ndiscretionary. See Bernal-Vallejo, 195 F.3d at 63 (looking at pre-\n\nIIRIRA caselaw to determine whether a particular ruling should be\n\nregarded as purely discretionary or as having a reviewable legal\n\ncomponent).    Rather, it is a question the resolution of which has\n\nbeen   regarded     as      circumscribed         by    a     legal   standard.       See\n\nRodriguez v. INS, 204 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2000) (adopting and\n\napplying a legal standard -- \"whether, at the time of the marriage,\n\nthere was an intent to establish a life together\" -- in reviewing\n\nthe Attorney General's determination that the petitioner failed to\n\nestablish    that     he    had     married    in      good    faith)   (citation     and\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., Damon v. Ashcroft, 360\n\nF.3d 1084,     1088-89       (9th    Cir.     2004)     (concluding,     in   light   of\n\ngoverning     legal        principles       and     without      discussion    of     any\n\njurisdictional issues, that there was no substantial evidence to\n\nsupport the Attorney General's determination that an alien was\n\nineligible for § 1186a(c)(4)(B) relief because she failed to prove\n\nthat she had married in good faith).                   It also is a question whose\n\nresolution is informed by objective regulatory criteria set forth\n\nat 8 C.F.R. § 216.5(e)(2) (listing factors to be considered in\n\nassessing whether a marriage was entered into in good faith).\n\nCf. Bernal-Vallejo, 195 F.3d at 62 (observing that inquiries guided\n\nby objective statutory criteria are not discretionary).\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f          Our jurisdictional inquiry does not end with our decision\n\nto treat the Attorney General's eligibility ruling, and not his\n\ndenial of the hardship waiver, as the relevant \"decision or action\"\n\nfor   purposes      of   assessing     the    effect     of    8       U.S.C.   §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) on Cho's petition.           The Attorney General has a\n\nfallback position:       that his eligibility rulings are themselves\n\ndiscretionary    decisions     or   actions   shielded    from     substantial\n\nevidence review under § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). At first, this argument\n\nseems implausible in light of the authority, set forth in the\n\npreceding paragraph, suggesting that the decision whether an alien\n\nhas married in good faith is not completely discretionary but is,\n\nrather, a decision with a legal component that helps define the\n\nclass of aliens eligible for hardship waivers. But as the Attorney\n\nGeneral correctly points out, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B) not only\n\ncommits to the Attorney General's discretion the decision whether\n\nto grant eligible aliens hardship waivers, but it also contains the\n\nprovision which states: \"In acting on applications under this\n\nparagraph,    the   Attorney   General      shall   consider     any    credible\n\nevidence relevant to the application.           The determination of what\n\nevidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence shall\n\nbe within the sole discretion of the Attorney General.\"\n\n             In the Attorney General's view, this \"sole discretion\"\n\nprovision effectively describes all that goes into a threshold\n\neligibility ruling under 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B), and thus\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\frenders all such rulings \"decision(s) or action(s)\" textually\n\ncommitted to the Attorney General's unreviewable discretion per 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).   The Attorney General says that the\n\nThird Circuit has accepted this reading of the statute. See Urena-\n\nTavarez v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 154, 159-61 (3d Cir. 2004); see also\n\nAssaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir. 2004) (following\n\nUrena-Tavarez); Randhawa v. Ashcroft, 2005 WL 221502 (6th Cir. Jan.\n\n31, 2005) (unpublished opinion) (same).\n\n          Although Urena-Tavarez and the cases which follow it use\n\nsweeping language, they do not unequivocally hold that 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars all court challenges to determinations by\n\nthe Attorney General that an alien has failed to prove that she\n\nmarried in good faith and thus is ineligible for discretionary\n\nrelief under 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B).       Of the three opinions,\n\nonly Urena-Tavarez describes in any detail the nature of the\n\narguments made in the petition for review, and it is clear that the\n\narguments in that case were directed at the Attorney General's\n\ncredibility determinations and the weight he gave to the evidence\n\nthat he credited.   See 367 F.3d at 160-61.    And we certainly have\n\nno quarrel with the conclusion that § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes\n\ncourt review of petitions grounded in such arguments (again,\n\nassuming arguendo that we should peek behind the veil of the\n\nremoval order itself).\n\n          But we think it evident that the portion of 8 U.S.C. §\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f1186a(c)(4)(B)     which   commits    to     the    Attorney      General's    \"sole\n\ndiscretion\" the tasks of deciding what evidence is credible and the\n\nweight to be given to that evidence should not be read also to\n\ncommit to the Attorney General's sole discretion the qualitatively\n\ndifferent    tasks   of    interpreting       applicable         background    legal\n\nquestions and applying those standards to the evidence ultimately\n\ncredited    and   deemed   weighty.        Such     a    reading    would     broadly\n\ninterpret the relevant statutory language, unnaturally we think, to\n\nyield an outlier enclave of administrative law in which the courts\n\nare stripped of their customary power to be the final word on the\n\nmeaning of legal concepts imbedded in our immigration statutes.2\n\nNot surprisingly, the Supreme Court has cautioned against such\n\noutcomes.     See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 298 (2001); see\n\nalso Montero-Martinez, 277 F.3d at 1141.                     Perhaps this is why\n\ncourts, including ours, have not hesitated to review the Attorney\n\nGeneral's     threshold      eligibility           determinations       under      §\n\n1186a(c)(4)(B) for substantial record evidence notwithstanding the\n\nstatute's    \"sole   discretion\"      provision         --   a   provision    which,\n\nincidentally, pre-dates the IIRIRA.            See, e.g., Syed v. Ashcroft,\n\n\n\n     2\n      Indeed, one should be careful not to read the \"sole\ndiscretion\" language too broadly, because such a reading could be\nin tension both with the previous sentence in the statute --\ndirecting that (our emphasis) \"the Attorney General shall consider\nany credible evidence relevant to the application\" -- and the\nlegislative history describing the origin and purpose of the two\nsentences, as a pair. See H.R. Rep. 103-395 (describing purpose of\nsection 242); H.R. Conf. Rep. 103-711 at 164-65.\n\n                                      -13-\n\f389 F.3d 248, 251 (1st Cir. 2004); Rodriguez, 204 F.3d at 27.\n\nThere is, after all, only marginal (if any) tension between the\n\n\"sole discretion\" provision (narrowly directed to the question of\n\nwhat evidence is credible and how much weight it should be given)\n\nand the substantial evidence standard of review (as applied to the\n\nstatutory question whether the marriage was entered into in good\n\nfaith), which merely looks to whether an agency determination is\n\nreasonably grounded in the administrative record and has never\n\nproperly been understood to permit a reviewing court either to\n\nsubstitute its own credibility findings for those made by the\n\nagency or to weigh the credited evidence itself.        See, e.g.,\n\nConsolo v. Federal Maritime Comm., 383 U.S. 607, 619-21 (1966);\n\nSeavey v. Barnhart, 276 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2001); see generally\n\nII Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise, § 11.2 (4th\n\ned. 2002).\n\n          We conclude our discussion of jurisdiction by observing\n\nthat the concern expressed by Judge Easterbrook in Pilch and noted\n\nabove -- that allowing a peek behind the veil at the actual\n\nrationale of the Attorney General's decision would open the door to\n\nthe de facto nullification of the jurisdiction-stripping statute,\n\nsee 353 F.3d at 587 -- is not relevant here.    We hold today only\n\nthat eligibility rulings under section 1186a remain reviewable by\n\nthe courts, and that this is true whether the 'decision or action'\n\nphrase of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) covers only 'final' decisions or also\n\n\n                               -14-\n\finterim   rulings,    cf.    Subhan,   383   F.3d   at   594-95.   The\n\njurisdictional questions arising from that statutory provision are\n\nmany and complex, and nothing we say here should be taken to\n\ndictate answers for problems beyond the one we are addressing.\n\n          We turn now to whether there is substantial record\n\nevidence supporting the Attorney General's decision, here delegated\n\nto and made by the BIA, that Cho failed to prove that she married\n\nin good faith.    The relevant legal standard is, again, whether Cho\n\nintended to establish a life with her spouse at the time she\n\nmarried him.     See Rodriquez, 204 F.3d at 27 (citing Bark v. INS,\n\n511 F.2d 1200, 1201 (9th Cir. 1975)). Cho's marriage is legitimate\n\nso long as this standard is met, even if securing an immigration\n\nbenefit was one of the factors that led her to marry.        See Matter\n\nof Boromand, 17 I. & N. Dec. 450, 454 (BIA 1980); Sarah Ignatius &\n\nElisabeth S. Stickney, Immigration Law & the Family, § 4:21 (2004);\n\ncf. United States v. Tagalicud, 84 F.3d 1180, 1185 (9th Cir. 1996)\n\n(\"The ulterior motive of financial benefit or immigration benefit\n\ndoes not make the marriage a fraud, though it may be evidence that\n\nthe marriage is fraudulent.\") (interpreting 8 U.S.C. § 1325(b)).\n\n          We start with the fact that Cho made a very strong\n\nshowing that she married with the requisite intent to establish a\n\nlife with her husband.      Cho introduced uncontradicted evidence --\n\nexpressly credited by the IJ and never questioned by the BIA --\n\nthat she and her future husband engaged in a nearly two-year\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fcourtship prior to marrying (Cho lived in Taiwan at the time she\n\nwas telephonically introduced to her future husband by a mutual\n\nacquaintance in January 1996); that she and her future husband were\n\nin frequent telephonic contact during the portions of this two-year\n\nperiod when they lived apart (telephone records were introduced to\n\nsubstantiate this); that her future husband traveled to Taiwan and\n\nthen to Burma in December 1996 (he stayed through early 1997) to\n\nmeet her and her family; that she paid a ten-day visit to her\n\nfuture husband in the United States in March 1997 to meet his\n\nfamily and to sightsee; that she returned to the United States in\n\nJune 1997 (on a visitor's visa which permitted her to remain in the\n\ncountry through late September 1997) to decide whether she would\n\nremain in the United States or whether her future husband would\n\nmove with her to Taiwan; that the two decided to marry civilly on\n\nSeptember 15, 1997 and then to return to Taiwan to hold a more\n\nformal reception (a reception that was never held because of\n\nemergent marriage troubles traceable, inter alia, to her husband's\n\nphysical and emotional abuse and intimate relationship with a\n\nformer girlfriend); and that the two lived together at his parents'\n\nhouse from the time of her arrival in the United States in June\n\n1997 until he asked her to move out on April 22, 1998 (the day of\n\nher conditional residency interview, at which she angered her\n\nhusband by arriving with counsel and an affidavit detailing his\n\nabuse of her).\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f              In addition, Cho introduced evidence that, after the\n\nmarriage,     she   and   her    husband   jointly      enrolled   in    a   health\n\ninsurance policy, filed tax returns, opened bank accounts, entered\n\ninto automobile financing agreements, and secured a credit card.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 216(e)(2)(i) (noting the potential relevance to the\n\ngood-faith determination of \"[d]ocumentation relating to the degree\n\nto which the financial assets and liabilities of the parties were\n\ncombined\").     Cho also introduced extensive counseling records from\n\nthe period following her separation which detailed her therapists'\n\nperceptions that she harbored a strong desire to make her marriage\n\nwork and her serious depression over its troubles and eventual\n\nfailure.\n\n              The BIA cited four facts in support of its conclusion\n\nthat, in spite this evidence (which the Board acknowledged but did\n\nnot   discuss),     Cho   had    failed    to   carry    her   burden:    (1)   her\n\napplication to secure conditional permanent residency, and a visa\n\npetition her husband concomitantly submitted on her behalf, were\n\nprepared in Cho's handwriting within two weeks of the marriage; (2)\n\nCho and her husband married one week prior to the expiration of the\n\nvisitor's visa by which she came to the United States in June 1997;\n\n(3) Cho's husband maintained an intimate relationship with another\n\nwoman during the marriage; and (4) Cho obtained employment and\n\nmoved   out    of   the   marital    residence     shortly     after     obtaining\n\nconditional residency.          These findings are problematic and do not,\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\falone or in combination, sufficiently ground the Attorney General's\n\ninference about Cho's intent at the time of her marriage.\n\n            The BIA did not explain, and we do not see, how Cho's\n\nprompt submission of a conditional residency application after her\n\nmarriage tends to show that Cho did not marry in good faith.   As we\n\nalready have stated, the visitor's visa by which Cho entered the\n\ncountry expired just after the marriage, so Cho had to do something\n\nto remain here lawfully.    So too with the fact that the relevant\n\nforms were filled out in Cho's handwriting; how this tends to show\n\na sham marriage is unexplained and not apparent to us (especially\n\nin light of the uncontradicted record evidence that Cho filled out\n\nthe forms because she wrote more legibly in English than did her\n\nhusband).    And while Cho's husband's intimate relationship with\n\nanother woman during the marriage might well have been probative of\n\nCho's marital intentions if there were some evidence that Cho knew\n\nof the relationship and its nature at the time she married, the\n\nuncontradicted evidence was that Cho learned of the affair only\n\nafter the marriage. These facts thus do little to substantiate the\n\nconclusion that Cho failed to establish the bona fides of her\n\nmarriage.\n\n            This leaves the two findings regarding the timing of the\n\nmarriage and the separation.    Taken in isolation, these findings\n\nmight seem to identify substantial evidence in support of the\n\nAttorney General's decision. After all, the findings are supported\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fby the record, and ordinarily, one who marries one week prior to\n\nthe expiration of her visitor's visa and then moves out of the\n\nmarital home shortly after the conditional residency interview\n\nmight    reasonably      be     thought    to    have    married    solely       for   an\n\nimmigration benefit.           But we are not permitted to analyze these\n\nfindings in isolation; we must evaluate them in context.                              See,\n\ne.g., Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(emphasizing      that      substantial         evidence       review    requires      an\n\nassessment of the entirety of the administrative record). And when\n\nwe do so, any connotation of fraud raised by the timing of the\n\nmarriage and the separation largely evaporates. For the undisputed\n\nand credited record evidence establishes both that the marriage was\n\npreceded by a long courtship and that Cho's husband initiated the\n\nseparation   after       Cho    publically       embarrassed      him    by    retaining\n\ncounsel and detailing his abuse of her at the conditional residency\n\ninterview.      Thus, this \"timing\" evidence does not seem to us to be\n\n\"such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate\" to\n\nground    the        Attorney     General's        eligibility          determination.\n\nConsolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938).\n\n            The      substantial       evidence         test    requires       that    we\n\n\"'conscientiously find that the evidence supporting [the Attorney\n\nGeneral's] decision is substantial, when viewed in the light that\n\nthe record      in    its   entirety      furnishes,       including     the    body   of\n\nevidence opposed to the Board's view.'\" Mukamusoni, 390 F.3d at 119\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\f(quoting Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951)).\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we cannot so find based on the\n\nrecord in this case.     Therefore, we conclude that petitioner Cho\n\nhas satisfied the \"good faith\" marriage requirement for eligibility\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B).         Accordingly, we grant Cho's\n\npetition for review and remand this matter to the BIA for further\n\nproceedings   consistent   with   this   opinion.   This   resolution\n\neliminates any need for us to consider whether the BIA erred in\n\nupholding the IJ's denial of Cho's motion to reconsider.\n\n          So ordered.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We acknowledge with gratitude the efforts of the Family\nViolence Prevention Fund, the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute,\nthe National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, and\nGreater Boston Legal Services, who jointly filed a brief as amici\ncuriae in support of Cho.\n\n                                  -20-\n\f",

Subsequently, Cho secured conditional admission as a permanent United States resident. The couple divorced within two years of the marriage, and Cho applied to the Attorney General for a hardship waiver. But the Attorney General, acting first through an INS district director, then through an immigration judge, and finally through the Board of Immigration Appeals, denied Cho's application on the ground that she failed to establish that she had married in good faith and thus failed to establish eligibility for a hardship waiver. Cho petitions to vacate the order of removal that followed these determinations, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the Attorney General's ruling. The Attorney General responds that we lack jurisdiction to entertain this petition and, alternatively, that the removal order is grounded in substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the jurisdictional issue. The Attorney General argues that we lack power to consider the petition under a permanent, jurisdiction-stripping statute enacted into law as part of the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. In relevant part, the statute reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under [certain statutory grants of discretionary authority to the Attorney General not here relevant], or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney General the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General, other than the granting of relief under [another statute not here relevant].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B). The parties agree that the Attorney General's rejection of an application for a hardship waiver under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) is a decision made pursuant to the relevant statutory \"subchapter\" mentioned in subparagraph (ii). They also agree that the Attorney General's general authority to grant a hardship waiver under &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) is specified to be within the Attorney General's discretion. But they disagree over whether these two facts resolve the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General says that they do. He primarily argues that the \"decision or action\" referred to in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is his final order, which he says is his denial of the hardship waiver, and not the threshold eligibility ruling &#8212; that Cho failed to prove that she married in good faith &#8212; on which that order was based. And because this \"decision or action\" involves the withholding of discretionary relief, the argument goes, we have no power of review. <i>Cf. Pilch v. Ashcroft,</i> 353 F.3d 585, 587 (7th Cir.2003) (interpreting a similar jurisdiction-stripping provision of the IIRIRA's transitional rules, IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(E), and explaining that, absent an all-or-nothing approach, \"there would be no jurisdiction if the agency is right but jurisdiction when it errs; [and] that would be a back door assertion of jurisdiction to review every decision, and an effective nullification of the statute\"). Cho counters that the \"decision or action\" referred to in the statute is not the Attorney General's discretionary decision to withhold a hardship waiver, but the specific and non-discretionary (or so she argues, <i>see infra</i>) ruling upon which that decision depended and which she challenges in her petition &#8212; i.e., that Cho is not within the class of aliens entitled to apply to discretionary relief under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) because she failed to establish that she married in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that Cho has the better of this argument. We start with the fact that the Attorney General's position proves too much. Even if we were to accept for the sake of argument that the final agency order at which the petition is directed, and not the eligibility ruling leading to the order, is the \"decision or action\" to which 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) refers, the final agency order in this case would not be the Attorney General's rejection of Cho's application for a hardship waiver. Rather, it would be the removal order itself, which is the final decision of the Attorney General that we have jurisdiction to review under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(1). <i>See Subhan v. Ashcroft,</i> 383 F.3d 591, 594 (7th Cir.2004). And the removal order is not a decision or action the authority for which is specified by the relevant statute to be in the discretion of the Attorney General. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, and contrary to the position he takes in his brief, the Attorney General needs us to look to the rationale underlying his order, and not simply the nature of the order itself, if 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is ever to preclude court review of a final removal order. And in this case, the rationale for the final removal order was not that the Attorney General, in an exercise of the discretion conferred upon him by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B), saw fit to reject Cho's application for a hardship waiver; it was that Cho is ineligible as a matter of law for a discretionary hardship waiver under &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) because she failed to establish that she married in good faith. So even if we assume <i>arguendo</i> that the \"decision or action\" to which &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) refers in the context of this case is not the removal order, but is the specific decision leading to the removal order, we would not accept the Attorney General's characterization of that decision as involving a discretionary denial of a hardship waiver to an eligible alien under &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treating the Attorney General's ineligibility ruling as the relevant \"decision or action\" (again, assuming for the sake of argument that the relevant \"decision or action\" is not the removal order itself) is consistent with the approach we have taken in other cases interpreting similar jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the IIRIRA. In those cases, we have consistently emphasized that, in deciding whether a jurisdiction-stripping statute applies, we should engage in a precise reading of both the agency decision and the petition. <i>See Succar v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 8, 20 (1st Cir.2005) (interpreting 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)); <i>Prado v. Reno,</i> 198 F.3d 286, 288 (1st Cir.1999) (also interpreting &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)); <i>Bernal-Vallejo v. INS,</i> 195 F.3d 56, 61-62 (1st Cir.1999) (interpreting IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(E)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasons for reading precisely provided in those cases pertain here as well. First, if Congress had intended to preclude all court review of agency decisions involving hardship waiver applications, it is hard to see why it would not have said so more clearly and categorically, using language such as that in, for example, IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(G) (\"[T]here shall be no appeal permitted in the case of an alien who is inadmissable or deportable by reason of having committed [certain criminal offenses]\") &#8212; a transitional rule which we have read to preclude <i>all</i> court review in the case of an alien who was deemed by the agency to be inadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed one of the specified criminal offenses. <i>See Bernal-Vallejo,</i> 195 F.3d at 62; <i>see also Ruckbi v.

And short of using language of this sort, Congress certainly could have added 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) to the list of statutes described in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) as involving \"judgment[s]\" that \"no court shall have jurisdiction to review.\" <i>See Prado,</i> 198 F.3d at 290 (suggesting in dicta that the jurisdiction-stripping language of &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) prohibits review of a \"broader\" range of agency decisions than does IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(E), which, like &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), prohibits review of only certain discretionary \"decisions\"); <i>but see Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft,</i> 277 F.3d 1137, 1141-44 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that the term \"judgment\" in &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) encompasses only discretionary decisions by the Attorney General).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the IIRIRA's jurisdiction-stripping provisions have been interpreted <i>not</i> to preclude judicial review \"of the legal question of interpretation of the statute as to whether an alien is <i>eligible</i> for consideration of relief.\" <i>Succar,</i> 394 F.3d at 19 (emphasis added); <i>see also Goncalves v. Reno,</i> 144 F.3d 110, 125 (1st Cir.1998) (\"Analytically, the decision whether an alien is eligible to be considered for a particular discretionary form of relief is a statutory question separate from the discretionary component of the administrative decision whether to grant relief.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and relatedly, the eligibility ruling challenged here is <i>not</i> one that historically has been regarded as entirely discretionary. <i>See Bernal-Vallejo,</i> 195 F.3d at 63 (looking at pre-IIRIRA caselaw to determine whether a particular ruling should be regarded as purely discretionary or as having a reviewable legal component). Rather, it is a question the resolution of which has been regarded as circumscribed by a legal standard. <i>See Rodriguez v. INS,</i> 204 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2000) (adopting and applying a legal standard &#8212; \"whether, at the time of the marriage, there was an intent to establish a life together\" &#8212; in reviewing the Attorney General's determination that the petitioner failed to establish that he had married in good faith) (citation and quotation marks omitted); <i>see also, e.g., Damon v. Ashcroft,</i> 360 F.3d 1084, 1088-89 (9th Cir.2004) (concluding, in light of governing legal principles and without discussion of any jurisdictional issues, that there was no substantial evidence to support the Attorney General's determination that an alien was ineligible for &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) relief because she failed to prove that she had married in good faith). It also is a question whose resolution is informed by objective regulatory criteria set forth at 8 C.F.R. &#167; 216.5(e)(2) (listing factors to be considered in assessing whether a marriage was entered into in good faith). <i>Cf. Bernal-Vallejo,</i> 195 F.3d at 62 (observing that inquiries guided by objective statutory criteria are not discretionary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our jurisdictional inquiry does not end with our decision to treat the Attorney General's eligibility ruling, and not his denial of the hardship waiver, as the relevant \"decision or action\" for purposes of assessing the effect of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) on Cho's petition. The Attorney General has a fallback position: that his eligibility rulings are themselves discretionary decisions or actions shielded from substantial evidence review under &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). At first, this argument seems implausible in light of the authority, set forth in the preceding paragraph, suggesting that the decision whether an alien has married in good faith is not completely discretionary but is, rather, a decision with a legal component that helps define the class of aliens eligible for hardship waivers. But as the Attorney General correctly points out, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) not only commits to the Attorney General's discretion the decision whether to grant eligible aliens hardship waivers, but it also contains the provision which states: \"In acting on applications under this paragraph, the Attorney General shall consider any credible evidence relevant to the application. The determination of what evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole discretion of the Attorney General.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Attorney General's view, this \"sole discretion\" provision effectively describes all that goes into a threshold eligibility ruling under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B), and thus renders all such rulings \"decision(s) or action(s)\" textually committed to the Attorney General's unreviewable discretion per 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). The Attorney General says that the Third Circuit has accepted this reading of the statute. <i>See Urena-Tavarez v. Ashcroft,</i> 367 F.3d 154, 159-61 (3d Cir.2004); <i>see also Assaad v. Ashcroft,</i> 378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004) (following <i>Urena-Tavarez</i>); <i>Randhawa v. Ashcroft,</i> 121 Fed.Appx. 612, 2005 WL 221502 (6th Cir. Jan.31, 2005) (unpublished opinion) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Urena-Tavarez</i> and the cases which follow it use sweeping language, they do not unequivocally hold that 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars <i>all</i> court challenges to determinations by the Attorney General that an alien has failed to prove that she married in good faith and thus is ineligible for discretionary relief under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B). Of the three opinions, only <i>Urena-Tavarez</i> describes in any detail the nature of the arguments made in the petition for review, and it is clear that the arguments in that case were directed at the Attorney General's credibility determinations and the weight he gave to the evidence that he credited. <i>See</i> 367 F.3d at 160-61. And we certainly have no quarrel with the conclusion that &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes court review of petitions grounded in such arguments (again, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that we should peek behind the veil of the removal order itself).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we think it evident that the portion of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) which commits to the Attorney General's \"sole discretion\" the tasks of deciding what evidence is credible and the weight to be given to that evidence should not be read also to commit to the Attorney General's sole discretion the qualitatively different tasks of interpreting applicable background legal questions and applying those standards to the evidence ultimately credited and deemed weighty. Such a reading would broadly interpret the relevant statutory language, unnaturally we think, to yield an outlier enclave of administrative law in which the courts are stripped of their customary power to be the final word on the meaning of legal concepts imbedded in our immigration statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has cautioned against such outcomes. <i>See INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 298, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001); <i>see also Montero-Martinez,</i> 277 F.3d at 1141. Perhaps this is why courts, including ours, have not hesitated to review the Attorney General's threshold eligibility determinations under &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) for substantial record evidence notwithstanding the statute's \"sole discretion\" provision &#8212; a provision which, incidentally, pre-dates the IIRIRA. <i>See, e.g., Syed v. Ashcroft,</i> 389 F.3d 248, 251 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Rodriguez,</i> 204 F.3d at 27. There is, after all, only marginal (if any) tension between the \"sole discretion\" provision (narrowly directed to the question of what evidence is credible and how much weight it should be given) and the substantial evidence standard of review (as applied to the statutory question whether the marriage was entered into in good faith), which merely looks to whether an agency determination is reasonably grounded in the administrative record and has never properly been understood to permit a reviewing court either to substitute its own credibility findings for those made by the agency or to weigh the credited evidence itself. <i>See, e.g., Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm.,</i> 383 U.S. 607, 619-21, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966); <i>Seavey v. Barnhart,</i> 276 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see generally</i> II Richard J.

We hold today only that eligibility rulings under section 1186a remain reviewable by the courts, and that this is true whether the `decision or action' phrase of &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) covers only `final' decisions or also interim rulings, <i>cf. Subhan,</i> 383 F.3d at 594-95. The jurisdictional questions arising from that statutory provision are many and complex, and nothing we say here should be taken to dictate answers for problems beyond the one we are addressing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to whether there is substantial record evidence supporting the Attorney General's decision, here delegated to and made by the BIA, that Cho failed to prove that she married in good faith. The relevant legal standard is, again, whether Cho intended to establish a life with her spouse at the time she married him. <i>See Rodriquez,</i> 204 F.3d at 27 (citing <i>Bark v. INS,</i> 511 F.2d 1200, 1201 (9th Cir.1975)). Cho's marriage is legitimate so long as this standard is met, even if securing an immigration benefit was <i>one</i> of the factors that led her to marry. <i>See Matter of Boromand,</i> 17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 450, 454 (BIA 1980); Sarah Ignatius &amp; Elisabeth S. Stickney, <i>Immigration Law &amp; the Family,</i> &#167; 4:21 (2004); <i>cf. United States v. Tagalicud,</i> 84 F.3d 1180, 1185 (9th Cir.1996) (\"The ulterior motive of financial benefit or immigration benefit does not make the marriage a fraud, though it may be evidence that the marriage is fraudulent.\") (interpreting 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1325(b)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the fact that Cho made a very strong showing that she married with the requisite intent to establish a life with her husband. Cho introduced uncontradicted evidence &#8212; expressly credited by the IJ and never questioned by the BIA &#8212; that she and her future husband engaged in a nearly two-year courtship prior to marrying (Cho lived in Taiwan at the time she was telephonically introduced to her future husband by a mutual acquaintance in January 1996); that she and her future husband were in frequent telephonic contact during the portions of this two-year period when they lived apart (telephone records were introduced to substantiate this); that her future husband traveled to Taiwan and then to Burma in December 1996 (he stayed through early 1997) to meet her and her family; that she paid a ten-day visit to her future husband in the United States in March 1997 to meet his family and to sightsee; that she returned to the United States in June 1997 (on a visitor's visa which permitted her to remain in the country through late September 1997) to decide whether she would remain in the United States or whether her future husband would move with her to Taiwan; that the two decided to marry civilly on September 15, 1997 and then to return to Taiwan to hold a more formal reception (a reception that was never held because of emergent marriage troubles traceable, <i>inter alia,</i> to her husband's physical and emotional abuse and intimate relationship with a former girlfriend); and that the two lived together at his parents' house from the time of her arrival in the United States in June 1997 until he asked her to move out on April 22, 1998 (the day of her conditional residency interview, at which she angered her husband by arriving with counsel and an affidavit detailing his abuse of her).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Cho introduced evidence that, after the marriage, she and her husband jointly enrolled in a health insurance policy, filed tax returns, opened bank accounts, entered into automobile financing agreements, and secured a credit card. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 216(e)(2)(i) (noting the potential relevance to the good-faith determination of \"[d]ocumentation relating to the degree to which the financial assets and liabilities of the parties were combined\"). Cho also introduced extensive counseling records from the period following her separation which detailed her therapists' perceptions that she harbored a strong desire to make her marriage work and her serious depression over its troubles and eventual failure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA cited four facts in support of its conclusion that, in spite of this evidence (which the Board acknowledged but did not discuss), Cho had failed to carry her burden: (1) her application to secure conditional permanent residency, and a visa petition her husband concomitantly submitted on her behalf, were prepared in Cho's handwriting within two weeks of the marriage; (2) Cho and her husband married one week prior to the expiration of the visitor's visa by which she came to the United States in June 1997; (3) Cho's husband maintained an intimate relationship with another woman during the marriage; and (4) Cho obtained employment and moved out of the marital residence shortly after obtaining conditional residency. These findings are problematic and do not, alone or in combination, sufficiently ground the Attorney General's inference about Cho's intent at the time of her marriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA did not explain, and we do not see, how Cho's prompt submission of a conditional residency application after her marriage tends to show that Cho did not marry in good faith. As we already have stated, the visitor's visa by which Cho entered the country expired just after the marriage, so Cho had to do something to remain here lawfully. So too with the fact that the relevant forms were filled out in Cho's handwriting; how this tends to show a sham marriage is unexplained and not apparent to us (especially in light of the uncontradicted record evidence that Cho filled out the forms because she wrote more legibly in English than did her husband). And while Cho's husband's intimate relationship with another woman during the marriage might well have been probative of Cho's marital intentions if there were some evidence that Cho knew of the relationship and its nature at the time she married, the uncontradicted evidence was that Cho learned of the affair only <i>after</i> the marriage. These facts thus do little to substantiate the conclusion that Cho failed to establish the <i>bona fides</i> of her marriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the two findings regarding the timing of the marriage and the separation. Taken in isolation, these findings might seem to identify substantial evidence in support of the Attorney General's decision. After all, the findings are supported by the record, and ordinarily, one who marries one week prior to the expiration of her visitor's visa and then moves out of the marital home shortly after the conditional residency interview might reasonably be thought to have married solely for an immigration benefit. But we are not permitted to analyze these findings in isolation; we must evaluate them in context. <i>See, e.g., Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft,</i> 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir.2004) (emphasizing that substantial evidence review requires an assessment of the entirety of the administrative record). And when we do so, any connotation of fraud raised by the timing of the marriage and the separation largely evaporates. For the undisputed and credited record evidence establishes both that the marriage was preceded by a long courtship and that <i>Cho's husband</i> initiated the separation after Cho publicly embarrassed him by retaining counsel and detailing his abuse of her at the conditional residency interview. Thus, this \"timing\" evidence does not seem to us to be \"such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate\" to ground the Attorney General's eligibility determination. <i>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB,</i> 305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantial evidence test requires that we \"`conscientiously find that the evidence supporting [the Attorney General's] decision is substantial, when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes, including the body of evidence opposed to the Board's view.'\" <i>Mukamusoni,</i> 390 F.3d at 119 (quoting <i>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,</i> 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951)). For the reasons set forth above, we cannot so find based on the record in this case. Therefore, we conclude that petitioner Cho has satisfied the \"good faith\" marriage requirement for eligibility under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B). Accordingly, we <i>grant</i> Cho's petition for review and <i>remand</i> this matter to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. This resolution eliminates any need for us to consider whether the BIA erred in upholding the IJ's denial of Cho's motion to reconsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>So ordered.</i>\n      <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as United States Attorney General on February 3, 2005.

Subsequently, Cho secured conditional admission as a permanent United States resident. The couple divorced within two years of the marriage, and Cho applied to the Attorney General for a hardship waiver. But the Attorney General, acting first through an INS district director, then through an immigration judge, and finally through the Board of Immigration Appeals, denied Cho's application on the ground that she failed to establish that she had married in good faith and thus failed to establish eligibility for a hardship waiver. Cho petitions to vacate the order of removal that followed these determinations, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the Attorney General's ruling.

They also agree that the Attorney General's general authority to grant a hardship waiver under &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) is specified to be within the Attorney General's discretion.

He primarily argues that the \"decision or action\" referred to in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is his final order, which he says is his denial of the hardship waiver, and not the threshold eligibility ruling &#8212; that Cho failed to prove that she married in good faith &#8212; on which that order was based. And because this \"decision or action\" involves the withholding of discretionary relief, the argument goes, we have no power of review. <i>Cf. Pilch v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784573\"><a href=\"/opinion/784573/stanislaw-pilch-and-zofia-pilch-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span>, 587 (7th Cir.2003) (interpreting a similar jurisdiction-stripping provision of the IIRIRA's transitional rules, IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(E), and explaining that, absent an all-or-nothing approach, \"there would be no jurisdiction if the agency is right but jurisdiction when it errs; [and] that would be a back door assertion of jurisdiction to review every decision, and an effective nullification of the statute\"). Cho counters that the \"decision or action\" referred to in the statute is not the Attorney General's discretionary decision to withhold a hardship waiver, but the specific and non-discretionary (or so she argues, <i>see infra</i>) ruling upon which that decision depended and which she challenges in her petition &#8212; i.e., that Cho is not within the class of aliens entitled to apply to discretionary relief under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) because she failed to establish that she married in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that Cho has the better of this argument. We start with the fact that the Attorney General's position proves too much. Even if we were to accept for the sake of argument that the final agency order at which the petition is directed, and not the eligibility ruling leading to the order, is the \"decision or action\" to which 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) refers, the final agency order in this case would not be the Attorney General's rejection of Cho's application for a hardship waiver. Rather, it would be the removal order itself, which is the final decision of the Attorney General that we have jurisdiction to review under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(1). <i>See Subhan v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787730\"><a href=\"/opinion/787730/mohammed-subhan-v-john-d-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span>, 594 (7th Cir.2004). And the removal order is not a decision or action the authority for which is specified by the relevant statute to be in the discretion of the Attorney General. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, and contrary to the position he takes in his brief, the Attorney General needs us to look to the rationale underlying his order, and not simply the nature of the order itself, if 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is ever to preclude court review of a final removal order. And in this case, the rationale for the final removal order was not that the Attorney General, in an exercise of the discretion conferred upon him by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B), saw fit to reject Cho's application for a hardship waiver; it was that Cho is ineligible as a matter of law for a discretionary hardship waiver under &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) because she failed to establish that she married in good faith. So even if we assume <i>arguendo</i> that the \"decision or action\" to which &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) refers in the context of this case is not the removal order, but is the specific decision leading to the removal order, we would not accept the Attorney General's characterization of that decision as involving a discretionary denial of a hardship waiver to an eligible alien under &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treating the Attorney General's ineligibility ruling as the relevant \"decision or action\" (again, assuming for the sake of argument that the relevant \"decision or action\" is not the removal order itself) is consistent with the approach we have taken in other cases interpreting similar jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the IIRIRA. In those cases, we have consistently emphasized that, in deciding whether a jurisdiction-stripping statute applies, we should engage in a precise reading of both the agency decision and the petition. <i>See Succar v.

First, if Congress had intended to preclude all court review of agency decisions involving hardship waiver applications, it is hard to see why it would not have said so more clearly and categorically, using language such as that in, for example, IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(G) (\"[T]here shall be no appeal permitted in the case of an alien who is inadmissable or deportable by reason of having committed [certain criminal offenses]\") &#8212; a transitional rule which we have read to preclude <i>all</i> court review in the case of an alien who was deemed by the agency to be inadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed one of the specified criminal offenses. <i>See Bernal-Vallejo,</i> 195 F.3d at 62; <i>see also Ruckbi v.

And short of using language of this sort, Congress certainly could have added 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) to the list of statutes described in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) as involving \"judgment[s]\" that \"no court shall have jurisdiction to review.\" <i>See Prado,</i> 198 F.3d at 290 (suggesting in dicta that the jurisdiction-stripping language of &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) prohibits review of a \"broader\" range of agency decisions than does IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(E), which, like &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), prohibits review of only certain discretionary \"decisions\"); <i>but see Montero-Martinez v.

It also is a question whose resolution is informed by objective regulatory criteria set forth at 8 C.F.R. &#167; 216.5(e)(2) (listing factors to be considered in assessing whether a marriage was entered into in good faith). <i>Cf. Bernal-Vallejo,</i> 195 F.3d at 62 (observing that inquiries guided by objective statutory criteria are not discretionary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our jurisdictional inquiry does not end with our decision to treat the Attorney General's eligibility ruling, and not his denial of the hardship waiver, as the relevant \"decision or action\" for purposes of assessing the effect of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) on Cho's petition. The Attorney General has a fallback position: that his eligibility rulings are themselves discretionary decisions or actions shielded from substantial evidence review under &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). At first, this argument seems implausible in light of the authority, set forth in the preceding paragraph, suggesting that the decision whether an alien has married in good faith is not completely discretionary but is, rather, a decision with a legal component that helps define the class of aliens eligible for hardship waivers. But as the Attorney General correctly points out, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) not only commits to the Attorney General's discretion the decision whether to grant eligible aliens hardship waivers, but it also contains the provision which states: \"In acting on applications under this paragraph, the Attorney General shall consider any credible evidence relevant to the application. The determination of what evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole discretion of the Attorney General.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Attorney General's view, this \"sole discretion\" provision effectively describes all that goes into a threshold eligibility ruling under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B), and thus renders all such rulings \"decision(s) or action(s)\" textually committed to the Attorney General's unreviewable discretion per 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).

Of the three opinions, only <i>Urena-Tavarez</i> describes in any detail the nature of the arguments made in the petition for review, and it is clear that the arguments in that case were directed at the Attorney General's credibility determinations and the weight he gave to the evidence that he credited. <i>See</i> 367 F.3d at 160-61. And we certainly have no quarrel with the conclusion that &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes court review of petitions grounded in such arguments (again, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that we should peek behind the veil of the removal order itself).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we think it evident that the portion of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) which commits to the Attorney General's \"sole discretion\" the tasks of deciding what evidence is credible and the weight to be given to that evidence should not be read also to commit to the Attorney General's sole discretion the qualitatively different tasks of interpreting applicable background legal questions and applying those standards to the evidence ultimately credited and deemed weighty. Such a reading would broadly interpret the relevant statutory language, unnaturally we think, to yield an outlier enclave of administrative law in which the courts are stripped of their customary power to be the final word on the meaning of legal concepts imbedded in our immigration statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has cautioned against such outcomes. <i>See INS v.

Perhaps this is why courts, including ours, have not hesitated to review the Attorney General's threshold eligibility determinations under &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B) for substantial record evidence notwithstanding the statute's \"sole discretion\" provision &#8212; a provision which, incidentally, pre-dates the IIRIRA. <i>See, e.g., Syed v.

There is, after all, only marginal (if any) tension between the \"sole discretion\" provision (narrowly directed to the question of what evidence is credible and how much weight it should be given) and the substantial evidence standard of review (as applied to the statutory question whether the marriage was entered into in good faith), which merely looks to whether an agency determination is reasonably grounded in the administrative record and has never properly been understood to permit a reviewing court either to substitute its own credibility findings for those made by the agency or to weigh the credited evidence itself. <i>See, e.g., Consolo v.

Cho introduced uncontradicted evidence &#8212; expressly credited by the IJ and never questioned by the BIA &#8212; that she and her future husband engaged in a nearly two-year courtship prior to marrying (Cho lived in Taiwan at the time she was telephonically introduced to her future husband by a mutual acquaintance in January 1996); that she and her future husband were in frequent telephonic contact during the portions of this two-year period when they lived apart (telephone records were introduced to substantiate this); that her future husband traveled to Taiwan and then to Burma in December 1996 (he stayed through early 1997) to meet her and her family; that she paid a ten-day visit to her future husband in the United States in March 1997 to meet his family and to sightsee; that she returned to the United States in June 1997 (on a visitor's visa which permitted her to remain in the country through late September 1997) to decide whether she would remain in the United States or whether her future husband would move with her to Taiwan; that the two decided to marry civilly on September 15, 1997 and then to return to Taiwan to hold a more formal reception (a reception that was never held because of emergent marriage troubles traceable, <i>inter alia,</i> to her husband's physical and emotional abuse and intimate relationship with a former girlfriend); and that the two lived together at his parents' house from the time of her arrival in the United States in June 1997 until he asked her to move out on April 22, 1998 (the day of her conditional residency interview, at which she angered her husband by arriving with counsel and an affidavit detailing his abuse of her).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Cho introduced evidence that, after the marriage, she and her husband jointly enrolled in a health insurance policy, filed tax returns, opened bank accounts, entered into automobile financing agreements, and secured a credit card. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 216(e)(2)(i) (noting the potential relevance to the good-faith determination of \"[d]ocumentation relating to the degree to which the financial assets and liabilities of the parties were combined\"). Cho also introduced extensive counseling records from the period following her separation which detailed her therapists' perceptions that she harbored a strong desire to make her marriage work and her serious depression over its troubles and eventual failure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA cited four facts in support of its conclusion that, in spite of this evidence (which the Board acknowledged but did not discuss), Cho had failed to carry her burden: (1) her application to secure conditional permanent residency, and a visa petition her husband concomitantly submitted on her behalf, were prepared in Cho's handwriting within two weeks of the marriage; (2) Cho and her husband married one week prior to the expiration of the visitor's visa by which she came to the United States in June 1997; (3) Cho's husband maintained an intimate relationship with another woman during the marriage; and (4) Cho obtained employment and moved out of the marital residence shortly after obtaining conditional residency. These findings are problematic and do not, alone or in combination, sufficiently ground the Attorney General's inference about Cho's intent at the time of her marriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA did not explain, and we do not see, how Cho's prompt submission of a conditional residency application after her marriage tends to show that Cho did not marry in good faith. As we already have stated, the visitor's visa by which Cho entered the country expired just after the marriage, so Cho had to do something to remain here lawfully. So too with the fact that the relevant forms were filled out in Cho's handwriting; how this tends to show a sham marriage is unexplained and not apparent to us (especially in light of the uncontradicted record evidence that Cho filled out the forms because she wrote more legibly in English than did her husband). And while Cho's husband's intimate relationship with another woman during the marriage might well have been probative of Cho's marital intentions if there were some evidence that Cho knew of the relationship and its nature at the time she married, the uncontradicted evidence was that Cho learned of the affair only <i>after</i> the marriage. These facts thus do little to substantiate the conclusion that Cho failed to establish the <i>bona fides</i> of her marriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the two findings regarding the timing of the marriage and the separation. Taken in isolation, these findings might seem to identify substantial evidence in support of the Attorney General's decision. After all, the findings are supported by the record, and ordinarily, one who marries one week prior to the expiration of her visitor's visa and then moves out of the marital home shortly after the conditional residency interview might reasonably be thought to have married solely for an immigration benefit. But we are not permitted to analyze these findings in isolation; we must evaluate them in context. <i>See, e.g., Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201357\"><a href=\"/opinion/201357/mukamusoni-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 119 (1st Cir.2004) (emphasizing that substantial evidence review requires an assessment of the entirety of the administrative record). And when we do so, any connotation of fraud raised by the timing of the marriage and the separation largely evaporates. For the undisputed and credited record evidence establishes both that the marriage was preceded by a long courtship and that <i>Cho's husband</i> initiated the separation after Cho publicly embarrassed him by retaining counsel and detailing his abuse of her at the conditional residency interview. Thus, this \"timing\" evidence does not seem to us to be \"such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate\" to ground the Attorney General's eligibility determination. <i>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103099\"><a href=\"/opinion/103099/consolidated-edison-co-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 229, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104856\"><a href=\"/opinion/104856/universal-camera-corp-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span>, 488, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104856\"><a href=\"/opinion/104856/universal-camera-corp-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Therefore, we conclude that petitioner Cho has satisfied the \"good faith\" marriage requirement for eligibility under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B). Accordingly, we <i>grant</i> Cho's petition for review and <i>remand</i> this matter to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. This resolution eliminates any need for us to consider whether the BIA erred in upholding the IJ's denial of Cho's motion to reconsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>So ordered.</i>\n      <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as United States Attorney General on February 3, 2005.
