This   is   an    appeal    from     the\n\ndismissal of a suit by Angel Villanueva-Mendez charging several\n\nofficials of a Puerto Rico agency with demoting him for politically\n\ndiscriminatory reasons.        Because the matter was resolved in the\n\ndefendants'    favor   on    summary    judgment     based      on   a   statute   of\n\nlimitations defense, the facts are recited in the light most\n\nfavorable to Villanueva.            Morris v. Gov't Dev. Bank of P.R., 27\n\nF.3d 746, 748 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            From July 1997 to June 2000, Villanueva, an active member\n\nof the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), occupied a trust (i.e., non-\n\ncareer) position in a Puerto Rico government authority now called\n\nthe National Parks Company.          In June 2000, he became Park Director\n\nof   the   Camuy   River    Caves    Park   (\"Camuy\"),     a    permanent    career\n\nposition under Puerto Rico law. In January 2001, after the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (\"PDP\") won the general election, a new PDP\n\ngovernor took office and Ramon Luis Nieves-Vazquez was named\n\nExecutive Director of the National Parks Company.\n\n            On February 20, 2001, Nieves met with Villanueva to\n\ndiscuss a new initiative within the National Parks Company, the\n\ncreation of a Quality Standards Committee.                     There followed       a\n\nletter to Villanueva, received on February 28 and reading (in\n\ntranslation) as follows:\n\n            February 27, 2001\n\n            Mr. Angel Villanueva Mendez\n            Director, Camuy River Caves Park\n\n                                        -3-\n\f          SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT\n\n          Last February 20, I held a conversation with\n          you regarding the projects that are to be\n          carried out with the creation of the Puerto\n          Rico National Parks Company, specifically, the\n          creation of a Quality Standards Committee.\n\n          As per our conversation, and due to service\n          needs, I hereby notify you that effective\n          March 1, 2001, I am assigning you to work in\n          the Quality Standards Committee in the\n          headquarters of Puerto Rico National Parks\n          Trust. You will have flexible working hours.\n\n          In order that this assignment not be onerous\n          to you, I am approving a differential amount\n          of $195.00 monthly for the duration of the\n          project. This assignment will not affect your\n          employee status or your monthly salary.\n\n          We hereby notify you that you are entitled to\n          appeal the foregoing assignment within thirty\n          (30) days of receipt of this letter if you\n          think that your rights have been violated.\n\n          We expect your usual collaboration.\n\n          Sincerely,\n\n          [signature]\n          Ramon Luis Nieves, Esq.\n          Executive Director\n\n          Starting March 1, 2001, Villanueva began traveling to the\n\nNational Parks Company's central offices in San Juan three days a\n\nweek, to attend to the duties of his new assignment.   On March 9,\n\nhe suffered a work-related accident that kept him away from work\n\nuntil May 18.   While on leave, Villanueva sent Nieves a letter,\n\ndated March 27 and captioned \"APPEAL OF SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT.\"    In\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fthe letter, Villanueva asked Nieves to \"reconsider my assignation\n\nto the Quality Standards Committee.\"    He continued:\n\n            I believe that this transfer, disguised as an\n            assignment, . . . violates my rights as a\n            permanent employee of our agency.\n\n            In the first place, I am relieved of my duties\n            as Director of the Camuy River Caves Park,\n            without any justification, in order to place\n            another person that has the trust and the\n            political   affiliation   of  the   appointing\n            authority. . . .\n\n            Therefore, this transfer is not justified,\n            removing me from my place of work, on the\n            grounds that it responds to service needs.\n            The nature of the service need is not stated\n            either. However, I was not assigned functions\n            or duties, either specific or concrete, in the\n            alleged special assignment. . . .\n\nVillanueva concluded by asking \"that this situation be corrected\"\n\nand that he \"be reinstated as Director of the Camuy River Caves\n\nPark, with all my rights, duties, and prerogatives as a public\n\nservant.\"\n\n            Instead, on May 21, 2001, just as Villanueva returned to\n\nactive duty, Nieves announced a newly-created position within the\n\nNational Parks Company--\"Park Coordinator\"--to be filled by Angel\n\nLopez-Lopez.    According to Villanueva, the new appointee was \"a\n\nknown PDP activist,\" and he \"was going to be in charge of [Camuy]\n\nfrom that day on.\"    That same day, Villanueva requested a meeting\n\nwith Nieves and asked him \"about this stripping of functions\";\n\nNieves responded (according to Villanueva), \"In the past you were\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fa confidential employee and you must understand that I have to\n\nchoose my people.\"\n\n            The next day, May 22, Nieves sent Villanueva a letter\n\ndescribing the tasks that Villanueva \"will be performing full-time\n\nas part of the Quality Standards Committee.\"      Villanueva sent a\n\nletter of his own to Nieves on May 23--their two letters apparently\n\ncrossed in the mail--appealing \"the decision to unlawfully remove\n\nme from my functions as the Park Director for the Camuy River\n\nCaverns.\"    Referring back to the May 21 meeting at which Nieves\n\nannounced the appointment of Lopez, Villanueva recalled that\n\n            [a]t that meeting, among other things, you\n            asked me to vacate my office since it was\n            going to be occupied by Mr. Angel Lopez-Lopez,\n            Special Assistant that you were appointing as\n            the Park Director. . . .\n\n            On the other hand, you informed me that during\n            two days a week I would be working in San\n            Juan, as part of the job assignment you gave\n            me, and through which you had me direct the\n            Service Quality Standards Committee.        In\n            addition, you told me that the rest of the\n            week's work days I'd be reporting to the Camuy\n            River Caverns Park, but that I would be doing\n            the Service Quality Standards Committee work.\n            . . . I asked you to tell me how my functions\n            would be affected by the appointment of Mr.\n            Angel Lopez-Lopez. You pointed out to me that\n            you would let me know subsequently.     At the\n            time I write this communication I have not yet\n            been informed anything about it.\n\n            I understand that this whole situation[]\n            constitutes an unlawful removal of functions .\n            . . . As Park Director, I was the person in\n            charge of it and the one with the highest\n            hierarchy, I would take care of all matters at\n            the administrative level, working Monday\n\n                                 -6-\n\f            through Friday, I had my own office with a\n            secretary, telephone with an access code to\n            make calls through the local switchboard, and\n            also had a direct telephone line available to\n            me. In fact, whenever I traveled to San Juan\n            or other towns, I could make use of an\n            official vehicle with a driver.\n\n            This whole new situation that you all have\n            created within the agency, the supposed\n            reorganization that as you told me has not yet\n            been comp[l]eted, has constituted a removal of\n            my functions as the Park Director for the\n            Camuy River Caverns.\n\n            Villanueva filed the present law suit, under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983 (2000), on May 17, 2002.       He alleged that the injury of which\n\nhe complained occurred on May 21, 2001, when he \"was transferred\n\nand actually demoted involuntarily while simultaneously keeping\n\njust the title of Park Director.\"         The defendants (ignoring three\n\nothers   later    dropped   from   the   case)    were   Nieves   and   Samuel\n\nGonzalez,   who   was   described   in    the    complaint   as   the   Deputy\n\nExecutive Director of the National Parks Company.            The complaint,\n\nlater amended in respects not relevant here, also asserted claims\n\nunder Puerto Rico law.\n\n            The defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting that\n\nthe section 1983 claim--brought on May 17, 2002--had accrued in\n\nFebruary or March 2001 and so was barred by the applicable Puerto\n\nRico one-year statute of limitations. It is common ground that the\n\nPuerto Rico one-year period applies,1 but federal law determines\n\n\n     1\n      Federal law borrows the local statute, Morris, 27 F.3d at 748\n(citing Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 269 (1985)), and the\n\n                                    -7-\n\fthe starting (or accrual) date, Morris, 27 F.3d at 748.                            Accrual\n\ncommences, for federal law purposes, when a plaintiff \"knows, or\n\nhas reason to know, of the discriminatory act that underpins his\n\ncause of action.\"           Id. at 749 (citing Chardon v. Fernandez, 454\n\nU.S. 6, 8 (1981)).\n\n               The   district      court    agreed       with   the   defendants        that\n\nVillanueva's federal claim accrued \"at the latest[] on February 28,\n\n2001    when    he    received     the     letter    informing        him    of   his   new\n\nassignment.\"         The court dismissed the federal claim as barred by\n\nthe statute of limitations and dismissed somewhat different claims\n\nunder    Puerto      Rico    law   without     prejudice.         See       28    U.S.C.   §\n\n1367(c)(3) (2000).          Villanueva now appeals, and our review is de\n\nnovo, drawing inferences in his favor.                    Morris, 27 F.3d at 748.\n\n               At the outset, it is worth noting that Villanueva may not\n\nbe protected against \"political discrimination\" at all.                            Supreme\n\nCourt doctrine, creating such a constitutional claim under the\n\naegis of the First Amendment, distinguishes between positions for\n\nwhich    political          affiliation       is     a     legitimate        requirement\n\n(policymakers, confidential assistants, and so on) and those for\n\nwhich it is not a permissible basis for hiring or dismissal.                            See\n\nBranti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 518 (1980); Elrod v. Burns, 427\n\n\n\n\napplicable limitations period in Puerto Rico is one year, P.R. Laws\nAnn. tit. 31, § 5298 (2002); see also Morris, 27 F.3d at 748.\n\n                                            -8-\n\fU.S. 347, 372 (1976); see also Flynn v. City of Boston, 140 F.3d\n\n42, 44-46 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 961 (1998).\n\n              Save at the ends of the spectrum, whether a position is\n\nimmune to \"political discrimination\" is often debatable, dependent\n\non a host of variables; but there is also an inclination to have\n\nthe   judge    resolve   the   issue   based   primarily   on   the   official\n\ndescription of the position's duties.              See Duriex-Gauthier v.\n\nLopez-Nieves, 274 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 2001).           In all events, the\n\nquestion is resolved under federal constitutional standards; that\n\na claimant may be a trust employee under Puerto Rico law or instead\n\nhave civil service protection (as Villanueva does) is not decisive\n\nas to the 1983 claim, id., although claims under Puerto Rico law\n\nturn on the trust/career distinction.\n\n              Villanueva, as Camuy park director, was likely performing\n\nexecutive functions in some degree; but we have been given no\n\nposition description and furnished with few details.            Nor have the\n\ndefendants moved for summary disposition of Villanueva's claim on\n\nthis ground.      At the same time, our decision does not rest on any\n\nimplicit assumption that Villanueva is entitled to constitutional\n\nprotection; rather, it is an open question which, having not been\n\nraised, is also not here resolved.\n\n              We turn, then, to the statute of limitations which the\n\ndistrict court found to bar Villanueva's federal claim.               Standing\n\nalone, Nieves' original assignment of Villanueva to the Quality\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fStandards Committee is ambiguous in two respects: as to duration\n\nand, more important, as to whether it terminated Villanueva's\n\nposition as Camuy park director.             Even after the events of May\n\n2001, Villanueva concedes that his formal status and pay remained\n\nthat of a \"director,\" but whether this designation refers generally\n\nto \"rank\" in the civil service hierarchy or to the office of Camuy\n\npark director is a different matter.\n\n              Unfortunately for Villanueva, his March 27, 2001, letter\n\nsays:      \"In the first place, I am relieved of my duties as Director\n\nof the Camuy River Caves Park, without any justification, in order\n\nto place another person that has the trust and the political\n\naffiliation of the appointing authority.\"            It goes on to request\n\nthat \"I . . . be reinstated as Director of the Camuy River Caves\n\nPark, with all my rights, duties, and prerogatives as a public\n\nservant.\"\n\n              These statements by Villanueva reflect a recognition\n\nthat, as of March 2001, he had been ousted as Camuy park director\n\nand that his replacement was or would be a political appointee.\n\nThis did not mean that his special assignment was permanent; but he\n\nhad   no    apparent   reason   to   think   that,   at   its   end,   the   new\n\nadministration would remove his political replacement and reinstate\n\nhim as Camuy park director. So Villanueva certainly knew enough in\n\nMarch 2001 to bring a political discrimination claim for his\n\nouster.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f           The letter's powerful inference of knowledge might have\n\nbeen countered, if the facts so permitted, by a counter-showing\n\nfrom Villanueva that he had nevertheless in fact been allowed to\n\ncontinue his duties as Camuy park director until the events of May\n\n2001.   Yet he says himself that he was excluded after February 2001\n\nfrom travel and training that were customarily part of a park\n\ndirector's role.    Beyond this, we know only that he spent several\n\ndays a week at the Camuy park facilities and, seemingly, retained\n\nuntil May his original office space and certain perks (e.g., a\n\nchauffeured car).\n\n           In a legal filing with the district court,            Villanueva\n\nsaid that he was \"still officially performing two days a week his\n\nfunctions as Park Director\" until May 2001.         But his only citation\n\nfor this statement is to factual allegations in the complaint which\n\nneither directly support the inference nor carry weight once the\n\nissue has been posed on summary judgment by evidence proffered by\n\nthe opponent.    See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n\n250-52 (1986); LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 841-42\n\n(1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1018 (1994).\n\n           Thus, the only direct evidence before the district court\n\nwas Villanueva's own letter indicating that by March 2001 at the\n\nlatest, he knew he had been effectively supplanted as Camuy park\n\ndirector   in   favor   of   someone   who,   in   the   eyes   of   the   new\n\nadministration, had stronger political credentials.             The time to\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fbring a section 1983 claim on this ground was within one year of\n\nFebruary or March 2001.      Villanueva did not do so and his federal\n\nclaim is therefore barred.\n\n           There is not much else to say.      Villanueva argues that a\n\nclaim based on the special assignment that occurred in February\n\n2001 would not automatically bar a separate claim for his removal\n\nas Camuy park director in May, or that the latter should be viewed\n\nas part of a \"continuing violation.\"        This might well work if his\n\nremoval dated only from May 2001; but his letter, as already\n\npointed   out,   complains   of   his   removal–-not   just   his   special\n\nassignment–-in March 2001.\n\n           Villanueva also complains of the district court's failure\n\nto act on his opposition to a defendant's request for a stay of\n\ndiscovery; but, as the stay was not granted, how the failure to act\n\nhurt Villanueva's claim is not apparent and never explained.            At\n\noral argument his counsel said that Villanueva had himself sought\n\nfurther discovery; but a look at his request under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(f) indicates that this request for additional discovery related\n\nto an alternative qualified immunity defense, which the district\n\ncourt never reached.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f",

Bank of P.R.,</i> 27 F.3d 746, 748 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From July 1997 to June 2000, Villanueva, an active member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), occupied a trust (<i>i.e.,</i> non-career) position in a Puerto Rico government authority now called the National Parks Company. In June 2000, he became Park Director of the Camuy River Caves Park (\"Camuy\"), a permanent career position under Puerto Rico law. In January 2001, after the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") won the general election, a new PDP governor took office and Ramon Luis Nieves-Vazquez was named Executive Director of the National Parks Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 20, 2001, Nieves met with Villanueva to discuss a new initiative within the National Parks Company, the creation of a Quality Standards Committee. There followed a letter to Villanueva, received on February 28 and reading (in translation) as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <pre>  February 27, 2001\n  Mr. Angel Villanueva Mendez\n  Director, Camuy River Caves Park</pre>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last February 20, I held a conversation with you regarding the projects that are to be carried out with the creation of the Puerto Rico National Parks Company, specifically, the creation of a Quality Standards Committee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As per our conversation, and due to service needs, I hereby notify you that effective March 1, 2001, I am assigning you to work in the Quality Standards Committee in the headquarters of Puerto Rico National Parks Trust.

On March 9, he suffered a work-related accident that kept him away from work until May 18. While on leave, Villanueva sent Nieves a letter, dated March 27 and captioned \"APPEAL OF SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT.\" In the letter, Villanueva asked Nieves to \"reconsider my assignation to the Quality Standards Committee.\" He continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that this transfer, disguised as an assignment, . . . violates my rights as a permanent employee of our agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, I am relieved of my duties as Director of the Camuy River Caves Park, without any justification, in order to place another person that has the trust and the political affiliation of the appointing authority. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, this transfer is not justified, removing me from my place of work, on the grounds that it responds to service needs. The nature of the service need is not stated either. However, I was not assigned functions or duties, either specific or concrete, in the alleged special assignment. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villanueva concluded by asking \"that this situation be corrected\" and that he \"be reinstated as Director of the Camuy River Caves Park, with all my rights, duties, and prerogatives as a public servant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, on May 21, 2001, just as Villanueva returned to active duty, Nieves announced a newly-created position within the National Parks Company&#8212;\"Park Coordinator\"&#8212;to be filled by Angel Lopez-Lopez. According to Villanueva, the new appointee was \"a known PDP activist,\" and he \"was going to be in charge of [Camuy] from that day on.\" That same day, Villanueva requested a meeting with Nieves and asked him \"about this stripping of functions\"; Nieves responded (according to Villanueva), \"In the past you were a confidential employee and you must understand that I have to choose my people.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, May 22, Nieves sent Villanueva a letter describing the tasks that Villanueva \"will be performing full-time as part of the Quality Standards Committee.\" Villanueva sent a letter of his own to Nieves on May 23&#8212;their two letters apparently crossed in the mail&#8212;appealing \"the decision to unlawfully remove me from my functions as the Park Director for the Camuy River Caverns.\" Referring back to the May 21 meeting at which Nieves announced the appointment of Lopez, Villanueva recalled that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]t that meeting, among other things, you asked me to vacate my office since it was going to be occupied by Mr. Angel Lopez-Lopez, Special Assistant that you were appointing as the Park Director. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, you informed me that during two days a week I would be working in San Juan, as part of the job assignment you gave me, and through which you had me direct the Service Quality Standards Committee. In addition, you told me that the rest of the week's work days I'd be reporting to the Camuy River Caverns Park, but that I would be doing the Service Quality Standards Committee work. . . . I asked you to tell me how my functions would be affected by the appointment of Mr. Angel Lopez-Lopez. You pointed out to me that you would let me know subsequently. At the time I write this communication I have not yet been informed anything about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I understand that this whole situation[] constitutes an unlawful removal of functions.... As Park Director, I was the person in charge of it and the one with the highest hierarchy, I would take care of all matters at the administrative level, working Monday through Friday, I had my own office with a secretary, telephone with an access code to make calls through the local switchboard, and also had a direct telephone line available to me. In fact, whenever I traveled to San Juan or other towns, I could make use of an official vehicle with a driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This whole new situation that you all have created within the agency, the supposed reorganization that as you told me has not yet been comp[l]eted, has constituted a removal of my functions as the Park Director for the Camuy River Caverns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villanueva filed the present law suit, under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), on May 17, 2002. He alleged that the injury of which he complained occurred on May 21, 2001, when he \"was transferred and actually demoted involuntarily while simultaneously keeping just the title of Park Director.\" The defendants (ignoring three others later dropped from the case) were Nieves and Samuel Gonzalez, who was described in the complaint as the Deputy Executive Director of the National Parks Company. The complaint, later amended in respects not relevant here, also asserted claims under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting that the section 1983 claim&#8212;brought on May 17, 2002&#8212; had accrued in February or March 2001 and so was barred by the applicable Puerto Rico one-year statute of limitations. It is common ground that the Puerto Rico one-year period applies,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but federal law determines the starting (or accrual) date, <i>Morris,</i> 27 F.3d at 748. Accrual commences, for federal law purposes, when a plaintiff \"knows, or has reason to know, of the discriminatory act that underpins his cause of action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 749 (citing <i>Chardon v. Fernandez,</i> 454 U.S. 6, 8, 102 S.Ct. 28, 70 L.Ed.2d 6 (1981)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court agreed with the defendants that Villanueva's federal claim accrued \"at the latest[] on February 28, 2001 when he received the letter informing him of his new assignment.\" The court dismissed the federal claim as barred by the statute of limitations and dismissed somewhat different claims under Puerto Rico law without prejudice. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3) (2000). Villanueva now appeals, and our review is <i>de novo,</i> drawing inferences in his favor. <i>Morris,</i> 27 F.3d at 748.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, it is worth noting that Villanueva <i>may</i> not be protected against \"political discrimination\" at all. Supreme Court doctrine, creating such a constitutional claim under the aegis of the First Amendment, distinguishes between positions for which political affiliation is a legitimate requirement (policymakers, confidential assistants, and so on) and those for which it is not a permissible basis for hiring or dismissal. <i>See Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980); <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 372, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); <i>see also Flynn v. City of Boston,</i> 140 F.3d 42, 44-46 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 525 U.S. 961, 119 S.Ct. 403, 142 L.Ed.2d 327 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Save at the ends of the spectrum, whether a position is immune to \"political discrimination\" is often debatable, dependent on a host of variables; but there is also an inclination to have the judge resolve the issue based primarily on the official description of the position's duties. <i>See Duriex-Gauthier v. Lopez-Nieves,</i> 274 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir.2001). In all events, the question is resolved under federal constitutional standards; that a claimant may be a trust employee under Puerto Rico law or instead have civil service protection (as Villanueva does) is not decisive as to the section 1983 claim, <i>id.,</i> although claims under Puerto Rico law turn on the trust/career distinction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villanueva, as Camuy park director, was likely performing executive functions in some degree; but we have been given no position description and furnished with few details. Nor have the defendants moved for summary disposition of Villanueva's claim on this ground. At the same time, our decision does not rest on any implicit assumption that Villanueva is entitled to constitutional protection; rather, it is an open question which, having not been raised, is also not here resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to the statute of limitations which the district court found to bar Villanueva's federal claim. Standing alone, Nieves' original assignment of Villanueva to the Quality Standards Committee is ambiguous in two respects: as to duration and, more important, as to whether it terminated Villanueva's position as Camuy park director. Even after the events of May 2001, Villanueva concedes that his formal status and pay remained that of a \"director,\" but whether this designation refers generally to \"rank\" in the civil service hierarchy or to the office of Camuy park director is a different matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Villanueva, his March 27, 2001, letter says: \"In the first place, I am relieved of my duties as Director of the Camuy River Caves Park, without any justification, in order to place another person that has the trust and the political affiliation of the appointing authority.\" It goes on to request that \"I . . . be reinstated as Director of the Camuy River Caves Park, with all my rights, duties, and prerogatives as a public servant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statements by Villanueva reflect a recognition that, as of March 2001, he had been ousted as Camuy park director and that his replacement was or would be a political appointee. This did not mean that his special assignment was permanent; but he had no apparent reason to think that, at its end, the new administration would remove his political replacement and reinstate him as Camuy park director. So Villanueva certainly knew enough in March 2001 to bring a political discrimination claim for his ouster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter's powerful inference of knowledge might have been countered, if the facts so permitted, by a counter-showing from Villanueva that he had nevertheless in fact been allowed to continue his duties as Camuy park director until the events of May 2001. Yet he says himself that he was excluded after February 2001 from travel and training that were customarily part of a park director's role. Beyond this, we know only that he spent several days a week at the Camuy park facilities and, seemingly, retained until May his original office space and certain perks (<i>e.g.,</i> a chauffeured car).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a <i>legal</i> filing with the district court, Villanueva said that he was \"still officially performing two days a week his functions as Park Director\" until May 2001. But his only citation for this statement is to factual allegations in the complaint which neither directly support the inference nor carry weight once the issue has been posed on summary judgment by <i>evidence</i> proffered by the opponent. <i>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 250-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <i>LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co.,</i> 6 F.3d 836, 841-42 (1st Cir.1993), <i>cert. denied,</i> 511 U.S. 1018, 114 S.Ct. 1398, 128 L.Ed.2d 72 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the only direct evidence before the district court was Villanueva's own letter indicating that by March 2001 at the latest, he knew he had been effectively supplanted as Camuy park director in favor of someone who, in the eyes of the new administration, had stronger political credentials. The time to bring a section 1983 claim on this ground was within one year of February or March 2001. Villanueva did not do so and his federal claim is therefore barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is not much else to say. Villanueva argues that a claim based on the special assignment that occurred in February 2001 would not automatically bar a separate claim for his removal as Camuy park director in May, or that the latter should be viewed as part of a \"continuing violation.\" This might well work if his removal dated only from May 2001; but his letter, as already pointed out, complains of his removal&#8212;not just his special assignment&#8212;in March 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villanueva also complains of the district court's failure to act on his opposition to a defendant's request for a stay of discovery; but, as the stay was not granted, how the failure to act hurt Villanueva's claim is not apparent and never explained. At oral argument his counsel said that Villanueva had himself sought further discovery; but a look at his request under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) indicates that this request for additional discovery related to an alternative qualified immunity defense, which the district court never reached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Federal law borrows the local statute,<i>Morris,</i> 27 F.3d at 748 (citing <i>Wilson v.

This assignment will not affect your employee status or your monthly salary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hereby notify you that you are entitled to appeal the foregoing assignment within thirty (30) days of receipt of this letter if you think that your rights have been violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We expect your usual collaboration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <pre>  Sincerely,\n  [signature]\n  Ramon Luis Nieves, Esq.\n  Executive Director</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting March 1, 2001, Villanueva began traveling to the National Parks Company's central offices in San Juan three days a week, to attend to the duties of his new assignment. On March 9, he suffered a work-related accident that kept him away from work until May 18. While on leave, Villanueva sent Nieves a letter, dated March 27 and captioned \"APPEAL OF SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT.\" In the letter, Villanueva asked Nieves to \"reconsider my assignation to the Quality Standards Committee.\" He continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that this transfer, disguised as an assignment, . . . violates my rights as a permanent employee of our agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, I am relieved of my duties as Director of the Camuy River Caves Park, without any justification, in order to place another person that has the trust and the political affiliation of the appointing authority. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, this transfer is not justified, removing me from my place of work, on the grounds that it responds to service needs. The nature of the service need is not stated either. However, I was not assigned functions or duties, either specific or concrete, in the alleged special assignment. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villanueva concluded by asking \"that this situation be corrected\" and that he \"be reinstated as Director of the Camuy River Caves Park, with all my rights, duties, and prerogatives as a public servant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, on May 21, 2001, just as Villanueva returned to active duty, Nieves announced a newly-created position within the National Parks Company&#8212;\"Park Coordinator\"&#8212;to be filled by Angel Lopez-Lopez. According to Villanueva, the new appointee was \"a known PDP activist,\" and he \"was going to be in charge of [Camuy] from that day on.\" That same day, Villanueva requested a meeting with Nieves and asked him \"about this stripping of functions\"; Nieves responded (according to Villanueva), \"In the past you were a confidential employee and you must understand that I have to choose my people.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, May 22, Nieves sent Villanueva a letter describing the tasks that Villanueva \"will be performing full-time as part of the Quality Standards Committee.\" Villanueva sent a letter of his own to Nieves on May 23&#8212;their two letters apparently crossed in the mail&#8212;appealing \"the decision to unlawfully remove me from my functions as the Park Director for the Camuy River Caverns.\" Referring back to the May 21 meeting at which Nieves announced the appointment of Lopez, Villanueva recalled that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]t that meeting, among other things, you asked me to vacate my office since it was going to be occupied by Mr. Angel Lopez-Lopez, Special Assistant that you were appointing as the Park Director. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, you informed me that during two days a week I would be working in San Juan, as part of the job assignment you gave me, and through which you had me direct the Service Quality Standards Committee. In addition, you told me that the rest of the week's work days I'd be reporting to the Camuy River Caverns Park, but that I would be doing the Service Quality Standards Committee work. . . . I asked you to tell me how my functions would be affected by the appointment of Mr. Angel Lopez-Lopez. You pointed out to me that you would let me know subsequently. At the time I write this communication I have not yet been informed anything about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I understand that this whole situation[] constitutes an unlawful removal of functions.... As Park Director, I was the person in charge of it and the one with the highest hierarchy, I would take care of all matters at the administrative level, working Monday through Friday, I had my own office with a secretary, telephone with an access code to make calls through the local switchboard, and also had a direct telephone line available to me. In fact, whenever I traveled to San Juan or other towns, I could make use of an official vehicle with a driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This whole new situation that you all have created within the agency, the supposed reorganization that as you told me has not yet been comp[l]eted, has constituted a removal of my functions as the Park Director for the Camuy River Caverns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villanueva filed the present law suit, under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), on May 17, 2002. He alleged that the injury of which he complained occurred on May 21, 2001, when he \"was transferred and actually demoted involuntarily while simultaneously keeping just the title of Park Director.\" The defendants (ignoring three others later dropped from the case) were Nieves and Samuel Gonzalez, who was described in the complaint as the Deputy Executive Director of the National Parks Company. The complaint, later amended in respects not relevant here, also asserted claims under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting that the section 1983 claim&#8212;brought on May 17, 2002&#8212; had accrued in February or March 2001 and so was barred by the applicable Puerto Rico one-year statute of limitations. It is common ground that the Puerto Rico one-year period applies,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but federal law determines the starting (or accrual) date, <i>Morris,</i> 27 F.3d at 748. Accrual commences, for federal law purposes, when a plaintiff \"knows, or has reason to know, of the discriminatory act that underpins his cause of action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 749 (citing <i>Chardon v. Fernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></span>, 8, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Villanueva now appeals, and our review is <i>de novo,</i> drawing inferences in his favor. <i>Morris,</i> 27 F.3d at 748.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, it is worth noting that Villanueva <i>may</i> not be protected against \"political discrimination\" at all. Supreme Court doctrine, creating such a constitutional claim under the aegis of the First Amendment, distinguishes between positions for which political affiliation is a legitimate requirement (policymakers, confidential assistants, and so on) and those for which it is not a permissible basis for hiring or dismissal. <i>See Branti v. Finkel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110232\"><a href=\"/opinion/110232/branti-v-finkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 518, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110232\"><a href=\"/opinion/110232/branti-v-finkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Lopez-Nieves,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199731\"><a href=\"/opinion/199731/duriex-gauthier-v-lopez-nieves/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2001). In all events, the question is resolved under federal constitutional standards; that a claimant may be a trust employee under Puerto Rico law or instead have civil service protection (as Villanueva does) is not decisive as to the section 1983 claim, <i>id.,</i> although claims under Puerto Rico law turn on the trust/career distinction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villanueva, as Camuy park director, was likely performing executive functions in some degree; but we have been given no position description and furnished with few details. Nor have the defendants moved for summary disposition of Villanueva's claim on this ground. At the same time, our decision does not rest on any implicit assumption that Villanueva is entitled to constitutional protection; rather, it is an open question which, having not been raised, is also not here resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to the statute of limitations which the district court found to bar Villanueva's federal claim. Standing alone, Nieves' original assignment of Villanueva to the Quality Standards Committee is ambiguous in two respects: as to duration and, more important, as to whether it terminated Villanueva's position as Camuy park director. Even after the events of May 2001, Villanueva concedes that his formal status and pay remained that of a \"director,\" but whether this designation refers generally to \"rank\" in the civil service hierarchy or to the office of Camuy park director is a different matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Villanueva, his March 27, 2001, letter says: \"In the first place, I am relieved of my duties as Director of the Camuy River Caves Park, without any justification, in order to place another person that has the trust and the political affiliation of the appointing authority.\" It goes on to request that \"I . . . be reinstated as Director of the Camuy River Caves Park, with all my rights, duties, and prerogatives as a public servant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statements by Villanueva reflect a recognition that, as of March 2001, he had been ousted as Camuy park director and that his replacement was or would be a political appointee. This did not mean that his special assignment was permanent; but he had no apparent reason to think that, at its end, the new administration would remove his political replacement and reinstate him as Camuy park director. So Villanueva certainly knew enough in March 2001 to bring a political discrimination claim for his ouster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter's powerful inference of knowledge might have been countered, if the facts so permitted, by a counter-showing from Villanueva that he had nevertheless in fact been allowed to continue his duties as Camuy park director until the events of May 2001. Yet he says himself that he was excluded after February 2001 from travel and training that were customarily part of a park director's role. Beyond this, we know only that he spent several days a week at the Camuy park facilities and, seemingly, retained until May his original office space and certain perks (<i>e.g.,</i> a chauffeured car).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a <i>legal</i> filing with the district court, Villanueva said that he was \"still officially performing two days a week his functions as Park Director\" until May 2001. But his only citation for this statement is to factual allegations in the complaint which neither directly support the inference nor carry weight once the issue has been posed on summary judgment by <i>evidence</i> proffered by the opponent. <i>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/jack-anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc-and-willis-a-carto/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 250-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/jack-anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc-and-willis-a-carto/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The time to bring a section 1983 claim on this ground was within one year of February or March 2001. Villanueva did not do so and his federal claim is therefore barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is not much else to say. Villanueva argues that a claim based on the special assignment that occurred in February 2001 would not automatically bar a separate claim for his removal as Camuy park director in May, or that the latter should be viewed as part of a \"continuing violation.\" This might well work if his removal dated only from May 2001; but his letter, as already pointed out, complains of his removal&#8212;not just his special assignment&#8212;in March 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villanueva also complains of the district court's failure to act on his opposition to a defendant's request for a stay of discovery; but, as the stay was not granted, how the failure to act hurt Villanueva's claim is not apparent and never explained. At oral argument his counsel said that Villanueva had himself sought further discovery; but a look at his request under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) indicates that this request for additional discovery related to an alternative qualified immunity defense, which the district court never reached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Federal law borrows the local statute,<i>Morris,</i> 27 F.3d at 748 (citing <i>Wilson v.
