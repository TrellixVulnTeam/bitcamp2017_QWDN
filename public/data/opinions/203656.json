(\"Narragansett\") and its\n\ngeneral liability insurer, appellee St. Paul Fire and Marine\n\nInsurance Co. (\"St. Paul\").             Narragansett sought defense and\n\nindemnity from St. Paul in connection with a civil action filed\n\nagainst it by Slane & Slane Designs, LLC (\"Slane\") in the Southern\n\nDistrict   of    New   York   (\"the   underlying     action\"   or    \"the   Slane\n\nlawsuit\").      Following St. Paul's denial of coverage, Narragansett\n\nfiled suit in Rhode Island federal district court for breach of the\n\ninsurance contract and for a declaratory judgment that St. Paul was\n\nrequired to provide coverage.

Co.\n\nv. Beals, 240 A.2d 397, 402 (R.I. 1968).               We start with the\n\ncomplaint.2    Slane is a jewelry design company that contracted with\n\nNarragansett    in   1996.     Pursuant   to   the    parties'   agreement,\n\nNarragansett was to develop jewelry models and molds based on Slane\n\ndesigns, and to produce jewelry ordered by Slane.                Once Slane\n\ndesigned a particular piece of jewelry, it was Narragansett's job\n\nto produce a model to serve as a template from which the jewelry\n\ncould be mass produced.      Upon Slane's approval of the model, a mold\n\nwould be created for use in the mass production process.\n\n          The gist of Slane's complaint was that Narragansett\n\n\"failed and refused to develop models of consistent and usable\n\nquality and which were free of defects.\"       More specifically, Slane\n\n\n\n2\n Slane followed its original complaint with an amended complaint.\nWe refer to the latter unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcharged that Narragansett's models were not properly calibrated, or\n\nwere defective in other ways that prevented them from being used to\n\nmanufacture    the   final   products.   Slane   also   claimed   that\n\nNarragansett damaged and lost numerous models belonging to Slane.\n\nFinally, Slane asserted that Narragansett either failed to deliver\n\nthe final product, or delivered goods long after the expected\n\ndelivery date.\n\n            Slane's original complaint, filed in May 2002, set forth\n\ncauses of action for breach of contract, breach of express and\n\nimplied warranties, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and\n\nbreach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.      After St.\n\nPaul denied coverage, Slane filed an amended complaint in March\n\n2003 adding a count entitled \"Entrustment-Negligence,\" alleging\n\nthat Narragansett damaged jewelry models which Slane entrusted to\n\nNarragansett for use in the production of jewelry.      St. Paul again\n\ndenied coverage, and Narragansett's declaratory judgment action\n\nfollowed.\n\n            In relevant part, the Comprehensive General Liability\n\npolicy St. Paul issued to Narragansett provides that St. Paul will\n\n\"pay amounts [Narragansett] is legally required to pay as damages\n\nfor covered . . . property damage that happens while this agreement\n\nis in effect and is caused by an event.\"         The policy defines\n\n\"property damage\" as \"physical damage to tangible property of\n\nothers, including all resulting loss of use of that property\" or\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f\"loss of use of tangible property of others that isn't physically\n\ndamaged.\"     The St. Paul policy also contains several exclusions,\n\ndescribing matters that are not covered by the policy.                        One of\n\nthese, the Control of Property exclusion, provides that the policy\n\ndoes not \"cover property damage to . . . [p]ersonal property that's\n\nin the care, custody, or control of [Narragansett].\"\n\n                                          III.\n\n             The district court granted St. Paul's motion for summary\n\njudgment     on    the   basis    of    the   Control   of     Property    exclusion,\n\nconcluding        that   the    factual   allegations     in    the    \"Entrustment-\n\nNegligence\" count3 ineluctably describe a loss related to Slane's\n\nproperty -- molds and models -- in Narragansett's \"care, custody or\n\ncontrol.\"     We review the district court's summary judgment ruling\n\nde novo, construing the record evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto Narragansett. Dennis v. Osram Sylvania, Inc., 549 F.3d 851, 855\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).         \"Summary judgment is appropriate 'where there is\n\nno genuine issue as to any material fact . . . and the movant is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.'\"               New Fed. Mortgage Corp.\n\nv.   Nat'l    Union      Fire    Ins.     Co.,   543    F.3d    7,    11   (1st   Cir.\n\n2008)(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).\n\n             In determining whether the allegations in a complaint are\n\nsufficient to create a duty to defend, we apply general rules of\n\n\n3\n Narragansett conceded during the proceedings below that only the\n\"Entrustment-Negligence\" count in the amended complaint could be\nconstrued to afford it coverage.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fcontract     construction        and   give     words    their    \"plain,      ordinary\n\nmeaning.\" Allstate Ins. Co. v. Russo, 641 A.2d 1304, 1306-07 (R.I.\n\n1994).     Any doubts about the sufficiency of the allegations are\n\nresolved in favor of the insured.                Id.\n\n             St.    Paul    argues     that   the      explicit   language      of   the\n\ncomplaint    compels       a    conclusion    that      the   Control    of    Property\n\nexclusion applies to deny coverage.               Specifically, St. Paul points\n\nout that the \"Entrustment-Negligence\" claim alleges that \"Slane &\n\nSlane owned certain models which it entrusted to [Narragansett] for\n\nuse in the production of jewelry,\" and that                   Narragansett \"caused\n\nphysical damage to such models . . . .\"                  Narragansett responds by\n\nhypothesizing that the alleged loss and/or damage possibly occurred\n\nduring the shipment process when placed in the hands of a third-\n\nparty carrier, and thus not in Narragansett's care, custody or\n\ncontrol.     We agree with the district court that Narragansett's\n\nargument misses the mark.\n\n             Regardless of what might be \"possible,\" there are no\n\nallegations    in    the       Slane   lawsuit    that    support    Narragansett's\n\nhypothesis.        Indeed, the exact opposite is true.                  The complaint\n\nspecifically and repeatedly alleges that Narragansett caused the\n\ndamage at issue.        Narragansett relies on Shelby Ins. Co. v. Ne.\n\nStructures, Inc., 767 A.2d 75 (R.I. 2001), a building-collapse case\n\nin   which    the    Rhode       Island   Supreme        Court    stated      that   the\n\n\"possibility\" of coverage was sufficient to bring the complaint\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fwithin the scope of the relevant policy.      Shelby, however, is\n\nreadily distinguishable.   There, while the underlying complaint\n\ncharged faulty workmanship, which would be excluded from coverage,\n\nid. at 77, the defendant/insured's underlying answer directly\n\nraised the substantive defense that the collapse was caused by an\n\n\"Act of God,\" such as high winds, which might be covered.      Id.\n\nHere, the pleadings in the underlying case contain no similar claim\n\nthat the alleged damage was caused by third party.   Narragansett's\n\npost-hoc speculation about third parties not referenced in the\n\nunderlying lawsuit cannot suffice to avoid the plain language of\n\nboth the complaint and the policy.4\n\n          The decision of the district court is Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n4\n Because we affirm on the basis of the Control of Property\nExclusion, we do not address the other exclusions discussed by both\nsides.\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

Id.\n\n             St.    Paul    argues     that   the      explicit   language      of   the\n\ncomplaint    compels       a    conclusion    that      the   Control    of    Property\n\nexclusion applies to deny coverage.               Specifically, St. Paul points\n\nout that the \"Entrustment-Negligence\" claim alleges that \"Slane &\n\nSlane owned certain models which it entrusted to [Narragansett] for\n\nuse in the production of jewelry,\" and that                   Narragansett \"caused\n\nphysical damage to such models . . . .\"                  Narragansett responds by\n\nhypothesizing that the alleged loss and/or damage possibly occurred\n\nduring the shipment process when placed in the hands of a third-\n\nparty carrier, and thus not in Narragansett's care, custody or\n\ncontrol.     We agree with the district court that Narragansett's\n\nargument misses the mark.\n\n             Regardless of what might be \"possible,\" there are no\n\nallegations    in    the       Slane   lawsuit    that    support    Narragansett's\n\nhypothesis.        Indeed, the exact opposite is true.                  The complaint\n\nspecifically and repeatedly alleges that Narragansett caused the\n\ndamage at issue.        Narragansett relies on Shelby Ins. Co. v. Ne.\n\nStructures, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1985469\"><a href=\"/opinion/1985469/shelby-ins-co-v-northeast-structures/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (R.I. 2001), a building-collapse case\n\nin   which    the    Rhode       Island   Supreme        Court    stated      that   the\n\n\"possibility\" of coverage was sufficient to bring the complaint\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fwithin the scope of the relevant policy.      Shelby, however, is\n\nreadily distinguishable.   There, while the underlying complaint\n\ncharged faulty workmanship, which would be excluded from coverage,\n\nid. at 77, the defendant/insured's underlying answer directly\n\nraised the substantive defense that the collapse was caused by an\n\n\"Act of God,\" such as high winds, which might be covered.      Id.\n\nHere, the pleadings in the underlying case contain no similar claim\n\nthat the alleged damage was caused by third party.   Narragansett's\n\npost-hoc speculation about third parties not referenced in the\n\nunderlying lawsuit cannot suffice to avoid the plain language of\n\nboth the complaint and the policy.4\n\n          The decision of the district court is Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n4\n Because we affirm on the basis of the Control of Property\nExclusion, we do not address the other exclusions discussed by both\nsides.\n\n                               -7-\n\f</pre>",
