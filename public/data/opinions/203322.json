This is a dispute between Boston\n\nGas Company (\"Boston Gas\"), the largest provider of natural gas in\n\nthe New England area, and one of its insurers, Century Indemnity\n\nCompany (\"Century\").        Before natural gas became the primary source\n\nof   energy     in   New   England,   Boston   Gas   produced   gas   fuel    at\n\nfacilities called manufactured gas plants, known in the industry as\n\n\"MGPs\".       These MGPs created gas by heating coal in large ovens,\n\ngenerating gas which was then purified and piped out for use.\n\n              This process also produced a variety of byproducts,\n\nincluding ash, drip oil, tar and coke.          Many are non-biodegradable\n\nand some are deemed carcinogenic, and they now contaminate the\n\nground and water around many former MGP sites; further, MGPs were\n\noften sited near waterways which were contaminated in turn.1                 See\n\nEnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc. v. Century Indem. Co., 452 F.3d 44,\n\n46-47 (1st Cir. 2006).           Contamination has been discovered at\n\ntwenty-nine former Boston Gas MGPs; this case concerns only one of\n\nthose sites, located in Everett, Massachusetts.\n\n              Boston Gas operated the Everett MGP from 1908 until\n\napproximately 1969; the MGP produced manufactured gas and also\n\nprocessed coke oven gas purchased from a nearby coke plant.                   In\n\n1995,     a   routine   investigation   uncovered    contamination     at    the\n\n\n      1\n      The main contaminant in this case was tar--the chief liquid\nbyproduct of manufactured gas production. At nearly all MGP sites\nsome tar escaped confinement and leaked into the environment; once\nthat leakage occurs, tar tends to migrate and to contaminate soils\nand groundwater beyond the borders of the facility's site.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fEverett site.   Although the Everett site had been sold to a new\n\nowner (DOMAC, LLC) in 1970, Boston Gas was nevertheless strictly\n\nliable under Massachusetts law for all costs associated with the\n\ninvestigation and cleanup of the contamination caused by the MGP's\n\noperations.\n\n           Boston    Gas   had    purchased   three    general   commercial\n\nliability insurance policies from Century covering the period from\n\nDecember 1, 1951, through December 1, 1969.           Each policy contained\n\na self-insured retention (\"SIR\")--essentially a deductible--of\n\n$100,000 for each occurrence resulting in personal injury or\n\nproperty   damage.     Above     the   deductible   amount,   the   policies\n\nprovided that Century would cover Boston Gas' \"ultimate net loss\"\n\nup to the applicable limits of the policies for any liabilities\n\nstemming from bodily injury, property damage, or other harm caused\n\nby an \"occurrence.\"    An \"occurrence,\" said the policies, was\n\n           an accident, including injurious exposure to\n           conditions, which results, during the policy\n           period, in property damage neither expected\n           nor intended from the standpoint of the\n           [i]nsured.\n\n           After Boston Gas investigated and began to clean up the\n\ncontaminated soils and groundwater at and near the Everett site,\n\nBoston Gas warned Century that it might seek indemnification.\n\nCentury \"reserved its rights,\" and on October 22, 2002, Boston Gas\n\nfiled a diversity law suit against Century in the federal district\n\ncourt, seeking a declaratory judgment as to Century's obligations\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\funder the policies and damages for its breach thereof.   A three-\n\nweek long jury trial followed, focusing upon the Everett site.2\n\n          Boston Gas argued in the district court that to recover\n\nunder the policies, it needed to prove only that an occurrence had\n\ncaused some off-site property damage during the policy periods--\n\noff-site because the policy had an \"owned property\" exclusion for\n\ndamage to Boston Gas' own property.   Off-site damage, in Boston\n\nGas' view, required Century to indemnify Boston Gas for all its\n\nliabilities connected to the occurrence.   Century responded that\n\nvarious exclusions contained in the policies precluded or limited\n\nindemnification.\n\n          Importantly, Century argued that Boston Gas was well\n\naware by 1951 that pollution from the Everett MGP was causing\n\nproperty damage at or near the site; the costs were therefore\n\nbarred by an exclusion requiring that the property damage be\n\n\"neither expected nor intended\" by the insured.      Century also\n\nargued that Boston Gas improperly sought to recover costs expended\n\nto repair and improve the Everett site itself, rather than to\n\nremediate or prevent off-site property damage.\n\n          At trial, the jury awarded Boston Gas over $6.1 million\n\nin past remediation expenses; the district court also issued a\n\n\n\n     2\n      The other twenty-eight Boston Gas MGPs remain the subject of\na larger dispute. Boston Gas intends to use the outcome of the\nEverett trial as an exemplar to establish its rights against\nCentury with respect to the other sites.\n\n                               -5-\n\fdeclaratory judgment obligating Century to pay all future costs\n\nassociated with the investigation and environmental cleanup of the\n\nEverett site.     Century now appeals on multiple grounds from the\n\ndistrict court's judgment.      As usual, the standard of review\n\ndepends on the issue.    Indianapolis Life Ins. Co. v. Herman, 516\n\nF.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n          Allocation among insurers.   Century's most far-reaching\n\nclaim is that the district court should have limited Century's\n\nliability by allocating Boston Gas' liabilities among all insurers\n\nfrom whom Boston Gas had purchased general commercial liability\n\ninsurance during the Everett MGP's lifespan.      Century insured\n\nBoston Gas under various policies from 1951-1969,3     while other\n\ninsurers covered Boston Gas during other periods of its century-\n\nlong operation.\n\n          Century does not now dispute the jury's finding that the\n\nEverett site suffered contamination during the 1951-1969 time\n\nperiod.   Indeed, contamination seemingly occurred over a much\n\nlonger period, even though no findings were made as to duration.\n\nRather, renewing an argument made in the district court, Century\n\nsays that manifestly not all of the damage could have been caused\n\n\n     3\n      The terms of the policies varied. The 1960-66 policy had a\nper occurrence limit of $1 million and a SIR of $100,000.      The\n1966-69 policy contained a limit of $17 million and a SIR of\n$100,000. The 1951-60 policy was lost, but the jury found that the\npolicy had a $1 million policy limit in 1951 and from 1955-1960,\nand a limit of $500,000 from 1952-1954. The jury did not determine\nthe lost policy's self-insured retention limits.\n\n                                -6-\n\fduring its limited period of insurance and its liability should be\n\nno more than its proportionate share.    It also urges that its share\n\nshould be spread among its various policy years.4\n\n             The district court instead applied a method of allocation\n\nreferred to in the doctrine as the joint and several, or \"all\n\nsums,\" approach and permitted Boston Gas to recover from Century\n\nits total clean-up liability--subject only to the SIR and policy\n\nlimit--under any one of its policies in place between 1951 and\n\n1969.      Not surprisingly, Boston Gas selected the policy with the\n\nhighest coverage limit--$17 million--and Century was held fully\n\nliable for $6,227,327.90 in damages, less that policy's $100,000\n\nSIR.\n\n               On appeal, arguing for pro rata allocation, Century\n\nhighlights the policy language--the underscoring is ours--defining\n\nan occurrence as \"an accident . . . which results, during the\n\npolicy period, in property damage.\"       It asserts that it is not\n\nresponsible for damage that occurred outside of the policy period,\n\nso proration among insurers is required.     Boston Gas counters that\n\nthe policy says nothing about proration, so given an occurrence--\n\nwhich includes \"continuous or repeated exposure to substantially\n\n\n\n       4\n      In substance Century wants any award reduced by its policies'\nself-insured retention of $100,000 for each year of contamination,\narguing that this approach is consistent with Massachusetts'\nrequirement that an insured exhaust all available underlying\nprimary insurance.      A.W. Chesterton Co. v. Mass. Insurers\nInsolvency Fund, 838 N.E.2d 1237, 1254 (Mass. 2005).\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe same general conditions\"--within the policy period, Century is\n\nliable for the \"'ultimate net loss' mean[ing] the sum actually paid\n\nor payable\" by the insured.\n\n           This   dispute    commonly   arises    in   the   context    of\n\nenvironmental damage and toxic exposure disputes--so-called \"long-\n\ntail\" indivisible injuries attributable to ongoing events without\n\na single clear \"cause.\"     See Russ & Segalla, 15 Couch on Insurance\n\n§ 220:25 (3d ed. 2007).     The language of traditional comprehensive\n\ngeneral liability policies--drafted before such law suits became\n\ncommon--does not neatly map onto these types of injuries.        Hickman\n\n& DeYoung, Allocation of Environmental Cleanup Liability Between\n\nSuccessive Insurers, 17 N. Ky. L. Rev. 291, 292 (1990).\n\n           Competing methods have emerged.       Some courts have deemed\n\ninsurers fully liable--normally, jointly and severally--for all\n\ndamages attributable to an occurrence, exposure or contamination\n\nthat happened at least in part during the coverage period.             See\n\nKeene Corp. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 667 F.2d 1034, 1050 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1981). Others have prorated an insurer's liability, based largely,\n\nbut not always exclusively, on the number of years during which\n\ncoverage was offered.       See Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Forty-Eight\n\nInsulations, Inc., 633 F.2d 1212, 1224-25 (6th Cir. 1980); Owens-\n\nIllinois, Inc. v. United Ins. Co., 650 A.2d 974, 993-94 (N.J.\n\n1994).   The parties agree that Massachusetts law governs here.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f            Unfortunately, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\n\nhas not yet resolved this allocation question, A.W. Chesterton Co.\n\nv. Mass. Insurers Insolvency Fund, 838 N.E.2d 1237, 1242 n.3 (Mass.\n\n2005) (expressly reserving the issue), so our choices are two: we\n\ncan make our best guess on this de novo review issue, or we can\n\ncertify the question and ancillary issues to the SJC.               The first\n\npath offers the benefit of expedition but with a risk of error; the\n\nsecond path, the reverse.5\n\n            Although    there   is    one   Massachusetts   Appeals     Court\n\ndecision on point, its treatment of the choice between the two\n\nallocation methods is cursory.         Rubenstein v. Royal Ins. Co. of\n\nAm., 694 N.E.2d 381, 388 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998); see also Chicago\n\nBridge & Iron Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, 797\n\nN.E.2d 434, 441-45 (Mass. App. Ct. 2003) (adopting joint and\n\nseveral allocation, but as a matter of Illinois law).             Nor is there\n\na   clear   consensus   among   the    states   as   to   which    method   is\n\npreferable. A growing plurality have adopted some form of pro rata\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      Century sought certification of the allocation question\nbefore the district court.     The district court stated that it\nbelieved itself to be \"compel[led]\" by Rubenstein v. Royal\nInsurance Co. of America, 694 N.E.2d 381, 388 (Mass. App. Ct.\n1998), to adopt the joint-and-several approach, but based its\ndenial of the motion on the fact that the allocation question was\nnot   outcome   determinative.   See   Mass.  S.J.C.  Rule   1:03\n(certification appropriate only when the disputed question of law\n\"may be determinative of the cause\").\n\n                                      -9-\n\fallocation,6 but a significant number of courts impose joint and\n\nseveral allocation.7\n\n            Nor   do     policy   arguments   line    up   solely behind one\n\nsolution.    At first blush it may seem illogical to hold a single\n\ninsurer, who may have only covered the insured for a single year,\n\nfully liable for the costs of environmental damage that may have\n\naccrued over the course of a century.           But that insurer can seek\n\ncontribution      from    other   insurers    \"on    the   risk\"   during   the\n\ncontamination period.        See, e.g., Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v.\n\nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 769 N.E.2d 835, 841 (Ohio 2002).               And the\n\nalternative may force the insured to sue numerous companies in one\n\nsuit, if this is possible at all, to avoid inconsistencies.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      See EnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc. v. Certain Underwriters at\nLloyd's, 934 A.2d 517, 526 (N.H. 2007); Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v.\nCommonwealth of Kentucky, 179 S.W.3d 830, 842 (Ky. 2005); Sec. Ins.\nCo. of Hartford v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas.

Co., 626 A.2d 502, 507-08\n(Pa. 1993).\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            Either method forces courts to indulge in a probable\n\nfiction as to when the event triggering coverage occurred. The pro\n\nrata method assumes an ongoing occurrence causing stable amounts of\n\ndamage over time; the joint and several method pretends, even less\n\nplausibly, that a single occurrence caused all the damage, and\n\nallows the insured effectively to choose the year in which that\n\nhappened.    Both are crude approximations made under conditions of\n\nuncertainty.\n\n            Pro rata allocation is generally favored by insurers;\n\ninsureds    usually   prefer   joint   and   several   allocation   as   it\n\nalleviates the need for multiple defendants and possibly multiple\n\nlawsuits.    Yet in those jurisdictions that employ the joint and\n\nseveral method, but limit the insured to making a claim against a\n\nsingle policy--a method sometimes referred to as joint and several\n\nallocation without stacking, Am. Physicians Ins. Exch. v. Garcia,\n\n876 S.W.2d 842, 853-54 (Tex. 1994)--the insured may collect less\n\nthan it would have under pro rata allocation. Bratspies, Splitting\n\nthe Baby: Apportioning Environmental Liability Among Triggered\n\nInsurance Policies, 1999 BYU L. Rev. 1215, 1258.\n\n            Each method also has secondary implications, which courts\n\nhave variously viewed as more or less desirable.          One example is\n\nso-called \"orphan shares,\" i.e., damages attributable to years\n\nduring which the insured \"went bare\" or purchased coverage from a\n\nnow-insolvent insurer.     Pro rata allocation usually (although not\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\finevitably) treats the insured as self-insuring for those years, a\n\nresult that some courts view (appropriately) as preventing a\n\nwindfall, EnergyNorth, 934 A.2d at 526; others as (inappropriately)\n\ndepriving the insured of expected protection.        Keene, 667 F.2d at\n\n1048-49.     The two approaches also differ in the incentives they\n\ncreate for settlements, in their tendency vel non to consolidate\n\nlitigation   in   one   case,   and   in   their   treatment   of    policy\n\ndeductibles and excess insurance policies.\n\n           For example, under pro rata allocation, the insured will\n\nseek coverage from each insurance policy in effect during the\n\ncontamination period and is likely to absorb the self-insurance\n\nretentions of each policy, Pub. Serv. Co. of Colo. v. Wallis &\n\nCos., 986 P.2d 924, 941 (Colo. 1999), while excess insurance\n\npolicies offering coverage only for damages above that prorated\n\namount will not be triggered. By contrast, under joint and several\n\nliability all damages are attributable to a single year; ordinarily\n\nthe insured is responsible for a single deductible and, given the\n\nlarge sums ordinarily sought, it becomes more likely that excess\n\ninsurance will be activated.\n\n           That a legal issue is close or difficult is not normally\n\nenough to warrant certification, or else diversity cases would\n\nregularly require appellate proceedings in two courts.              But the\n\ndollar amounts involved in this and the follow-on cases for other\n\nsites are very large (see note 2, above); and the allocation method\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fcould easily matter in future cases not involving these parties.\n\nAlthough Massachusetts judicial policy is often favorable to the\n\ninsured, at least in consumer cases, sister courts in New York, New\n\nHampshire and Connecticut have adopted the pro rata approach.   See\n\nnote 6, above.\n\n          Perhaps the strongest argument for certification is that\n\neven within the two broad schools of thought, there are additional\n\nnuances complicating any prediction by us of Massachusetts law.\n\nFor instance, in joint and several allocation courts divide on\n\nwhether an insured is allowed to \"stack\" multiple policies to\n\nobtain coverage for all their damages; for pro rata allocation,\n\nsome courts allocate damages based purely upon the number of years\n\nof coverage, while others allocate based on both years and amounts\n\nof coverage offered.8\n\n          Because we have found no controlling SJC precedent on the\n\nallocation question and the issue is determinative of the scope of\n\nBoston Gas' claim, we will certify the questions set forth at the\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      Compare Keene, 667 F.2d at 1049 (allowing insured to seek\ncoverage only under a single policy), with J.H. France, 626 A.2d at\n509 (adopting joint and several allocation with stacking), and\ncompare Pub. Serv. Co. of Colorado, 986 P.2d at 942 (proration by\nyears), with Owens-Illinois, 650 A.2d at 993 (proration by years\nand   limits).

S.J.C. Rule 1:03.\n\n            Apportionment of recoverable costs.        We now turn to a\n\nconnected pair of issues: Century's claim that the district court\n\nfailed properly to instruct on the \"owned-property exclusion\"\n\ncontained   in   Century's   policies9   and   its   separate   claim   for\n\njudgment as a matter of law as to costs incurred incident to\n\nDOMAC's expansion project. The issues both relate to apportionment\n\nbetween recoverable and unrecoverable costs and both relate in part\n\nto the DOMAC construction.\n\n            Review of the legal correctness of an instruction is de\n\nnovo, Cigna Ins. Co. v. Oy Saunatec, Ltd., 241 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2001), with deference as to phrasing and emphasis, United States v.\n\nTeemer, 394 F.3d 59, 63 n.2 (1st Cir. 2005).          On appeal from the\n\ndenial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the question\n\nusually is whether, drawing all inferences in favor of the verdict,\n\nthe evidence permitted a reasonable jury to render a verdict\n\nadverse to the moving party.    FHS Props. Ltd. P'ship v. BC Assocs.,\n\n175 F.3d 81, 85 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      Boston Gas argues that claims of jury misinstruction were not\nadequately preserved.    Having read the pertinent parts of the\nrecord, we are satisfied that Century made its objections clear at\nthe charge conference, as required by Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 51(c) and\nthe case law. See Suprenant v. Rivas, 424 F.3d 5, 15 (1st Cir.\n2005).\n\n                                  -14-\n\f            Each of the policies Boston Gas purchased from Century\n\ncontained a clause stating that \"[t]his policy does not apply . .\n\n. to property damage to . . . property owned by the [i]nsured.\"\n\nSuch clauses--like other exclusions--provide the insurer with an\n\naffirmative defense to liability, placing the burden on the insurer\n\nto exclude damage otherwise recoverable.         Allmerica Fin. Corp. v.\n\nCertain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, 871 N.E.2d 418, 425 (Mass.\n\n2007).     However, this does not mean that costs of remediation of\n\nthe Everett site itself are automatically excluded.\n\n            The   governing    Massachusetts    decision   on    the   owned-\n\nproperty    exclusion   in    environmental    spill   cases    is   Hakim   v.\n\nMassachusetts Insurers' Insolvency Fund, 675 N.E.2d 1161 (Mass.\n\n1997).     There the court held that when pollutants have migrated\n\nfrom the insured's property to an adjacent property--or perhaps\n\neven when the threat of such migration is imminent--\"coverage [to\n\nremediate the insured's property] is not barred if the [on-site]\n\ncleanup is designed to remediate, to prevent or to abate further\n\nmigration of contaminants to the off-site property.\"             Id. at 1164\n\n& n.8 (emphasis added).10\n\n            The special verdict form asked the jury: \"Was the cost of\n\nremediation at the Everett site incurred solely to clean up the\n\n\n     10\n      Accord Patz v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 15 F.3d 699,\n705 (7th Cir. 1994) (Wisconsin law); Intel Corp. v. Hartford\nAccident & Indem. Co., 952 F.2d 1551, 1565-66 (9th Cir. 1991)\n(California law); Gerrish Corp. v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co.,\n947 F.2d 1023, 1030-31 (2d Cir. 1991) (Vermont law).\n\n                                    -15-\n\fproperty of Boston Gas Company, as opposed to eliminating and/or\n\navoiding, at least in part, contamination of ground water or\n\nadjacent property?\"       A \"yes\" answer would have barred recovery; a\n\n\"no\" answer--which the jury returned--required the jury to specify\n\n\"the amount Boston Gas Company has been legally obligated to pay\n\nfor the investigation and cleanup as a result of the property\n\ndamage at the Everett site caused during the years for which it had\n\ncoverage.\"\n\n               Century correctly says that the special verdict form\n\n(standing alone) could easily have led the jury to conclude that\n\nonce some of the on-site remediation was justified to cope with\n\nactual    or    threatened   off-site   pollution,     all    of   the   on-site\n\nremediation       costs   were   covered    by   the   policy.       The   oral\n\ninstructions suggest that this was likely not the intended result.11\n\nBut while an instruction might sometimes be so clear as to control\n\nan ambiguous special verdict form, here the special verdict form\n\ndemanded an all-or-nothing award.\n\n               Boston Gas says that it proved off-site contamination,\n\nbut this is not an answer to a claim that the special verdict\n\nerroneously presented an all-or-nothing choice.              Under Hakim, some\n\noff-site contamination does not automatically justify recovery of\n\n\n     11\n      The district court told the jury that \"the plaintiff cannot\nrecover for any costs that were incurred solely to clean up its own\nproperty.\" But other portions of the instructions--the district\ncourt went on to characterize \"the cleanup costs\" as an indivisible\nsum--cut the other way.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fall on-site remediation.       As Hakim explained: \"The policy covers\n\ncleanup costs incurred to remediate or prevent further migration of\n\nthe contaminants to the off-site waterways. Costs incurred for the\n\nsole purpose of remediating the Hakims' property are barred by . .\n\n. the policy.\"     Id. at 1165-66.\n\n           Boston Gas also says that Century provided no evidence\n\nthat would have allowed the jury to determine that some of the on-\n\nsite costs were solely for the benefit of the site and not\n\nnecessary to prevent further off-site pollution.             Yet substantial\n\ncosts (Century says $3.5 million) were incurred to remove soils and\n\nfor other work incident to a project undertaken in 2000 by DOMAC to\n\nexpand its operations at the Everett site--or at least the jury\n\ncould have so found.      These costs are part of the award against\n\nCentury.\n\n           For     example,    among   other      steps,     DOMAC   removed\n\ncontaminated soils and liquids from underground storage tanks--\n\nthese tanks were buried under the Everett site when DOMAC first\n\npurchased the property in 1970--at a cost to Boston Gas (under a\n\nsharing agreement with DOMAC) of around $1.6 million. Century says\n\nthat this was clearly done for the purpose of giving DOMAC a firm\n\nfoundation   for   its   own   facilities   and   not   as   remediation   or\n\nprevention of further off-site damage.\n\n           The fact that the jury verdict included the disputed\n\ncosts shows only that the jury believed that some costs targeted\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fpollution that damaged or threatened off-site property. So we must\n\nremand for a new trial on this issue.               This is a relatively narrow\n\nissue, but the amounts are not trivial.                     In all events, the\n\nprinciple is clear: only that remediation necessary to protect\n\nagainst   off-site       contamination       is    compensable;    further   costs,\n\nhowever useful to mitigate on-site contamination, are not.\n\n             Century says that it should have been given judgment as\n\na   matter   of    law    as    to   a   portion    of   these   disputed    costs--\n\nspecifically, the $1.6 million allocated to the removal of the\n\ncontaminated soils.            Century argues, first, that the removal was\n\nindisputably for the purpose of the DOMAC expansion project and\n\ntherefore excluded; and second, that the soil was contaminated by\n\nunderground       oil    only   after     DOMAC    purchased     the   property   and\n\nCentury's coverage ceased.               We are not persuaded that the issue\n\nshould have been taken from the jury.\n\n             The \"purpose\" of the removal may, as Century claims, have\n\nbeen to forward the DOMAC expansion; but the relevant question\n\nunder the policy and Hakim is whether the removal of that soil was\n\nalso objectively necessary because contaminants in the soil posed\n\na threat to off-site property as well.               Similarly, Century's claim\n\nthat this all occurred after its policy coverage ended in 1969 begs\n\nthe question; the covered \"occurrence\"--ongoing contamination--\n\nbegan before and continued during and lasted until after Century's\n\nperiod of coverage.\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f            Century points to some evidence that the contamination of\n\nthe soil in the tanks occurred during the 1970 project; but Boston\n\nGas attacked the credibility of Century's expert witness, Richard\n\nMeehan,    and    offered   evidence   that     the    tanks    may   have     been\n\ncontaminated at some earlier point and that contamination generally\n\nhad spread throughout the Everett site and beyond.              This is for the\n\njury to resolve.         Sailor Inc. F/V v. City of Rockland, 428 F.3d\n\n348, 354 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                 Exclusion of Charles Anderson's supplementary expert\n\nreport.    Century next argues that the district court erred in\n\nprecluding one of its expert witnesses, Charles Anderson, from\n\nsupplementing      his   expert   report    after     the   expiration    of   the\n\ndeadline for such responses as set by the district court.                The test\n\nin such a case is abuse of discretion.                 Licciardi v. TIG Ins.\n\nGroup, 140 F.3d 357, 362-63 (1st Cir. 1998); see also Nat'l Hockey\n\nLeague v. Metro. Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639, 642 (1976) (per\n\ncuriam).\n\n            In federal practice, an expert must ordinarily file a\n\nreport, Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B), kept current by supplementary\n\nreports if needed, id. 26(e)(2).           The trial judge typically sets a\n\nschedule and may exclude non-complying evidence.               Id. 26(a)(2)(c);\n\nMacaulay v. Anas, 321 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir. 2003).              Here,    November\n\n30, 2004, was the deadline for the parties to serve reports\n\ncontaining their experts' complete opinions.                The parties were to\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fconclude expert depositions by April 1, 2005, file rebuttal reports\n\nby April 22, 2005, and conduct rebuttal depositions by May 13,\n\n2005.\n\n            Pursuant to this timetable, Century produced Anderson's\n\nreport on November 29, 2004, and supplemented it with a report\n\nfiled on March 11, 2005.     Anderson was to serve as Century's expert\n\non the proper categorization of costs; Anderson attested that he\n\nwould categorize Boston Gas' site-related expenditures as \"legal\n\ncosts, site investigation costs, remediation costs, and general\n\nbusiness expenditures\"-- presumably to aid the jury in determining\n\nwhich costs fell within Century's policy exclusions.\n\n            On September 16, 2005--approximately two months before\n\ntrial was set to begin--Century produced a second supplemental\n\nreport from Anderson, which contained (in Century's view) essential\n\nopinions    related   to    Century's     owned-property      defense.     For\n\ninstance, the report characterized certain expenses previously\n\ncategorized as \"remediation\" as necessary for on-site construction\n\nactivities but not remediation.          The new report also contained new\n\nanalysis of the costs Boston Gas had incurred in the removal and\n\ndisposal of the three underground storage tanks; Anderson planned\n\nto   say   this   project   was   part    of   construction    activity,   not\n\nremediation efforts.\n\n            Boston    Gas   moved   to    strike Anderson's supplemental\n\nreport, complaining that Century sought to inject an entirely new\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\ftheory of defense as to certain costs after the deadline for expert\n\nreports.   Century answered that the tardy report was based on\n\ninformation that Boston Gas had itself belatedly disclosed on\n\nAugust   16,   2005;   this   data,   Century   claims,   was    previously\n\nunavailable to Century.       The district court sided with Boston Gas\n\nand excluded the new report, saying the report was a major change\n\nand prior discovery available to Century undermined Century's\n\nclaimed lack of notice.\n\n           From our vantage, this was a close call.             Century has\n\nsome basis for contesting Boston Gas' description of the reports as\n\nreflecting a \"sea change,\" and         Boston Gas could have asked to\n\ndepose Anderson on his new adjustments.            See Johnson v. H.K.\n\nWebster, Inc., 775 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1985).             But changes in\n\nposition shortly before trial complicate scheduling; the district\n\ncourt's on-the-ground weighing of the factors has to be respected,\n\nabsent a clear abuse, Thibeault v. Square D Co., 960 F.2d 239, 244\n\n(1st Cir. 1992); and we are not disposed in this case to override\n\nits judgment.      If the limited new trial ordered changes the\n\ncalculus, that is a matter for the district court.\n\n           Jury instructions on \"expected or intended\" defense.\n\nCentury's policy defines occurrence as \"an accident, including\n\ninjurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy\n\nperiod, in property damage neither expected nor intended from the\n\nstandpoint of the [i]nsured.\"          Massachusetts courts read such\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fclauses as exclusions, with the insurer bearing the burden of\n\nproof.   Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Abernathy, 469 N.E.2d 797, 800\n\n(Mass. 1984); see also McGinnis v. Aetna Life & Cas. Co. 494 N.E.2d\n\n1322 (Mass. 1986).       Placing the burden on Century, the district\n\ncourt asked the jury on the special verdict form to decide:\n\n           Did Boston Gas Company intentionally cause or\n           know to a substantial certainty that it was\n           causing contamination of soil and groundwater\n           at the Everett site in one or more policy\n           years?\n\n           A \"yes\" answer to this question required the jury to\n\nidentify the year or years in which Boston Gas \"intentionally\n\ncause[d] or [knew] to a substantial certainty that it was causing\n\nsuch   contamination.\"      But   the   jury   returned   a   \"no\"   answer,\n\nrendering the exclusion inapplicable.          On appeal, Century objects\n\nto the charge based on a remark made by the district court in\n\nexplaining its special questions to the jury.\n\n           The remark was made by the district judge in seeking to\n\ndifferentiate between the type of knowledge required by this\n\n\"expected/intended\" exclusion and another \"known loss\" exclusion\n\nthat Massachusetts courts read into such policies; the latter is a\n\njudicially created exclusion that prevents a policyholder from\n\nrecovering for losses from damage that it knew existed before\n\npurchasing an insurance policy.         See SCA Servs. Inc. v. Transp.\n\nIns. Co., 646 N.E.2d 394, 397 (Mass. 1995).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f            The court described a known loss as reflecting \"knowledge\n\nof damage before the policy becomes effective\" as compared to the\n\nexpected or intended damage exclusion, which involves \"either\n\nintending during the policy year or knowing to a substantial\n\ncertainty   that    it    was   contaminating   during     the    policy   year\"\n\n(emphasis added).        Century says that the latter direction required\n\nthe jury to disregard evidence, heavily relied on by Century, of\n\nBoston Gas' expectations in the years before the first Century\n\npolicy went into effect.\n\n            Taken   literally      and   in   isolation,    the    underscored\n\nlanguage might be understood as Century contends and might well\n\nmisstate Massachusetts law; we can see no reason why knowledge\n\nprior to the policy year would not count against the insured.               But\n\nthe chance of prejudice is limited because the pertinent charge as\n\na whole (which Century did not trouble to quote) tended to convey\n\nthe correct message and also because common sense tends to reject\n\nthe notion that an earlier intention or expectation would not\n\ncount.\n\n            Anyway, Century failed to object to the district court's\n\narguable misstatement when the charge was given, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n51(c).   Century did object to the district court's \"expected or\n\nintended\" instruction, but did so on grounds unrelated to the\n\ntemporal aspect it now criticizes.              Cf. Colon-Millin v. Sears\n\nRoebuck de Puerto Rico, Inc., 455 F.3d 30, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fThe misstatement could easily have been corrected on the spot. The\n\nobjection is therefore forfeit and we have dealt with the point for\n\nthe sake of trial in successor cases.\n\n           Declaratory    judgment.          In   addition     to    awarding     the\n\ndamages   calculated    by     the   jury,    the    district       court   granted\n\ndeclaratory relief requiring Century to indemnify Boston Gas for\n\nall future costs for investigation and cleanup at and around the\n\nEverett   site.   Century      contends--as         it   did   below--that        the\n\ndeclaratory judgment is over-broad because it applies to possible\n\ndamage from MGP operations at the Everett site that was not\n\nspecifically litigated at the Everett trial.\n\n           For instance, Century claims that Boston Gas may use the\n\ndeclaratory judgment to compel Century to indemnify Boston Gas for\n\ncosts incurred to clean up the Mystic River; although the river\n\nabuts the Everett site, Century says that no issue related to the\n\ncleanup of the river was adjudicated as part of the Everett trial.\n\nCentury claims that these and some other future costs are \"purely\n\nspeculative,\" not the subject of any formulated clean-up plan, and\n\nmay be subject to exclusions or defenses that Century was unable to\n\nraise or that were otherwise not at issue during the trial.\n\n           The district judge retains substantial discretion in\n\ndeciding whether to grant declaratory relief, but--so far as its\n\ngrant   determines     legal    liabilities--our         review     may     be   more\n\n\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fsearching.12     We    are   troubled       neither     by   the     claim   of\n\nspeculativeness--there were indications of further damage to the\n\nriver--nor about the lack of a final remedial plan.                      In the\n\nanalogous   CERCLA    context,   courts     routinely    enter     declaratory\n\njudgments on liability for response costs or damages.               See Kelley\n\nv. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 17 F.3d 836, 844-46 (6th Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n            But the declaratory judgment makes Century liable for\n\n\"all costs that Boston Gas has incurred, and will incur, for\n\ninvestigation   and    cleanup   at   and    around    the   Everett     site.\"\n\nCentury's   obligations   are    defined    by   the    policy     and   related\n\nliability rules and, although presumably not intended by the\n\ndistrict court, the judgment could be read to sweep more broadly--\n\nsay, to encompass clean-up operations that are necessitated by\n\nfuture remediation of the Everett site property solely for the\n\nbenefit of the new owner.\n\n            Surely the entry of declaratory relief in Boston Gas'\n\nfavor should not preclude an insurer from contesting the amount of\n\nthe requested costs or whether the work undertaken was consistent\n\nwith compensable remediation efforts. Cf. Foster v. United States,\n\n922 F. Supp. 663, 664-65 (D.D.C. 1996); see also Am. Cyanamid Co.\n\n\n\n     12\n      See generally Diaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico, 451 F.3d 13 (1st\nCir. 2006); Ernst & Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp., 45 F.3d\n530, 534 (1st Cir. 1995); Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Providence\n& Worcester R.R. Co., 798 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n                                   -25-\n\fv. Capuano, 381 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 2004).                Whether future costs\n\nmay be covered by an exclusion (e.g., for the insured's own\n\nproperty) or defense is not easily resolved in the abstract.                      One\n\ncan imagine scenarios in which Boston Gas may seek recovery for\n\ncosts that Century may deem covered by a defense not yet resolved\n\nor forfeit.\n\n            We conclude that as to future costs, Century cannot re-\n\nargue matters that have already been decided, but conversely,\n\nBoston Gas cannot properly seek to recover for future costs spent\n\npurely to remediate its own property where no threat exists of\n\ncontamination outside the site. The district court will be able to\n\ndetermine the scope of litigation when a dispute arises, using\n\ndoctrines like collateral estoppel, waiver, and the like to prevent\n\nrelitigation      of    matters   that    have   been,    or    could   have   been,\n\ndecided.\n\n            By its literal terms the declaratory judgment could be\n\nread to encompass costs that are not recoverable under Century's\n\npolicy; the district court may not have considered that requiring\n\nCentury    to    indemnify      Boston    Gas    for    all     costs   related    to\n\n\"investigation         and   cleanup\"    may    apply    more    broadly   than    it\n\nintended.       On remand an adjustment is needed in order to clarify\n\nthat Boston Gas' entitlement extends only to costs incurred for\n\nremediation not barred by the terms of Century's policies and\n\nconsistent with the findings of the jury.\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\f           Statutory prejudgment interest.

If the date of the breach\n           or demand is not established, interest shall\n           be added . . . at the rate of twelve per cent\n           per annum from the date of the commencement of\n           the action.\n\nBased on this provision, the district court calculated prejudgment\n\ninterest (roughly $2.5 million) as running from the various dates\n\nthat Boston Gas incurred expenses for which it was entitled to\n\nindemnity from Century.        For purposes of this calculation, Boston\n\nGas submitted dated invoices for all of these expenses.\n\n           Century argues to us, as it did in the district court,\n\nthat interest should instead run from October 22, 2002--the date on\n\nwhich   Boston   Gas   filed    the   action--with   respect   to   expenses\n\nincurred before that date.       (Both agree that interest on expenses\n\nincurred after the filing date accrues only from the dates they\n\nwere incurred.)    It says that the date of breach or demand has not\n\nbeen \"established\" because there was no jury finding; and, further,\n\nno breach or demand occurred before suit was filed because Boston\n\nGas had not requested indemnification for specific expenses.            Our\n\nreview on this claim is de novo. See R.I. Charities Trust v.\n\nEngelhard Corp., 267 F.3d 3, 5 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\f          Massachusetts courts have repeatedly stated that, where\n\na case is tried to a jury, the jury is to pass on the question of\n\nwhether and when (for purposes of section 6C) breach occurred or a\n\ndemand was made.   Deerskin Trading Post, Inc. v. Spencer Press,\n\nInc., 495 N.E.2d 303, 308 (Mass. 1986) (in jury case neither trial\n\njudge or appellate court can decide issue); see also Berish v.\n\nBornstein, 770 N.E.2d 961, 979-980 (Mass. 2002).     Here, neither\n\nparty sought a special verdict finding on this question.\n\n          Federal courts in diversity cases are bound to follow\n\nstate substantive law, but whether a judge or jury should decide an\n\nissue is a matter of court practice or procedure.     Byrd v. Blue\n\nRidge Rural Electrical Cooperative, Inc., 356 U.S. 525 (1958),\n\nexpressly decided that the distribution of issues between judge and\n\njury is \"not bound up with rights and obligations,\" so as to commit\n\na federal court to follow the state rule.     Id. at 538; see also\n\nHanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 465 (1965); Mayer v. Gary Partners\n\n& Co., 29 F.3d 330, 333 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\n          Boston Gas is entitled, under Massachusetts law, to\n\nprejudgment interest at the statutory rate from the date of \"breach\n\nor demand\"; but in a federal court federal practice governs who\n\ndetermines that date.     Our case law does not appear to have\n\ndirectly addressed this question before.   Occasionally, on this or\n\nlike issues, we have referred to state practice, e.g., Saint-Gobain\n\nIndus. Ceramics Inc. v. Wellons, Inc., 246 F.3d 64 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n\n                               -28-\n\f(where no one seems to have argued that federal law should govern),\n\nbut without a considered holding.\n\n           In federal practice, usually the jury is required to pass\n\non all elements of damages; yet prejudgment interest is routinely\n\nadded by the judge on motion to alter or amend the judgment under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), e.g., Osterneck v. Ernst & Whinney, 489 U.S.\n\n169,   171-72   (1989),    and   the   district     judge   decides   based   on\n\n\"considerations of fairness\" whether to award interest at all and\n\nat what rate.     Bd. of County Comm'rs of Jackson County v. United\n\nStates, 308 U.S. 343, 352 (1939).\n\n           If interest were required to be awarded from a certain\n\ndate by right, and there were a genuine factual dispute as to that\n\ndate, then a federal court might yield to the jury, cf. Erskine v.\n\nVan Arsdale, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 75, 77 (1872); but even this is not\n\nbeyond doubt since judges do determine facts in certain contexts,\n\nsee Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 378\n\n(1996).   The inquiry, to the extent that the seventh amendment is\n\ninvoked, is largely historical.          Id.\n\n           We need not engage in that inquiry here because we are\n\nconvinced that no factual questions are implicated.              The material\n\nfacts are known and undisputed.               On August 4, 1995, Boston Gas\n\nwrote to Century to give notice of the contamination:\n\n           This will      serve as notice of circumstances\n           indicating     the potential for claims against\n           Boston Gas     Company (\"Boston Gas\") arising out\n           of alleged      contamination . . . .     You are\n\n                                       -29-\n\f          hereby notified that Boston Gas claims\n          entitlement to coverage under the referenced\n          policies with respect to any claims or\n          liabilities that may arise out of any\n          contamination of the referenced sites.\n\nCentury responded on July 22, 1996, writing that until it could\n\n\"obtain additional factual information,\" it will \"reserve all\n\nrights, at law and in equity, to disclaim coverage under the terms,\n\nconditions, definitions and exclusions of the policies.\"\n\n          The letter explicitly warned that it \"should not be\n\nunderstood as either accepting or disclaiming coverage but, rather,\n\nas notice to Boston Gas that coverage may be in jeopardy under the\n\npolicies.\"      Century   says   that,    thereafter,   Boston   Gas   never\n\nrequested payment for specific expenses or submitted particular\n\ninvoices to it for reimbursement, and Boston Gas does not claim\n\notherwise.   In other words, until this suit there was never a\n\nrefusal to pay any invoice, either specifically or categorically.\n\n          On the present record, no date of \"breach or demand\" has\n\nbeen established, and Boston Gas is entitled to statutory interest\n\nonly from the date of filing suit (or later, for those expenses\n\nthat post-dated the filing).      The Supreme Judicial Court has held\n\nthat a demand should inform the defendant \"of the basis and extent\n\nof its obligations, as well as the fact that performance was then\n\ndue.\"   Town of Lexington v. Town of Bedford, 393 N.E.2d 321, 324\n\n(Mass. 1979).    Boston Gas' letter, which gave notice only of the\n\n\"potential\" for claims (presumably to satisfy notice requirements),\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fdid not do so; it was not an \"unequivocal demand[] for payment.\"\n\nGen. Dynamics Corp. v. Fed. Pac. Elec. Co., 482 N.E.2d 824, 830\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1985).\n\n           In allowing interest from the dates of the invoices, the\n\ndistrict court relied on Sterilite Corp. v. Continental Casualty\n\nCo., 494 N.E.2d 1008 (Mass. 1986), holding that an insurer who\n\nbreached its duty to defend was liable for interest from the dates\n\nthat the insured, \"on notice that the defendant would refuse to pay\n\nfor those expenses, was forced to pay those expenses itself.\"   Id.\n\nat 1011.   But Century had not disclaimed coverage, cf. Protective\n\nLife Ins. Co. v. Dignity Viatical Settlement Partners, L.P., 171\n\nF.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 1999), and was not bound to make payments in\n\nthe absence of specific requests to do so.\n\n           Missing policies.   Century's last objection is easily\n\ndispatched.   Century challenges the jury's findings on the limits\n\nof liability for the insurance policies Century issued to Boston\n\nGas between 1951 and 1960.     Although Boston Gas sought coverage\n\nfor liabilities at the Everett site under the Century policy in\n\neffect from 1966-1969, Boston Gas--presumably to protect its own\n\ninterests in subsequent cases and in settlement discussions--\n\nrequested that the jury find the limits of Century's policy XPL-\n\n3392, which was in effect from 1951 through 1960.         The jury\n\nconcluded that the policy had an annual limit of $500,000 during\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\fthe 1952-54 time period, and a limit of $1,000,000 in all the other\n\nyears.\n\n            Neither   party   produced   a   copy   of   policy   XPL-3392;\n\npossibly the policy, over a half century old, was lost or perhaps\n\ndestroyed    at   some   point   in   the    intervening     years.     Under\n\nMassachusetts law, the loss of a policy is not fatal to a claim:\n\nthe proponent of the policy simply bears the burden of proving--\n\ne.g., by business records and expert testimony--the prior existence\n\nand terms of the policy.      Rubenstein, 694 N.E.2d at 384.          Century\n\nnow claims that the jury's findings as to the terms of policy XPL-\n\n3392 are unsupported by the evidence.\n\n            At trial, evidence was produced by both sides as to\n\nCentury's insurance practices during the relevant period; for\n\nexample, Boston Gas placed in evidence a 1951 Century insurance\n\npolicy issued to Brooklyn Union Gas Company.             Boston Gas relied\n\nheavily on the language of the 1960-66 policy, XPL-5607, which\n\nstated that it was a renewal of XPL-3392; Boston Gas' former\n\ndirector of risk management, Stephanie Shepard, testified that the\n\nterm \"renewing\" meant that XPL-5607, which had an annual limit of\n\n$1,000,000, renewed a prior policy with similar coverage and\n\nlimits.\n\n            Boston Gas also relied on testimony about reinsurance\n\npractices from Judith Harnadek, an assistant vice-president in\n\nCentury's claim handling department, to show that XPL-3392 was\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\fvalued somewhere between $500,000 and $1,000,000.              Century, in\n\nturn,   attempted    to   impugn   Shepard's    knowledge    of     insurance\n\npractices during the 1950s and said that Harnadek's testimony\n\nestablished that Century's insurance practices were highly variable\n\nand the policy limits of XPL-3392 could not be determined with any\n\ncertainty.\n\n           The jury's determination of raw facts stands unless it is\n\nunsupported by any rational view of the evidence. Marcoux v. Shell\n\nOil Prods. Co. LLC, 524 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 2008).           Here a jury\n\ncould reasonably be persuaded by Boston Gas' evidence showing that\n\nXPL-5607 served as a renewal of the earlier XPL-3392, as well as by\n\nthe documentary evidence of contemporaneous policies issued by\n\nCentury to other manufactured gas companies.           Century produced\n\nevidence casting doubt on Boston Gas' position, but nothing that\n\ncompelled a different finding.\n\n           Conclusion.      The    questions   specified    below    will   be\n\nreferred to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for its\n\nconsideration.      We have decided all other issues, confirming that\n\nthe certified issues do affect the ultimate outcome. The questions\n\nare as follows:\n\n                  1.    Where an insured protected by\n           standard CGL policy language incurs covered\n           costs as a result of ongoing environmental\n           contamination occurring over more than one\n           year and the insurer provided coverage for\n           less than the full period of years in which\n           contamination occurred, should the direct\n           liability of the sued insurer be pro rated in\n\n                                    -33-\n\f           some manner among all insurers \"on the risk,\"\n           limiting the direct liability of the sued\n           insurer to its share but leaving the insured\n           free to seek the balance from other such\n           insurers (see pages 9-13, above) ?\n\n                  2. If some form of pro rata liability\n           is called for in such circumstances, what\n           allocation method or formula should be used\n           (see page 13, above)?\n\n                  3.    If a single insurer in such\n           circumstances is subject to liability under\n           more than one policy and each policy has a\n           separate deductible or self-insured retention,\n           should the insured be able to collect covered\n           losses from a single policy subject only to\n           that policy's deductible or self-insured\n           retention, or should liability be reduced by\n           the sum of the applicable self-insured\n           retentions,   effectively   allocating   total\n           liability across the policies of that insurer\n           in effect during the contamination period (see\n           page 7 and note 4, above)?\n\nWe would also welcome any additional observations about relevant\n\nMassachusetts law that the Supreme Judicial Court may wish to\n\noffer.\n\n           The clerk of this court is directed to forward to the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, under the official seal of\n\nthis court, a copy of the certified questions and our decision in\n\nthis case, along with a copy of the briefs and appendix filed by\n\nthe parties in this case.   We retain jurisdiction over this appeal\n\nand will frame our ultimate decision and judgment after receiving\n\nsuch guidance on the certified questions as the SJC may be prepared\n\nto give.   No costs will be taxed at this stage of the proceedings,\n\n\n\n                                -34-\n\fbut the issue may be revisited after we have received the answers\n\nto the certified questions.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -35-\n\f",

This is a dispute between Boston\n\nGas Company (\"Boston Gas\"), the largest provider of natural gas in\n\nthe New England area, and one of its insurers, Century Indemnity\n\nCompany (\"Century\").        Before natural gas became the primary source\n\nof   energy     in   New   England,   Boston   Gas   produced   gas   fuel    at\n\nfacilities called manufactured gas plants, known in the industry as\n\n\"MGPs\".       These MGPs created gas by heating coal in large ovens,\n\ngenerating gas which was then purified and piped out for use.\n\n              This process also produced a variety of byproducts,\n\nincluding ash, drip oil, tar and coke.          Many are non-biodegradable\n\nand some are deemed carcinogenic, and they now contaminate the\n\nground and water around many former MGP sites; further, MGPs were\n\noften sited near waterways which were contaminated in turn.1                 See\n\nEnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc. v. Century Indem. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794719\"><a href=\"/opinion/794719/energynorth-natural-gas-inc-successor-in-interest-to-gas-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n46-47 (1st Cir. 2006).           Contamination has been discovered at\n\ntwenty-nine former Boston Gas MGPs; this case concerns only one of\n\nthose sites, located in Everett, Massachusetts.\n\n              Boston Gas operated the Everett MGP from 1908 until\n\napproximately 1969; the MGP produced manufactured gas and also\n\nprocessed coke oven gas purchased from a nearby coke plant.                   In\n\n1995,     a   routine   investigation   uncovered    contamination     at    the\n\n\n      1\n      The main contaminant in this case was tar--the chief liquid\nbyproduct of manufactured gas production. At nearly all MGP sites\nsome tar escaped confinement and leaked into the environment; once\nthat leakage occurs, tar tends to migrate and to contaminate soils\nand groundwater beyond the borders of the facility's site.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fEverett site.   Although the Everett site had been sold to a new\n\nowner (DOMAC, LLC) in 1970, Boston Gas was nevertheless strictly\n\nliable under Massachusetts law for all costs associated with the\n\ninvestigation and cleanup of the contamination caused by the MGP's\n\noperations.\n\n           Boston    Gas   had    purchased   three    general   commercial\n\nliability insurance policies from Century covering the period from\n\nDecember 1, 1951, through December 1, 1969.           Each policy contained\n\na self-insured retention (\"SIR\")--essentially a deductible--of\n\n$100,000 for each occurrence resulting in personal injury or\n\nproperty   damage.     Above     the   deductible   amount,   the   policies\n\nprovided that Century would cover Boston Gas' \"ultimate net loss\"\n\nup to the applicable limits of the policies for any liabilities\n\nstemming from bodily injury, property damage, or other harm caused\n\nby an \"occurrence.\"    An \"occurrence,\" said the policies, was\n\n           an accident, including injurious exposure to\n           conditions, which results, during the policy\n           period, in property damage neither expected\n           nor intended from the standpoint of the\n           [i]nsured.\n\n           After Boston Gas investigated and began to clean up the\n\ncontaminated soils and groundwater at and near the Everett site,\n\nBoston Gas warned Century that it might seek indemnification.\n\nCentury \"reserved its rights,\" and on October 22, 2002, Boston Gas\n\nfiled a diversity law suit against Century in the federal district\n\ncourt, seeking a declaratory judgment as to Century's obligations\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\funder the policies and damages for its breach thereof.   A three-\n\nweek long jury trial followed, focusing upon the Everett site.2\n\n          Boston Gas argued in the district court that to recover\n\nunder the policies, it needed to prove only that an occurrence had\n\ncaused some off-site property damage during the policy periods--\n\noff-site because the policy had an \"owned property\" exclusion for\n\ndamage to Boston Gas' own property.   Off-site damage, in Boston\n\nGas' view, required Century to indemnify Boston Gas for all its\n\nliabilities connected to the occurrence.   Century responded that\n\nvarious exclusions contained in the policies precluded or limited\n\nindemnification.\n\n          Importantly, Century argued that Boston Gas was well\n\naware by 1951 that pollution from the Everett MGP was causing\n\nproperty damage at or near the site; the costs were therefore\n\nbarred by an exclusion requiring that the property damage be\n\n\"neither expected nor intended\" by the insured.      Century also\n\nargued that Boston Gas improperly sought to recover costs expended\n\nto repair and improve the Everett site itself, rather than to\n\nremediate or prevent off-site property damage.\n\n          At trial, the jury awarded Boston Gas over $6.1 million\n\nin past remediation expenses; the district court also issued a\n\n\n\n     2\n      The other twenty-eight Boston Gas MGPs remain the subject of\na larger dispute. Boston Gas intends to use the outcome of the\nEverett trial as an exemplar to establish its rights against\nCentury with respect to the other sites.\n\n                               -5-\n\fdeclaratory judgment obligating Century to pay all future costs\n\nassociated with the investigation and environmental cleanup of the\n\nEverett site.     Century now appeals on multiple grounds from the\n\ndistrict court's judgment.      As usual, the standard of review\n\ndepends on the issue.    Indianapolis Life Ins. Co. v.

Century's most far-reaching\n\nclaim is that the district court should have limited Century's\n\nliability by allocating Boston Gas' liabilities among all insurers\n\nfrom whom Boston Gas had purchased general commercial liability\n\ninsurance during the Everett MGP's lifespan.      Century insured\n\nBoston Gas under various policies from 1951-1969,3     while other\n\ninsurers covered Boston Gas during other periods of its century-\n\nlong operation.\n\n          Century does not now dispute the jury's finding that the\n\nEverett site suffered contamination during the 1951-1969 time\n\nperiod.   Indeed, contamination seemingly occurred over a much\n\nlonger period, even though no findings were made as to duration.\n\nRather, renewing an argument made in the district court, Century\n\nsays that manifestly not all of the damage could have been caused\n\n\n     3\n      The terms of the policies varied. The 1960-66 policy had a\nper occurrence limit of $1 million and a SIR of $100,000.      The\n1966-69 policy contained a limit of $17 million and a SIR of\n$100,000. The 1951-60 policy was lost, but the jury found that the\npolicy had a $1 million policy limit in 1951 and from 1955-1960,\nand a limit of $500,000 from 1952-1954. The jury did not determine\nthe lost policy's self-insured retention limits.\n\n                                -6-\n\fduring its limited period of insurance and its liability should be\n\nno more than its proportionate share.    It also urges that its share\n\nshould be spread among its various policy years.4\n\n             The district court instead applied a method of allocation\n\nreferred to in the doctrine as the joint and several, or \"all\n\nsums,\" approach and permitted Boston Gas to recover from Century\n\nits total clean-up liability--subject only to the SIR and policy\n\nlimit--under any one of its policies in place between 1951 and\n\n1969.      Not surprisingly, Boston Gas selected the policy with the\n\nhighest coverage limit--$17 million--and Century was held fully\n\nliable for $6,227,327.90 in damages, less that policy's $100,000\n\nSIR.\n\n               On appeal, arguing for pro rata allocation, Century\n\nhighlights the policy language--the underscoring is ours--defining\n\nan occurrence as \"an accident . . . which results, during the\n\npolicy period, in property damage.\"       It asserts that it is not\n\nresponsible for damage that occurred outside of the policy period,\n\nso proration among insurers is required.     Boston Gas counters that\n\nthe policy says nothing about proration, so given an occurrence--\n\nwhich includes \"continuous or repeated exposure to substantially\n\n\n\n       4\n      In substance Century wants any award reduced by its policies'\nself-insured retention of $100,000 for each year of contamination,\narguing that this approach is consistent with Massachusetts'\nrequirement that an insured exhaust all available underlying\nprimary insurance.

One example is\n\nso-called \"orphan shares,\" i.e., damages attributable to years\n\nduring which the insured \"went bare\" or purchased coverage from a\n\nnow-insolvent insurer.     Pro rata allocation usually (although not\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\finevitably) treats the insured as self-insuring for those years, a\n\nresult that some courts view (appropriately) as preventing a\n\nwindfall, EnergyNorth, 934 A.2d at 526; others as (inappropriately)\n\ndepriving the insured of expected protection.

By contrast, under joint and several\n\nliability all damages are attributable to a single year; ordinarily\n\nthe insured is responsible for a single deductible and, given the\n\nlarge sums ordinarily sought, it becomes more likely that excess\n\ninsurance will be activated.\n\n           That a legal issue is close or difficult is not normally\n\nenough to warrant certification, or else diversity cases would\n\nregularly require appellate proceedings in two courts.              But the\n\ndollar amounts involved in this and the follow-on cases for other\n\nsites are very large (see note 2, above); and the allocation method\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fcould easily matter in future cases not involving these parties.\n\nAlthough Massachusetts judicial policy is often favorable to the\n\ninsured, at least in consumer cases, sister courts in New York, New\n\nHampshire and Connecticut have adopted the pro rata approach.   See\n\nnote 6, above.\n\n          Perhaps the strongest argument for certification is that\n\neven within the two broad schools of thought, there are additional\n\nnuances complicating any prediction by us of Massachusetts law.\n\nFor instance, in joint and several allocation courts divide on\n\nwhether an insured is allowed to \"stack\" multiple policies to\n\nobtain coverage for all their damages; for pro rata allocation,\n\nsome courts allocate damages based purely upon the number of years\n\nof coverage, while others allocate based on both years and amounts\n\nof coverage offered.8\n\n          Because we have found no controlling SJC precedent on the\n\nallocation question and the issue is determinative of the scope of\n\nBoston Gas' claim, we will certify the questions set forth at the\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      Compare Keene, 667 F.2d at 1049 (allowing insured to seek\ncoverage only under a single policy), with J.H.

The   oral\n\ninstructions suggest that this was likely not the intended result.11\n\nBut while an instruction might sometimes be so clear as to control\n\nan ambiguous special verdict form, here the special verdict form\n\ndemanded an all-or-nothing award.\n\n               Boston Gas says that it proved off-site contamination,\n\nbut this is not an answer to a claim that the special verdict\n\nerroneously presented an all-or-nothing choice.              Under Hakim, some\n\noff-site contamination does not automatically justify recovery of\n\n\n     11\n      The district court told the jury that \"the plaintiff cannot\nrecover for any costs that were incurred solely to clean up its own\nproperty.\" But other portions of the instructions--the district\ncourt went on to characterize \"the cleanup costs\" as an indivisible\nsum--cut the other way.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fall on-site remediation.       As Hakim explained: \"The policy covers\n\ncleanup costs incurred to remediate or prevent further migration of\n\nthe contaminants to the off-site waterways. Costs incurred for the\n\nsole purpose of remediating the Hakims' property are barred by . .\n\n. the policy.\"     Id. at 1165-66.\n\n           Boston Gas also says that Century provided no evidence\n\nthat would have allowed the jury to determine that some of the on-\n\nsite costs were solely for the benefit of the site and not\n\nnecessary to prevent further off-site pollution.             Yet substantial\n\ncosts (Century says $3.5 million) were incurred to remove soils and\n\nfor other work incident to a project undertaken in 2000 by DOMAC to\n\nexpand its operations at the Everett site--or at least the jury\n\ncould have so found.      These costs are part of the award against\n\nCentury.\n\n           For     example,    among   other      steps,     DOMAC   removed\n\ncontaminated soils and liquids from underground storage tanks--\n\nthese tanks were buried under the Everett site when DOMAC first\n\npurchased the property in 1970--at a cost to Boston Gas (under a\n\nsharing agreement with DOMAC) of around $1.6 million. Century says\n\nthat this was clearly done for the purpose of giving DOMAC a firm\n\nfoundation   for   its   own   facilities   and   not   as   remediation   or\n\nprevention of further off-site damage.\n\n           The fact that the jury verdict included the disputed\n\ncosts shows only that the jury believed that some costs targeted\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fpollution that damaged or threatened off-site property. So we must\n\nremand for a new trial on this issue.               This is a relatively narrow\n\nissue, but the amounts are not trivial.                     In all events, the\n\nprinciple is clear: only that remediation necessary to protect\n\nagainst   off-site       contamination       is    compensable;    further   costs,\n\nhowever useful to mitigate on-site contamination, are not.\n\n             Century says that it should have been given judgment as\n\na   matter   of    law    as    to   a   portion    of   these   disputed    costs--\n\nspecifically, the $1.6 million allocated to the removal of the\n\ncontaminated soils.            Century argues, first, that the removal was\n\nindisputably for the purpose of the DOMAC expansion project and\n\ntherefore excluded; and second, that the soil was contaminated by\n\nunderground       oil    only   after     DOMAC    purchased     the   property   and\n\nCentury's coverage ceased.               We are not persuaded that the issue\n\nshould have been taken from the jury.\n\n             The \"purpose\" of the removal may, as Century claims, have\n\nbeen to forward the DOMAC expansion; but the relevant question\n\nunder the policy and Hakim is whether the removal of that soil was\n\nalso objectively necessary because contaminants in the soil posed\n\na threat to off-site property as well.               Similarly, Century's claim\n\nthat this all occurred after its policy coverage ended in 1969 begs\n\nthe question; the covered \"occurrence\"--ongoing contamination--\n\nbegan before and continued during and lasted until after Century's\n\nperiod of coverage.\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f            Century points to some evidence that the contamination of\n\nthe soil in the tanks occurred during the 1970 project; but Boston\n\nGas attacked the credibility of Century's expert witness, Richard\n\nMeehan,    and    offered   evidence   that     the    tanks    may   have     been\n\ncontaminated at some earlier point and that contamination generally\n\nhad spread throughout the Everett site and beyond.              This is for the\n\njury to resolve.         Sailor Inc. F/V v.

Anderson was to serve as Century's expert\n\non the proper categorization of costs; Anderson attested that he\n\nwould categorize Boston Gas' site-related expenditures as \"legal\n\ncosts, site investigation costs, remediation costs, and general\n\nbusiness expenditures\"-- presumably to aid the jury in determining\n\nwhich costs fell within Century's policy exclusions.\n\n            On September 16, 2005--approximately two months before\n\ntrial was set to begin--Century produced a second supplemental\n\nreport from Anderson, which contained (in Century's view) essential\n\nopinions    related   to    Century's     owned-property      defense.     For\n\ninstance, the report characterized certain expenses previously\n\ncategorized as \"remediation\" as necessary for on-site construction\n\nactivities but not remediation.          The new report also contained new\n\nanalysis of the costs Boston Gas had incurred in the removal and\n\ndisposal of the three underground storage tanks; Anderson planned\n\nto   say   this   project   was   part    of   construction    activity,   not\n\nremediation efforts.\n\n            Boston    Gas   moved   to    strike Anderson's supplemental\n\nreport, complaining that Century sought to inject an entirely new\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\ftheory of defense as to certain costs after the deadline for expert\n\nreports.   Century answered that the tardy report was based on\n\ninformation that Boston Gas had itself belatedly disclosed on\n\nAugust   16,   2005;   this   data,   Century   claims,   was    previously\n\nunavailable to Century.       The district court sided with Boston Gas\n\nand excluded the new report, saying the report was a major change\n\nand prior discovery available to Century undermined Century's\n\nclaimed lack of notice.\n\n           From our vantage, this was a close call.             Century has\n\nsome basis for contesting Boston Gas' description of the reports as\n\nreflecting a \"sea change,\" and         Boston Gas could have asked to\n\ndepose Anderson on his new adjustments.

Placing the burden on Century, the district\n\ncourt asked the jury on the special verdict form to decide:\n\n           Did Boston Gas Company intentionally cause or\n           know to a substantial certainty that it was\n           causing contamination of soil and groundwater\n           at the Everett site in one or more policy\n           years?\n\n           A \"yes\" answer to this question required the jury to\n\nidentify the year or years in which Boston Gas \"intentionally\n\ncause[d] or [knew] to a substantial certainty that it was causing\n\nsuch   contamination.\"      But   the   jury   returned   a   \"no\"   answer,\n\nrendering the exclusion inapplicable.          On appeal, Century objects\n\nto the charge based on a remark made by the district court in\n\nexplaining its special questions to the jury.\n\n           The remark was made by the district judge in seeking to\n\ndifferentiate between the type of knowledge required by this\n\n\"expected/intended\" exclusion and another \"known loss\" exclusion\n\nthat Massachusetts courts read into such policies; the latter is a\n\njudicially created exclusion that prevents a policyholder from\n\nrecovering for losses from damage that it knew existed before\n\npurchasing an insurance policy.         See SCA Servs. Inc. v. Transp.\n\nIns.

Century says that the latter direction required\n\nthe jury to disregard evidence, heavily relied on by Century, of\n\nBoston Gas' expectations in the years before the first Century\n\npolicy went into effect.\n\n            Taken   literally      and   in   isolation,    the    underscored\n\nlanguage might be understood as Century contends and might well\n\nmisstate Massachusetts law; we can see no reason why knowledge\n\nprior to the policy year would not count against the insured.               But\n\nthe chance of prejudice is limited because the pertinent charge as\n\na whole (which Century did not trouble to quote) tended to convey\n\nthe correct message and also because common sense tends to reject\n\nthe notion that an earlier intention or expectation would not\n\ncount.\n\n            Anyway, Century failed to object to the district court's\n\narguable misstatement when the charge was given, Fed.

In   addition     to    awarding     the\n\ndamages   calculated    by     the   jury,    the    district       court   granted\n\ndeclaratory relief requiring Century to indemnify Boston Gas for\n\nall future costs for investigation and cleanup at and around the\n\nEverett   site.   Century      contends--as         it   did   below--that        the\n\ndeclaratory judgment is over-broad because it applies to possible\n\ndamage from MGP operations at the Everett site that was not\n\nspecifically litigated at the Everett trial.\n\n           For instance, Century claims that Boston Gas may use the\n\ndeclaratory judgment to compel Century to indemnify Boston Gas for\n\ncosts incurred to clean up the Mystic River; although the river\n\nabuts the Everett site, Century says that no issue related to the\n\ncleanup of the river was adjudicated as part of the Everett trial.\n\nCentury claims that these and some other future costs are \"purely\n\nspeculative,\" not the subject of any formulated clean-up plan, and\n\nmay be subject to exclusions or defenses that Century was unable to\n\nraise or that were otherwise not at issue during the trial.\n\n           The district judge retains substantial discretion in\n\ndeciding whether to grant declaratory relief, but--so far as its\n\ngrant   determines     legal    liabilities--our         review     may     be   more\n\n\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fsearching.12     We    are   troubled       neither     by   the     claim   of\n\nspeculativeness--there were indications of further damage to the\n\nriver--nor about the lack of a final remedial plan.                      In the\n\nanalogous   CERCLA    context,   courts     routinely    enter     declaratory\n\njudgments on liability for response costs or damages.               See Kelley\n\nv. E.I.

One\n\ncan imagine scenarios in which Boston Gas may seek recovery for\n\ncosts that Century may deem covered by a defense not yet resolved\n\nor forfeit.\n\n            We conclude that as to future costs, Century cannot re-\n\nargue matters that have already been decided, but conversely,\n\nBoston Gas cannot properly seek to recover for future costs spent\n\npurely to remediate its own property where no threat exists of\n\ncontamination outside the site. The district court will be able to\n\ndetermine the scope of litigation when a dispute arises, using\n\ndoctrines like collateral estoppel, waiver, and the like to prevent\n\nrelitigation      of    matters   that    have   been,    or    could   have   been,\n\ndecided.\n\n            By its literal terms the declaratory judgment could be\n\nread to encompass costs that are not recoverable under Century's\n\npolicy; the district court may not have considered that requiring\n\nCentury    to    indemnify      Boston    Gas    for    all     costs   related    to\n\n\"investigation         and   cleanup\"    may    apply    more    broadly   than    it\n\nintended.       On remand an adjustment is needed in order to clarify\n\nthat Boston Gas' entitlement extends only to costs incurred for\n\nremediation not barred by the terms of Century's policies and\n\nconsistent with the findings of the jury.\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\f           Statutory prejudgment interest.       Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231\n\n§ 6C provides:\n\n           In   all    actions   based   on   contractual\n           obligations . . . interest shall be added by\n           the clerk of the court . . . at the rate of\n           twelve per cent per annum from the date of the\n           breach or demand. If the date of the breach\n           or demand is not established, interest shall\n           be added . . . at the rate of twelve per cent\n           per annum from the date of the commencement of\n           the action.\n\nBased on this provision, the district court calculated prejudgment\n\ninterest (roughly $2.5 million) as running from the various dates\n\nthat Boston Gas incurred expenses for which it was entitled to\n\nindemnity from Century.        For purposes of this calculation, Boston\n\nGas submitted dated invoices for all of these expenses.\n\n           Century argues to us, as it did in the district court,\n\nthat interest should instead run from October 22, 2002--the date on\n\nwhich   Boston   Gas   filed    the   action--with   respect   to   expenses\n\nincurred before that date.       (Both agree that interest on expenses\n\nincurred after the filing date accrues only from the dates they\n\nwere incurred.)    It says that the date of breach or demand has not\n\nbeen \"established\" because there was no jury finding; and, further,\n\nno breach or demand occurred before suit was filed because Boston\n\nGas had not requested indemnification for specific expenses.

The material\n\nfacts are known and undisputed.               On August 4, 1995, Boston Gas\n\nwrote to Century to give notice of the contamination:\n\n           This will      serve as notice of circumstances\n           indicating     the potential for claims against\n           Boston Gas     Company (\"Boston Gas\") arising out\n           of alleged      contamination . . . .

In other words, until this suit there was never a\n\nrefusal to pay any invoice, either specifically or categorically.\n\n          On the present record, no date of \"breach or demand\" has\n\nbeen established, and Boston Gas is entitled to statutory interest\n\nonly from the date of filing suit (or later, for those expenses\n\nthat post-dated the filing).

Century's last objection is easily\n\ndispatched.   Century challenges the jury's findings on the limits\n\nof liability for the insurance policies Century issued to Boston\n\nGas between 1951 and 1960.     Although Boston Gas sought coverage\n\nfor liabilities at the Everett site under the Century policy in\n\neffect from 1966-1969, Boston Gas--presumably to protect its own\n\ninterests in subsequent cases and in settlement discussions--\n\nrequested that the jury find the limits of Century's policy XPL-\n\n3392, which was in effect from 1951 through 1960.         The jury\n\nconcluded that the policy had an annual limit of $500,000 during\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\fthe 1952-54 time period, and a limit of $1,000,000 in all the other\n\nyears.\n\n            Neither   party   produced   a   copy   of   policy   XPL-3392;\n\npossibly the policy, over a half century old, was lost or perhaps\n\ndestroyed    at   some   point   in   the    intervening     years.     Under\n\nMassachusetts law, the loss of a policy is not fatal to a claim:\n\nthe proponent of the policy simply bears the burden of proving--\n\ne.g., by business records and expert testimony--the prior existence\n\nand terms of the policy.      Rubenstein, 694 N.E.2d at 384.          Century\n\nnow claims that the jury's findings as to the terms of policy XPL-\n\n3392 are unsupported by the evidence.\n\n            At trial, evidence was produced by both sides as to\n\nCentury's insurance practices during the relevant period; for\n\nexample, Boston Gas placed in evidence a 1951 Century insurance\n\npolicy issued to Brooklyn Union Gas Company.             Boston Gas relied\n\nheavily on the language of the 1960-66 policy, XPL-5607, which\n\nstated that it was a renewal of XPL-3392; Boston Gas' former\n\ndirector of risk management, Stephanie Shepard, testified that the\n\nterm \"renewing\" meant that XPL-5607, which had an annual limit of\n\n$1,000,000, renewed a prior policy with similar coverage and\n\nlimits.\n\n            Boston Gas also relied on testimony about reinsurance\n\npractices from Judith Harnadek, an assistant vice-president in\n\nCentury's claim handling department, to show that XPL-3392 was\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\fvalued somewhere between $500,000 and $1,000,000.              Century, in\n\nturn,   attempted    to   impugn   Shepard's    knowledge    of     insurance\n\npractices during the 1950s and said that Harnadek's testimony\n\nestablished that Century's insurance practices were highly variable\n\nand the policy limits of XPL-3392 could not be determined with any\n\ncertainty.\n\n           The jury's determination of raw facts stands unless it is\n\nunsupported by any rational view of the evidence. Marcoux v. Shell\n\nOil Prods. Co.

Here a jury\n\ncould reasonably be persuaded by Boston Gas' evidence showing that\n\nXPL-5607 served as a renewal of the earlier XPL-3392, as well as by\n\nthe documentary evidence of contemporaneous policies issued by\n\nCentury to other manufactured gas companies.           Century produced\n\nevidence casting doubt on Boston Gas' position, but nothing that\n\ncompelled a different finding.\n\n           Conclusion.      The    questions   specified    below    will   be\n\nreferred to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for its\n\nconsideration.      We have decided all other issues, confirming that\n\nthe certified issues do affect the ultimate outcome. The questions\n\nare as follows:\n\n                  1.    Where an insured protected by\n           standard CGL policy language incurs covered\n           costs as a result of ongoing environmental\n           contamination occurring over more than one\n           year and the insurer provided coverage for\n           less than the full period of years in which\n           contamination occurred, should the direct\n           liability of the sued insurer be pro rated in\n\n                                    -33-\n\f           some manner among all insurers \"on the risk,\"\n           limiting the direct liability of the sued\n           insurer to its share but leaving the insured\n           free to seek the balance from other such\n           insurers (see pages 9-13, above) ?\n\n                  2. If some form of pro rata liability\n           is called for in such circumstances, what\n           allocation method or formula should be used\n           (see page 13, above)?\n\n                  3.    If a single insurer in such\n           circumstances is subject to liability under\n           more than one policy and each policy has a\n           separate deductible or self-insured retention,\n           should the insured be able to collect covered\n           losses from a single policy subject only to\n           that policy's deductible or self-insured\n           retention, or should liability be reduced by\n           the sum of the applicable self-insured\n           retentions,   effectively   allocating   total\n           liability across the policies of that insurer\n           in effect during the contamination period (see\n           page 7 and note 4, above)?\n\nWe would also welcome any additional observations about relevant\n\nMassachusetts law that the Supreme Judicial Court may wish to\n\noffer.\n\n           The clerk of this court is directed to forward to the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, under the official seal of\n\nthis court, a copy of the certified questions and our decision in\n\nthis case, along with a copy of the briefs and appendix filed by\n\nthe parties in this case.   We retain jurisdiction over this appeal\n\nand will frame our ultimate decision and judgment after receiving\n\nsuch guidance on the certified questions as the SJC may be prepared\n\nto give.   No costs will be taxed at this stage of the proceedings,\n\n\n\n                                -34-\n\fbut the issue may be revisited after we have received the answers\n\nto the certified questions.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -35-\n\f</pre>",
