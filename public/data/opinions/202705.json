This is a case involving a\n\nclaim for possession of property and a monetary claim that the\n\nGovernment of the Virgin Islands (\"GVI\") made against the Small\n\nBusiness Administration (\"SBA\") receivership estate for Fairway\n\nCapital Corporation.      The SBA Receiver recommended that GVI's\n\npossessory claim be denied, and that its monetary claim be granted\n\nin part.   GVI filed an objection, but the district court affirmed\n\nthe Receiver's Report and Recommendation.        GVI now appeals the\n\ncourt's disposition of its claims before the Receiver.           After\n\ncareful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                        I. Factual Background\n\n           A. Before the Receivership Proceedings\n\n           Protestant Cay is an island in the Virgin Islands.       In\n\n1964, the Virgin Islands legislature approved Act 1179, which\n\nauthorized GVI to negotiate a fifty-year lease for Protestant Cay.\n\nThe same year, GVI leased the land on Protestant Cay to Hotel-On-\n\nThe-Cay, Inc. for fifty years (the \"Ground Lease\").        In exchange\n\nfor the lease, Hotel-On-The-Cay, Inc. agreed to pay rent to GVI, to\n\nconstruct a hotel, and to pay GVI a portion of the profits from the\n\nhotel.\n\n           In   1969,   GVI   and   Hotel-On-The-Cay,   Inc.   executed\n\nAmendment No. 1 to the Ground Lease to protect the rights of\n\nlenders who might hold a mortgage over the leasehold interest.       No\n\nlegislative approval was sought for the amendment.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           Hotel-On-The-Cay,       Inc.    assigned   its   interest    in   the\n\nGround Lease to Oliver Plunkett (\"Plunkett\").               In 1980, Plunkett\n\nfiled a declaration in the Virgin Islands stating his intention to\n\ncreate 2,900 weekly timeshare units to be known as \"Hotel On The\n\nCay Resort\" (the \"Resort\").        Plunkett had a fair bit of success,\n\nselling 1,500 of the units. However, by 1982, 1,400 units remained\n\nunsold, forcing Plunkett to declare bankruptcy.                 In 1986, the\n\ntrustee in Plunkett's bankruptcy conveyed Plunkett's interest in\n\nthe Ground Lease to Harborfront Properties, Inc. (\"Harborfront\")\n\nand Plunkett's interest in the unsold timeshare units to Protestant\n\nCay, Ltd. (\"PCL\").\n\n           In    1990,    Legend   Resorts     L.P.   (\"Legend\")       and   TSA\n\nAcquisition, Inc. (\"TSA\") agreed to acquire the unsold timeshare\n\nunits from PCL.      In order to finance the acquisition, Legend and\n\nTSA borrowed $1.7 million (the \"Legend Loan\") from Fairway Capital\n\nCorp. (\"Fairway\"), a Small Business Investment Company as defined\n\nin 15 U.S.C. ยง 681.       The Legend Loan was secured by a mortgage on\n\nthe unsold timeshare units; Fairway was also made a 20% limited\n\npartner   in    Legend.    In   addition,    Harborfront     gave    Fairway   a\n\nmortgage on Harborfront's interest in the Ground Lease; Harborfront\n\nlater assigned the Ground Lease to Fairway in 1991.                 Thus, as of\n\n1991, Fairway held (a) a mortgage interest in the unsold timeshare\n\nunits, (b) a mortgage interest in the Ground Lease, and (c) a 20%\n\nlimited partnership interest in Legend.           The same year, GVI and\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fLegend entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Ground Lease, which\n\nprovided in part that the lease would be subject to cancellation by\n\nthe lessor if the lessee was in arrears for sixty days after notice\n\nof default.      As with Amendment No. 1, this amendment was not\n\nseparately approved by the legislature.\n\n           In order to service the Legend Loan, Fairway formed a\n\nsubsidiary named Participation Services Corporation (\"PSC\") in\n\n1994.   Fairway assigned its interest in the Legend Loan to PSC the\n\nsame year. Legend defaulted on the Legend Loan, and PSC foreclosed\n\non the mortgages, naming Legend, TSA, Harborfront, and GVI in the\n\nforeclosure action.       A stipulated judgment of foreclosure was\n\nentered on June 7, 1996.      Thus, as of that date, PSC became the\n\nowner of (a) the leasehold interest in the Ground Lease and (b) the\n\nunsold timeshare units.\n\n           GVI then sent notice to Legend and Fairway that Legend\n\nwas in arrears and that GVI would terminate the Ground Lease.\n\nSixty days later, GVI filed an eviction action against Legend and\n\nFairway   in   the   Territorial   Court   of   the   Virgin   Islands   (the\n\n\"eviction action\").     Neither Legend nor Fairway appeared, and the\n\nTerritorial Court entered a default judgment on September 18, 1997.\n\nOn December 31, 1997, PSC filed a motion to intervene and to set\n\naside the default judgment in the eviction action.              At the same\n\ntime, a similar motion was filed by Hotel On the Cay Timeshare\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fAssociation, Inc. (\"HOTC\"), an entity incorporated by the owners of\n\nthe sold timeshare units.          Both motions were granted.\n\n            On May 22, 1998, GVI and HOTC entered into a settlement\n\nagreement,     which    the    parties     refer    to     as    the   \"Stipulated\n\nSettlement.\"    The Stipulated Settlement provided that in exchange\n\nfor HOTC withdrawing its intervention in the eviction action, GVI\n\nwould   recognize      HOTC   as   the   lessee    of    the    timeshare   resort,\n\nincluding the unsold timeshare units.             In addition, the Stipulated\n\nSettlement stated that HOTC would not be deemed a successor to\n\nLegend or Fairway.       Finally, the parties agreed in the Stipulated\n\nSettlement that in the event that Legend and Fairway prevailed in\n\nthe eviction action and their lease of the resort was reinstated,\n\nGVI would give credit to Legend and Fairway for all of HOTC's rent\n\npayments.    After concluding the Stipulated Settlement with HOTC,\n\nGVI continued to prosecute its eviction action against Legend and\n\nFairway in the Territorial Court, filing a motion for summary\n\njudgment on December 22, 1999.\n\n            On January 19, 2000, the SBA filed a complaint against\n\nFairway in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nRhode Island.    The SBA's complaint asked that Fairway be placed in\n\nreceivership because of Fairway's breach of various SBA regulations\n\nand its failure to pay amounts owed to the SBA.                 On March 13, 2000,\n\nthe district court entered an order placing Fairway in receivership\n\nand imposing a stay on all litigation involving Fairway, including\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fGVI's eviction action. At this time, the Territorial Court had not\n\nyet ruled on GVI's motion for summary judgment in the eviction\n\naction.   Thus, as of March 13, 2000, PSC continued to hold an\n\ninterest in the Ground Lease and the unsold timeshare units subject\n\nto the outcome of the stayed eviction proceedings.     In March 2002,\n\nthe district court ordered these interests transferred to the\n\nFairway receivership estate.1\n\n          B. The Receivership Proceedings\n\n          GVI filed two claims with the SBA Receiver: an equitable\n\nclaim asking for immediate possession of the unsold timeshare units\n\nand a monetary claim asking for $1,450,760 for unpaid rent, taxes,\n\nunemployment   insurance    contributions,   and   associated   costs,\n\ninterest, and penalties.      The Receiver recommended denying the\n\nequitable claim and granting the monetary claim to the extent of\n\n$430,421.84.   The Receiver found that the remainder of GVI's\n\nmonetary claim was either not supported by evidence that met\n\nrequirements set forth in the \"Notice to Creditors,\" or that the\n\nclaim covered time during which neither Fairway nor Legend were in\n\npossession of the resort.\n\n\n\n\n1\n   PSC and its successor Pantheon were found to be instruments and\nalter egos of Fairway. See Hotel on the Cay Time-Sharing Ass'n,\nInc. v. Kilberg, 2000 WL 34019282 at *10 (D.R.I. Apr. 6, 2000). As\nsuch, assets owned by PSC and Pantheon were deemed to be assets of\nFairway.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           At a preliminary hearing on the Receiver's Report, held\n\non February 16, 2005, the district court stated the procedure for\n\nmaking objections:\n\n           Any objectors should file their materials\n           within 30 days as the order provides.      The\n           Receiver will have 30 days to respond.     And\n           then when I have that material, I will make a\n           determination of whether I can decide those\n           matters on the papers or whether a bench trial\n           is necessary. And I will reserve decision on\n           that until I see those papers.\n\nAfter GVI stated that it would raise the issue of abstention, the\n\ncourt responded:\n\n           I think [GVI] should put forth all of its\n           contentions in the objection, and then [the\n           Receiver will] respond to it, and then I'll\n           decide whether I'm going to have a hearing\n           separately on that question of abstention or\n           not.\n\nGVI filed an objection to the Receiver's Report and Recommendation,\n\nsuggesting that the court abstain from deciding whether GVI was in\n\nactual   possession   of   the   unsold   timeshare   units,   and   in   the\n\nalternative, arguing that GVI was in actual possession of the\n\nunsold timeshare units, and thus would be entitled to judgment on\n\nits equitable claim.       GVI's objection also stated that it was\n\nentitled to an additional $120,000 on its monetary claim, of which\n\nit identified approximately $59,000 as being undisputed.\n\n           At a hearing on the objection on July 12, 2005, the court\n\nasked GVI if it wanted to \"present any evidence, any testimonial\n\nevidence.\"   GVI responded, \"Not in addition to what's already been\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fsubmitted, your Honor, that's correct.\"     GVI then proceeded to\n\nstate that only its monetary claim was properly before the court\n\nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction over its equitable\n\nclaim for possession of the unsold timeshare units.        The court\n\nresponded, \"I thought everything was before the court.       I have\n\njurisdiction over the whole works.\" GVI then argued that the court\n\nlacked jurisdiction because the court had jurisdiction only over\n\nassets possessed by Fairway, and that Fairway did not possess the\n\nResort.   The court responded, \"That's a question I will have to\n\ndecide, not the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands.      I have\n\nexclusive jurisdiction of this matter.    I've already ruled that.\n\nI denied the lifting of the stay.\"   The court then explained:\n\n          I have taken exclusive jurisdiction of this\n          matter and any property that the Receiver\n          claims that belongs to Fairway. And you want\n          to contest that? Fine. That's what I'm here\n          to hear. . . . I will make a decision as to\n          whether the receiver owns those 1400 units of\n          timeshares, not the Territorial Court of the\n          Virgin Islands. . . . Now, if you say its not\n          before me today, then we'll put it before me\n          at some later time, but I considered it before\n          me today.    I considered that I would hear\n          arguments on those issues, all those issues\n          today.   And I'm prepared to take it under\n          advisement and write a written opinion about\n          this Court's jurisdiction, the question of\n          abstention, the question of title, the\n          question of forfeiture of the ground lease,\n          the power of the governor to enter into a\n          settlement stipulation which transferred title\n          to the tenants association, all the issues in\n          this case. I'm prepared to decide them all.\n\nAfter a brief colloquy, GVI responded:\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f           [T]o the extent that you believe jurisdiction\n           exists over a possession issue and claim, it's\n           our understanding that we would have the\n           opportunity to participate in a plenary\n           hearing on that issue.\n\nThe court answered, \"I thought it was before me now.             The Receiver\n\ndenied your equitable claim.         So that matter is before me unless\n\nyou're waiving it.\"\n\n           Both   GVI    and   the   Receiver   proceeded   to    make   their\n\narguments regarding jurisdiction, abstention, and the substantive\n\nquestion of whether or not GVI was in possession of the unsold\n\ntimeshare units.        After both parties made their arguments, GVI\n\nstated, \"The issue of whether there exists a timeshare interest\n\nthat the receiver has title to is clearly one that's entitled to a\n\nplenary   hearing,      whether   it's   something   that   is   effectively\n\nresolved in the territorial court or here.\" The court asked, \"What\n\ndo you mean by that, plenary hearing?\"          GVI answered:\n\n           Well, [the Receiver] take[s] the position that\n           they actually have title in this mortgage\n           leasehold interest, which we say doesn't exist\n           anymore. So clearly there's a conflict there.\n           To the extent that they claim this title\n           exists, that's an issue that would have to be\n           fully litigated.\n\nThe court responded:\n\n           I gave you an opportunity to litigate it here\n           today. You were advised that if you had any\n           evidence to present on any of these issues,\n           you present it today.\n\nGVI then stated:\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f          My understanding, and this was going to the\n          last point, so maybe I misunderstood you\n          earlier. In an earlier proceeding before your\n          Honor, you indicated that there would be a\n          full and fair opportunity to address the\n          concerns of [GVI], you know, to the extent\n          that evidence needs to be presented at a full\n          hearing, and I was articulating earlier that\n          [there   are]  logistical   difficult[ies   in\n          bringing witnesses.] . . . I was under the\n          impression that once you determined whether\n          there was jurisdiction here, which you said\n          you were going to make that determination,\n          that we would be given the opportunity to have\n          that hearing at another time.\n\n          The court responded, \"Well, your impression is wrong.   I\n\nset aside two days to take testimony here starting today and\n\ntomorrow. . . . My order from the bench was clear that when I was\n\ngoing to hear this matter, I would hear any evidence you had to\n\npresent on any of these issues.\"      GVI then conceded that, \"what\n\nwe're talking about here and now, your Honor, are issues of law .\n\n. . . [A]ll of the issues that are before your Honor in any event\n\nreally are issues of law that are based upon the record that is\n\nbefore you, that are contained in our briefs.\"       The court then\n\nstated, \"You had an opportunity to present any evidence you wanted\n\nto present today.   You didn't choose to do so.   So I'm taking this\n\ncase under advisement.\"\n\n          On June 8, 2006, the court issued a written decision\n\naffirming its jurisdiction over the unsold timeshare units and\n\nrejecting GVI's arguments for abstention, its equitable claim for\n\npossession, and its request for a higher monetary claim. The court\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fthen affirmed and accepted the Receiver's Report and Recommendation\n\nwith respect to GVI's claims.       GVI now appeals.\n\n                             II. Discussion\n\n           GVI makes four claims.          First, GVI argues that the\n\ndistrict court should have abstained from deciding whether GVI was\n\nentitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units.              Second, GVI\n\nsuggests   that   the   district   court   did   not   give   it   sufficient\n\nopportunity to present evidence in favor of its claims. Third, GVI\n\nargues that the district court wrongly concluded that it was not\n\nentitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units.              Fourth, GVI\n\ncontends that the district court erroneously resolved its monetary\n\nclaim.   We take each claim in turn.\n\n           A. Abstention\n\n           GVI argues that the Territorial Court was in a better\n\nposition than the district court to hear its equitable claims for\n\npossession and that the district court should have abstained from\n\nhearing the case.       GVI argues that two theories of abstention\n\nsupport this argument: the doctrine of abstention discussed in\n\nColorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S.\n\n800 (1976), and the doctrine of abstention referenced in Odell v.\n\nH. Batterman Co., 223 F. 292 (2d Cir. 1915).2\n\n\n2\n   GVI also proposes a third theory of abstention based on the\nholding in Princess Lida of Thurn and Taxis v. Thompson, 305 U.S.\n456 (1939). Princess Lida held that \"if the two suits are in rem,\nor quasi in rem, so that the court, or its officer, has possession\nor must have control of the property which is the subject of the\n\n                                   -11-\n\f                  1. Colorado River Abstention\n\n          In Colorado River, the Supreme Court held that in certain\n\ncircumstances, a court may abstain from hearing a case \"due to the\n\npresence of a concurrent state proceeding for reasons of wise\n\njudicial administration.\"     424 U.S. at 818.   We have emphasized\n\nthat these circumstances are quite limited, and that there is a\n\n\"heavy presumption favoring the exercise of jurisdiction.\"    Villa\n\nMarina Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Hatteras Yachts, 915 F.2d 7, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).   We consider eight factors in determining whether such\n\nlimited circumstances exist:\n\n          (1)   whether   either   court   has   assumed\n          jurisdiction over a res; (2) the inconvenience\n          of the federal forum; (3) the desirability of\n          avoiding piecemeal litigation; (4) the order\n          in which the forums obtained jurisdiction; (5)\n          whether state or federal law controls; (6) the\n          adequacy of the state forum to protect the\n          parties' interests; (7) the vexatious or\n          contrived nature of the federal claim; and (8)\n          respect for the principles underlying removal\n          jurisdiction.\n\nKPS & Assocs. v. Designs by FMC, Inc., 318 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   These factors are not \"exhaustive, nor is any one factor\n\nnecessarily determinative.\"     Id.    Where a district court has\n\n\nlitigation in order to proceed with the cause and grant the relief\nsought the jurisdiction of the one court must yield to that of the\nother.\" 305 U.S. at 466. We have treated the issue of a state\ncourt's in rem or quasi in rem jurisdiction as the first factor to\nbe considered in the Colorado River abstention analysis, and as\nsuch, it is unnecessary to address abstention under Princess Lida\nseparately. See Bergeron v. Estate of Loeb, 777 F.2d 792, 799 (1st\nCir. 1985) (discussing application of Princess Lida doctrine in\nColorado River context).\n\n                                -12-\n\fdeclined to exercise its discretion to abstain from hearing a case\n\nunder Colorado River doctrine, we review for abuse of discretion.\n\nRรญo Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc. v. Rullรกn, 397 F.3d 56, 68 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n               As to the first factor, the district court found that in\n\nthe eviction action, the Territorial Court did not exercise in rem\n\n(or quasi in rem) jurisdiction over the unsold timeshare units. We\n\ndisagree.       A quasi in rem action requires that \"the court or its\n\nofficer have possession or control of the property which is the\n\nsubject of the suit in order to proceed with the cause and to grant\n\nthe relief sought.\"        Penn Gen. Cas. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 294 U.S.\n\n189,     195    (1935).     Here,   the     Territorial    Court   must      have\n\njurisdiction over the resort (including the unsold timeshare units)\n\nin order to adjudicate GVI's possessory claim.            As such, it is only\n\nthe parties' interests in the resort that serve as the basis of the\n\nTerritorial Court's jurisdiction.            See Virgin Islands v. Legend\n\nResorts, L.P., 39 V.I. 12, 14 (V.I. Terr. Ct. 1998) (noting that\n\nthe subject of GVI's eviction action was \"an interest related to\n\nthe leasehold\"); Schindel v. Pelican Beach Inc., 16 V.I. 237, 250\n\n(V.I. Terr. Ct. 1979) (describing a quasi in rem action as one that\n\n\"ha[s]    the     effect   of   adjudicating    the   parties'     'rights    to\n\nproperty'\"); see also State Eng'r v. S. Fork Band of the Te-Moak\n\nTribe of W. Shoshone Indians of Nev., 339 F.3d 804, 811 (9th Cir.\n\n2003) (\"But 'it is the [parties'] interest[s] in the property that\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fserve[] as the basis of the jurisdiction.'        Therefore, the action\n\nis quasi in rem.\" (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1245 (6th ed.\n\n1990)).    Because GVI brought the eviction action to adjudicate\n\nGVI's rights to the unsold timeshare units, i.e., whether it was\n\nentitled to possession, the Territorial Court had \"jurisdiction\n\nover a res.\"    KPS & Assocs., 318 F.3d at 10.\n\n           Nevertheless, a state court's quasi in rem jurisdiction\n\ndoes not make abstention mandatory.         See Bergeron v. Estate of\n\nLoeb, 777 F.2d 792, 798 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"Considering the Colorado\n\nRiver factors in turn, we do not think that the Nevada state\n\ndistrict court's assumption of in rem jurisdiction over the trust\n\nres   compels   dismissal   here.\").     Here,   the    importance   of   the\n\nTerritorial Court's quasi in rem jurisdiction is diminished by the\n\nfact that 15 U.S.C. ยง 687c(b) gives a district court \"exclusive\n\njurisdiction\" over the property of an SBA receivership estate.\n\nBecause the eviction action had not proceeded to final judgment,\n\nthe unsold timeshare units remained the property of the Fairway\n\nestate at the time that GVI made its claim.3           While it may be true\n\n\n\n3\n   GVI suggests that it possessed the unsold timeshare units, and\nthus that the property was not part of the Fairway estate. This\nallegation is at odds with the fact that GVI brought an eviction\naction, which is \"[a]n action for the recovery of the possession of\nthe premises.\" V.I. Code Ann. tit. 28, ยง 789(b). If GVI had been\nin actual possession of the unsold timeshare units, it would not\nhave needed to bring an action for their recovery. Whether GVI is\nultimately entitled to possession is not determinative of whether\nGVI was in actual possession of the unsold timeshare units at the\ntime that the eviction action was stayed.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fthat ยง 687c(b) gives a district court discretion over whether to\n\nretain jurisdiction over the property of an estate, it was not an\n\nabuse of discretion for the district court to have concluded that\n\njurisdiction was necessary to disentangle Fairway's assets.    See\n\nUnited States v. Royal Bus. Funds Corp., 29 B.R. 777, 779-80\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 1983) (\"[T]he purpose of the federal receivership was to\n\nprotect the assets pending the Small Business Administration's\n\nrecovery on its investment, as well as to permit discovery of any\n\npast abuses of program funds.\" (quoting United States v. Norwood\n\nCapital Corp., 273 F. Supp. 236, 240 (D. S.C. 1967))). In addition,\n\nthe district court was only determining the validity of GVI's claim\n\nto rights in the unsold timeshare units; as the Supreme Court\n\nstated in Princess Lida, \"an action in the federal court to\n\nestablish the validity or the amount of a claim constitutes no\n\ninterference with a state court's possession or control of a res.\"\n\n305 U.S. at 467; see also Bergeron, 777 F.2d at 799 (stating that\n\nColorado River abstention was inappropriate where \"claims against\n\nthe [res] appear to be unrelated to the administration of the\n\n[res]\"); Mattei v. V/O Prodintorg, 321 F.2d 180, 184 (1st Cir.\n\n1963) (\"[A] state court may properly adjudicate rights in property\n\nin the possession of a federal court and . . . the same procedure\n\nmay be followed by a federal court with respect to property in the\n\npossession of a state court.\").   Because of the district court's\n\n\"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the timeshare units, we conclude that\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fthe Territorial Court's quasi in rem jurisdiction over the units\n\ndoes not strongly favor abstention.\n\n            With respect to the second factor, we agree with the\n\ndistrict   court   that   the   federal   forum   was   not   inconvenient.\n\nAlthough GVI initially claimed the need to present witnesses and\n\nevidence, it later renounced that desire when it stated to the\n\ncourt that \"all of the issues that are before your Honor in any\n\nevent really are issues of law that are based upon the record that\n\nis before you, that are contained in our briefs.\"4              Even though\n\nRhode Island may be physically distant from the Virgin Islands, in\n\nthis era of electronic communications, legal arguments travel\n\nquickly.    Because there was no need to bring any witnesses or\n\npresent any evidence, GVI's claims of inconvenience carry little\n\nweight.    See Villa Marina Yacht Sales, 915 F.2d at 15 (noting that\n\nthe inconvenient forum factor is \"concerned with the physical\n\nproximity of the federal forum to the evidence and witnesses\").\n\n            The third factor requires the district court to determine\n\nwhether there is a risk that \"piecemeal litigation\" would result if\n\nthe case was held in a federal forum.         The district court found\n\nthat there was little risk of piecemeal litigation.           We agree.   The\n\n\n4\n   Indeed, we can discern no evidentiary disputes here; it appears\nthat the primary disagreements are over the contractual\nconstruction of the Stipulated Settlement, which is a matter of\nlaw. See U & W Indus. Supply, Inc. v. Martin Marietta Alumina,\nInc., 34 F.3d 180, 185 (3d Cir. 1994) (finding that \"[t]he\nconstruction of an unambiguous contract is a matter of law for the\ncourt\").\n\n                                   -16-\n\fconcern for piecemeal litigation does not arise simply when two\n\ncourts     might     exercise   parallel      jurisdiction;      \"in   considering\n\nwhether the concern for avoiding piecemeal litigation should play\n\na role in this case, the district court must look beyond the\n\nroutine inefficiency that is the inevitable result of parallel\n\nproceedings to determine whether there is some exceptional basis\n\nfor requiring the case to proceed entirely in [state] court.\"                    Id.\n\nat 16.     In Colorado River, the Supreme Court found an exceptional\n\nbasis where the federal statute that provided the cause of action\n\nhad a \"clear federal policy [of] . . . the avoidance of piecemeal\n\nadjudication.\"            424 U.S. at 819.        In the present case, the\n\njurisdictional statute at issue evinces a clear federal policy of\n\nresolving all disputes over Fairway's property in federal court.\n\nSee   15   U.S.C.     ยง    687c(b)   (noting    that   in    a   SBA   receivership\n\nproceeding,      a   court    may    \"take   exclusive      jurisdiction    of   the\n\nlicensee or licensees and the assets thereof, wherever located; and\n\nthe court shall have jurisdiction in any such proceeding to appoint\n\na trustee or receiver to hold or administer under the direction of\n\nthe court the assets so possessed\" (emphasis added)).\n\n             In addition, we have found that a risk of piecemeal\n\nlitigation arises when \"a ruling from the [state court] . . . would\n\nrender     our     opinion    merely    advisory.\"          Rivera-Feliciano      v.\n\nAcevedo-Vilรก, 438 F.3d 50, 62 (1st Cir. 2006).                     Here, there is\n\nlittle risk of that occurring:               regardless of the ruling of the\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fTerritorial Court, GVI would not be entitled to possession of the\n\nunsold timeshare units.             If the Territorial Court was to rule in\n\nthe eviction proceeding that Fairway was entitled to possession,\n\nthen    GVI    would   not    be    entitled      to    possession      of     the    unsold\n\ntimeshare units.        If the Territorial Court ruled in favor of GVI in\n\nthe    eviction      proceeding,     GVI     would     still     not    be    entitled      to\n\npossession of the unsold timeshare units because it has already re-\n\nleased the       property     to    HOTC.5        Thus,   a    later    ruling        by   the\n\nTerritorial Court would have no effect on the district court's\n\ndetermination that GVI is not entitled to possession of the unsold\n\ntimeshare units.        Accordingly, there is little risk of piecemeal\n\nlitigation.\n\n               As for the fourth factor, neither party disputes the fact\n\nthat the Territorial Court obtained jurisdiction over the unsold\n\ntimeshare units before the district court, and that this factor\n\nweighs in favor of abstention.\n\n               With regard to the fifth factor, the district court is\n\ncorrect       that   this    case    does    not       present    one    of     the    \"rare\n\ncircumstances [where] the presence of state-law issues may weigh in\n\nfavor of [the] surrender\" of federal jurisdiction.                           Moses H. Cone\n\nMem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 26 (1983).                               The\n\n\n\n5\n  GVI argues that a third possibility exists: that the Territorial\nCourt would rule the Stipulated Settlement unenforceable, and thus\nHOTC's leasehold interest would revert to GVI.       We find this\nargument implausible. See infra Part II.C.\n\n                                           -18-\n\fdistrict court found that the only issue involving Virgin Islands\n\nlaw was the interpretation of the Stipulated Settlement because, as\n\nwe explained before, the only way that GVI could obtain possession\n\nof the unsold timeshare units is if (a) it prevailed in the\n\neviction action and (b) the Stipulated Settlement was considered\n\nunenforceable.     The only argument based on Virgin Islands law that\n\nGVI   propounds   in   favor   of   finding   the   Stipulated   Settlement\n\nunenforceable is that the Stipulated Settlement violates V.I. Code\n\nAnn. tit. 31, ยง 205(c), which states that no lease of Government\n\nproperty exceeding one year shall be valid unless approved by the\n\nlegislature.6     In light of the statutory policy of giving federal\n\ncourts exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes over property\n\ninvolved in a SBA receivership proceeding, 15 U.S.C. ยง 687c(b), we\n\nconclude that it was within the discretion of the district court to\n\nfind that the presence of a single state law issue did not outweigh\n\nthe federal interests here.\n\n           As to the sixth factor, we do not agree with the district\n\ncourt that the Territorial Court would be inadequate to protect\n\nfederal interests simply because it is not a court constituted\n\n\n\n6\n   The district court was correct to conclude that any remaining\nquestions of contract construction under Virgin Islands law could\nbe resolved by reference to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.\nSee James v. Zurich-Amer. Ins. Co., 203 F.3d 250, 255 (3d Cir.\n2000) (\"All of the ALI Restatements of the Law (thus including the\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts . . .) have been adopted as\ndefinitive sources of rules of decision by the Virgin Islands\nLegislature.\").\n\n                                    -19-\n\funder Article III of the Constitution.               State and territorial\n\ncourts are normally competent to hear cases that involve federal\n\ninterests.    See, e.g., Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453\n\nU.S. 473, 479 (1981) (\"[T]he presumption of concurrent jurisdiction\n\ncan be rebutted by an explicit statutory directive, by unmistakable\n\nimplication from legislative history, or by a clear incompatibility\n\nbetween state-court jurisdiction and federal interests.\").                   The\n\nstatement in 15 U.S.C. ยง 687c(b) that a federal court \"may take\n\n. . . exclusive jurisdiction\" over the assets of a SBA receivership\n\nestate is not sufficient to establish an \"explicit statutory\n\ndirective\" to divest state courts of all jurisdiction over matters\n\ninvolving those assets, nor is there an \"unmistakable implication\n\nfrom legislative history\" to that effect.           See Gulf Offshore Co.,\n\n453 U.S. at 479.      Nor has the SBA Receiver argued that there is\n\nclear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and federal\n\ninterests.      See   id.     Thus,   the    Territorial   Court   would     not\n\nnecessarily have been an inadequate forum to hear GVI's possessory\n\nclaim.     However, the fact that the Territorial Court might be an\n\nadequate    forum   does    not   militate   in   favor   of   abstention;   we\n\nunderstand this factor to be important only when it disfavors\n\nabstention.     See Bethlehem Contracting Co. v. Lehrer/McGovern,\n\nInc., 800 F.2d 325, 328 (2d Cir. 1986).            In other words, because\n\n\"the possibility that the state court proceeding might adequately\n\nprotect the interests of the parties is not enough to justify the\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fdistrict court's deference to the state action,\" id., we find that\n\nthis factor is neutral.\n\n          The seventh factor is the \"vexatious or contrived nature\n\nof the federal claim.\"    The district court did not address this\n\nfactor directly.   However, we do not see any basis for an argument\n\nthat the receivership proceedings were \"vexatious\" or \"contrived.\"\n\n          Finally, the eighth factor is \"respect for the principles\n\nunderlying removal jurisdiction.\"      The district court did not make\n\nany finding as to this factor, but we believe that it does not\n\nfavor abstention. In Villa Marina Yacht Sales, we stated that this\n\nfactor was relevant if a plaintiff was attempting to evade the\n\npolicy in 28 U.S.C. ยง 1441 that only a defendant be able to remove\n\na lawsuit from state court to federal court.       915 F.2d at 14.   We\n\ndo not see how this factor is relevant in the present case, where\n\nGVI has evinced no desire to remove its eviction action from the\n\nTerritorial Court to federal court.\n\n          Thus, of the eight factors, only one factor favors\n\nabstention: that the Territorial Court obtained jurisdiction before\n\nthe district court did.   The remaining factors are either neutral\n\nor favor a federal forum.      Given that federal courts have a\n\n\"virtually   unflagging   obligation\"     to   exercise   jurisdiction,\n\nColorado River, 424 U.S. at 817, we do not believe that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in determining that this case\n\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fdid   not    present    the   \"exceptional\"   circumstances   required   for\n\nabstention.\n\n                       2. \"Odell Abstention\"\n\n             In Odell v. H. Batterman & Co., the Second Circuit held\n\nthat where a federal receiver had taken a tenant into receivership\n\n(because of financial problems), the receivership court should\n\nallow the tenant's landlord to pursue eviction proceedings in a\n\nparallel proceeding in state court.           223 F. at 299.    The Second\n\nCircuit held that \"[a] landlord has a right, which the court cannot\n\nproperly disregard, to have its claim to the possession of [its]\n\nproperty passed upon and determined, and, if found to be valid, it\n\nhas a right to be restored to the immediate possession of the\n\nproperty.\"      Id.     One might understand Odell to stand for the\n\nproposition that where a blanket stay of litigation would prohibit\n\na party from having its claim of possession adjudicated, a federal\n\ncourt may exercise its discretion to lift the stay as to that\n\nparty.      Thus, our review is for abuse of discretion.        See, e.g.,\n\nManhattan Rubber Mfg. Co. v. Lucey Mfg. Co., 5 F.2d 39, 41 (2d Cir.\n\n1925) (finding that Odell applied an abuse of discretion standard);\n\nsee also New Eng. Power and Marine, Inc. v. Town of Tyngsborough\n\n(In re Middlesex Power Equip. & Marine, Inc.), 292 F.3d 61, 69 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (noting that appellate courts review discretionary\n\nabstention decisions for abuse of discretion).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\f             Odell was decided in 1918, and has not been cited since\n\n1952.    We need not decide whether it should be resurrected because\n\nthere is a clear and significant difference between the facts of\n\nOdell and the situation here.            In Odell, the landlord seeking to\n\nregain possession of his property had no forum in which to pursue\n\na remedy; its state court action was stayed, and the federal court\n\ndid not provide an opportunity for resolution of its claims.                       223\n\nF. at 299.      GVI, however, has a federal forum for the resolution of\n\nits   claims:     the   district   court.         In   fact,   GVI    has   had    its\n\npossessory claim adjudicated.            Thus, even assuming that we would\n\nrecognize a doctrine of Odell abstention, we would find that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to abstain\n\nfrom hearing GVI's possessory claim.\n\n             B. Plenary Hearing\n\n             GVI argues that it was entitled to a plenary hearing on\n\nits equitable and monetary claims, and that the district court did\n\nnot provide it with one. The district court treated the Receiver's\n\nReport    and    Recommendation        much    like    a   summary    judgment:     it\n\ndetermined      that    there   were    no    material     disputes   of    fact   and\n\nresolved the questions of law.                 Cf. City Equities Anaheim v.\n\nLincoln Plaza Dev. Co. (In re City Equities Anaheim), 22 F.3d 954,\n\n958 (9th Cir. 1994) (\"Like many litigants, Lincoln sought to end a\n\nsuit based on the absence of any disputed material facts. In this\n\nrespect, its motion was akin to a motion for summary judgment.\").\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fSummary judgment is appropriate only when \"there is no genuine\n\nissue of material fact.\"     Vives v. Fajardo, 472 F.3d 19, 21 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).   We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.             Id.\n\n           GVI's claim that it was entitled to a plenary hearing\n\ncannot succeed because it fails to identify any disputed issues of\n\nfact.    This was ultimately the same position GVI took in the\n\ndistrict court.   The court ordered GVI to put all of its objections\n\n(both   factual   and   legal)   to   the   SBA    Receiver's   Report    and\n\nRecommendation in one single motion.              GVI failed to raise any\n\nissues of fact in this motion.        At the hearing on GVI's motion,\n\nwhen asked whether it had any additional evidence, GVI stated \"Not\n\nin addition to what's already been submitted.\"          Although GVI later\n\nasked for an evidentiary hearing on its equitable and monetary\n\nclaims, after the court denied the request, GVI retreated and\n\ninstead stated that \"what we're talking about here and now, your\n\nHonor, are issues of law.\"\n\n           In light of GVI's on-the-record position that there were\n\nno factual disputes, and in light of GVI's inability to now point\n\nto evidence that would establish a disputed issue of material fact,\n\nwe conclude that the district court did not err in approving the\n\nSBA Receiver's report and denying GVI an evidentiary hearing on its\n\nclaims. See United States v. Ianniello, 824 F.2d 203, 207 (2d Cir.\n\n1987) (finding no need for a plenary hearing where the court \"gave\n\ndefendants ample opportunity to rebut the government's case\").\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f          C. GVI's Equitable Claim for Possession\n\n          GVI argues that the court erred in denying its equitable\n\nclaim for possession of the unsold timeshare units.   Because there\n\nappear to be no disputed facts, we review the court's decision de\n\nnovo. See Villafaรฑe-Neriz v. FDIC, 75 F.3d 727, 730 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(\"As the essential facts are not in dispute, and all that is before\n\nus is a question of law, our review of the district court's\n\ndecision is de novo.\"); Hope Furnace Assocs. v. FDIC, 71 F.3d 39,\n\n42 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          We begin by assuming, as the district court appears to\n\nhave done, that GVI was entitled to terminate the Ground Lease with\n\nFairway and that this would give GVI possession of the unsold\n\ntimeshare units.      However, GVI has entered into the Stipulated\n\nSettlement with HOTC, which gives HOTC possession of the units.\n\nThus, if the Stipulated Settlement is valid and enforceable, HOTC,\n\nand not GVI, would be entitled to equitable possession of the\n\ntimeshare units.7     The district court found that the Stipulated\n\n\n7\n   GVI also raises an objection to consideration of the Stipulated\nSettlement under Federal Rule of Evidence 408. Rule 408 provides\nthat a settlement agreement may not be used to prove \"liability\nfor, invalidity of, or amount of a claim that was disputed as to\nvalidity or amount.\" Here, the Stipulated Settlement is not being\nused as evidence of liability on the part of GVI. To the contrary,\nwe have assumed for the purposes of argument that Fairway was\nliable and that GVI was entitled to terminate the Ground Lease.\nInstead, we use the Stipulated Settlement only to determine whether\nGVI has subsequently relet the unsold timeshare units to another\nparty, in which case GVI would no longer be entitled to possession\nof the premises. Thus, the district court's use of the Stipulated\nSettlement does not implicate Rule 408 concerns.\n\n                                 -25-\n\fSettlement    was    valid   and   enforceable,     and   thus    denied   GVI's\n\nequitable claim for possession.        We agree that GVI is not entitled\n\nto possession of the unsold timeshare units.\n\n            GVI raises two arguments against enforcing the Stipulated\n\nSettlement.      First, GVI argues that V.I. Code Ann. tit. 31, ยง 205\n\n(c)   requires      that   all   dispositions     of   government    property,\n\nincluding    each    individual    lease    and   subsequent     reletting,   be\n\napproved by the legislature of the Virgin Islands.               Section 205(c)\n\nstates, in relevant part:\n\n            [N]o sale, exchange, lease or sublease of\n            government real estate, nor any use permit of\n            the same for a term exceeding one year\n            (including the period of any allowable\n            extensions or renewals) nor sublease of\n            government real estate for a term exceeding\n            five years (including the period of any\n            allowable extensions or renewals) shall be\n            deemed binding upon the Government of the\n            United States Virgin Islands, unless and until\n            (1) such proposed sale or exchange or such\n            proposed lease or sublease shall have been\n            submitted to the Legislature, while in regular\n            or special session, (2) shall have been\n            approved by the Legislature.\n\nV.I. Code Ann. tit. 31, ยง 205(c).          Although there do not appear to\n\nbe any Virgin Islands law decisions that interpret Section 205(c),\n\nwe find GVI's proposed interpretation of the law to be highly\n\nimprobable.      First, neither of the prior amendments to the Ground\n\nLease appear to have received legislative approval.               In addition,\n\nV.I. Code Ann. tit. 3, ยง 218(a)(5) appears to give the Department\n\nof Property and Procurement of the Virgin Islands the power to\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\f\"manage rental properties owned or controlled by the Government,\n\nexcept as limited by Federal law, hotels, and housing development\n\nprograms or projects; and make inventory and establish forms and\n\nprocedures for the sale, rental, or disposition thereof.\"                 In\n\naddition, Article 8.03(b) of Amendment No. 2 to the Ground Lease,\n\nwhose validity is not in dispute, plainly states that in the event\n\nof a lessee's default, GVI may \"[e]ither cancel this Lease by\n\nnotice or without canceling this Lease, relet the Lease premises or\n\nany part thereof upon such terms and conditions as shall appear\n\nadvisable to [GVI].\"         Thus, while ยง 205(c) may require some\n\nauthorizing act for the disposition of government real estate, we\n\ndo not believe it requires the legislature to engage in the\n\nminutiae of defaults and relettings.               Because the legislature\n\nauthorized the initial lease of Protestant Cay in Act No. 1178\n\n(April   2,   1964),   we   conclude   that   no    additional   legislative\n\napproval was needed for the Stipulated Settlement, which relet the\n\npremises to HOTC.8\n\n\n\n\n8\n   To the extent that GVI claims that the Stipulated Settlement\nconstituted an entirely new lease, we agree with the district court\nthat, in the absence of contrary indication, contracts should be\nconstrued so as to be legal and enforceable. Restatement (Second)\nof Contracts, ยง 203(a) cmt. c. Thus, in accordance with this canon\nof contract construction, we construe the Stipulated Settlement to\nbe a valid and lawful reletting rather than an invalid and unlawful\nseparate lease. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that GVI\ncalls the Stipulated Settlement \"merely an attempt to mitigate\nGVI's damages,\" rather than a new contractual arrangement. See\nAppellant's Br. at 59.\n\n                                   -27-\n\f               GVI's second argument is that the SBA Receiver may not\n\nuse the Stipulated Settlement to deny GVI's equitable claim because\n\nFairway was neither a party to the agreement nor an intended\n\nbeneficiary of the agreement. Thus, GVI argues, the only party who\n\nmay use the Stipulated Settlement to deny GVI's claim is HOTC.                   The\n\ndistrict court found that \"the Receiver was appointed to receive\n\nthe claims of all creditors of the Fairway Estate and to recommend\n\nthe   disposition      of   those    claims.\"       Thus,   the    district   court\n\nconcluded that the SBA Receiver could use the Stipulated Settlement\n\nin determining whether GVI was entitled to possession of the unsold\n\ntimeshare units.\n\n               Section 687c(b) gives a court the power to put a Small\n\nBusiness Investment Company into receivership; \"the receiver is\n\ncharged with the responsibility for obtaining possession of the\n\nassets    of    the   corporation     prior   to    its   liquidation.\"       Small\n\nBusiness Administration v. Segal, 383 F. Supp. 198, 203 (D. Conn.\n\n1974).    Receivership is \"an attempt to provide equitable relief on\n\nthe road to some form of full and final relief.\"                       13 Moore's\n\nFederal    Practice     ยง   66.03.      Thus,      \"a   district    court   in   its\n\ndiscretionary supervision of an equitable receivership may deny\n\nremedies like rescission and restitution where the equities of the\n\nsituation suggest such a denial would be appropriate.\"                        United\n\nStates v. Vanguard Inv. Co., 6 F.3d 222, 227 (4th Cir. 1993).\n\nHere, the SBA Receiver was charged with collecting, disentangling,\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fand liquidating the assets of Fairway.              The SBA Receiver collected\n\nthe unsold timeshare units because Fairway was \"in possession\" of\n\nthem at the time the receivership proceedings were brought.                      GVI\n\nthen   submitted   a    equitable   claim      to    the   Receiver    because    it\n\nbelieved    that   it   was   entitled    to    possession      of    the   resort.\n\nHowever, the SBA Receiver was not limited to merely determining\n\nwhether GVI's claim to the unsold timeshare units was superior to\n\nthat   of   Fairway.     Rather,    the   SBA       Receiver   was    entitled    to\n\ndetermine, based on the evidence submitted, whether GVI had any\n\nequitable claim to possession of the unsold timeshare units. While\n\nFairway may or may not have been entitled to possession of the\n\nunsold timeshare units,9 it is clear from the Stipulated Settlement\n\nthat GVI was not entitled to possession of them.               Thus, neither the\n\nSBA Receiver nor the district court erred in concluding that, based\n\non the Stipulated Settlement, GVI's possessory claim to the unsold\n\ntimeshare units should be denied.\n\n            D. GVI's Monetary Claim\n\n            GVI also brought a monetary claim against the Fairway\n\nreceivership estate in the amount of $1,450,760.                      The district\n\ncourt granted $430,421.84 of the claim, denying the remainder. GVI\n\nargues that at a minimum, it was entitled to $489,552.09.                      This\n\n\n\n9\n   In this respect, HOTC also submitted a monetary, but not a\npossessory, claim to the Receiver.         Whether HOTC or the\nreceivership estate would prevail in a possessory claim is beyond\nthe scope of this opinion.\n\n                                     -29-\n\fdiscrepancy appears to be the result of a disagreement as to when\n\nPSC stopped managing the resort and HOTC took over.             GVI claims\n\nthat PSC stopped managing the resort on May 31, 1998, and thus it\n\nis entitled to rent until this date.         The district court, relying\n\non the findings of fact in Hotel on the Cay Time-Sharing Assoc. v.\n\nKilberg, 2000 WL 34019282 (D.R.I. 2000), found that PSC stopped\n\nmanaging the resort on May 31, 1997.           GVI seems to suggest that\n\nsome of the findings of fact in that case were erroneous.            However,\n\nGVI does not point to any evidence that it submitted which would\n\nsuggest that Kilberg got the date wrong, or that its date is the\n\ncorrect date.     Simply put, GVI cannot show, based on the record,\n\nwhat   was   wrong   with   the   district   court's   disposition    of   its\n\nmonetary claim.      Accordingly, we detect no error.\n\n                              III. Conclusion\n\n             For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f",

The SBA Receiver recommended that GVI's possessory claim be denied, and that its monetary claim be granted in part. GVI filed an objection, but the district court affirmed the Receiver's Report and Recommendation. GVI now appeals the court's disposition of its claims before the Receiver. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Before the Receivership Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Protestant Cay is an island in the Virgin Islands. In 1964, the Virgin Islands legislature approved Act 1179, which authorized GVI to negotiate a fifty-year lease for Protestant Cay. The same year, GVI leased the land on Protestant Cay to Hotel-On-The-Cay, Inc. for fifty years (the \"Ground Lease\"). In exchange for the lease, Hotel-On-The-Cay, Inc. agreed to pay rent to GVI, to construct a hotel, and to pay GVI a portion of the profits from the hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1969, GVI and Hotel-On-The-Cay, Inc. executed Amendment No. 1 to the Ground Lease to protect the rights of lenders who might hold a mortgage over the leasehold interest. No legislative approval was sought for the amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hotel-On-The-Cay, Inc. assigned its interest in the Ground Lease to Oliver Plunkett (\"Plunkett\"). In 1980, Plunkett filed a declaration in the Virgin Islands stating his intention to create 2,900 weekly timeshare units to be known as \"Hotel On The Cay Resort\" (the \"Resort\"). Plunkett had a fair bit of success, selling 1,500 of the units. However, by 1982, 1,400 units remained unsold, forcing Plunkett to declare bankruptcy. In 1986, the trustee in Plunkett's bankruptcy conveyed Plunkett's interest in the Ground Lease to Harborfront Properties, Inc. (\"Harborfront\") and Plunkett's interest in the unsold timeshare units to Protestant Cay, Ltd. (\"PCL\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, Legend Resorts L.P. (\"Legend\") and TSA Acquisition, Inc. (\"TSA\") agreed to acquire the unsold timeshare units from PCL. In order to finance the acquisition, Legend and TSA borrowed $1.7 million (the \"Legend Loan\") from Fairway Capital Corp. (\"Fairway\"), a Small Business Investment Company as defined in 15 U.S.C. &#167; 681. The Legend Loan was secured by a mortgage on the unsold timeshare units; Fairway was also made a 20% limited partner in Legend. In addition, Harborfront gave Fairway a mortgage on Harborfront's interest in the Ground Lease; Harborfront later assigned the Ground Lease to Fairway in 1991. Thus, as of 1991, Fairway held (a) a mortgage interest in the unsold timeshare units, (b) a mortgage interest in the Ground Lease, and (c) a 20% limited partnership interest in Legend. The same year, GVI and Legend entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Ground Lease, which provided in part that the lease would be subject to cancellation by the lessor if the lessee was in arrears for sixty days after notice of default. As with Amendment No. 1, this amendment was not separately approved by the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to service the Legend Loan, Fairway formed a subsidiary named Participation Services Corporation (\"PSC\") in 1994. Fairway assigned its interest in the Legend Loan to PSC the same year. Legend defaulted on the Legend Loan, and PSC foreclosed on the mortgages, naming Legend, TSA, Harborfront, and GVI in the foreclosure action. A stipulated judgment of foreclosure was entered on June 7, 1996. Thus, as of that date, PSC became the owner of (a) the leasehold interest in the Ground Lease and (b) the unsold time-share units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI then sent notice to Legend and Fairway that Legend was in arrears and that GVI would terminate the Ground Lease. Sixty days later, GVI filed an eviction action against Legend and Fairway in the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands (the \"eviction action\"). Neither Legend nor Fairway appeared, and the Territorial Court entered a default judgment on September 18, 1997. On December 31, 1997, PSC filed a motion to intervene and to set aside the default judgment in the eviction action. At the same time, a similar motion was filed by Hotel On the Cay Timeshare Association, Inc. (\"HOTC\"), an entity incorporated by the owners of the sold timeshare units. Both motions were granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 22, 1998, GVI and HOTC entered into a settlement agreement, which the parties refer to as the \"Stipulated Settlement.\" The Stipulated Settlement provided that in exchange for HOTC withdrawing its intervention in the eviction action, GVI would recognize HOTC as the lessee of the timeshare resort, including the unsold timeshare units. In addition, the Stipulated Settlement stated that HOTC would not be deemed a successor to Legend or Fairway. Finally, the parties agreed in the Stipulated Settlement that in the event that Legend and Fairway prevailed in the eviction action and their lease of the resort was reinstated, GVI would give credit to Legend and Fairway for all of HOTC's rent payments. After concluding the Stipulated Settlement with HOTC, GVI continued to prosecute its eviction action against Legend and Fairway in the Territorial Court, filing a motion for summary judgment on December 22, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 19, 2000, the SBA filed a complaint against Fairway in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The SBA's complaint asked that Fairway be placed in receivership because of Fairway's breach of various SBA regulations and its failure to pay amounts owed to the SBA. On March 13, 2000, the district court entered an order placing Fairway in receivership and imposing a stay on all litigation involving Fairway, including GVI's eviction action. At this time, the Territorial Court had not yet ruled on GVI's motion for summary judgment in the eviction action. Thus, as of March 13, 2000, PSC continued to hold an interest in the Ground Lease and the unsold timeshare units subject to the outcome of the stayed eviction proceedings. In March 2002, the district court ordered these interests transferred to the Fairway receivership estate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Receivership Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI filed two claims with the SBA Receiver: an equitable claim asking for immediate possession of the unsold timeshare units and a monetary claim asking for $1,450,760 for unpaid rent, taxes, unemployment insurance contributions, and associated costs, interest, and penalties. The Receiver recommended denying the equitable claim and granting the monetary claim to the extent of $430,421.84. The Receiver found that the remainder of GVI's monetary claim was either not supported by evidence that met requirements set forth in the \"Notice to Creditors,\" or that the claim covered time during which neither Fairway nor Legend were in possession of the resort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a preliminary hearing on the Receiver's Report, held on February 16, 2005, the district court stated the procedure for making objections:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any objectors should file their materials within 30 days as the order provides. The Receiver will have 30 days to respond. And then when I have that material, I will make a determination of whether I can decide those matters on the papers or whether a bench trial is necessary. And I will reserve decision on that until I see those papers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After GVI stated that it would raise the issue of abstention, the court responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think [GVI] should put forth all of its contentions in the objection, and then [the Receiver will] respond to it, and then I'll decide whether I'm going to have a hearing separately on that question of abstention or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI filed an objection to the Receiver's Report and Recommendation, suggesting that the court abstain from deciding whether GVI was in actual possession of the unsold timeshare units, and in the alternative, arguing that GVI was in actual possession of the unsold timeshare units, and thus would be entitled to judgment on its equitable claim. GVI's objection also stated that it was entitled to an additional $120,000 on its monetary claim, of which it identified approximately $59,000 as being undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing on the objection on July 12, 2005, the court asked GVI if it wanted to \"present any evidence, any testimonial evidence.\" GVI responded, \"Not in addition to what's already been submitted, your Honor, that's correct.\" GVI then proceeded to state that only its monetary claim was properly before the court because the district court lacked jurisdiction over its equitable claim for possession of the unsold timeshare units. The court responded, \"I thought everything was before the court. I have jurisdiction over the whole works.\" GVI then argued that the court lacked jurisdiction because the court had jurisdiction only over assets possessed by Fairway, and that Fairway did not possess the Resort. The court responded, \"That's a question I will have to decide, not the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands. I have exclusive jurisdiction of this matter. I've already ruled that. I denied the lifting of the stay.\" The court then explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have taken exclusive jurisdiction of this matter and any property that the Receiver claims that belongs to Fairway. And you want to contest that? Fine. That's what I'm here to hear. . . . I will make a decision as to whether the receiver owns those 1400 units of timeshares, not the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands. . . . Now, if you say its not before me today, then we'll put it before me at some later time, but I considered it before me today. I considered that I would hear arguments on those issues, all those issues today. And I'm prepared to take it under advisement and write a written opinion about this Court's jurisdiction, the question of abstention, the question of title, the question of forfeiture of the ground lease, the power of the governor to enter into a settlement stipulation which transferred title to the tenants association, all the issues in this case. I'm prepared to decide them all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">After a brief colloquy, GVI responded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]o the extent that you believe jurisdiction exists over a possession issue and claim, it's our understanding that we would have the opportunity to participate in a plenary hearing on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court answered, \"I thought it was before me now. The Receiver denied your equitable claim. So that matter is before me unless you're waiving it.\" Both GVI and the Receiver proceeded to make their arguments regarding jurisdiction, abstention, and the substantive question of whether or not GVI was in possession of the unsold timeshare units. After both parties made their arguments, GVI stated, \"The issue of whether there exists a timeshare interest that the receiver has title to is clearly one that's entitled to a plenary hearing, whether it's something that is effectively resolved in the territorial court or here.\" The court asked, \"What do you mean by that, plenary hearing?\" GVI answered:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Well, [the Receiver] take[s] the position that they actually have title in this mortgage leasehold interest, which we say doesn't exist anymore. So clearly there's a conflict there. To the extent that they claim this title exists, that's an issue that would have to be fully litigated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court responded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I gave you an opportunity to litigate it here today. You were advised that if you had any evidence to present on any of these issues, you present it today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">GVI then stated:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My understanding, and this was going to the last point, so maybe I misunderstood you earlier. In an earlier proceeding before your Honor, you indicated that there would be a full and fair opportunity to address the concerns of [GVI], you know, to the extent that evidence needs to be presented at a full hearing, and I was articulating earlier that [there are] logistical difficult[ies in bringing witnesses.] . . . I was under the impression that once you determined whether there was jurisdiction here, which you said you were going to make that determination, that we would be given the opportunity to have that hearing at another time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court responded, \"Well, your impression is wrong. I set aside two days to take testimony here starting today and tomorrow. . . . My order from the bench was clear that when I was going to hear this matter, I would hear any evidence you had to present on any of these issues.\" GVI then conceded that, \"what we're talking about here and now, your Honor, are issues of law. . . . [A]ll of the issues that are before your Honor in any event really are issues of law that are based upon the record that is before you, that are contained in our briefs.\" The court then stated, \"You had an opportunity to present any evidence you wanted to present today. You didn't choose to do so. So I'm taking this case under advisement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 8, 2006, the court issued a written decision affirming its jurisdiction over the unsold timeshare units and rejecting GVI's arguments for abstention, its equitable claim for possession, and its request for a higher monetary claim. The court then affirmed and accepted the Receiver's Report and Recommendation with respect to GVI's claims. GVI now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI makes four claims. First, GVI argues that the district court should have abstained from deciding whether GVI was entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units. Second, GVI suggests that the district court did not give it sufficient opportunity to present evidence in favor of its claims. Third, GVI argues that the district court wrongly concluded that it was not entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units. Fourth, GVI contends that the district court erroneously resolved its monetary claim. We take each claim in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Abstention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI argues that the Territorial Court was in a better position than the district court to hear its equitable claims for possession and that the district court should have abstained from hearing the case. GVI argues that two theories of abstention support this argument: the doctrine of abstention discussed in <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,</i> 424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976), and the doctrine of abstention referenced in <i>Odell v. H. Batterman Co.,</i> 223 F. 292 (2d Cir.1915).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">1. <i>Colorado River</i> Abstention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Colorado River,</i> the Supreme Court held that in certain circumstances, a court may abstain from hearing a case \"due to the presence of a concurrent state proceeding for reasons of wise judicial administration.\" 424 U.S. at 818, 96 S.Ct. 1236. We have emphasized that these circumstances are quite limited, and that there is a \"heavy presumption favoring the exercise of jurisdiction.\" <i>Villa Marina Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Hatteras Yachts,</i> 915 F.2d 7, 13 (1st Cir.1990). We consider eight factors in determining whether such limited circumstances exist:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) whether either court has assumed jurisdiction over a <i>res;</i> (2) the inconvenience of the federal forum; (3) the desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation; (4) the order in which the forums obtained jurisdiction; (5) whether state or federal law controls; (6) the adequacy of the state forum to protect the parties' interests; (7) the vexatious or contrived nature of the federal claim; and (8) respect for the principles underlying removal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>KPS &amp; Assocs. v. Designs by FMC, Inc.,</i> 318 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2003). These factors are not \"exhaustive, nor is any one factor necessarily determinative.\" <i>Id.</i> Where a district court has declined to exercise its discretion to abstain from hearing a case under <i>Colorado River</i> doctrine, we review for abuse of discretion. <i>R&#237;o Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc. v. Rull&#225;n,</i> 397 F.3d 56, 68 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first factor, the district court found that in the eviction action, the Territorial Court did not exercise in rem (or quasi in rem) jurisdiction over the unsold timeshare units. We disagree. A quasi in rem action requires that \"the court or its officer have possession or control of the property which is the subject of the suit in order to proceed with the cause and to grant the relief sought.\" <i>Penn Gen. Cas. Co. v. Pennsylvania,</i> 294 U.S. 189, 195, 55 S.Ct. 386, 79 L.Ed. 850 (1935). Here, the Territorial Court must have jurisdiction over the resort (including the unsold timeshare units) in order to adjudicate GVI's possessory claim. As such, it is only the parties' interests in the resort that serve as the basis of the Territorial Court's jurisdiction. <i>See Virgin Islands v. Legend Resorts, L.P.,</i> 39 V.I. 12, 14 (V.I.Terr.Ct.1998) (noting that the subject of GVI's eviction action was \"an interest related to the leasehold\"); <i>Schindel v. Pelican Beach Inc.,</i> 16 V.I. 237, 250 (V.I.Terr.Ct.1979) (describing a quasi in rem action as one that \"ha[s] the effect of adjudicating the parties' `rights to property'\"); <i>see also State Eng'r v. S. Fork Band of the Te-Moak Tribe of W. Shoshone Indians of Nev.,</i> 339 F.3d 804, 811 (9th Cir.2003) (\"But `it is the [parties'] interest[s] in the property that serve[] as the basis of the jurisdiction.' Therefore, the action is quasi in rem.\" (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1245 (6th ed.1990)). Because GVI brought the eviction action to adjudicate GVI's rights to the unsold timeshare units, <i>i.e.,</i> whether it was entitled to possession, the Territorial Court had \"jurisdiction over a res.\") <i>KPS &amp; Assocs.,</i> 318 F.3d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, a state court's quasi in rem jurisdiction does not make abstention mandatory. <i>See Bergeron v. Estate of Loeb,</i> 777 F.2d 792, 798 (1st Cir.1985) (\"Considering the <i>Colorado River</i> factors in turn, we do not think that the Nevada state district court's assumption of in rem jurisdiction over the trust res compels dismissal here.\"). Here, the importance of the Territorial Court's quasi in rem jurisdiction is diminished by the fact that 15 U.S.C. &#167; 687c(b) gives a district court \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the property of an SBA receivership estate. Because the eviction action had not proceeded to final judgment, the unsold timeshare units remained the property of the Fairway estate at the time that GVI made its claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While it may be true that &#167; 687c(b) gives a district court discretion over whether to retain jurisdiction over the property of an estate, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to have concluded that jurisdiction was necessary to disentangle Fairway's assets. <i>See United States v. Royal Bus. Funds Corp.,</i> 29 B.R. 777, 779-80 (S.D.N.Y.1983) (\"[T]he purpose of the federal receivership was to protect the assets pending the Small Business Administration's recovery on its investment, as well as to permit discovery of any past abuses of program funds.\" (quoting <i>United States v. Norwood Capital Corp.,</i> 273 F.Supp. 236, 240 (D.S.C.1967))). In addition, the district court was only determining the validity of GVI's claim to rights in the unsold timeshare units; as the Supreme Court stated in <i>Princess Lida,</i> \"an action in the federal court to establish the validity or the amount of a claim constitutes no interference with a state court's possession or control of a res.\" 305 U.S. at 467, 59 S.Ct. 275; <i>see also Bergeron,</i> 777 F.2d at 799 (stating that <i>Colorado River</i> abstention was inappropriate where \"claims against the [res] appear to be unrelated to the administration of the [res]\"); <i>Mattei v. V/O Prodintorg,</i> 321 F.2d 180, 184 (1st Cir.1963) (\"[A] state court may properly adjudicate rights in property in the possession of a federal court and . . . the same procedure may be followed by a federal court with respect to property in the possession of a state court.\"). Because of the district court's \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the timeshare units, we conclude that the Territorial Court's quasi in rem jurisdiction over the units does not strongly favor abstention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the second factor, we agree with the district court that the federal forum was not inconvenient. Although GVI initially claimed the need to present witnesses and evidence, it later renounced that desire when it stated to the court that \"all of the issues that are before your Honor in any event really are issues of law that are based upon the record that is before you, that are contained in our briefs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Even though Rhode Island may be physically distant from the Virgin Islands, in this era of electronic communications, legal arguments travel quickly. Because there was no need to bring any witnesses or present any evidence, GVI's claims of inconvenience carry little weight. <i>See Villa Marina Yacht Sales,</i> 915 F.2d at 15 (noting that the inconvenient forum factor is \"concerned with the physical proximity of the federal forum to the evidence and witnesses\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third factor requires the district court to determine whether there is a risk that \"piecemeal litigation\" would result if the case was held in a federal forum. The district court found that there was little risk of piecemeal litigation. We agree. The concern for piecemeal litigation does not arise simply when two courts might exercise parallel jurisdiction; \"in considering whether the concern for avoiding piecemeal litigation should play a role in this case, the district court must look beyond the routine inefficiency that is the inevitable result of parallel proceedings to determine whether there is some exceptional basis for requiring the case to proceed entirely in [state] court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 16. In <i>Colorado River,</i> the Supreme Court found an exceptional basis where the federal statute that provided the cause of action had a \"clear federal policy [of] . . . the avoidance of piecemeal adjudication.\" 424 U.S. at 819, 96 S.Ct. 1236. In the present case, the jurisdictional statute at issue evinces a clear federal policy of resolving all disputes over Fairway's property in federal court. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 687c(b) (noting that in a SBA receivership proceeding, a court may \"take <i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction of the licensee or licensees and the assets thereof, wherever located; and the court shall have jurisdiction in any such proceeding to appoint a trustee or receiver to hold or administer under the direction of the court the assets so possessed\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, we have found that a risk of piecemeal litigation arises when \"a ruling from the [state court] . . . would render our opinion merely advisory.\" <i>Rivera-Feliciano v. Acevedo-Vil&#225;,</i> 438 F.3d 50, 62 (1st Cir.2006). Here, there is little risk of that occurring: regardless of the ruling of the Territorial Court, GVI would not be entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units. If the Territorial Court was to rule in the eviction proceeding that Fairway was entitled to possession, then GVI would not be entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units. If the Territorial Court ruled in favor of GVI in the eviction proceeding, GVI would still not be entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units because it has already released the property to HOTC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, a later ruling by the Territorial Court would have no effect on the district court's determination that GVI is not entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units. Accordingly, there is little risk of piecemeal litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the fourth factor, neither party disputes the fact that the Territorial Court obtained jurisdiction over the unsold timeshare units before the district court, and that this factor weighs in favor of abstention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the fifth factor, the district court is correct that this case does not present one of the \"rare circumstances [where] the presence of state-law issues may weigh in favor of [the] surrender\" of federal jurisdiction. <i>Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,</i> 460 U.S. 1, 26, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). The district court found that the only issue involving Virgin Islands law was the interpretation of the Stipulated Settlement because, as we explained before, the only way that GVI could obtain possession of the unsold timeshare units is if (a) it prevailed in the eviction action and (b) the Stipulated Settlement was considered unenforceable. The only argument based on Virgin Islands law that GVI propounds in favor of finding the Stipulated Settlement unenforceable is that the Stipulated Settlement violates V.I.Code Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 205(c), which states that no lease of Government property exceeding one year shall be valid unless approved by the legislature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In light of the statutory policy of giving federal courts exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes over property involved in a SBA receivership proceeding, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 687c(b), we conclude that it was within the discretion of the district court to find that the presence of a single state law issue did not outweigh the federal interests here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the sixth factor, we do not agree with the district court that the Territorial Court would be inadequate to protect federal interests simply because it is not a court constituted under Article III of the Constitution. State and territorial courts are normally competent to hear cases that involve federal interests. <i>See, e.g., Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> 453 U.S. 473, 479, 101 S.Ct. 2870, 69 L.Ed.2d 784 (1981) (\"[T]he presumption of concurrent jurisdiction can be rebutted by an explicit statutory directive, by unmistakable implication from legislative history, or by a clear incompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal interests.\"). The statement in 15 U.S.C. &#167; 687c(b) that a federal court \"<i>may</i> take . . . exclusive jurisdiction\" over the assets of a SBA receivership estate is not sufficient to establish an \"explicit statutory directive\" to divest state courts of all jurisdiction over matters involving those assets, nor is there an \"unmistakable implication from legislative history\" to that effect. <i>See Gulf Offshore Co.,</i> 453 U.S. at 479, 101 S.Ct. 2870. Nor has the SBA Receiver argued that there is clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and federal interests. <i>See id.</i> Thus, the Territorial Court would not necessarily have been an inadequate forum to hear GVI's possessory claim. However, the fact that the Territorial Court might be an <i>adequate</i> forum does not militate in favor of abstention; we understand this factor to be important only when it disfavors abstention. <i>See Bethlehem Contracting</i> <i>Co. v. Lehrer/McGovern, Inc.,</i> 800 F.2d 325, 328 (2d Cir.1986). In other words, because \"the possibility that the state court proceeding might adequately protect the interests of the parties is not enough to justify the district court's deference to the state action,\" <i>id.,</i> we find that this factor is neutral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The seventh factor is the \"vexatious or contrived nature of the federal claim.\" The district court did not address this factor directly. However, we do not see any basis for an argument that the receivership proceedings were \"vexatious\" or \"contrived.\" Finally, the eighth factor is \"respect for the principles underlying removal jurisdiction.\" The district court did not make any finding as to this factor, but we believe that it does not favor abstention. In <i>Villa Marina Yacht Sales,</i> we stated that this factor was relevant if a plaintiff was attempting to evade the policy in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441 that only a defendant be able to remove a lawsuit from state court to federal court. 915 F.2d at 14. We do not see how this factor is relevant in the present case, where GVI has evinced no desire to remove its eviction action from the Territorial Court to federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, of the eight factors, only one factor favors abstention: that the Territorial Court obtained jurisdiction before the district court did. The remaining factors are either neutral or favor a federal forum. Given that federal courts have a \"virtually unflagging obligation\" to exercise jurisdiction, <i>Colorado River,</i> 424 U.S. at 817, 96 S.Ct. 1236, we do not believe that the district court abused its discretion in determining that this case did not present the \"exceptional\" circumstances required for abstention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. \"<i>Odell</i> Abstention\"</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Odell v. H. Batterman &amp; Co.,</i> the Second Circuit held that where a federal receiver had taken a tenant into receivership (because of financial problems), the receivership court should allow the tenant's landlord to pursue eviction proceedings in a parallel proceeding in state court. 223 F. at 299. The Second Circuit held that \"[a] landlord has a right, which the court cannot properly disregard, to have its claim to the possession of [its] property passed upon and determined, and, if found to be valid, it has a right to be restored to the immediate possession of the property.\" <i>Id.</i> One might understand <i>Odell</i> to stand for the proposition that where a blanket stay of litigation would prohibit a party from having its claim of possession adjudicated, a federal court may exercise its discretion to lift the stay as to that party. Thus, our review is for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., Manhattan Rubber Mfg. Co. v. Lucey Mfg. Co.,</i> 5 F.2d 39, 41 (2d Cir.1925) (finding that <i>Odell</i> applied an abuse of discretion standard); <i>see also New Eng. Power and Marine, Inc. v. Town of Tyngsborough</i> (<i>In re Middlesex Power Equip. &amp; Marine, Inc.</i>), 292 F.3d 61, 69 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that appellate courts review discretionary abstention decisions for abuse of discretion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Odell</i> was decided in 1915, and has not been cited since 1952. We need not decide whether it should be resurrected because there is a clear and significant difference between the facts of <i>Odell</i> and the situation here. In <i>Odell,</i> the landlord seeking to regain possession of his property had no forum in which to pursue a remedy; its state court action was stayed, and the federal court did not provide an opportunity for resolution of its claims. 223 F. at 299. GVI, however, has a federal forum for the resolution of its claims: the district court. In fact, GVI has had its possessory claim adjudicated. Thus, even assuming that we would recognize a doctrine of <i>Odell</i> abstention, we would find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to abstain from hearing GVI's possessory claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Plenary Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI argues that it was entitled to a plenary hearing on its equitable and monetary claims, and that the district court did not provide it with one. The district court treated the Receiver's Report and Recommendation much like a summary judgment: it determined that there were no material disputes of fact and resolved the questions of law. <i>Cf. City Equities Anaheim v. Lincoln Plaza Dev. Co. (In re City Equities Anaheim,</i>) 22 F.3d 954, 958 (9th Cir.1994) (\"Like many litigants, Lincoln sought to end a suit based on the absence of any disputed material facts. In this respect, its motion was akin to a motion for summary judgment.\"). Summary judgment is appropriate only when \"there is no genuine issue of material fact.\" <i>Vives v. Fajardo,</i> 472 F.3d 19, 21 (1st Cir.2007). We review a grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI's claim that it was entitled to a plenary hearing cannot succeed because it fails to identify any disputed issues of fact. This was ultimately the same position GVI took in the district court. The court ordered GVI to put all of its objections (both factual and legal) to the SBA Receiver's Report and Recommendation in one single motion. GVI failed to raise any issues of fact in this motion. At the hearing on GVI's motion, when asked whether it had any additional evidence, GVI stated \"Not in addition to what's already been submitted.\" Although GVI later asked for an evidentiary hearing on its equitable and monetary claims, after the court denied the request, GVI retreated and instead stated that \"what we're talking about here and now, your Honor, are issues of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of GVI's on-the-record position that there were no factual disputes, and in light of GVI's inability to now point to evidence that would establish a disputed issue of material fact, we conclude that the district court did not err in approving the SBA Receiver's report and denying GVI an evidentiary hearing on its claims. <i>See United States v. Ianniello,</i> 824 F.2d 203, 207 (2d Cir.1987) (finding no need for a plenary hearing where the court \"gave defendants ample opportunity to rebut the government's case\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. GVI's Equitable Claim for Possession</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI argues that the court erred in denying its equitable claim for possession of the unsold timeshare units. Because there appear to be no disputed facts, we review the court's decision <i>de novo. See Villafa&#241;e-Neriz v. FDIC,</i> 75 F.3d 727, 730 (1st Cir.1996) (\"As the essential facts are not in dispute, and all that is before us is a question of law, our review of the district court's decision is <i>de novo.</i>\"); <i>Hope Furnace Assocs. v. FDIC,</i> 71 F.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by assuming, as the district court appears to have done, that GVI was entitled to terminate the Ground Lease with Fairway and that this would give GVI possession of the unsold timeshare units. However, GVI has entered into the Stipulated Settlement with HOTC, which gives HOTC possession of the units. Thus, if the Stipulated Settlement is valid and enforceable, HOTC, and not GVI, would be entitled to equitable possession of the timeshare units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The district court found that the Stipulated Settlement was valid and enforceable, and thus denied GVI's equitable claim for possession. We agree that GVI is not entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI raises two arguments against enforcing the Stipulated Settlement. First, GVI argues that V.I.Code Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 205(c) requires that all dispositions of government property, including each individual lease and subsequent reletting, be approved by the legislature of the Virgin Islands. Section 205(c) states, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[N]o sale, exchange, lease or sublease of government real estate, nor any use permit of the same for a term exceeding one year (including the period of any allowable extensions or renewals) nor sublease of government real estate for a term exceeding five years (including the period of any allowable extensions or renewals) shall be deemed binding upon the Government of the United States Virgin Islands, unless and until (1) such proposed sale or exchange or such proposed lease or sublease shall have been submitted to the Legislature, while in regular or special session, (2) shall have been approved by the Legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V.I.Code Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 205(c). Although there do not appear to be any Virgin Islands law decisions that interpret Section 205(c), we find GVI's proposed interpretation of the law to be highly improbable. First, neither of the prior amendments to the Ground Lease appear to have received legislative approval. In addition, V.I.Code Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 218(a)(5) appears to give the Department of Property and Procurement of the Virgin Islands the power to \"manage rental properties owned or controlled by the Government, except as limited by Federal law, hotels, and housing development programs or projects; and make inventory and establish forms and procedures for the sale, rental, or disposition thereof.\" In addition, Article 8.03(b) of Amendment No. 2 to the Ground Lease, whose validity is not in dispute, plainly states that in the event of a lessee's default, GVI may \"[e]ither cancel this Lease by notice or without canceling this Lease, relet the Lease premises or any part thereof upon such terms and conditions as shall appear advisable to [GVI].\" Thus, while &#167; 205(c) may require some authorizing act for the disposition of government real estate, we do not believe it requires the legislature to engage in the minutiae of defaults and relettings. Because the legislature authorized the initial lease of Protestant Cay in Act No. 1178 (April 2, 1964), we conclude that no additional legislative approval was needed for the Stipulated Settlement, which relet the premises to HOTC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI's second argument is that the SBA Receiver may not use the Stipulated Settlement to deny GVI's equitable claim because Fairway was neither a party to the agreement nor an intended beneficiary of the agreement. Thus, GVI argues, the only party who may use the Stipulated Settlement to deny GVI's claim is HOTC. The district court found that \"the Receiver was appointed to receive the claims of all creditors of the Fairway Estate and to recommend the disposition of those claims.\" Thus, the district court concluded that the SBA Receiver could use the Stipulated Settlement in determining whether GVI was entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 687c(b) gives a court the power to put a Small Business Investment Company into receivership; \"the receiver is charged with the responsibility for obtaining possession of the assets of the corporation prior to its liquidation.\" <i>Small Business Administration v. Segal,</i> 383 F.Supp. 198, 203 (D.Conn.1974). Receivership is \"an attempt to provide equitable relief on the road to some form of full and final relief.\" 13 Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 66.03. Thus, \"a district court in its discretionary supervision of an equitable receivership may deny remedies like rescission and restitution where the equities of the situation suggest such a denial would be appropriate.\" <i>United States v. Vanguard Inv. Co.,</i> 6 F.3d 222, 227 (4th Cir. 1993). Here, the SBA Receiver was charged with collecting, disentangling, and liquidating the assets of Fairway. The SBA Receiver collected the unsold timeshare units because Fairway was \"in possession\" of them at the time the receivership proceedings were brought. GVI then submitted a equitable claim to the Receiver because it believed that it was entitled to possession of the resort. However, the SBA Receiver was not limited to merely determining whether GVI's claim to the unsold timeshare units was superior to that of Fairway. Rather, the SBA Receiver was entitled to determine, based on the evidence submitted, whether GVI had any equitable claim to possession of the unsold timeshare units. While Fairway may or may not have been entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> it is clear from the Stipulated Settlement that GVI was not entitled to possession of them. Thus, neither the SBA Receiver nor the district court erred in concluding that, based on the Stipulated Settlement, GVI's possessory claim to the unsold timeshare units should be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. GVI's Monetary Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI also brought a monetary claim against the Fairway receivership estate in the amount of $1,450,760. The district court granted $430,421.84 of the claim, denying the remainder. GVI argues that at a minimum, it was entitled to $489,552.09. This discrepancy appears to be the result of a disagreement as to when PSC stopped managing the resort and HOTC took over. GVI claims that PSC stopped managing the resort on May 31, 1998, and thus it is entitled to rent until this date. The district court, relying on the findings of fact in <i>Hotel on the Cay Time-Sharing Assoc. v. Kilberg,</i> 2000 WL 34019282 (D.R.I.2000), found that PSC stopped managing the resort on May 31, 1997. GVI seems to suggest that some of the findings of fact in that case were erroneous. However, GVI does not point to any evidence that it submitted which would suggest that <i>Kilberg</i> got the date wrong, or that its date is the correct date. Simply put, GVI cannot show, based on the record, what was wrong with the district court's disposition of its monetary claim. Accordingly, we detect no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> PSC and its successor Pantheon were found to be instruments and alter egos of Fairway<i>See Hotel on the Cay Time-Sharing Ass'n, Inc. v.

As such, assets owned by PSC and Pantheon were deemed to be assets of Fairway.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> GVI also proposes a third theory of abstention based on the holding in<i>Princess Lida of Thurn and Taxis v. Thompson,</i> 305 U.S. 456, 59 S.Ct. 275, 83 L.Ed. 285 (1939). <i>Princess Lida</i> held that \"if the two suits are in rem, or quasi in rem, so that the court, or its officer, has possession or must have control of the property which is the subject of the litigation in order to proceed with the cause and grant the relief sought the jurisdiction of the one court must yield to that of the other.\" 305 U.S. at 466, 59 S.Ct. 275. We have treated the issue of a state court's in rem or quasi in rem jurisdiction as the first factor to be considered in the <i>Colorado River</i> abstention analysis, and as such, it is unnecessary to address abstention under <i>Princess Lida</i> separately. <i>See Bergeron v. Estate of Loeb,</i> 777 F.2d 792, 799 (1st Cir.1985) (discussing application of <i>Princess Lida</i> doctrine in <i>Colorado River</i> context).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> GVI suggests that it possessed the unsold timeshare units, and thus that the property was not part of the Fairway estate. This allegation is at odds with the fact that GVI brought an eviction action, which is \"[a]n action for the recovery of the possession of the premises.\" V.I.Code Ann. tit. 28, &#167; 789(b). If GVI had been in actual possession of the unsold timeshare units, it would not have needed to bring an action for their recovery. Whether GVI is ultimately entitled to possession is not determinative of whether GVI was in actual possession of the unsold timeshare units at the time that the eviction action was stayed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Indeed, we can discern no evidentiary disputes here; it appears that the primary disagreements are over the contractual construction of the Stipulated Settlement, which is a matter of law<i>See U &amp; W Indus. Supply, Inc. v. Martin Marietta Alumina, Inc.,</i> 34 F.3d 180, 185 (3d Cir.1994) (finding that \"[t]he construction of an unambiguous contract is a matter of law for the court\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> GVI argues that a third possibility exists: that the Territorial Court would rule the Stipulated Settlement unenforceable, and thus HOTC's leasehold interest would revert to GVI. We find this argument implausible<i>See infra</i> Part II.C.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The district court was correct to conclude that any remaining questions of contract construction under Virgin Islands law could be resolved by reference to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts<i>See James v. Zurich-Amer. Ins. Co.,</i> 203 F.3d 250, 255 (3d Cir. 2000) (\"All of the ALI Restatements of the Law (thus including the Restatement (Second) of Contracts . . .) have been adopted as definitive sources of rules of decision by the Virgin Islands Legislature.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> GVI also raises an objection to consideration of the Stipulated Settlement under Federal Rule of Evidence 408. Rule 408 provides that a settlement agreement may not be used to prove \"liability for, invalidity of, or amount of a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount.\" Here, the Stipulated Settlement is not being used as evidence of liability on the part of GVI. To the contrary, we have assumed for the purposes of argument that Fairway was liable and that GVI was entitled to terminate the Ground Lease. Instead, we use the Stipulated Settlement only to determine whether GVI has subsequently relet the unsold timeshare units to another party, in which case GVI would no longer be entitled to possession of the premises. Thus, the district court's use of the Stipulated Settlement does not implicate Rule 408 concerns</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> To the extent that GVI claims that the Stipulated Settlement constituted an entirely new lease, we agree with the district court that, in the absence of contrary indication, contracts should be construed so as to be legal and enforceable. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#167; 203(a) cmt. c. Thus, in accordance with this canon of contract construction, we construe the Stipulated Settlement to be a valid and lawful reletting rather than an invalid and unlawful separate lease. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that GVI calls the Stipulated Settlement \"merely an attempt to mitigate GVI's damages,\" rather than a new contractual arrangement<i>See</i> Appellant's Br. at 59.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In this respect, HOTC also submitted a monetary, but not a possessory, claim to the Receiver.

The SBA Receiver recommended that GVI's possessory claim be denied, and that its monetary claim be granted in part. GVI filed an objection, but the district court affirmed the Receiver's Report and Recommendation. GVI now appeals the court's disposition of its claims before the Receiver. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Before the Receivership Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Protestant Cay is an island in the Virgin Islands. In 1964, the Virgin Islands legislature approved Act 1179, which authorized GVI to negotiate a fifty-year lease for Protestant Cay. The same year, GVI leased the land on Protestant Cay to Hotel-On-The-Cay, Inc. for fifty years (the \"Ground Lease\"). In exchange for the lease, Hotel-On-The-Cay, Inc. agreed to pay rent to GVI, to construct a hotel, and to pay GVI a portion of the profits from the hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1969, GVI and Hotel-On-The-Cay, Inc. executed Amendment No. 1 to the Ground Lease to protect the rights of lenders who might hold a mortgage over the leasehold interest. No legislative approval was sought for the amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hotel-On-The-Cay, Inc. assigned its interest in the Ground Lease to Oliver Plunkett (\"Plunkett\"). In 1980, Plunkett filed a declaration in the Virgin Islands stating his intention to create 2,900 weekly timeshare units to be known as \"Hotel On The Cay Resort\" (the \"Resort\"). Plunkett had a fair bit of success, selling 1,500 of the units. However, by 1982, 1,400 units remained unsold, forcing Plunkett to declare bankruptcy. In 1986, the trustee in Plunkett's bankruptcy conveyed Plunkett's interest in the Ground Lease to Harborfront Properties, Inc. (\"Harborfront\") and Plunkett's interest in the unsold timeshare units to Protestant Cay, Ltd. (\"PCL\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, Legend Resorts L.P. (\"Legend\") and TSA Acquisition, Inc. (\"TSA\") agreed to acquire the unsold timeshare units from PCL. In order to finance the acquisition, Legend and TSA borrowed $1.7 million (the \"Legend Loan\") from Fairway Capital Corp. (\"Fairway\"), a Small Business Investment Company as defined in 15 U.S.C. &#167; 681. The Legend Loan was secured by a mortgage on the unsold timeshare units; Fairway was also made a 20% limited partner in Legend. In addition, Harborfront gave Fairway a mortgage on Harborfront's interest in the Ground Lease; Harborfront later assigned the Ground Lease to Fairway in 1991. Thus, as of 1991, Fairway held (a) a mortgage interest in the unsold timeshare units, (b) a mortgage interest in the Ground Lease, and (c) a 20% limited partnership interest in Legend. The same year, GVI and Legend entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Ground Lease, which provided in part that the lease would be subject to cancellation by the lessor if the lessee was in arrears for sixty days after notice of default. As with Amendment No. 1, this amendment was not separately approved by the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to service the Legend Loan, Fairway formed a subsidiary named Participation Services Corporation (\"PSC\") in 1994. Fairway assigned its interest in the Legend Loan to PSC the same year. Legend defaulted on the Legend Loan, and PSC foreclosed on the mortgages, naming Legend, TSA, Harborfront, and GVI in the foreclosure action. A stipulated judgment of foreclosure was entered on June 7, 1996. Thus, as of that date, PSC became the owner of (a) the leasehold interest in the Ground Lease and (b) the unsold time-share units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI then sent notice to Legend and Fairway that Legend was in arrears and that GVI would terminate the Ground Lease. Sixty days later, GVI filed an eviction action against Legend and Fairway in the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands (the \"eviction action\"). Neither Legend nor Fairway appeared, and the Territorial Court entered a default judgment on September 18, 1997. On December 31, 1997, PSC filed a motion to intervene and to set aside the default judgment in the eviction action. At the same time, a similar motion was filed by Hotel On the Cay Timeshare Association, Inc. (\"HOTC\"), an entity incorporated by the owners of the sold timeshare units. Both motions were granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 22, 1998, GVI and HOTC entered into a settlement agreement, which the parties refer to as the \"Stipulated Settlement.\" The Stipulated Settlement provided that in exchange for HOTC withdrawing its intervention in the eviction action, GVI would recognize HOTC as the lessee of the timeshare resort, including the unsold timeshare units. In addition, the Stipulated Settlement stated that HOTC would not be deemed a successor to Legend or Fairway. Finally, the parties agreed in the Stipulated Settlement that in the event that Legend and Fairway prevailed in the eviction action and their lease of the resort was reinstated, GVI would give credit to Legend and Fairway for all of HOTC's rent payments. After concluding the Stipulated Settlement with HOTC, GVI continued to prosecute its eviction action against Legend and Fairway in the Territorial Court, filing a motion for summary judgment on December 22, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 19, 2000, the SBA filed a complaint against Fairway in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The SBA's complaint asked that Fairway be placed in receivership because of Fairway's breach of various SBA regulations and its failure to pay amounts owed to the SBA. On March 13, 2000, the district court entered an order placing Fairway in receivership and imposing a stay on all litigation involving Fairway, including GVI's eviction action. At this time, the Territorial Court had not yet ruled on GVI's motion for summary judgment in the eviction action. Thus, as of March 13, 2000, PSC continued to hold an interest in the Ground Lease and the unsold timeshare units subject to the outcome of the stayed eviction proceedings. In March 2002, the district court ordered these interests transferred to the Fairway receivership estate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Receivership Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI filed two claims with the SBA Receiver: an equitable claim asking for immediate possession of the unsold timeshare units and a monetary claim asking for $1,450,760 for unpaid rent, taxes, unemployment insurance contributions, and associated costs, interest, and penalties. The Receiver recommended denying the equitable claim and granting the monetary claim to the extent of $430,421.84. The Receiver found that the remainder of GVI's monetary claim was either not supported by evidence that met requirements set forth in the \"Notice to Creditors,\" or that the claim covered time during which neither Fairway nor Legend were in possession of the resort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a preliminary hearing on the Receiver's Report, held on February 16, 2005, the district court stated the procedure for making objections:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any objectors should file their materials within 30 days as the order provides. The Receiver will have 30 days to respond. And then when I have that material, I will make a determination of whether I can decide those matters on the papers or whether a bench trial is necessary.

GVI's objection also stated that it was entitled to an additional $120,000 on its monetary claim, of which it identified approximately $59,000 as being undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing on the objection on July 12, 2005, the court asked GVI if it wanted to \"present any evidence, any testimonial evidence.\" GVI responded, \"Not in addition to what's already been submitted, your Honor, that's correct.\" GVI then proceeded to state that only its monetary claim was properly before the court because the district court lacked jurisdiction over its equitable claim for possession of the unsold timeshare units. The court responded, \"I thought everything was before the court. I have jurisdiction over the whole works.\" GVI then argued that the court lacked jurisdiction because the court had jurisdiction only over assets possessed by Fairway, and that Fairway did not possess the Resort. The court responded, \"That's a question I will have to decide, not the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands. I have exclusive jurisdiction of this matter. I've already ruled that. I denied the lifting of the stay.\" The court then explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have taken exclusive jurisdiction of this matter and any property that the Receiver claims that belongs to Fairway. And you want to contest that? Fine. That's what I'm here to hear. . . . I will make a decision as to whether the receiver owns those 1400 units of timeshares, not the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands. . . . Now, if you say its not before me today, then we'll put it before me at some later time, but I considered it before me today. I considered that I would hear arguments on those issues, all those issues today. And I'm prepared to take it under advisement and write a written opinion about this Court's jurisdiction, the question of abstention, the question of title, the question of forfeiture of the ground lease, the power of the governor to enter into a settlement stipulation which transferred title to the tenants association, all the issues in this case. I'm prepared to decide them all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">After a brief colloquy, GVI responded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]o the extent that you believe jurisdiction exists over a possession issue and claim, it's our understanding that we would have the opportunity to participate in a plenary hearing on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court answered, \"I thought it was before me now. The Receiver denied your equitable claim. So that matter is before me unless you're waiving it.\" Both GVI and the Receiver proceeded to make their arguments regarding jurisdiction, abstention, and the substantive question of whether or not GVI was in possession of the unsold timeshare units. After both parties made their arguments, GVI stated, \"The issue of whether there exists a timeshare interest that the receiver has title to is clearly one that's entitled to a plenary hearing, whether it's something that is effectively resolved in the territorial court or here.\" The court asked, \"What do you mean by that, plenary hearing?\" GVI answered:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Well, [the Receiver] take[s] the position that they actually have title in this mortgage leasehold interest, which we say doesn't exist anymore. So clearly there's a conflict there. To the extent that they claim this title exists, that's an issue that would have to be fully litigated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court responded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I gave you an opportunity to litigate it here today. You were advised that if you had any evidence to present on any of these issues, you present it today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">GVI then stated:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My understanding, and this was going to the last point, so maybe I misunderstood you earlier. In an earlier proceeding before your Honor, you indicated that there would be a full and fair opportunity to address the concerns of [GVI], you know, to the extent that evidence needs to be presented at a full hearing, and I was articulating earlier that [there are] logistical difficult[ies in bringing witnesses.] . . . I was under the impression that once you determined whether there was jurisdiction here, which you said you were going to make that determination, that we would be given the opportunity to have that hearing at another time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court responded, \"Well, your impression is wrong. I set aside two days to take testimony here starting today and tomorrow. . . . My order from the bench was clear that when I was going to hear this matter, I would hear any evidence you had to present on any of these issues.\" GVI then conceded that, \"what we're talking about here and now, your Honor, are issues of law. . . . [A]ll of the issues that are before your Honor in any event really are issues of law that are based upon the record that is before you, that are contained in our briefs.\" The court then stated, \"You had an opportunity to present any evidence you wanted to present today.

First, GVI argues that the district court should have abstained from deciding whether GVI was entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units. Second, GVI suggests that the district court did not give it sufficient opportunity to present evidence in favor of its claims. Third, GVI argues that the district court wrongly concluded that it was not entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units. Fourth, GVI contends that the district court erroneously resolved its monetary claim. We take each claim in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Abstention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI argues that the Territorial Court was in a better position than the district court to hear its equitable claims for possession and that the district court should have abstained from hearing the case. GVI argues that two theories of abstention support this argument: the doctrine of abstention discussed in <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v.

We disagree. A quasi in rem action requires that \"the court or its officer have possession or control of the property which is the subject of the suit in order to proceed with the cause and to grant the relief sought.\" <i>Penn Gen. Cas. Co. v. Pennsylvania,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102380\"><a href=\"/opinion/102380/penn-central-casualty-co-v-pennsylvania-ex-rel-schnader/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span>, 195, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, the Territorial Court must have jurisdiction over the resort (including the unsold timeshare units) in order to adjudicate GVI's possessory claim. As such, it is only the parties' interests in the resort that serve as the basis of the Territorial Court's jurisdiction. <i>See Virgin Islands v.

Therefore, the action is quasi in rem.\" (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1245 (6th ed.1990)). Because GVI brought the eviction action to adjudicate GVI's rights to the unsold timeshare units, <i>i.e.,</i> whether it was entitled to possession, the Territorial Court had \"jurisdiction over a res.\") <i>KPS &amp; Assocs.,</i> 318 F.3d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, a state court's quasi in rem jurisdiction does not make abstention mandatory. <i>See Bergeron v.

Here, the importance of the Territorial Court's quasi in rem jurisdiction is diminished by the fact that 15 U.S.C. &#167; 687c(b) gives a district court \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the property of an SBA receivership estate. Because the eviction action had not proceeded to final judgment, the unsold timeshare units remained the property of the Fairway estate at the time that GVI made its claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While it may be true that &#167; 687c(b) gives a district court discretion over whether to retain jurisdiction over the property of an estate, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to have concluded that jurisdiction was necessary to disentangle Fairway's assets. <i>See United States v. Royal Bus. Funds Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1872358\"><a href=\"/opinion/1872358/united-states-v-royal-business-funds-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span>, 779-80 (S.D.N.Y.1983) (\"[T]he purpose of the federal receivership was to protect the assets pending the Small Business Administration's recovery on its investment, as well as to permit discovery of any past abuses of program funds.\" (quoting <i>United States v.

In addition, the district court was only determining the validity of GVI's claim to rights in the unsold timeshare units; as the Supreme Court stated in <i>Princess Lida,</i> \"an action in the federal court to establish the validity or the amount of a claim constitutes no interference with a state court's possession or control of a res.\" 305 U.S. at 467, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because of the district court's \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the timeshare units, we conclude that the Territorial Court's quasi in rem jurisdiction over the units does not strongly favor abstention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the second factor, we agree with the district court that the federal forum was not inconvenient. Although GVI initially claimed the need to present witnesses and evidence, it later renounced that desire when it stated to the court that \"all of the issues that are before your Honor in any event really are issues of law that are based upon the record that is before you, that are contained in our briefs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Even though Rhode Island may be physically distant from the Virgin Islands, in this era of electronic communications, legal arguments travel quickly. Because there was no need to bring any witnesses or present any evidence, GVI's claims of inconvenience carry little weight. <i>See Villa Marina Yacht Sales,</i> 915 F.2d at 15 (noting that the inconvenient forum factor is \"concerned with the physical proximity of the federal forum to the evidence and witnesses\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third factor requires the district court to determine whether there is a risk that \"piecemeal litigation\" would result if the case was held in a federal forum. The district court found that there was little risk of piecemeal litigation. We agree. The concern for piecemeal litigation does not arise simply when two courts might exercise parallel jurisdiction; \"in considering whether the concern for avoiding piecemeal litigation should play a role in this case, the district court must look beyond the routine inefficiency that is the inevitable result of parallel proceedings to determine whether there is some exceptional basis for requiring the case to proceed entirely in [state] court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 16. In <i>Colorado River,</i> the Supreme Court found an exceptional basis where the federal statute that provided the cause of action had a \"clear federal policy [of] . . . the avoidance of piecemeal adjudication.\" 424 U.S. at 819, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109405\"><a href=\"/opinion/109405/colorado-river-water-cons-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1236</span></a></span>. In the present case, the jurisdictional statute at issue evinces a clear federal policy of resolving all disputes over Fairway's property in federal court. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 687c(b) (noting that in a SBA receivership proceeding, a court may \"take <i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction of the licensee or licensees and the assets thereof, wherever located; and the court shall have jurisdiction in any such proceeding to appoint a trustee or receiver to hold or administer under the direction of the court the assets so possessed\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, we have found that a risk of piecemeal litigation arises when \"a ruling from the [state court] . . . would render our opinion merely advisory.\" <i>Rivera-Feliciano v. Acevedo-Vil&#225;,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202063\"><a href=\"/opinion/202063/rivera-feliciano-v-acevedo-vila/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.2006). Here, there is little risk of that occurring: regardless of the ruling of the Territorial Court, GVI would not be entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units. If the Territorial Court was to rule in the eviction proceeding that Fairway was entitled to possession, then GVI would not be entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units. If the Territorial Court ruled in favor of GVI in the eviction proceeding, GVI would still not be entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units because it has already released the property to HOTC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, a later ruling by the Territorial Court would have no effect on the district court's determination that GVI is not entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units. Accordingly, there is little risk of piecemeal litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the fourth factor, neither party disputes the fact that the Territorial Court obtained jurisdiction over the unsold timeshare units before the district court, and that this factor weighs in favor of abstention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the fifth factor, the district court is correct that this case does not present one of the \"rare circumstances [where] the presence of state-law issues may weigh in favor of [the] surrender\" of federal jurisdiction. <i>Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110873\"><a href=\"/opinion/110873/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-v-mercury-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110873\"><a href=\"/opinion/110873/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-v-mercury-constr-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span> (1983). The district court found that the only issue involving Virgin Islands law was the interpretation of the Stipulated Settlement because, as we explained before, the only way that GVI could obtain possession of the unsold timeshare units is if (a) it prevailed in the eviction action and (b) the Stipulated Settlement was considered unenforceable. The only argument based on Virgin Islands law that GVI propounds in favor of finding the Stipulated Settlement unenforceable is that the Stipulated Settlement violates V.I.Code Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 205(c), which states that no lease of Government property exceeding one year shall be valid unless approved by the legislature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In light of the statutory policy of giving federal courts exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes over property involved in a SBA receivership proceeding, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 687c(b), we conclude that it was within the discretion of the district court to find that the presence of a single state law issue did not outweigh the federal interests here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the sixth factor, we do not agree with the district court that the Territorial Court would be inadequate to protect federal interests simply because it is not a court constituted under Article III of the Constitution. State and territorial courts are normally competent to hear cases that involve federal interests. <i>See, e.g., Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110560\"><a href=\"/opinion/110560/gulf-offshore-co-v-mobil-oil-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 479, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110560\"><a href=\"/opinion/110560/gulf-offshore-co-v-mobil-oil-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span> (1981) (\"[T]he presumption of concurrent jurisdiction can be rebutted by an explicit statutory directive, by unmistakable implication from legislative history, or by a clear incompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal interests.\"). The statement in 15 U.S.C. &#167; 687c(b) that a federal court \"<i>may</i> take . . . exclusive jurisdiction\" over the assets of a SBA receivership estate is not sufficient to establish an \"explicit statutory directive\" to divest state courts of all jurisdiction over matters involving those assets, nor is there an \"unmistakable implication from legislative history\" to that effect. <i>See Gulf Offshore Co.,</i> 453 U.S. at 479, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110560\"><a href=\"/opinion/110560/gulf-offshore-co-v-mobil-oil-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2870</span></a></span>. Nor has the SBA Receiver argued that there is clear incompatibility between state court jurisdiction and federal interests. <i>See id.</i> Thus, the Territorial Court would not necessarily have been an inadequate forum to hear GVI's possessory claim. However, the fact that the Territorial Court might be an <i>adequate</i> forum does not militate in favor of abstention; we understand this factor to be important only when it disfavors abstention. <i>See Bethlehem Contracting</i> <i>Co. v. Lehrer/McGovern, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"475734\"><a href=\"/opinion/475734/bethlehem-contracting-company-a-corporation-of-the-commonwealth-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 328 (2d Cir.1986). In other words, because \"the possibility that the state court proceeding might adequately protect the interests of the parties is not enough to justify the district court's deference to the state action,\" <i>id.,</i> we find that this factor is neutral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The seventh factor is the \"vexatious or contrived nature of the federal claim.\" The district court did not address this factor directly. However, we do not see any basis for an argument that the receivership proceedings were \"vexatious\" or \"contrived.\" Finally, the eighth factor is \"respect for the principles underlying removal jurisdiction.\" The district court did not make any finding as to this factor, but we believe that it does not favor abstention. In <i>Villa Marina Yacht Sales,</i> we stated that this factor was relevant if a plaintiff was attempting to evade the policy in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441 that only a defendant be able to remove a lawsuit from state court to federal court. 915 F.2d at 14. We do not see how this factor is relevant in the present case, where GVI has evinced no desire to remove its eviction action from the Territorial Court to federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, of the eight factors, only one factor favors abstention: that the Territorial Court obtained jurisdiction before the district court did. The remaining factors are either neutral or favor a federal forum. Given that federal courts have a \"virtually unflagging obligation\" to exercise jurisdiction, <i>Colorado River,</i> 424 U.S. at 817, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109405\"><a href=\"/opinion/109405/colorado-river-water-cons-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1236</span></a></span>, we do not believe that the district court abused its discretion in determining that this case did not present the \"exceptional\" circumstances required for abstention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">2. \"<i>Odell</i> Abstention\"</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Odell v. H. Batterman &amp; Co.,</i> the Second Circuit held that where a federal receiver had taken a tenant into receivership (because of financial problems), the receivership court should allow the tenant's landlord to pursue eviction proceedings in a parallel proceeding in state court. 223 F. at 299. The Second Circuit held that \"[a] landlord has a right, which the court cannot properly disregard, to have its claim to the possession of [its] property passed upon and determined, and, if found to be valid, it has a right to be restored to the immediate possession of the property.\" <i>Id.</i> One might understand <i>Odell</i> to stand for the proposition that where a blanket stay of litigation would prohibit a party from having its claim of possession adjudicated, a federal court may exercise its discretion to lift the stay as to that party. Thus, our review is for abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., Manhattan Rubber Mfg. Co. v. Lucey Mfg.

We need not decide whether it should be resurrected because there is a clear and significant difference between the facts of <i>Odell</i> and the situation here. In <i>Odell,</i> the landlord seeking to regain possession of his property had no forum in which to pursue a remedy; its state court action was stayed, and the federal court did not provide an opportunity for resolution of its claims. 223 F. at 299. GVI, however, has a federal forum for the resolution of its claims: the district court. In fact, GVI has had its possessory claim adjudicated. Thus, even assuming that we would recognize a doctrine of <i>Odell</i> abstention, we would find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to abstain from hearing GVI's possessory claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

The district court treated the Receiver's Report and Recommendation much like a summary judgment: it determined that there were no material disputes of fact and resolved the questions of law. <i>Cf. City Equities Anaheim v. Lincoln Plaza Dev. Co.

This was ultimately the same position GVI took in the district court. The court ordered GVI to put all of its objections (both factual and legal) to the SBA Receiver's Report and Recommendation in one single motion. GVI failed to raise any issues of fact in this motion. At the hearing on GVI's motion, when asked whether it had any additional evidence, GVI stated \"Not in addition to what's already been submitted.\" Although GVI later asked for an evidentiary hearing on its equitable and monetary claims, after the court denied the request, GVI retreated and instead stated that \"what we're talking about here and now, your Honor, are issues of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of GVI's on-the-record position that there were no factual disputes, and in light of GVI's inability to now point to evidence that would establish a disputed issue of material fact, we conclude that the district court did not err in approving the SBA Receiver's report and denying GVI an evidentiary hearing on its claims. <i>See United States v.

Because there appear to be no disputed facts, we review the court's decision <i>de novo. See Villafa&#241;e-Neriz v.

However, GVI has entered into the Stipulated Settlement with HOTC, which gives HOTC possession of the units. Thus, if the Stipulated Settlement is valid and enforceable, HOTC, and not GVI, would be entitled to equitable possession of the timeshare units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The district court found that the Stipulated Settlement was valid and enforceable, and thus denied GVI's equitable claim for possession. We agree that GVI is not entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI raises two arguments against enforcing the Stipulated Settlement. First, GVI argues that V.I.Code Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 205(c) requires that all dispositions of government property, including each individual lease and subsequent reletting, be approved by the legislature of the Virgin Islands. Section 205(c) states, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[N]o sale, exchange, lease or sublease of government real estate, nor any use permit of the same for a term exceeding one year (including the period of any allowable extensions or renewals) nor sublease of government real estate for a term exceeding five years (including the period of any allowable extensions or renewals) shall be deemed binding upon the Government of the United States Virgin Islands, unless and until (1) such proposed sale or exchange or such proposed lease or sublease shall have been submitted to the Legislature, while in regular or special session, (2) shall have been approved by the Legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V.I.Code Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 205(c). Although there do not appear to be any Virgin Islands law decisions that interpret Section 205(c), we find GVI's proposed interpretation of the law to be highly improbable. First, neither of the prior amendments to the Ground Lease appear to have received legislative approval. In addition, V.I.Code Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 218(a)(5) appears to give the Department of Property and Procurement of the Virgin Islands the power to \"manage rental properties owned or controlled by the Government, except as limited by Federal law, hotels, and housing development programs or projects; and make inventory and establish forms and procedures for the sale, rental, or disposition thereof.\" In addition, Article 8.03(b) of Amendment No. 2 to the Ground Lease, whose validity is not in dispute, plainly states that in the event of a lessee's default, GVI may \"[e]ither cancel this Lease by notice or without canceling this Lease, relet the Lease premises or any part thereof upon such terms and conditions as shall appear advisable to [GVI].\" Thus, while &#167; 205(c) may require some authorizing act for the disposition of government real estate, we do not believe it requires the legislature to engage in the minutiae of defaults and relettings. Because the legislature authorized the initial lease of Protestant Cay in Act No. 1178 (April 2, 1964), we conclude that no additional legislative approval was needed for the Stipulated Settlement, which relet the premises to HOTC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI's second argument is that the SBA Receiver may not use the Stipulated Settlement to deny GVI's equitable claim because Fairway was neither a party to the agreement nor an intended beneficiary of the agreement. Thus, GVI argues, the only party who may use the Stipulated Settlement to deny GVI's claim is HOTC. The district court found that \"the Receiver was appointed to receive the claims of all creditors of the Fairway Estate and to recommend the disposition of those claims.\" Thus, the district court concluded that the SBA Receiver could use the Stipulated Settlement in determining whether GVI was entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 687c(b) gives a court the power to put a Small Business Investment Company into receivership; \"the receiver is charged with the responsibility for obtaining possession of the assets of the corporation prior to its liquidation.\" <i>Small Business Administration v. Segal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2245352\"><a href=\"/opinion/2245352/small-business-administration-v-segal/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span>, 203 (D.Conn.1974). Receivership is \"an attempt to provide equitable relief on the road to some form of full and final relief.\" 13 Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 66.03. Thus, \"a district court in its discretionary supervision of an equitable receivership may deny remedies like rescission and restitution where the equities of the situation suggest such a denial would be appropriate.\" <i>United States v. Vanguard Inv. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654215\"><a href=\"/opinion/654215/united-states-of-america-small-business-administration-truduax/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span>, 227 (4th Cir. 1993). Here, the SBA Receiver was charged with collecting, disentangling, and liquidating the assets of Fairway. The SBA Receiver collected the unsold timeshare units because Fairway was \"in possession\" of them at the time the receivership proceedings were brought. GVI then submitted a equitable claim to the Receiver because it believed that it was entitled to possession of the resort. However, the SBA Receiver was not limited to merely determining whether GVI's claim to the unsold timeshare units was superior to that of Fairway. Rather, the SBA Receiver was entitled to determine, based on the evidence submitted, whether GVI had any equitable claim to possession of the unsold timeshare units. While Fairway may or may not have been entitled to possession of the unsold timeshare units,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> it is clear from the Stipulated Settlement that GVI was not entitled to possession of them. Thus, neither the SBA Receiver nor the district court erred in concluding that, based on the Stipulated Settlement, GVI's possessory claim to the unsold timeshare units should be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. GVI's Monetary Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GVI also brought a monetary claim against the Fairway receivership estate in the amount of $1,450,760. The district court granted $430,421.84 of the claim, denying the remainder. GVI argues that at a minimum, it was entitled to $489,552.09. This discrepancy appears to be the result of a disagreement as to when PSC stopped managing the resort and HOTC took over. GVI claims that PSC stopped managing the resort on May 31, 1998, and thus it is entitled to rent until this date. The district court, relying on the findings of fact in <i>Hotel on the Cay Time-Sharing Assoc. v. Kilberg,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">34019282</span></span> (D.R.I.2000), found that PSC stopped managing the resort on May 31, 1997. GVI seems to suggest that some of the findings of fact in that case were erroneous. However, GVI does not point to any evidence that it submitted which would suggest that <i>Kilberg</i> got the date wrong, or that its date is the correct date. Simply put, GVI cannot show, based on the record, what was wrong with the district court's disposition of its monetary claim. Accordingly, we detect no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> PSC and its successor Pantheon were found to be instruments and alter egos of Fairway<i>See Hotel on the Cay Time-Sharing Ass'n, Inc. v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></span> (1939). <i>Princess Lida</i> held that \"if the two suits are in rem, or quasi in rem, so that the court, or its officer, has possession or must have control of the property which is the subject of the litigation in order to proceed with the cause and grant the relief sought the jurisdiction of the one court must yield to that of the other.\" 305 U.S. at 466, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></span>. We have treated the issue of a state court's in rem or quasi in rem jurisdiction as the first factor to be considered in the <i>Colorado River</i> abstention analysis, and as such, it is unnecessary to address abstention under <i>Princess Lida</i> separately. <i>See Bergeron v.

This allegation is at odds with the fact that GVI brought an eviction action, which is \"[a]n action for the recovery of the possession of the premises.\" V.I.Code Ann. tit. 28, &#167; 789(b). If GVI had been in actual possession of the unsold timeshare units, it would not have needed to bring an action for their recovery.

Rule 408 provides that a settlement agreement may not be used to prove \"liability for, invalidity of, or amount of a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount.\" Here, the Stipulated Settlement is not being used as evidence of liability on the part of GVI. To the contrary, we have assumed for the purposes of argument that Fairway was liable and that GVI was entitled to terminate the Ground Lease. Instead, we use the Stipulated Settlement only to determine whether GVI has subsequently relet the unsold timeshare units to another party, in which case GVI would no longer be entitled to possession of the premises. Thus, the district court's use of the Stipulated Settlement does not implicate Rule 408 concerns</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> To the extent that GVI claims that the Stipulated Settlement constituted an entirely new lease, we agree with the district court that, in the absence of contrary indication, contracts should be construed so as to be legal and enforceable. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#167; 203(a) cmt. c. Thus, in accordance with this canon of contract construction, we construe the Stipulated Settlement to be a valid and lawful reletting rather than an invalid and unlawful separate lease. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that GVI calls the Stipulated Settlement \"merely an attempt to mitigate GVI's damages,\" rather than a new contractual arrangement<i>See</i> Appellant's Br. at 59.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In this respect, HOTC also submitted a monetary, but not a possessory, claim to the Receiver.
