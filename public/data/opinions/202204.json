In this appeal, plaintiffs-\n\nappellants Sandra I. Orta-Castro (\"Orta\") and her husband, José A.\n\nNieves-Romero, contest the decision of the district court to grant\n\nsummary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Merck, Sharp &\n\nDohme, Química of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Merck\") in an employment\n\ndiscrimination case arising out of Orta's employment at Merck.            In\n\nparticular, plaintiffs-appellants argue that the district court\n\nshould not have dismissed their claims under the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., the Family\n\nMedical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq., and Puerto\n\nRico law.   After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                              I.     Background\n\n            Orta began her employment with Merck in Caguas, Puerto\n\nRico in December 1992.       A year later, on December 1, 1993, Orta\n\nbecame the Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOP\") Coordinator at the\n\ncompany and worked in the Quality Operations Department.             As SOP\n\nCoordinator,     Orta   worked      with    the   company's   pharmaceutical\n\nmanufacturing operation. Among her responsibilities, she oversaw\n\nthe standard operating procedures for the company, served as the\n\ncustodian   of   the    company's    regulations,     maintained   documents\n\nrelated to the manufacturing process, and worked with Merck's forms\n\nsystem.   Orta was the only employee assigned to the SOP unit.\n\n            In 2000, Orta worked under the supervision of Antonio\n\nNieves (\"Nieves\"), head of the Quality Operations Department.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fQuality Operations, in turn, was supervised by Operations Manager\n\nCarlos Montoyo (\"Montoyo\").           Toward the end of 2000, Montoyo\n\nsuspected   that   an    unannounced    audit   by     the    Food   and   Drug\n\nAdministration (\"FDA\") was imminent and was concerned with some\n\ndeficiencies that he had noticed in the SOP unit.             To address the\n\ndeficiencies and prepare the SOP unit for the FDA audit, Montoyo\n\nplaced Orta under the supervision of Validation Engineer Rosa M.\n\nLugo (\"Lugo\") on October 19, 2000. Montoyo's decision was based on\n\nhis belief that Lugo was good with systems and that she had the\n\nnecessary skills to analyze the unit's problems and get it in\n\nproper working order.      Montoyo gave Lugo express instructions to\n\naddress the deficiencies in the SOP unit to prepare it for the\n\neventuality of an FDA audit.\n\n            Orta and Lugo had a prior history at Merck.              They had\n\nfirst met back in 1992 when Orta began work at the company.                  In\n\nApril 2000, before Lugo became Orta's supervisor, they had an\n\nincident related to an FDA visit to the plant.           In preparation for\n\nthe visit, Orta had to update a procedure document in a binder\n\nlocated in Lugo's office.      Although Orta inserted the new document\n\nin the binder, she failed to remove the old one because it was\n\nmarked with a \"post it,\" and Orta believed that Lugo was reading\n\nit.    Lugo    told     Orta   that   the   document    was    her    (Orta's)\n\nresponsibility, and that she (Lugo) could not assume responsibility\n\nfor something that was not part of her job description.              Orta felt\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\funcomfortable with Lugo's comment and the way she said it with a\n\nraised tone. This incident was discussed with Nieves, who met with\n\nboth Orta and Lugo.           Although Orta said that she did not know why\n\nLugo was angry with her, she later stated that Lugo's anger may\n\nhave been caused by stress associated with the upcoming FDA visit.\n\nOrta stated that she did not know of any other reason that Lugo\n\nwould be mad at her.\n\n              A    few    days    before      Lugo    officially   became   Orta's\n\nsupervisor, Lugo asked Orta to produce various documents and\n\ninformation pertaining to the SOP unit.                 The information that Lugo\n\nrequested was under Orta's control.                The work associated with this\n\nrequest prompted Orta to talk with Montoyo.                Orta complained about\n\nthe work pressure she felt and about the fact that Lugo was\n\nconstantly changing her requests and not providing any additional\n\ntime to comply.          Orta also told Montoyo that Lugo's requests made\n\nher nervous and that she thought Lugo's behavior was related to the\n\nbinder incident.\n\n              As a consequence of the stress she felt, Orta went to\n\nvisit   the       infirmary      at   Merck   to     receive   medical   attention.\n\nFurthermore, in November 2000, Orta sought medical treatment from\n\na psychiatrist, Dr. Celia Rodríguez-Valdez (\"Dr. Rodríguez\"), who\n\ndiagnosed that Orta was suffering a major depression and should be\n\nout of work for three months.              As a result, Orta was on leave from\n\nNovember 2, 2000 to February 2, 2001.                Upon taking this leave, Orta\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fwas advised about benefits such as non-occupational temporary\n\ndisability insurance and long-term disability.\n\n          When Orta returned to work on February 2, 2001, she\n\ndiscovered that her office had been moved from the second floor to\n\nthe first.   Nieves, her former supervisor, told her that she had\n\nbeen moved to the first floor to be closer to Lugo, her supervisor,\n\nand because books and other work materials were on the first floor.\n\nOrta found her new work area uncomfortable mainly because of the\n\nsize of her desk.   However, the desk was soon changed, and Orta was\n\nmore comfortable.\n\n          On March 2, 2001, Lugo sent Orta an e-mail addressing a\n\nseries of tasks that she had failed to perform and requesting a\n\nmeeting to discuss the problem.        Orta explained to Lugo at the\n\nmeeting how, when she returned from her leave, the paperwork had\n\nbeen in disarray, that the person who substituted for her did not\n\ndo what was required of her, and that she (Orta) had to make up for\n\nwhat had not been done.   Before the meeting ended, Orta told Lugo\n\nthat she needed to go to the infirmary.      Lugo accompanied Orta to\n\nthe infirmary and waited for her until she came out.    Lugo and Orta\n\nthen met with Montoyo. During this meeting, Lugo restated what she\n\nhad discussed with Orta regarding her responsibilities.      Montoyo\n\nlistened and then asked Orta whether she had anything else to say.\n\nAt this point, Orta requested a private meeting with Montoyo.\n\nDuring her meeting alone with Montoyo, Orta indicated how nervous\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fshe was.   She said that many of Lugo's requirements were related to\n\nprevious years when she was not present, that the person who had\n\nsubstituted for her had not complied with some requirements, and\n\nthat she now had to make up for these oversights, in addition to\n\ncontinuing   with   her    daily    work.    According   to   Orta,      Montoyo\n\npromised her that he would help her by speaking with Lugo, told her\n\nnot to worry, and requested that she work as best she could.\n\n           On April 17, 2001, Orta took a second medical leave for\n\nmajor depression upon the advice of her doctor, Dr. Rodríguez.\n\nHowever, sometime between May and July 2001, Dr. Rodríguez moved to\n\nthe continental United States.        As a result, Orta had to find a new\n\ndoctor, and she began to be treated by Dr. Edgardo Prieto-Agostini\n\n(\"Dr. Prieto\").     On July 30, 2001, Dr. Prieto provided Merck with\n\na   certificate   stating    that    Orta   was   suffering   from   a   severe\n\ndepressive condition that prevented her at that time from doing\n\nwork and recommending that Orta's medical leave be extended until\n\nDecember 31, 2001.        This recommendation was accepted, and Orta's\n\nleave was extended.\n\n           Nevertheless, on November 1, 2001, Orta received a call\n\nfrom Merck's Human Resources Department informing her of a position\n\navailable in technical services for which she was qualified.               Orta\n\ninformed the Human Resources official who had called her that she\n\nwas on medical leave until December 31, 2001 and could not go to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthe company for anything.   Orta admitted that she was not bothered\n\nby this call.\n\n           On December 11, 2001, Dr. Prieto certified to Orta that\n\nshe could return to work at Merck in January 2002, if the following\n\naccommodations were provided: (1) she had to work only four hours\n\na day for the first two weeks; (2) she had to be relocated and be\n\nplaced outside the supervision of Lugo; and (3) she had to continue\n\nvisiting her psychiatrist every two weeks.   Orta sent Dr. Prieto's\n\ncertification along with a letter to Félix Amador, a Merck Plant\n\nManager.\n\n           Orta also discussed Dr. Prieto's recommendations with\n\nMarilyn Maldonado of the Human Resources Department and signed a\n\ndocument dated January 11, 2002 that was related to her request for\n\naccommodation. The document acknowledged Merck's acceptance of the\n\nrecommendations made by Dr. Prieto and the actions to be taken by\n\nMerck in order to comply with the recommendations.   Specifically,\n\nthe January 11, 2002 memo acknowledged:\n\n           a)    That   pursuant    to   Dr.    Prieto's\n           recommendations, Orta would return to work on\n           January 15, 2002, as an Administrative\n           Assistant in the Engineering Department, at\n           the same level and with the same salary rate.\n\n           b) That instead of reporting to Lugo, Orta\n           would report to Jesús Martínez, head of the\n           Engineering Department in Caguas; and\n\n           c) That Orta would enjoy a four-hour work\n           schedule, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, until\n           she returned to her regular eight-hour\n           schedule after January 29, 2002.\n\n                                -7-\n\f           To      implement   the    substantive     provisions      of   this\n\naccommodation, Orta was assigned to work in a trailer outside the\n\nMerck office facilities.        She, however, found the trailer dirty,\n\ndepressing, and isolating.         Such a working environment led her to\n\napply for other positions within the company.               For example, she\n\napplied   for      a   secretarial   position   in    the   Quality    Control\n\nDepartment.       She, however, was denied the position.        Orta alleges\n\nthat she was told by an unidentified Human Resources representative\n\n-- she does not recall the person's name -- that she was not given\n\nthe position because of her absenteeism.            However, there may have\n\nbeen another reason for her rejection: if Orta was given the\n\nposition, she would have had contact with Lugo, who was part of the\n\nQuality Control Department, and such a placement would have been\n\ncontrary to Dr. Prieto's express recommendation.\n\n           On May 1, 2002, as a direct consequence of an incident\n\ninside the trailer with the person who replaced her in the position\n\nof SOP Coordinator, Orta visited Dr. Lillian T. Serrano (\"Dr.\n\nSerrano\"),    a    psychiatrist.      She   could    not    visit   her    usual\n\npsychiatrist, Dr. Prieto, because Merck's medical plan had changed,\n\nand it no longer listed Dr. Prieto as an approved medical provider.\n\nDr. Serrano placed Orta on leave as of May 1, 2002, and Orta\n\nprovided Merck with a certificate from Dr. Serrano to this effect.\n\nDespite being under the care of Dr. Serrano at this time, Orta, on\n\nMay 7, 2002, visited Dr. Prieto at the insistence of her husband.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fAfter examining her, Dr. Prieto put Orta on medical leave until\n\nDecember 31, 2002.          This medical leave was later extended until\n\nApril 30, 2003. Certificates documenting this additional leave were\n\nalso provided to the company.1\n\n            As   of   May    2,    2003,   Orta   had   not   returned   to   her\n\nemployment with Merck.            On May 3, 2003, Orta received a letter\n\ndated May 2, 2003 from Abigail Pérez, Merck's Director of Human\n\nResources. The letter stated that because Orta had been absent for\n\na non-occupational illness since May 1, 2002 and because more than\n\nthe 365 days required by law for her employment to be reserved had\n\nelapsed, her employment with Merck was terminated.\n\n            On June 3, 2003, Orta and her husband filed an employment\n\ndiscrimination action against Merck.              They alleged, inter alia,\n\nviolations to Orta's rights under the ADA, the FMLA, and Puerto\n\nRico law.    After the parties engaged in discovery, Merck filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, which Orta and her husband opposed.\n\n            On April 25, 2005, the district court issued its Opinion\n\nand Order, in which it granted Merck's summary judgment motion.\n\nThe court then dismissed the plaintiffs' federal claims with\n\nprejudice and their commonwealth law claims without prejudice.\n\nOrta and her husband now appeal these rulings.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    According to Merck's records, Orta was on non-occupational\ntemporary disability leave from May 1, 2002 to May 1, 2003.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f                               II.   Discussion\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n            This Court reviews the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment de novo. See Vélez-Rivera v. Agosto-Alicea, 437 F.3d 145,\n\n150 (1st Cir. 2006); EEOC v. Unión Independiente de la Autoridad de\n\nAcueductos y Alcantarillados, 279 F.3d 49, 55 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nB. Sworn Statement Under Penalty of Perjury\n\n            Before   reaching    appellants'      federal    and   Puerto   Rico\n\nclaims, we must address a preliminary issue.              In assessing Merck's\n\nsummary judgment motion, the district court disregarded Orta's\n\nSworn    Statement   Under     Penalty    of    Perjury    (\"Statement\"),    an\n\naffidavit submitted in support of the appellants' opposition to\n\nsummary judgment.     The court disregarded the Statement because it\n\nwas in conflict with the answers Orta had given in her deposition\n\nand because the appellants had failed to provide \"a satisfactory\n\nexplanation for the subsequent change in her testimony.\"               For two\n\nreasons, the appellants now argue that the district court erred in\n\ndisregarding Orta's Statement.           First, they claim that the court\n\nfailed    specifically    to    enumerate      the   contradictions    in   her\n\ntestimony.    Second, they contend that Orta provided a \"wholly\n\nsatisfactory\" explanation for the change in testimony.\n\n            This Court \"review[s] the district court's decision as to\n\n'the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a motion\n\nfor summary judgment' only for 'a clear abuse of discretion.'\"\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fLennon v. Rubin, 166 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting EEOC v.\n\nGreen, 76 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n             With regard to the appellants' first ground for error, we\n\ncan   find   no    authority          whatsoever     for    the   proposition     that    a\n\ndistrict court must specifically enumerate the contradictions that\n\nlead it to disregard a given piece of evidence.                          Orta's second\n\nasserted ground is similarly baseless.                     The appellants claim that\n\nthey provided a satisfactory explanation for the change in Orta's\n\ntestimony -- namely, the fact that Orta was having trouble with her\n\nmemory, and after reviewing certain documents she was able to\n\nrecall events that she did not recall during her deposition.                            We,\n\nhowever, do not find this explanation to be satisfactory.                         Rather,\n\nwe believe that the district court was warranted in finding the\n\nexplanation to be an attempt to manufacture an issue of fact in\n\norder to survive summary judgment.                         See Colantuoni v. Alfred\n\nCalcagni     &    Sons,    44    F.3d    1,    4-5   (1st     Cir.    1994)    (\"When    an\n\ninterested       witness        has    given    clear       answers    to     unambiguous\n\nquestions, he cannot create a conflict and resist summary judgment\n\nwith an affidavit that is clearly contradictory, but does not give\n\na satisfactory explanation of why the testimony is changed.\").\n\n             Several factors lead us to this conclusion.                       First, the\n\nStatement was executed only after Merck had filed its motion for\n\nsummary judgment, thus suggesting that the Statement was made\n\nsolely to create an issue of fact for the purpose of surviving\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fsummary judgment.2     In both Colantuoni, 44 F.3d at 5, and Torres v.\n\nE.I. Dupont de Nemours & Co., 219 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2000), we\n\nfound such a chronology to be probative of the fact that the non-\n\nmovant was merely attempting to create an issue of fact.            Second,\n\nOrta's deposition was taken on two different occasions.            The first\n\nsession was on January 28, 2004 and the second session on April 7,\n\n2004.   At both sessions, she was accompanied by her attorneys.            At\n\nno point did they suggest that she was having trouble with her\n\nmemory.   See Colantuoni, 44 F.3d at 5 (noting that plaintiff's\n\nattorney \"was present at the deposition, and had the opportunity to\n\nclarify any incorrect impressions\").        Orta's memory problems seem\n\nto have developed only after Merck filed its summary judgment\n\nmotion. The district court could well find incredible this sudden,\n\nretroactive bout of amnesia.         We therefore accept the district\n\ncourt's   conclusion    that   Orta's   proffered    explanation    was   not\n\nsatisfactory and find here that the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in disregarding Orta's Statement.\n\nC.   ADA claims\n\n           We   now   turn   our   attention   to   the   more   substantive\n\narguments made by the appellants.          First, they argue that the\n\ndistrict court erred in dismissing their claims under the ADA\n\nbecause there were genuine disputes of material fact that precluded\n\n\n\n2\n   In fact, the Statement was executed on the same date that Orta\nfiled her opposition to Merck's motion for summary judgment.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fsummary judgment.       More specifically, the appellants state that\n\nthree   distinct    ADA    claims   were    dismissed       in   error:    1)     a\n\ndiscriminatory discharge claim; 2) a disability harassment claim;\n\nand 3) a \"failure to accommodate\" claim.          We address these in turn.\n\n           We first look at the discriminatory discharge claim. For\n\nthe appellants to establish a prima facie case of disability\n\ndiscrimination under the ADA, they were required to prove:\n\n           a) that Orta was \"disabled\" within the meaning\n           of the Act;\n\n           b) that Orta was able to perform, with or\n           without    reasonable   accommodation, the\n           essential functions of her job; and\n\n           c) that Orta was discharged or adversely\n           affected, in whole or in part, because of her\n           disability.\n\nSee Dichner v. Liberty Travel, 141 F.3d 24, 29-30 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nIn this case, there is no controversy that the appellants produced\n\nsufficient   evidence     to   satisfy   the    first    two   elements.        The\n\ndistrict   court,   however,     held    that   the     appellants   could      not\n\nestablish the third, and final, element -- namely, that Orta was\n\ndischarged or adversely affected, in whole or in part, because of\n\nher disability.     The court found that \"the uncontested material\n\nfacts demonstrate[d] that Merck's decision to terminate Orta from\n\nher employment was based on her failure to return from a leave of\n\nabsence for a non-occupational condition after the three hundred\n\nand sixty five (365) days period provided by law ended,\" and not on\n\nher disability.     The court specifically noted that the appellants\n\n                                    -13-\n\fdid not provide any evidence to establish that Orta's termination\n\nwas because of her disability.\n\n          On appeal, we find the same deficiency.    In their brief,\n\nthe appellants cite only to the information contained in Orta's\n\nStatement to demonstrate that Orta was discharged because of her\n\ndisability.   More specifically, they cite to Orta's comment in the\n\nStatement that her medical leave commenced on May 7, 2002 and was\n\nto last until May 7, 2003.     Such a comment, if accepted, might\n\ncreate a genuine factual controversy as to the reason Orta's\n\nemployment was terminated. On the one hand, there would be Merck's\n\nproffered explanation that Orta was fired because she had failed to\n\nreturn from leave as expected on May 2, 2003.     On the other hand,\n\nthere would be Orta's explanation -- namely, that her leave was\n\nsupposed to last until May 7, 2003 and that Merck, by ending her\n\nemployment prior to that date, fired her because of her disability.\n\n          As discussed above, however, we agree with the district\n\ncourt's decision to disregard Orta's Statement.    In the absence of\n\nany other evidence that Merck terminated Orta because of her\n\ndisability, we are compelled to agree with the district court that\n\nMerck's decision to terminate Orta from her employment was based on\n\nher failure to return to work by a particular date.    The district\n\ncourt correctly found that the appellants had failed to satisfy the\n\nthird element of their prima facie case.      Accordingly, summary\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fjudgment on the appellants' discriminatory discharge claim was\n\nproper.\n\n            Next, we turn to the appellants' disability harassment\n\nclaim.    On appeal, they argue that Orta was the victim of a hostile\n\nworking environment as a result of her disability.         This claim is\n\neasily disposed of, as we can find no evidence that it was raised\n\nbefore the district court.     This Court has long held that an issue\n\nnot raised in the district court cannot be raised for the first\n\ntime on appeal.    See Waterproofing Sys., Inc. v. Hydro-Stop, Inc.,\n\n440 F.3d 24, 31 n.2 (1st Cir. 2006);         Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins.\n\nCo., 433 F.3d 100, 105 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005); Roche v. John Hancock\n\nMut. Life Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 257 n.6 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Finally,   we    examine   the   appellants'     \"failure   to\n\naccommodate\" claim under the ADA.      As the district court correctly\n\nnoted, a \"failure to accommodate\" claim has a different set of\n\nrequirements    from   the   \"discriminatory    discharge\"    claim.    A\n\nplaintiff in a \"failure to accommodate\" case must:\n\n            a) furnish sufficient admissible evidence that\n            she   is  a   qualified   individual  with   a\n            disability within the meaning of the ADA;\n\n            b) establish that she worked for an employer\n            covered by the ADA;\n\n            c) demonstrate that the employer, despite its\n            knowledge of the employee's limitations, did\n            not accommodate those limitations; and\n\n            d) show that the employer's failure to\n            accommodate the known limitations affected the\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f          terms, conditions, or           privileges   of   the\n          plaintiff's employment.\n\nHiggins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).    Although Merck conceded that the appellants produced\n\nenough evidence to meet the first two elements, the district court\n\nfound that the appellants failed to establish either of the last\n\ntwo elements.    The court therefore held that summary judgment was\n\nproper on the appellants' \"failure to accommodate\" claim.\n\n          On    appeal,   the   appellants   acknowledge    the   district\n\ncourt's conclusion that Merck had \"reasonably accommodated\" Orta\n\nbecause the company had, for instance, provided her with a number\n\nof medical leaves.    They contend, however, that there were many\n\nways in which Merck did not properly accommodate Orta.                For\n\nexample, they assert that the company only complied in \"form\" and\n\nnot in \"substance\" with Dr. Prieto's December 2001 recommendations.\n\nWe, however, do not find this argument to be persuasive.              Dr.\n\nPrieto made three specific recommendations: 1) that Orta work for\n\nfour hours for the first two weeks upon returning from leave; 2)\n\nthat she have no contact with Lugo; and 3) that she be allowed to\n\nbe absent one afternoon every two weeks to see Dr. Prieto.            From\n\nour reading of the record, we believe Merck complied with these\n\nrecommendations to the letter, whether viewed from the perspective\n\nof either \"form\" or \"substance.\"       We fail to see how the factors\n\ncited by the appellants -- for example, that Orta was placed in a\n\ndirty and depressing trailer, that Orta was not given a job\n\n                                   -16-\n\fdescription for her new position, and that Orta was not supervised\n\n-- are at all relevant to whether Orta was in fact allowed to work\n\nonly four hours each day upon returning from leave, whether Merck\n\nremoved Orta from Lugo's supervision, or whether Orta was allowed\n\nto be absent an afternoon every two weeks to be able to see her\n\npsychiatrist.\n\n            The appellants also argue that the district court erred\n\nbecause it failed to consider several reasonable accommodations\n\nrequested by Orta between February 2001 and March 2002.                   First,\n\nthey point to the fact that in February 2001, Orta requested the\n\nrelocation of her office from the first to the second floor.                Even\n\nif this is true, we do not see how such an accommodation is related\n\nto Orta's claimed disability. See Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp.\n\nof N. Am., 377 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting that \"under the\n\nADA,   requests   for   accommodation    must   be   .   .   .   linked    to   a\n\ndisability\"). Second, the appellants cite to a number of instances\n\nin which Orta purportedly requested to be removed either from\n\nLugo's supervision or the trailer that she found depressing. Under\n\nthe ADA, requests for accommodation must be express, see id., and\n\nwe can find no evidence that Orta explicitly made either of these\n\nrequests.   The district court came to the same conclusion, noting\n\nthat Orta only made two requests: 1) a written request to have\n\nMerck implement Dr. Prieto's recommendations; and 2) a verbal\n\nrequest to have her desk changed because it was uncomfortable. See\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fReed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 261 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(\"[T]he ADA's reasonable accommodation requirement usually does not\n\napply unless 'triggered by a request' . . . .\") (quoting Henry\n\nPerrett, Jr., 1 Americans With Disabilities Act Handbook § 4.17, at\n\n121 (3d ed. 1997)).      Third, the appellants point to how Orta's\n\nrequest to be transferred to a secretarial position was denied.\n\nThe district court, however, fully considered this request for\n\naccommodation and concluded that Merck was fully within its rights\n\nto deny Orta the position, since \"in that position Orta would have\n\nhad contact with Lugo, in contravention of Dr. Prieto's very\n\nspecific recommendation that she not have any contact with her\n\nformer supervisor.\"\n\n           Finally,   the   appellants    argue    that     Merck   failed   to\n\nproperly   accommodate   Orta   because   the     company    terminated      her\n\nemployment while she was on medical leave.          There is, however, no\n\nevidence that Orta was terminated while she was on leave.            The only\n\nproof offered by the appellants demonstrating that Orta was on\n\nleave on May 2, 2003, the date of her termination, was Orta's\n\nStatement, which we (and the district court) have disregarded.\n\nThere is ample evidence, however, to support the proposition that\n\nby May 2, 2003, Orta's one-year leave had elapsed.              For example,\n\nthere are the sworn statements of Merck employees Giselle Olmo and\n\nAbigail Pérez, which state unequivocally that Orta's leave was to\n\nend on May 1, 2003.      Even more important is the district court's\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\ffinding that Orta herself had submitted a certificate from her\n\ndoctor stating that she was on leave beginning May 1, 2002.   This\n\ndemonstrates to us that Orta's one-year leave had indeed elapsed by\n\nMay 2, 2003 and that Merck, in releasing Orta on that date, did not\n\nterminate her while she was on medical leave.       Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court was correct in granting summary judgment on the\n\nappellants' \"failure to accommodate\" claim.\n\nD.   FMLA claim\n\n           The appellants' next argument is that the district court\n\nerred in granting summary judgment on their FMLA claim. More\n\nspecifically, they take issue with the district court's resolution\n\nof their claim that Orta was discriminated and retaliated against\n\nunder the FMLA because she was denied the position of secretary in\n\nthe Quality Control department due to her absences under the FMLA.\n\nThe district court found that the appellants had not proffered any\n\nsignificantly probative evidence to sustain their allegation that\n\nOrta was denied the position because of her absences.\n\n           We agree with the district court. As the court correctly\n\nstated, to establish their retaliation claim, the appellants were\n\nrequired to establish their prima facie case by showing that 1)\n\nOrta had availed herself of a protected right under the FMLA; 2)\n\nOrta was adversely affected by an employment decision; and 3) there\n\nwas a causal connection between the protected conduct and the\n\nadverse employment action.    Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 144\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fF.3d 151, 161 (1st Cir. 1998).    Only the third prong of this test\n\nis at issue in this appeal.\n\n          In the parties' briefs, there is some dispute about the\n\nprecise date that Orta applied for the position of secretary in the\n\nQuality Control department.   Merck claims that Orta only applied\n\nfor the position in January 2002, after Dr. Prieto had made his\n\nDecember 2001 recommendation that Orta should be placed outside\n\nLugo's supervision.   The company argues that Orta was not named to\n\nthe secretarial position because, as noted above, in that position\n\nshe would have had contact with Lugo, who at the time was a\n\nsupervisor in the Quality Control department.      The appellants,\n\nhowever, contend that Orta applied for the position not in January\n\n2002, but in March 2001.   They point out that, at that time, Lugo\n\nwas not a supervisor in the Quality Control department. Therefore,\n\nthere would have been no medically-related reason for not placing\n\nOrta in the secretarial position. They allege that the real reason\n\nthat Orta was denied the job was the earlier medical leaves she had\n\ntaken under the FMLA.      They came to this conclusion after an\n\nunidentified Human Resources representative (they do not recall the\n\nname of the person) told Orta that she was not given the position\n\nbecause of her absenteeism.\n\n          We find it unnecessary to resolve this dispute about the\n\ndate of Orta's application for the secretarial position, because\n\neven assuming that the appellants are correct and that Orta had\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fapplied for the secretarial position in March 2001, we would still\n\ncome to the conclusion that the appellants' FMLA retaliation claim\n\nfails.    Simply put, the appellants offer no proof that Orta's\n\nabsences were taken into account in denying her the secretarial\n\nposition.    The only evidence they offer to support their claim is\n\nthe comment by the unidentified Human Resources representative who\n\ntold Orta that she was not given the position because of her\n\nabsenteeism.    It is unclear, however, whether this statement was\n\nmade by someone with authority to make such a statement on behalf\n\nof the company, in which case it could be admissible as an\n\nadmission of a party-opponent under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2).                   As\n\nthere is no evidence in the record that the unknown employee had\n\nsuch authority in this case, the evidence is inadmissible hearsay.\n\n            Accordingly,    the    appellants      offer    no    significantly\n\nprobative   evidence   to   show   that    there    was    in    fact   a   causal\n\nconnection between Orta's FMLA leave and Merck's decision to deny\n\nher the position of secretary in the Quality Control department.\n\nWe therefore find that the district court was correct in dismissing\n\nthe appellants' claim under the FMLA.\n\nE.   Puerto Rico claims\n\n            The appellants' final argument relates to their state law\n\nclaims.   Since the district court dismissed all of the appellants'\n\nfederal causes of action, the court exercised its discretion under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) and declined to exercise supplemental\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fjurisdiction over the appellants' state law claims.                The court\n\ndismissed all of the appellants' state law claims without prejudice\n\nso that the appellants would be able, if they wished, to refile the\n\nstate claims in state court. On appeal, the appellants were hoping\n\nthat we would reverse the district court's decision to grant\n\nsummary    judgment   on   the   federal   claims   and   then   require   the\n\ndistrict    court   to   exercise   its    supplemental   jurisdiction     and\n\nreinstate the state law claims, thereby allowing for the efficient\n\nuse of judicial resources.\n\n            Since we have found that the district court properly\n\ndismissed    the    appellants'     federal    claims,    we     decline   the\n\nappellants' invitation to compel the district court to exercise its\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction.        See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) (providing\n\nthat federal district courts, in their discretion, may \"decline to\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection\n\n(a),\" e.g., a state law claim, if the court \"has dismissed all\n\nclaims over which it has original jurisdiction\").\n\n                             III.   Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons expressed herein, the decision of the\n\ndistrict court granting summary judgment on behalf of Merck is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\f",

Nieves-Romero, contest the decision of the district court to grant summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme, Qu&#237;mica of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Merck\") in an employment discrimination case arising out of Orta's employment at Merck. In particular, plaintiffs-appellants argue that the district court should not have dismissed their claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 <i>et seq.,</i> the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2601 <i>et seq.,</i> and Puerto Rico law. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orta began her employment with Merck in Caguas, Puerto Rico in December 1992. A year later, on December 1, 1993, Orta became the Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOP\") Coordinator at the company and worked in the Quality Operations Department. As SOP Coordinator, Orta worked with the company's pharmaceutical manufacturing operation. Among her responsibilities, she oversaw the standard operating procedures for the company, served as the custodian of the company's regulations, maintained documents related to the manufacturing process, and worked with Merck's forms system. Orta was the only employee assigned to the SOP unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, Orta worked under the supervision of Antonio Nieves (\"Nieves\"), head of the Quality Operations Department. Quality Operations, in turn, was supervised by Operations Manager Carlos Montoyo (\"Montoyo\"). Toward the end of 2000, Montoyo suspected that an unannounced audit by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") was imminent and was concerned with some deficiencies that he had noticed in the SOP unit. To address the deficiencies and prepare the SOP unit for the FDA audit, Montoyo placed Orta under the supervision of Validation Engineer Rosa M. Lugo (\"Lugo\") on October 19, 2000. Montoyo's decision was based on his belief that Lugo was good with systems and that she had the necessary skills to analyze the unit's problems and get it in proper working order. Montoyo gave Lugo express instructions to address the deficiencies in the SOP unit to prepare it for the eventuality of an FDA audit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orta and Lugo had a prior history at Merck. They had first met back in 1992 when Orta began work at the company. In April 2000, before Lugo became Orta's supervisor, they had an incident related to an FDA visit to the plant. In preparation for the visit, Orta had to update a procedure document in a binder located in Lugo's office. Although Orta inserted the new document in the binder, she failed to remove the old one because it was marked with a \"post it,\" and Orta believed that Lugo was reading it. Lugo told Orta that the document was her (Orta's) responsibility, and that she (Lugo) could not assume responsibility for something that was not part of her job description. Orta felt uncomfortable with Lugo's comment and the way she said it with a raised tone. This incident was discussed with Nieves, who met with both Orta and Lugo. Although Orta said that she did not know why Lugo was angry with her, she later stated that Lugo's anger may have been caused by stress associated with the upcoming FDA visit. Orta stated that she did not know of any other reason that Lugo would be mad at her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days before Lugo officially became Orta's supervisor, Lugo asked Orta to produce various documents and information pertaining to the SOP unit. The information that Lugo requested was under Orta's control. The work associated with this request prompted Orta to talk with Montoyo. Orta complained about the work pressure she felt and about the fact that Lugo was constantly changing her requests and not providing any additional time to comply. Orta also told Montoyo that Lugo's requests made her nervous and that she thought Lugo's behavior was related to the binder incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a consequence of the stress she felt, Orta went to visit the infirmary at Merck to receive medical attention. Furthermore, in November 2000, Orta sought medical treatment from a psychiatrist, Dr. Celia Rodr&#237;guez-Valdez (\"Dr. Rodr&#237;guez\"), who diagnosed that Orta was suffering a major depression and should be out of work for three months. As a result, Orta was on leave from November 2, 2000 to February 2, 2001. Upon taking this leave, Orta was advised about benefits such as non-occupational temporary disability insurance and long-term disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Orta returned to work on February 2, 2001, she discovered that her office had been moved from the second floor to the first. Nieves, her former supervisor, told her that she had been moved to the first floor to be closer to Lugo, her supervisor, and because books and other work materials were on the first floor. Orta found her new work area uncomfortable mainly because of the size of her desk. However, the desk was soon changed, and Orta was more comfortable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 2, 2001, Lugo sent Orta an e-mail addressing a series of tasks that she had failed to perform and requesting a meeting to discuss the problem. Orta explained to Lugo at the meeting how, when she returned from her leave, the paperwork had been in disarray, that the person who substituted for her did not do what was required of her, and that she (Orta) had to make up for what had not been done. Before the meeting ended, Orta told Lugo that she needed to go to the infirmary. Lugo accompanied Orta to the infirmary and waited for her until she came out. Lugo and Orta then met with Montoyo. During this meeting, Lugo restated what she had discussed with Orta regarding her responsibilities. Montoyo listened and then asked Orta whether she had anything else to say. At this point, Orta requested a private meeting with Montoyo. During her meeting alone with Montoyo, Orta indicated how nervous she was. She said that many of Lugo's requirements were related to previous years when she was not present, that the person who had substituted for her had not complied with some requirements, and that she now had to make up for these oversights, in addition to continuing with her daily work. According to Orta, Montoyo promised her that he would help her by speaking with Lugo, told her not to worry, and requested that she work as best she could.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 17, 2001, Orta took a second medical leave for major depression upon the advice of her doctor, Dr. Rodr&#237;guez. However, sometime between May and July 2001, Dr. Rodr&#237;guez moved to the continental United States. As a result, Orta had to find a new doctor, and she began to be treated by Dr. Edgardo Prieto-Agostini (\"Dr. Prieto\"). On July 30, 2001, Dr. Prieto provided Merck with a certificate stating that Orta was suffering from a severe depressive condition that prevented her at that time from doing work and recommending that Orta's medical leave be extended until December 31, 2001. This recommendation was accepted, and Orta's leave was extended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, on November 1, 2001, Orta received a call from Merck's Human Resources Department informing her of a position available in technical services for which she was qualified. Orta informed the Human Resources official who had called her that she was on medical leave until December 31, 2001 and could not go to the company for anything. Orta admitted that she was not bothered by this call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 2001, Dr. Prieto certified to Orta that she could return to work at Merck in January 2002, if the following accommodations were provided: (1) she had to work only four hours a day for the first two weeks; (2) she had to be relocated and be placed outside the supervision of Lugo; and (3) she had to continue visiting her psychiatrist every two weeks. Orta sent Dr. Prieto's certification along with a letter to F&#233;lix Amador, a Merck Plant Manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orta also discussed Dr. Prieto's recommendations with Marilyn Maldonado of the Human Resources Department and signed a document dated January 11, 2002 that was related to her request for accommodation. The document acknowledged Merck's acceptance of the recommendations made by Dr. Prieto and the actions to be taken by Merck in order to comply with the recommendations. Specifically, the January 11, 2002 memo acknowledged:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) That pursuant to Dr. Prieto's recommendations, Orta would return to work on January 15, 2002, as an Administrative Assistant in the Engineering Department, at the same level and with the same salary rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) That instead of reporting to Lugo, Orta would report to Jes&#250;s Mart&#237;nez, head of the Engineering Department in Caguas; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c) That Orta would enjoy a four-hour work schedule, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, until she returned to her regular eight-hour schedule after January 29, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To implement the substantive provisions of this accommodation, Orta was assigned to work in a trailer outside the Merck office facilities. She, however, found the trailer dirty, depressing, and isolating. Such a working environment led her to apply for other positions within the company. For example, she applied for a secretarial position in the Quality Control Department. She, however, was denied the position. Orta alleges that she was told by an unidentified Human Resources representative &#8212; she does not recall the person's name &#8212; that she was not given the position because of her absenteeism. However, there may have been another reason for her rejection: if Orta was given the position, she would have had contact with Lugo, who was part of the Quality Control Department, and such a placement would have been contrary to Dr. Prieto's express recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2002, as a direct consequence of an incident inside the trailer with the person who replaced her in the position of SOP Coordinator, Orta visited Dr. Lillian T. Serrano (\"Dr. Serrano\"), a psychiatrist. She could not visit her usual psychiatrist, Dr. Prieto, because Merck's medical plan had changed, and it no longer listed Dr. Prieto as an approved medical provider. Dr. Serrano placed Orta on leave as of May 1, 2002, and Orta provided Merck with a certificate from Dr. Serrano to this effect. Despite being under the care of Dr. Serrano at this time, Orta, on May 7, 2002, visited Dr. Prieto at the insistence of her husband. After examining her, Dr. Prieto put Orta on medical leave until December 31, 2002. This medical leave was later extended until April 30, 2003. Certificates documenting this additional leave were also provided to the company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As of May 2, 2003, Orta had not returned to her employment with Merck. On May 3, 2003, Orta received a letter dated May 2, 2003 from Abigail P&#233;rez, Merck's Director of Human Resources. The letter stated that because Orta had been absent for a non-occupational illness since May 1, 2002 and because more than the 365 days required by law for her employment to be reserved had elapsed, her employment with Merck was terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 3, 2003, Orta and her husband filed an employment discrimination action against Merck. They alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> violations to Orta's rights under the ADA, the FMLA, and Puerto Rico law. After the parties engaged in discovery, Merck filed a motion for summary judgment, which Orta and her husband opposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 25, 2005, the district court issued its Opinion and Order, in which it granted Merck's summary judgment motion. The court then dismissed the plaintiffs' federal claims with prejudice and their commonwealth law claims without prejudice. Orta and her husband now appeal these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court reviews the district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. See V&#233;lez-Rivera v. Agosto-Alicea,</i> 437 F.3d 145, 150 (1st Cir.2006); <i>EEOC v. Uni&#243;n Independiente de la Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados,</i> 279 F.3d 49, 55 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sworn Statement Under Penalty of Perjury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before reaching appellants' federal and Puerto Rico claims, we must address a preliminary issue. In assessing Merck's summary judgment motion, the district court disregarded Orta's Sworn Statement Under Penalty of Perjury (\"Statement\"), an affidavit submitted in support of the appellants' opposition to summary judgment. The court disregarded the Statement because it was in conflict with the answers Orta had given in her deposition and because the appellants had failed to provide \"a satisfactory explanation for the subsequent change in her testimony.\" For two reasons, the appellants now argue that the district court erred in disregarding Orta's Statement. First, they claim that the court failed specifically to enumerate the contradictions in her testimony. Second, they contend that Orta provided a \"wholly satisfactory\" explanation for the change in testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court \"review[s] the district court's decision as to `the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a motion for summary judgment' only for `a clear abuse of discretion.'\" <i>Lennon v. Rubin,</i> 166 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>EEOC v. Green,</i> 76 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir.1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the appellants' first ground for error, we can find no authority whatsoever for the proposition that a district court must specifically enumerate the contradictions that lead it to disregard a given piece of evidence. Orta's second asserted ground is similarly baseless. The appellants claim that they provided a satisfactory explanation for the change in Orta's testimony &#8212; namely, the fact that Orta was having trouble with her memory, and after reviewing certain documents she was able to recall events that she did not recall during her deposition. We, however, do not find this explanation to be satisfactory. Rather, we believe that the district court was warranted in finding the explanation to be an attempt to manufacture an issue of fact in order to survive summary judgment. <i>See Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni &amp; Sons,</i> 44 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1994) (\"When an interested witness has given clear answers to unambiguous questions, he cannot create a conflict and resist summary judgment with an affidavit that is clearly contradictory, but does not give a satisfactory explanation of why the testimony is changed.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several factors lead us to this conclusion. First, the Statement was executed only after Merck had filed its motion for summary judgment, thus suggesting that the Statement was made solely to create an issue of fact for the purpose of surviving summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In both <i>Colantuoni,</i> 44 F.3d at 5, and <i>Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 219 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir.2000), we found such a chronology to be probative of the fact that the non-movant was merely attempting to create an issue of fact. Second, Orta's deposition was taken on two different occasions. The first session was on January 28, 2004 and the second session on April 7, 2004. At both sessions, she was accompanied by her attorneys. At no point did they suggest that she was having trouble with her memory. <i>See Colantuoni,</i> 44 F.3d at 5 (noting that plaintiff's attorney \"was present at the deposition, and had the opportunity to clarify any incorrect impressions\"). Orta's memory problems seem to have developed only after Merck filed its summary judgment motion. The district court could well find incredible this sudden, retroactive bout of amnesia. We therefore accept the district court's conclusion that Orta's proffered explanation was not satisfactory and find here that the district court did not abuse its discretion in disregarding Orta's Statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. ADA claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn our attention to the more substantive arguments made by the appellants. First, they argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims under the ADA because there were genuine disputes of material fact that precluded summary judgment. More specifically, the appellants state that three distinct ADA claims were dismissed in error: 1) a discriminatory discharge claim; 2) a disability harassment claim; and 3) a \"failure to accommodate\" claim. We address these in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first look at the discriminatory discharge claim. For the appellants to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, they were required to prove:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) that Orta was \"disabled\" within the meaning of the Act;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) that Orta was able to perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential functions of her job; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c) that Orta was discharged or adversely affected, in whole or in part, because of her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>See Dichner v. Liberty Travel,</i> 141 F.3d 24, 29-30 (1st Cir.1998). In this case, there is no controversy that the appellants produced sufficient evidence to satisfy the first two elements. The district court, however, held that the appellants could not establish the third, and final, element &#8212; namely, that Orta was discharged or adversely affected, in whole or in part, because of her disability. The court found that \"the uncontested material facts demonstrate[d] that Merck's decision to terminate Orta from her employment was based on her failure to return from a leave of absence for a non-occupational condition after the three hundred and sixty five (365) days period provided by law ended,\" and not on her disability. The court specifically noted that the appellants did not provide any evidence to establish that Orta's termination was because of her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we find the same deficiency. In their brief, the appellants cite only to the information contained in Orta's Statement to demonstrate that Orta was discharged because of her disability. More specifically, they cite to Orta's comment in the Statement that her medical leave commenced on May 7, 2002 and was to last until May 7, 2003. Such a comment, if accepted, might create a genuine factual controversy as to the reason Orta's employment was terminated. On the one hand, there would be Merck's proffered explanation that Orta was fired because she had failed to return from leave as expected on May 2, 2003. On the other hand, there would be Orta's explanation &#8212; namely, that her leave was supposed to last until May 7, 2003 and that Merck, by ending her employment prior to that date, fired her because of her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, however, we agree with the district court's decision to disregard Orta's Statement. In the absence of any other evidence that Merck terminated Orta because of her disability, we are compelled to agree with the district court that Merck's decision to terminate Orta from her employment was based on her failure to return to work by a particular date. The district court correctly found that the appellants had failed to satisfy the third element of their prima facie case. Accordingly, summary judgment on the appellants' discriminatory discharge claim was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we turn to the appellants' disability harassment claim. On appeal, they argue that Orta was the victim of a hostile working environment as a result of her disability. This claim is easily disposed of, as we can find no evidence that it was raised before the district court. This Court has long held that an issue not raised in the district court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. <i>See Waterproofing Sys., Inc. v. Hydro-Stop, Inc.,</i> 440 F.3d 24, 31 n. 2 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 433 F.3d 100, 105 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 81 F.3d 249, 257 n. 6 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we examine the appellants' \"failure to accommodate\" claim under the ADA. As the district court correctly noted, a \"failure to accommodate\" claim has a different set of requirements from the \"discriminatory discharge\" claim. A plaintiff in a \"failure to accommodate\" case must:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) furnish sufficient admissible evidence that she is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) establish that she worked for an employer covered by the ADA;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c) demonstrate that the employer, despite its knowledge of the employee's limitations, did not accommodate those limitations; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d) show that the employer's failure to accommodate the known limitations affected the terms, conditions, or privileges of the plaintiff's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st Cir.1999). Although Merck conceded that the appellants produced enough evidence to meet the first two elements, the district court found that the appellants failed to establish either of the last two elements. The court therefore held that summary judgment was proper on the appellants' \"failure to accommodate\" claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the appellants acknowledge the district court's conclusion that Merck had \"reasonably accommodated\" Orta because the company had, for instance, provided her with a number of medical leaves. They contend, however, that there were many ways in which Merck did not properly accommodate Orta. For example, they assert that the company only complied in \"form\" and not in \"substance\" with Dr. Prieto's December 2001 recommendations. We, however, do not find this argument to be persuasive. Dr. Prieto made three specific recommendations: 1) that Orta work for four hours for the first two weeks upon returning from leave; 2) that she have no contact with Lugo; and 3) that she be allowed to be absent one afternoon every two weeks to see Dr. Prieto. From our reading of the record, we believe Merck complied with these recommendations to the letter, whether viewed from the perspective of either \"form\" or \"substance.\" We fail to see how the factors cited by the appellants &#8212; for example, that Orta was placed in a dirty and depressing trailer, that Orta was not given a job description for her new position, and that Orta was not supervised &#8212; are at all relevant to whether Orta was in fact allowed to work only four hours each day upon returning from leave, whether Merck removed Orta from Lugo's supervision, or whether Orta was allowed to be absent an afternoon every two weeks to be able to see her psychiatrist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants also argue that the district court erred because it failed to consider several reasonable accommodations requested by Orta between February 2001 and March 2002. First, they point to the fact that in February 2001, Orta requested the relocation of her office from the first to the second floor. Even if this is true, we do not see how such an accommodation is related to Orta's claimed disability. <i>See Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am.,</i> 377 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that \"under the ADA, requests for accommodation must be . . . linked to a disability\"). Second, the appellants cite to a number of instances in which Orta purportedly requested to be removed either from Lugo's supervision or the trailer that she found depressing. Under the ADA, requests for accommodation must be express, <i>see id.,</i> and we can find no evidence that Orta explicitly made either of these requests. The district court came to the same conclusion, noting that Orta only made two requests: 1) a written request to have Merck implement Dr. Prieto's recommendations; and 2) a verbal request to have her desk changed because it was uncomfortable. <i>See Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc.,</i> 244 F.3d 254, 261 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[T]he ADA's reasonable accommodation requirement usually does not apply unless `triggered by a request' . . . .\") (quoting Henry Perrett, Jr., 1 <i>Americans With Disabilities Act Handbook</i> &#167; 4.17, at 121 (3d ed.1997)). Third, the appellants point to how Orta's request to be transferred to a secretarial position was denied. The district court, however, fully considered this request for accommodation and concluded that Merck was fully within its rights to deny Orta the position, since \"in that position Orta would have had contact with Lugo, in contravention of Dr. Prieto's very specific recommendation that she not have any contact with her former supervisor.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the appellants argue that Merck failed to properly accommodate Orta because the company terminated her employment while she was on medical leave. There is, however, no evidence that Orta was terminated while she was on leave. The only proof offered by the appellants demonstrating that Orta was on leave on May 2, 2003, the date of her termination, was Orta's Statement, which we (and the district court) have disregarded. There is ample evidence, however, to support the proposition that by May 2, 2003, Orta's one-year leave had elapsed. For example, there are the sworn statements of Merck employees Giselle Olmo and Abigail P&#233;rez, which state unequivocally that Orta's leave was to end on May 1, 2003. Even more important is the district court's finding that Orta herself had submitted a certificate from her doctor stating that she was on leave beginning May 1, 2002. This demonstrates to us that Orta's one-year leave had indeed elapsed by May 2, 2003 and that Merck, in releasing Orta on that date, did not terminate her while she was on medical leave. Therefore, the district court was correct in granting summary judgment on the appellants' \"failure to accommodate\" claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. FMLA claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' next argument is that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their FMLA claim. More specifically, they take issue with the district court's resolution of their claim that Orta was discriminated and retaliated against under the FMLA because she was denied the position of secretary in the Quality Control department due to her absences under the FMLA. The district court found that the appellants had not proffered any significantly probative evidence to sustain their allegation that Orta was denied the position because of her absences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court. As the court correctly stated, to establish their retaliation claim, the appellants were required to establish their prima facie case by showing that 1) Orta had availed herself of a protected right under the FMLA; 2) Orta was adversely affected by an employment decision; and 3) there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action. <i>Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> 144 F.3d 151, 161 (1st Cir.1998). Only the third prong of this test is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the parties' briefs, there is some dispute about the precise date that Orta applied for the position of secretary in the Quality Control department. Merck claims that Orta only applied for the position in January 2002, after Dr. Prieto had made his December 2001 recommendation that Orta should be placed outside Lugo's supervision. The company argues that Orta was not named to the secretarial position because, as noted above, in that position she would have had contact with Lugo, who at the time was a supervisor in the Quality Control department. The appellants, however, contend that Orta applied for the position not in January 2002, but in March 2001. They point out that, at that time, Lugo was not a supervisor in the Quality Control department. Therefore, there would have been no medically-related reason for not placing Orta in the secretarial position. They allege that the real reason that Orta was denied the job was the earlier medical leaves she had taken under the FMLA. They came to this conclusion after an unidentified Human Resources representative (they do not recall the name of the person) told Orta that she was not given the position because of her absenteeism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find it unnecessary to resolve this dispute about the date of Orta's application for the secretarial position, because even assuming that the appellants are correct and that Orta had applied for the secretarial position in March 2001, we would still come to the conclusion that the appellants' FMLA retaliation claim fails. Simply put, the appellants offer no proof that Orta's absences were taken into account in denying her the secretarial position. The only evidence they offer to support their claim is the comment by the unidentified Human Resources representative who told Orta that she was not given the position because of her absenteeism. It is unclear, however, whether this statement was made by someone with authority to make such a statement on behalf of the company, in which case it could be admissible as an admission of a party-opponent under Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2). As there is no evidence in the record that the unknown employee had such authority in this case, the evidence is inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the appellants offer no significantly probative evidence to show that there was in fact a causal connection between Orta's FMLA leave and Merck's decision to deny her the position of secretary in the Quality Control department. We therefore find that the district court was correct in dismissing the appellants' claim under the FMLA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Puerto Rico claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' final argument relates to their state law claims. Since the district court dismissed all of the appellants' federal causes of action, the court exercised its discretion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3) and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the appellants' state law claims. The court dismissed all of the appellants' state law claims without prejudice so that the appellants would be able, if they wished, to refile the state claims in state court.

Orta-Castro (\"Orta\") and her husband, Jos&#233; A. Nieves-Romero, contest the decision of the district court to grant summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme, Qu&#237;mica of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Merck\") in an employment discrimination case arising out of Orta's employment at Merck. In particular, plaintiffs-appellants argue that the district court should not have dismissed their claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 <i>et seq.,</i> the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2601 <i>et seq.,</i> and Puerto Rico law. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orta began her employment with Merck in Caguas, Puerto Rico in December 1992. A year later, on December 1, 1993, Orta became the Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOP\") Coordinator at the company and worked in the Quality Operations Department. As SOP Coordinator, Orta worked with the company's pharmaceutical manufacturing operation. Among her responsibilities, she oversaw the standard operating procedures for the company, served as the custodian of the company's regulations, maintained documents related to the manufacturing process, and worked with Merck's forms system. Orta was the only employee assigned to the SOP unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, Orta worked under the supervision of Antonio Nieves (\"Nieves\"), head of the Quality Operations Department. Quality Operations, in turn, was supervised by Operations Manager Carlos Montoyo (\"Montoyo\"). Toward the end of 2000, Montoyo suspected that an unannounced audit by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") was imminent and was concerned with some deficiencies that he had noticed in the SOP unit. To address the deficiencies and prepare the SOP unit for the FDA audit, Montoyo placed Orta under the supervision of Validation Engineer Rosa M. Lugo (\"Lugo\") on October 19, 2000. Montoyo's decision was based on his belief that Lugo was good with systems and that she had the necessary skills to analyze the unit's problems and get it in proper working order. Montoyo gave Lugo express instructions to address the deficiencies in the SOP unit to prepare it for the eventuality of an FDA audit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orta and Lugo had a prior history at Merck. They had first met back in 1992 when Orta began work at the company. In April 2000, before Lugo became Orta's supervisor, they had an incident related to an FDA visit to the plant. In preparation for the visit, Orta had to update a procedure document in a binder located in Lugo's office. Although Orta inserted the new document in the binder, she failed to remove the old one because it was marked with a \"post it,\" and Orta believed that Lugo was reading it. Lugo told Orta that the document was her (Orta's) responsibility, and that she (Lugo) could not assume responsibility for something that was not part of her job description. Orta felt uncomfortable with Lugo's comment and the way she said it with a raised tone. This incident was discussed with Nieves, who met with both Orta and Lugo. Although Orta said that she did not know why Lugo was angry with her, she later stated that Lugo's anger may have been caused by stress associated with the upcoming FDA visit. Orta stated that she did not know of any other reason that Lugo would be mad at her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days before Lugo officially became Orta's supervisor, Lugo asked Orta to produce various documents and information pertaining to the SOP unit. The information that Lugo requested was under Orta's control. The work associated with this request prompted Orta to talk with Montoyo. Orta complained about the work pressure she felt and about the fact that Lugo was constantly changing her requests and not providing any additional time to comply. Orta also told Montoyo that Lugo's requests made her nervous and that she thought Lugo's behavior was related to the binder incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a consequence of the stress she felt, Orta went to visit the infirmary at Merck to receive medical attention. Furthermore, in November 2000, Orta sought medical treatment from a psychiatrist, Dr. Celia Rodr&#237;guez-Valdez (\"Dr. Rodr&#237;guez\"), who diagnosed that Orta was suffering a major depression and should be out of work for three months. As a result, Orta was on leave from November 2, 2000 to February 2, 2001. Upon taking this leave, Orta was advised about benefits such as non-occupational temporary disability insurance and long-term disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Orta returned to work on February 2, 2001, she discovered that her office had been moved from the second floor to the first. Nieves, her former supervisor, told her that she had been moved to the first floor to be closer to Lugo, her supervisor, and because books and other work materials were on the first floor. Orta found her new work area uncomfortable mainly because of the size of her desk. However, the desk was soon changed, and Orta was more comfortable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 2, 2001, Lugo sent Orta an e-mail addressing a series of tasks that she had failed to perform and requesting a meeting to discuss the problem. Orta explained to Lugo at the meeting how, when she returned from her leave, the paperwork had been in disarray, that the person who substituted for her did not do what was required of her, and that she (Orta) had to make up for what had not been done. Before the meeting ended, Orta told Lugo that she needed to go to the infirmary. Lugo accompanied Orta to the infirmary and waited for her until she came out. Lugo and Orta then met with Montoyo. During this meeting, Lugo restated what she had discussed with Orta regarding her responsibilities. Montoyo listened and then asked Orta whether she had anything else to say. At this point, Orta requested a private meeting with Montoyo. During her meeting alone with Montoyo, Orta indicated how nervous she was. She said that many of Lugo's requirements were related to previous years when she was not present, that the person who had substituted for her had not complied with some requirements, and that she now had to make up for these oversights, in addition to continuing with her daily work. According to Orta, Montoyo promised her that he would help her by speaking with Lugo, told her not to worry, and requested that she work as best she could.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 17, 2001, Orta took a second medical leave for major depression upon the advice of her doctor, Dr. Rodr&#237;guez. However, sometime between May and July 2001, Dr. Rodr&#237;guez moved to the continental United States. As a result, Orta had to find a new doctor, and she began to be treated by Dr. Edgardo Prieto-Agostini (\"Dr. Prieto\"). On July 30, 2001, Dr. Prieto provided Merck with a certificate stating that Orta was suffering from a severe depressive condition that prevented her at that time from doing work and recommending that Orta's medical leave be extended until December 31, 2001. This recommendation was accepted, and Orta's leave was extended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, on November 1, 2001, Orta received a call from Merck's Human Resources Department informing her of a position available in technical services for which she was qualified. Orta informed the Human Resources official who had called her that she was on medical leave until December 31, 2001 and could not go to the company for anything. Orta admitted that she was not bothered by this call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 2001, Dr. Prieto certified to Orta that she could return to work at Merck in January 2002, if the following accommodations were provided: (1) she had to work only four hours a day for the first two weeks; (2) she had to be relocated and be placed outside the supervision of Lugo; and (3) she had to continue visiting her psychiatrist every two weeks. Orta sent Dr. Prieto's certification along with a letter to F&#233;lix Amador, a Merck Plant Manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orta also discussed Dr. Prieto's recommendations with Marilyn Maldonado of the Human Resources Department and signed a document dated January 11, 2002 that was related to her request for accommodation. The document acknowledged Merck's acceptance of the recommendations made by Dr. Prieto and the actions to be taken by Merck in order to comply with the recommendations. Specifically, the January 11, 2002 memo acknowledged:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) That pursuant to Dr. Prieto's recommendations, Orta would return to work on January 15, 2002, as an Administrative Assistant in the Engineering Department, at the same level and with the same salary rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) That instead of reporting to Lugo, Orta would report to Jes&#250;s Mart&#237;nez, head of the Engineering Department in Caguas; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c) That Orta would enjoy a four-hour work schedule, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, until she returned to her regular eight-hour schedule after January 29, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To implement the substantive provisions of this accommodation, Orta was assigned to work in a trailer outside the Merck office facilities. She, however, found the trailer dirty, depressing, and isolating. Such a working environment led her to apply for other positions within the company. For example, she applied for a secretarial position in the Quality Control Department. She, however, was denied the position. Orta alleges that she was told by an unidentified Human Resources representative &#8212; she does not recall the person's name &#8212; that she was not given the position because of her absenteeism. However, there may have been another reason for her rejection: if Orta was given the position, she would have had contact with Lugo, who was part of the Quality Control Department, and such a placement would have been contrary to Dr. Prieto's express recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2002, as a direct consequence of an incident inside the trailer with the person who replaced her in the position of SOP Coordinator, Orta visited Dr. Lillian T. Serrano (\"Dr. Serrano\"), a psychiatrist. She could not visit her usual psychiatrist, Dr. Prieto, because Merck's medical plan had changed, and it no longer listed Dr. Prieto as an approved medical provider. Dr. Serrano placed Orta on leave as of May 1, 2002, and Orta provided Merck with a certificate from Dr. Serrano to this effect. Despite being under the care of Dr. Serrano at this time, Orta, on May 7, 2002, visited Dr. Prieto at the insistence of her husband. After examining her, Dr. Prieto put Orta on medical leave until December 31, 2002. This medical leave was later extended until April 30, 2003. Certificates documenting this additional leave were also provided to the company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As of May 2, 2003, Orta had not returned to her employment with Merck. On May 3, 2003, Orta received a letter dated May 2, 2003 from Abigail P&#233;rez, Merck's Director of Human Resources. The letter stated that because Orta had been absent for a non-occupational illness since May 1, 2002 and because more than the 365 days required by law for her employment to be reserved had elapsed, her employment with Merck was terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 3, 2003, Orta and her husband filed an employment discrimination action against Merck. They alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> violations to Orta's rights under the ADA, the FMLA, and Puerto Rico law. After the parties engaged in discovery, Merck filed a motion for summary judgment, which Orta and her husband opposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 25, 2005, the district court issued its Opinion and Order, in which it granted Merck's summary judgment motion. The court then dismissed the plaintiffs' federal claims with prejudice and their commonwealth law claims without prejudice. Orta and her husband now appeal these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court reviews the district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo.

Sworn Statement Under Penalty of Perjury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before reaching appellants' federal and Puerto Rico claims, we must address a preliminary issue. In assessing Merck's summary judgment motion, the district court disregarded Orta's Sworn Statement Under Penalty of Perjury (\"Statement\"), an affidavit submitted in support of the appellants' opposition to summary judgment. The court disregarded the Statement because it was in conflict with the answers Orta had given in her deposition and because the appellants had failed to provide \"a satisfactory explanation for the subsequent change in her testimony.\" For two reasons, the appellants now argue that the district court erred in disregarding Orta's Statement. First, they claim that the court failed specifically to enumerate the contradictions in her testimony. Second, they contend that Orta provided a \"wholly satisfactory\" explanation for the change in testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court \"review[s] the district court's decision as to `the evidentiary materials it will consider in deciding a motion for summary judgment' only for `a clear abuse of discretion.'\" <i>Lennon v. Rubin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760938\"><a href=\"/opinion/760938/john-j-lennon-v-robert-rubin-secretary-of-the-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>EEOC v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712246\"><a href=\"/opinion/712246/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-88-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43900-equal/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the appellants' first ground for error, we can find no authority whatsoever for the proposition that a district court must specifically enumerate the contradictions that lead it to disregard a given piece of evidence. Orta's second asserted ground is similarly baseless. The appellants claim that they provided a satisfactory explanation for the change in Orta's testimony &#8212; namely, the fact that Orta was having trouble with her memory, and after reviewing certain documents she was able to recall events that she did not recall during her deposition. We, however, do not find this explanation to be satisfactory. Rather, we believe that the district court was warranted in finding the explanation to be an attempt to manufacture an issue of fact in order to survive summary judgment. <i>See Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni &amp; Sons,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.1994) (\"When an interested witness has given clear answers to unambiguous questions, he cannot create a conflict and resist summary judgment with an affidavit that is clearly contradictory, but does not give a satisfactory explanation of why the testimony is changed.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several factors lead us to this conclusion. First, the Statement was executed only after Merck had filed its motion for summary judgment, thus suggesting that the Statement was made solely to create an issue of fact for the purpose of surviving summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In both <i>Colantuoni,</i> 44 F.3d at 5, and <i>Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199000\"><a href=\"/opinion/199000/torres-v-ei-dupont/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2000), we found such a chronology to be probative of the fact that the non-movant was merely attempting to create an issue of fact. Second, Orta's deposition was taken on two different occasions. The first session was on January 28, 2004 and the second session on April 7, 2004. At both sessions, she was accompanied by her attorneys. At no point did they suggest that she was having trouble with her memory. <i>See Colantuoni,</i> 44 F.3d at 5 (noting that plaintiff's attorney \"was present at the deposition, and had the opportunity to clarify any incorrect impressions\"). Orta's memory problems seem to have developed only after Merck filed its summary judgment motion. The district court could well find incredible this sudden, retroactive bout of amnesia. We therefore accept the district court's conclusion that Orta's proffered explanation was not satisfactory and find here that the district court did not abuse its discretion in disregarding Orta's Statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. ADA claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn our attention to the more substantive arguments made by the appellants. First, they argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims under the ADA because there were genuine disputes of material fact that precluded summary judgment. More specifically, the appellants state that three distinct ADA claims were dismissed in error: 1) a discriminatory discharge claim; 2) a disability harassment claim; and 3) a \"failure to accommodate\" claim. We address these in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first look at the discriminatory discharge claim. For the appellants to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, they were required to prove:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) that Orta was \"disabled\" within the meaning of the Act;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) that Orta was able to perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential functions of her job; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c) that Orta was discharged or adversely affected, in whole or in part, because of her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>See Dichner v. Liberty Travel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197902\"><a href=\"/opinion/197902/dichner-v-liberty-travel/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29-30 (1st Cir.1998). In this case, there is no controversy that the appellants produced sufficient evidence to satisfy the first two elements. The district court, however, held that the appellants could not establish the third, and final, element &#8212; namely, that Orta was discharged or adversely affected, in whole or in part, because of her disability. The court found that \"the uncontested material facts demonstrate[d] that Merck's decision to terminate Orta from her employment was based on her failure to return from a leave of absence for a non-occupational condition after the three hundred and sixty five (365) days period provided by law ended,\" and not on her disability. The court specifically noted that the appellants did not provide any evidence to establish that Orta's termination was because of her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we find the same deficiency. In their brief, the appellants cite only to the information contained in Orta's Statement to demonstrate that Orta was discharged because of her disability. More specifically, they cite to Orta's comment in the Statement that her medical leave commenced on May 7, 2002 and was to last until May 7, 2003. Such a comment, if accepted, might create a genuine factual controversy as to the reason Orta's employment was terminated. On the one hand, there would be Merck's proffered explanation that Orta was fired because she had failed to return from leave as expected on May 2, 2003. On the other hand, there would be Orta's explanation &#8212; namely, that her leave was supposed to last until May 7, 2003 and that Merck, by ending her employment prior to that date, fired her because of her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, however, we agree with the district court's decision to disregard Orta's Statement. In the absence of any other evidence that Merck terminated Orta because of her disability, we are compelled to agree with the district court that Merck's decision to terminate Orta from her employment was based on her failure to return to work by a particular date. The district court correctly found that the appellants had failed to satisfy the third element of their prima facie case. Accordingly, summary judgment on the appellants' discriminatory discharge claim was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we turn to the appellants' disability harassment claim. On appeal, they argue that Orta was the victim of a hostile working environment as a result of her disability. This claim is easily disposed of, as we can find no evidence that it was raised before the district court. This Court has long held that an issue not raised in the district court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. <i>See Waterproofing Sys., Inc. v.

As the district court correctly noted, a \"failure to accommodate\" claim has a different set of requirements from the \"discriminatory discharge\" claim. A plaintiff in a \"failure to accommodate\" case must:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) furnish sufficient admissible evidence that she is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) establish that she worked for an employer covered by the ADA;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c) demonstrate that the employer, despite its knowledge of the employee's limitations, did not accommodate those limitations; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d) show that the employer's failure to accommodate the known limitations affected the terms, conditions, or privileges of the plaintiff's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198690\"><a href=\"/opinion/198690/higgins-v-new-balance/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span>, 264 (1st Cir.1999). Although Merck conceded that the appellants produced enough evidence to meet the first two elements, the district court found that the appellants failed to establish either of the last two elements. The court therefore held that summary judgment was proper on the appellants' \"failure to accommodate\" claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the appellants acknowledge the district court's conclusion that Merck had \"reasonably accommodated\" Orta because the company had, for instance, provided her with a number of medical leaves. They contend, however, that there were many ways in which Merck did not properly accommodate Orta. For example, they assert that the company only complied in \"form\" and not in \"substance\" with Dr. Prieto's December 2001 recommendations. We, however, do not find this argument to be persuasive. Dr. Prieto made three specific recommendations: 1) that Orta work for four hours for the first two weeks upon returning from leave; 2) that she have no contact with Lugo; and 3) that she be allowed to be absent one afternoon every two weeks to see Dr. Prieto. From our reading of the record, we believe Merck complied with these recommendations to the letter, whether viewed from the perspective of either \"form\" or \"substance.\" We fail to see how the factors cited by the appellants &#8212; for example, that Orta was placed in a dirty and depressing trailer, that Orta was not given a job description for her new position, and that Orta was not supervised &#8212; are at all relevant to whether Orta was in fact allowed to work only four hours each day upon returning from leave, whether Merck removed Orta from Lugo's supervision, or whether Orta was allowed to be absent an afternoon every two weeks to be able to see her psychiatrist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants also argue that the district court erred because it failed to consider several reasonable accommodations requested by Orta between February 2001 and March 2002. First, they point to the fact that in February 2001, Orta requested the relocation of her office from the first to the second floor. Even if this is true, we do not see how such an accommodation is related to Orta's claimed disability. <i>See Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></span>, 64 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that \"under the ADA, requests for accommodation must be . . . linked to a disability\"). Second, the appellants cite to a number of instances in which Orta purportedly requested to be removed either from Lugo's supervision or the trailer that she found depressing. Under the ADA, requests for accommodation must be express, <i>see id.,</i> and we can find no evidence that Orta explicitly made either of these requests. The district court came to the same conclusion, noting that Orta only made two requests: 1) a written request to have Merck implement Dr. Prieto's recommendations; and 2) a verbal request to have her desk changed because it was uncomfortable. <i>See Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199356\"><a href=\"/opinion/199356/reed-v-lepage-bakeries/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 261 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[T]he ADA's reasonable accommodation requirement usually does not apply unless `triggered by a request' . . . .\") (quoting Henry Perrett, Jr., 1 <i>Americans With Disabilities Act Handbook</i> &#167; 4.17, at 121 (3d ed.1997)). Third, the appellants point to how Orta's request to be transferred to a secretarial position was denied. The district court, however, fully considered this request for accommodation and concluded that Merck was fully within its rights to deny Orta the position, since \"in that position Orta would have had contact with Lugo, in contravention of Dr. Prieto's very specific recommendation that she not have any contact with her former supervisor.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the appellants argue that Merck failed to properly accommodate Orta because the company terminated her employment while she was on medical leave. There is, however, no evidence that Orta was terminated while she was on leave. The only proof offered by the appellants demonstrating that Orta was on leave on May 2, 2003, the date of her termination, was Orta's Statement, which we (and the district court) have disregarded. There is ample evidence, however, to support the proposition that by May 2, 2003, Orta's one-year leave had elapsed. For example, there are the sworn statements of Merck employees Giselle Olmo and Abigail P&#233;rez, which state unequivocally that Orta's leave was to end on May 1, 2003. Even more important is the district court's finding that Orta herself had submitted a certificate from her doctor stating that she was on leave beginning May 1, 2002. This demonstrates to us that Orta's one-year leave had indeed elapsed by May 2, 2003 and that Merck, in releasing Orta on that date, did not terminate her while she was on medical leave. Therefore, the district court was correct in granting summary judgment on the appellants' \"failure to accommodate\" claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. FMLA claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' next argument is that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their FMLA claim. More specifically, they take issue with the district court's resolution of their claim that Orta was discriminated and retaliated against under the FMLA because she was denied the position of secretary in the Quality Control department due to her absences under the FMLA. The district court found that the appellants had not proffered any significantly probative evidence to sustain their allegation that Orta was denied the position because of her absences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court. As the court correctly stated, to establish their retaliation claim, the appellants were required to establish their prima facie case by showing that 1) Orta had availed herself of a protected right under the FMLA; 2) Orta was adversely affected by an employment decision; and 3) there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action. <i>Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> 1<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>51, 161 (1st Cir.1998). Only the third prong of this test is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the parties' briefs, there is some dispute about the precise date that Orta applied for the position of secretary in the Quality Control department. Merck claims that Orta only applied for the position in January 2002, after Dr. Prieto had made his December 2001 recommendation that Orta should be placed outside Lugo's supervision. The company argues that Orta was not named to the secretarial position because, as noted above, in that position she would have had contact with Lugo, who at the time was a supervisor in the Quality Control department. The appellants, however, contend that Orta applied for the position not in January 2002, but in March 2001. They point out that, at that time, Lugo was not a supervisor in the Quality Control department. Therefore, there would have been no medically-related reason for not placing Orta in the secretarial position. They allege that the real reason that Orta was denied the job was the earlier medical leaves she had taken under the FMLA. They came to this conclusion after an unidentified Human Resources representative (they do not recall the name of the person) told Orta that she was not given the position because of her absenteeism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find it unnecessary to resolve this dispute about the date of Orta's application for the secretarial position, because even assuming that the appellants are correct and that Orta had applied for the secretarial position in March 2001, we would still come to the conclusion that the appellants' FMLA retaliation claim fails. Simply put, the appellants offer no proof that Orta's absences were taken into account in denying her the secretarial position. The only evidence they offer to support their claim is the comment by the unidentified Human Resources representative who told Orta that she was not given the position because of her absenteeism. It is unclear, however, whether this statement was made by someone with authority to make such a statement on behalf of the company, in which case it could be admissible as an admission of a party-opponent under Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2). As there is no evidence in the record that the unknown employee had such authority in this case, the evidence is inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the appellants offer no significantly probative evidence to show that there was in fact a causal connection between Orta's FMLA leave and Merck's decision to deny her the position of secretary in the Quality Control department. We therefore find that the district court was correct in dismissing the appellants' claim under the FMLA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Puerto Rico claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' final argument relates to their state law claims. Since the district court dismissed all of the appellants' federal causes of action, the court exercised its discretion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3) and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the appellants' state law claims. The court dismissed all of the appellants' state law claims without prejudice so that the appellants would be able, if they wished, to refile the state claims in state court. On appeal, the appellants were hoping that we would reverse the district court's decision to grant summary judgment on the federal claims and then require the district court to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction and reinstate the state law claims, thereby allowing for the efficient use of judicial resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since we have found that the district court properly dismissed the appellants' federal claims, we decline the appellants' invitation to compel the district court to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3) (providing that federal district courts, in their discretion, may \"decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a),\" e.g., a state law claim, if the court \"has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons expressed herein, the decision of the district court granting summary judgment on behalf of Merck is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to Merck's records, Orta was on non-occupational temporary disability leave from May 1, 2002 to May 1, 2003</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In fact, the Statement was executed on the same date that Orta filed her opposition to Merck's motion for summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
