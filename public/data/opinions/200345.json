Nathaniel M. Gorton, U. S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     John T. Ouderkirk, Jr., for appellant.\n     Peter K. Levitt, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                         February 14, 2003\n\f           BOWNES,    Senior       Circuit   Judge.     Defendant-appellant\n\nChamond Henderson (\"Henderson\") appeals from a jury conviction on\n\nall five counts of an indictment charging him and two others.\n\nCount One charged Henderson, Robert Carey (\"Carey\") and Kimberly\n\nPowers   (\"Powers\")    with    conspiring     to   possess   with   intent   to\n\ndistribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. ยง 846.1       Counts Two through Five charged Henderson and\n\nPowers with possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute it\n\nand with distribution in violation of 21 U.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1) and 18\n\nU.S.C. ยง 2.   Carey was also charged in Count Five.\n\n           Henderson and Carey were tried jointly.                  Both were\n\nconvicted and appealed separately.           Carey's appeal is also before\n\nus and is the subject of a separate opinion.           See United States v.\n\nCarey, No. 01-2439.     Powers entered into a plea bargain with the\n\ngovernment and testified at the trial.\n\n                              I.    THE EVIDENCE\n\n           We recount the facts as the jury rationally could have\n\nfound them, consistent with record support.            In October 1998 the\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") began an investigation of\n\ncrack cocaine trafficking in Worcester, Massachusetts.                The DEA\n\ncontacted a known crack cocaine user, Joseph Mozynski (\"Mozynski\"),\n\n\n\n     1\n      Grams and ounces are used interchangeably throughout this\nopinion. It should be noted that one ounce equals 28.35 grams.\nSee United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, ยง\n2D1.1, comments. (n.11) (Nov. 2002).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fto serve as a cooperating witness in its investigation.     Mozynski\n\nknew Henderson and had seen him once or twice before becoming a\n\ncooperating witness.    Mozynski facilitated four purchases of crack\n\ncocaine from Henderson during the course of the investigation.\n\nHenderson and Mozynski were present at all four sales.        Two of\n\nthese four purchases were made in the basement of the apartment\n\nbuilding in which Henderson lived, 27 Wachusett Street.    The other\n\nsales took place within two blocks of Wachusett Street.\n\nA.   The First Sale\n\n            The sale occurred on October 19, 1998.   It took place at\n\n6 Denny Street in Worcester.   Carey and Powers were living there at\n\nthe time.    Mozynski talked to Carey about wanting to buy crack\n\ncocaine and was told by Carey that he could get it from a person\n\ncalled \"Butter.\"    The deal was that Mozynski would pay $1,200 for\n\n25 grams of crack cocaine.     Carey was to get $200 for setting up\n\nthe sale.    It was agreed that Mozynski would pick up the crack\n\ncocaine at 6 Denny Street on October 19.\n\n            On that day, Mozynski met with DEA Special Agents Timothy\n\nAnderson and Robert Guerard.    They searched him and then wired him\n\nwith a concealed monitoring device, enabling the DEA to tape record\n\nthe drug transactions, and gave him $1,200.      The agents watched\n\nMozynski enter 6 Denny Street.    After he was inside the house, he\n\nwas met by Powers, Carey, and a woman named Lynn Cappulett.\n\nMozynski showed Powers the $1,200 and Powers told Carey to page\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fButter. After speaking to Butter on the phone and telling him that\n\nMozynski was here with the money, Powers told Mozynski that Butter\n\nwould be there within five minutes.    Agent Anderson videotaped\n\nHenderson walking down Denny Street and then turning into the\n\ndriveway at 6 Denny Street. Mozynski gave Henderson the $1,200 and\n\nreceived from him a package.    Mozynski and Henderson discussed\n\nfuture transactions, and Henderson told Mozynski to contact him\n\nonly through Powers.\n\n          A short time after Mozynski had entered 6 Denny Street,\n\nAgent Anderson observed and videotaped him leaving the premises.\n\nMozynski went straight to the DEA agents and gave them the package\n\nHenderson had given him.   Mozynski also made a written statement\n\ndescribing the events that took place inside 6 Denny Street.     As\n\npart of the statement, Mozynski described Henderson as five feet,\n\nten inches tall, 175 or 180 pounds and of medium complexion.      A\n\ncouple of minutes later, Agent Anderson observed and videotaped\n\nHenderson leaving 6 Denny Street.     A chemical analysis of the\n\ncontents of the package given by Mozynski to the DEA agents showed\n\nthat it contained 23.7 grams of crack cocaine.\n\nB.   The Second Sale\n\n          The second sale, which took place on October 27, 1998,\n\nwas also a face-to-face purchase by Mozynski.    Mozynski met Powers\n\nat 6 Denny Street to purchase three ounces of crack cocaine from\n\nHenderson.   After leaving Denny Street, Mozynski and Powers met\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fAgent Guerard in the car he used for undercover work.                    Agent\n\nGuerard said he was a customer of Mozynski.            Powers told Guerard to\n\ndrive to a nearby location where Powers and Mozynski got out of the\n\ncar.      Mozynski   and   Powers   met    Henderson    in   the   basement    of\n\nHenderson's apartment building at 27 Wachusett Street.                Mozynski\n\npaid Henderson $3,000 and was given a piece of newspaper containing\n\na plastic bag.       Mozynski then delivered the package to Agent\n\nGuerard, who searched him. The subsequent chemical analysis showed\n\nthe substance in the plastic bag contained 73.2 grams of crack\n\ncocaine.\n\nC.     The Third Sale\n\n            The third sale took place on November 3, 1998.            Mozynski\n\ncontacted Powers prior to November 3.          Powers told him to contact\n\nButter directly by his pager, which he did.              Butter returned the\n\npage; they talked over the phone and agreed to another drug sale\n\nusing the same format as the prior sale.          On November 3, Mozynski\n\nmet Powers at 6 Denny Street.        They both met Agent Guerard in his\n\ncar.     Powers and Mozynski again met Henderson in the basement of\n\nHenderson's apartment building at 27 Wachusett Street.                Mozynski\n\ngave Henderson $3,000 and Henderson gave Mozynski a package.                  The\n\npackage was delivered to Agent Guerard.                 Subsequent analysis\n\ndisclosed that the contents of the package contained 81.09 grams of\n\ncocaine.    A DEA agent took photos of Powers and Mozynski entering\n\n27 Wachusett Street.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fD.   The Fourth Sale\n\n            There were actually two more sales.               On November 16,\n\nPowers met with Henderson on the street while Mozynski waited a\n\nshort distance away.         It was dark outside and Mozynski could not\n\npositively identify Henderson.          Henderson gave Powers a package,\n\nwhich Powers gave to Mozynski.         Analysis of the package disclosed\n\nthat it contained wax, not crack cocaine.             Mozynski called Butter\n\nfrom Carey's apartment the evening of the wax sale.                  Butter said\n\nthat   he   would   give   Mozynski    the   crack    cocaine   he    owed   him.\n\nMozynski then met with Agent Guerard and gave him Butter's pager\n\nnumber, which Guerard called.           The agent spoke to Butter, who\n\npromised that he would give Guerard one ounce of crack cocaine the\n\nnext day, November 17, and two and one half ounces the day after,\n\nNovember 18.        The beeper number Agent Guerard used to contact\n\nButter was    listed    to    \"D.   Henderson\"   of   \"27    Wahusset    Street,\n\nWorcester, MA.\"      Henderson, whose middle name is David, lived at\n\n\"27 Wachusett Street\" in Worcester.            On November 17, Powers met\n\nHenderson at 27 Wachusett Street and Henderson gave her a package\n\nto give Mozynski.       Powers then met Mozynski and handed him the\n\npackage which Mozynski gave to Agent Guerard.               An analysis showed\n\nthat the package contained 19.68 grams of cocaine.\n\n            In addition to this evidence there was testimony by\n\nPowers that she bought crack cocaine from Henderson on a daily\n\nbasis throughout the period of the conspiracy; that at times she\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fmade purchases of crack cocaine several times a day; that she\n\nusually purchased crack cocaine one ounce at a time which she sold\n\nto her customers.        Powers further testified that Carey regularly\n\nbought crack cocaine from Henderson during the period of the\n\nconspiracy.        She also testified that Carey either used the crack\n\ncocaine himself or resold it to his own customers.                        Powers and\n\nCarey lived together during most of the conspiracy period.\n\n                                II.    THE ISSUES\n\n              We   consider    the    issues   in   the    order    set      forth   in\n\nappellant's brief.\n\nA.   The Admissibility of the Identification Testimony\n\n              Defendant filed a Motion to Suppress Identifications.\n\nThere was a hearing on the motion prior to trial.                      The district\n\ncourt denied the motion by a margin notation, \"Motion Denied.\"\n\nThere were no findings of facts or rulings of law.                 \"We will uphold\n\na district court's decision to deny a suppression motion if the\n\ndecision is supported by any reasonable view of the evidence.\"\n\nUnited States v. Campa, 234 F.3d 733, 737 (1st Cir. 2000).                       \"Our\n\nreview   of    a    district    court's    decision       to   grant    or    deny    a\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fsuppression motion is plenary.\"2             United States v. McCarthy, 77\n\nF.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            There is an additional factor, however, that must be\n\naddressed in our consideration of the pretrial review of the\n\nsuppression motion.       There were two identification witnesses who\n\ntestified at the hearing, Powers and Mozynski.                In January 1999,\n\nMozynski    was   shown   a   single   booking   photo   of    the   defendant.\n\nMozynski was asked \"Who is this?\"              He replied, \"It looks like\n\nButter.\"    In mid-February 1999, Powers was shown the same photo.\n\nPowers was asked if it was \"Butter.\"           She answered, \"Yes.\"\n\n            The Supreme Court has dealt directly with this problem.\n\nIn Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968), the Court\n\nheld:\n\n            Despite the hazards of initial identification\n            by photograph, this procedure has been used\n            widely and effectively in criminal law\n            enforcement, from the standpoint both of\n            apprehending offenders and of sparing innocent\n            suspects the ignominy of arrest by allowing\n            eyewitnesses   to   exonerate   them   through\n            scrutiny of photographs. The danger that use\n            of the technique may result in convictions\n            based    on    misidentification     may    be\n            substantially lessened by a course of cross-\n            examination at trial which exposes to the jury\n            the method's potential for error.      We are\n\n\n        2\n      We are somewhat hampered in our review of the hearing on the\nmotion to suppress because there seems to be no complete transcript\nof the pretrial hearing. There is an excerpt in the record of that\nportion of the hearing devoted to the admission of pawn shop\nreceipts. It is, of course, the duty of the appellant to make sure\nthe record is complete. We will do the best we can with what we\nhave.\n\n                                       -8-\n\f           unwilling to prohibit its employment, either\n           in the exercise of our supervisory power or,\n           still less, as a matter of constitutional\n           requirement. Instead, we hold that each case\n           must be considered on its own facts, and that\n           convictions based on eyewitness identification\n           at trial following a pretrial identification\n           by photograph will be set aside on that ground\n           only   if  the   photographic   identification\n           procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as\n           to give rise to a very substantial likelihood\n           of irreparable misidentification.\n\n(emphasis added).         We have, of course, followed this teaching:\n\n           Before excluding identification evidence, the\n           court must be persuaded that there was a very\n           substantial    likelihood    of    irreparable\n           misidentification.    A court must also be\n           mindful that it is only in extraordinary cases\n           that   identification   evidence   should   be\n           withheld from the jury.\n\nUnited States v. De Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(citations and quotation marks omitted); see also United States v.\n\nWatson, 76 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Guzman-\n\nRivera, 990 F.2d 681, 682 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           We use a two-step test to make this determination.                     See\n\nUnited States v. Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2002).                     The\n\nfirst   step   is    to    decide    whether       there   was   an   impermissibly\n\nsuggestive procedure.          See id.           We skip this step because the\n\ngovernment     has   conceded       that    the    photographic       procedure   was\n\nsuggestive. Our next step is to \"decide whether the identification\n\nitself was reliable under the totality of the circumstances,\n\nnotwithstanding the suggestive procedure.\"                 Id. at 10-11 (quoting\n\nWatson, 76 F.3d at 6).          Neal v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 199-200\n\n                                           -9-\n\f(1972), is the keystone case on the determination of identification\n\nreliability.   It enumerates five factors in the analysis:   (1) the\n\nopportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the\n\ncrime; (2) the witness' degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of\n\nthe witness' prior description of the defendant; (4) the level of\n\ncertainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; (5) the\n\nlength of time between the crime and the confrontation.\n\n           We make our analysis bearing in mind that \"reliability is\n\nthe linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification\n\ntestimony.\"    Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 114 (1977).    We\n\nstart with the testimony of Mozynski.   As far as the first factor,\n\nMozynski had at least three opportunities to view the defendant\n\nclosely.   This was not a single event crime.     There were three\n\nface-to-face sales by the defendant to Mozynski.       In addition,\n\nMozynski had seen Henderson on one or two occasions before he\n\nstarted working for the government as an informant.\n\n           The next factor is the witness' degree of attention. The\n\nevidence demonstrates that Mozynski had a sufficient degree of\n\nattention; he testified at trial to specific details about the\n\ncrack cocaine transactions with Henderson.   Mozynski, for example,\n\ndescribed how in one transaction Henderson wore a black, gold and\n\nwhite football jersey and a baseball hat; Mozynski also remembered\n\nreceiving the crack cocaine in a plastic bag wrapped in newspaper.\n\n           The third factor is the accuracy of the witness' prior\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fdescription of the criminal.             Mozynski's prior description of\n\nHenderson    was   not    perfect.      Mozynski      described     Henderson   as\n\nweighing between 175 and 180 pounds when he actually weighed 150\n\npounds. Mozynski reported that Henderson was five feet, ten inches\n\ntall, when Henderson claims he is five feet, nine inches tall.\n\nMozynski    also   said    that     Henderson   had    a   medium    complexion;\n\nHenderson says that he has a dark complexion.               We are satisfied,\n\nhowever,    that   the    other   reliability    factors     are    sufficiently\n\npersuasive to defeat any suspicion of unreliability raised by\n\nMozynski's prior description.          See United States v. Flores-Rivera,\n\n56 F.3d 319, 331 (1st Cir. 1995) (other reliability criteria under\n\nBiggers sufficient to overcome unreliability engendered by one\n\nfactor); Watson, 76 F.3d at 7 n.1 (upholding district court's\n\nfinding that identification was reliable under Biggers where there\n\nwas no prior description of the assailant but the witness had ample\n\nopportunity to focus on suspect and identified him within minutes\n\nof the assault).\n\n            The fourth factor, the level of certainty demonstrated by\n\nthe witness at confrontation, does not give us reason to pause.\n\nMozynski    \"remained      steadfast     in     the    positiveness      of     his\n\nidentification[],\"        despite    defense    counsel's    rigorous     cross-\n\nexamination.       Souza v. Howard, 488 F.2d 462, 465-66 (1st Cir.\n\n1973).   The fifth Biggers factor is the length of time between the\n\ncrime and the confrontation.            The last time Mozynski observed\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fHenderson was in November 1998.                  Mozynski identified Henderson's\n\nphotograph in January 1999.              The six day jury trial ended on April\n\n30, 2001.   We do not find that this lapse of time militates against\n\nthe reliability of Mozynski's in-court identification given the\n\nstrength of the other factors.                  See Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 331\n\n(seven   year     gap    between        crime    and   identification         permissible\n\nbecause other reliability criteria were sufficiently persuasive);\n\nDrougas,    748      F.2d    at    28    (five     year    gap    between      crime     and\n\nphotographic      identification          permissible       because      witness       spent\n\nconsiderable time with defendant).\n\n            Based       on   our    thorough        review       of   the     record     and\n\napplication     of    the    pertinent      law     to    the    facts   we    rule     that\n\nMozynski's identification of Henderson was sufficiently reliable to\n\novercome the admittedly suggestive photo showing.\n\n            Henderson advances a plethora of reasons why Mozynski's\n\nidentification should not pass muster: he argues that Mozynski did\n\nnot know the defendant by his actual name; that Mozynski lied to\n\nthe government when he said that he had met with Butter on at least\n\none occasion; that Mozynski wore glasses because he suffered from\n\nblurred vision and double vision; that when shown the photo,\n\nMozynski stated that \"[i]t looks like 'Butter';\" that Mozynski was\n\nmistaken as to the weight and complexion of the defendant; and that\n\n\"during the entire period of Mozynski's observations of Butter, he\n\nsuffered a worsening problem of memory loss.\"\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\f             Our conclusion regarding the reliability of Mozynski's\n\nidentification    makes   a   detailed    examination   of   each   argument\n\nunnecessary.     For as the Supreme Court has stated:\n\n             Surely, we cannot say that under all the\n             circumstances of this case there is a very\n             substantial    likelihood    of    irreparable\n             misidentification. Short of that point, such\n             evidence is for the jury to weigh.      We are\n             content to rely upon the good sense and\n             judgment of American juries, for evidence with\n             some element of untrustworthiness is customary\n             grist for the jury mill. Juries are not so\n             susceptible    that   they   cannot    measure\n             intelligently the weight of identification\n             testimony that has some questionable feature.\n\nManson, 432 U.S. at 116 (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n          Nor need we dwell too long on Powers' identification of\n\ndefendant.     There was evidence from which it could be found that\n\nshe had known Henderson going back to 1994.         Powers bought crack\n\ncocaine from Henderson for her own use and resale.                  She saw\n\nHenderson at her apartment daily during a six month period in 1994,\n\nat times spending an hour or more with him.        Powers was present at\n\nall crack cocaine sales to Mozynski, as an ally of Henderson.\n\nDuring October and November 1998, Powers saw Henderson every day.\n\nPowers' identification of Henderson at the pretrial hearing and at\n\nthe jury trial was positive and firm.       In addition, we do not think\n\nthe gap in time between Powers' last transaction with Henderson and\n\nher identification of Henderson's photograph calls into question\n\nthe reliability of her in-court identification, particularly given\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fher close interaction with Henderson.                See Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d\n\nat 331; Drougas, 748 F.2d at 28.\n\n            Like     those    made       regarding     Mozynski,    all    of   the\n\ndefendant's     arguments          pertaining    to    Powers     focus    on   her\n\nreliability:       that she was under the influence of cocaine during\n\nthe four sales; that she did not know the amount of money involved\n\nin the sales; that she was unable to tell how the cocaine was\n\npackaged.    Suffice it to say that all of these factors were brought\n\nto the jury's attention.\n\n            We rule that Powers' testimony was properly submitted to\n\nthe jury.\n\nB.   The Admissibility of the Pawn Shop Receipt\n\n            Henderson      alleges       that   the    court     below    committed\n\n\"constitutional error\" when it admitted into evidence a pawn shop\n\nsales receipt found in Henderson's wallet when he was arrested.\n\nThe pawn shop receipt was signed by Henderson and indicated that\n\nHenderson pawned a watch on March 21, 1998, and redeemed it by\n\npaying $320 on November 6, 1998, just days after the November 3,\n\n1998 drug sale. While Henderson objected at trial to the admission\n\nof   the   receipt,   he     did    so   on   relevancy,   not    constitutional,\n\ngrounds.    If a new basis for objection is raised for the first time\n\non appeal, that ground is not subject to harmless error review, and\n\nmay only be reviewed for plain error.             See United States v. Walsh,\n\n75 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996).            Review for plain error requires four\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fshowings:          (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or\n\nobvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial\n\nrights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of the judicial proceeding. See United States v.\n\nGomez, 255 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n              Henderson attacks the admission of the pawn shop receipt\n\non the grounds that it both impermissibly shifted the burden of\n\nproof by requiring him to explain where he got the money to redeem\n\nthe watch and, at the same time, constituted a \"direct statement\"\n\nto the jurors that they could make an inference against him based\n\non his choice not to testify.                     Both contentions lack merit.\n\nHenderson overlooks the fact that the admission of any evidence\n\noffered by the government in a criminal trial gives the defendant\n\na    reason    to    testify     if   he   has     a   basis    for    rebutting       the\n\ngovernment's theory of the case.             The jury was properly instructed\n\nboth    as    to    the   government's      burden     of   proof     and   as    to   the\n\ndefendant's         right   to    remain     silent.           In   light    of    these\n\ninstructions, we fail to see how the admission of the pawn shop\n\nsales receipt, in and of itself, impermissibly shifted the burden\n\nof proof, or how it invited the jury to draw an inference of guilt\n\nfrom the defendant's choice not to testify.                    The district court's\n\nadmission of the pawn shop sales receipt did not constitute plain\n\nerror.\n\nC.     The Remaining Evidence\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f           Because we are satisfied that the eyewitness testimony\n\n(including the identification evidence) and pawn shop sales receipt\n\nwere sufficient to support Henderson's conviction on all five\n\ncounts, we need only address whether there was sufficient evidence\n\nto support the verdict involving proximity to a school zone under\n\n18 U.S.C. ยง 860.    In determining the evidentiary sufficiency of a\n\nguilty verdict, \"the relevant question is whether, after viewing\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any\n\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"          United States v. Woodward,\n\n149 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir. 1998).      \"The scope of review is over the\n\ntotality of the evidence, both direct and circumstantial.\"          United\n\nStates v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1073 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           Henderson avers that the district court erred when it did\n\nnot grant his Rule 29 motion concerning the school zone violations\n\nattendant to the two transactions that took place at 27 Wachusett\n\nStreet.   In particular, Henderson is \"perplexed\" by the fact that\n\nthe district court denied the motion even though Agent Anderson\n\ntestified that the distance from the Elm Park Community School to\n\n27 Wachusett Street was 1,095 feet, which he measured by walking\n\nthe sidewalks. As Henderson correctly observes, 1,095 feet exceeds\n\nthe   statutory   1,000   feet   needed   to   support   a   conviction   in\n\nconnection with section 860.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f           Be that as it may, Henderson neglects the fact that the\n\nproper way to determine whether a sale was 1,000 feet or less from\n\na school is by measuring a straight line, rather than a pedestrian\n\ntravel route.   See United States v. Soler, 275 F.3d 146, 155 n.6\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (explaining that \"the schoolyard statute envisions\n\nstraight-line rather than pedestrian-route measurements\").           Here,\n\nthe government introduced into evidence, without objection, a map\n\nof the Elm Park Community School area which provided a detailed\n\nillustration of the distance between 27 Wachusett Street, where the\n\ndrug   transactions   took   place,     and   the   school.   This     map\n\ndemonstrated that each of the drug transactions occurred within\n\n1,000 feet of the school; the government, in closing argument,\n\npointed out as much to the jury.      We do not hesitate to find that\n\nthis evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.\n\nD.   The Five Year Limitation Contained in 21 U.S.C. ยง 851(e)is\nConstitutional\n\n           On March 9, 2001, the government filed an information\n\npursuant to 21 U.S.C. ยง 851(a), notifying Henderson that the\n\ngovernment would seek a twenty year minimum sentence based upon his\n\n1991 South Carolina state court conviction for drug trafficking.\n\nThe information charged that, on or about June 13, 1991, Henderson\n\nwas convicted in South Carolina state court for distribution of\n\ncocaine.   21 U.S.C. ยง 851(e) states:\n\n           No person who stands convicted of an offense\n           under this part may challenge the validity of\n           any prior conviction alleged under this\n\n                                 -17-\n\f           section which occurred more than five years\n           before the date of the information alleging\n           such prior conviction.\n\n             Because his prior conviction occurred more than five\n\nyears before the filing of the government's information, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the plain language of section 851(e)\n\nprecluded Henderson from denying the conviction, see id. ยง 851(b),\n\nor challenging its validity, see id. ยง 851(c).                 Based upon this\n\nprior conviction, Henderson was sentenced to a mandatory minimum of\n\n20 years in prison.      See id. ยง 841(b)(1)(A).\n\n           Although     we    have   previously   recognized     that   section\n\n851(e) bars an appellant from challenging the validity of prior\n\nconvictions that are more than five years old, see United States v.\n\nRomero-Carrion, 54 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1995), we have not, until\n\nnow, been asked to decide whether section 851(e) is constitutional.\n\nHenderson now poses the following question of first impression in\n\nthis circuit:     Does the five year limitation period set forth in 21\n\nU.S.C. ยง 851(e) violate the Due Process and Equal Protection\n\nClauses of the Constitution?          We hold that it does not.\n\n           \"We review de novo constitutional challenges to federal\n\nstatutes.\"      United States v. Robinson, 137 F.3d 652, 653 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).    As an initial matter, Henderson faces the hurdle that no\n\ncourt has sustained a constitutional challenge to 21 U.S.C. ยง\n\n851(e),   and    at   least   six    circuits   have   found    the   provision\n\nconstitutional on both due process and equal protection grounds.\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fSee United States v. Reed, 141 F.3d 644, 652 (6th Cir. 1998);\n\nUnited States v. Prior, 107 F.3d 654, 660-61 (8th Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 522 U.S. 824 (1997); United States v. Gonzales, 79 F.3d\n\n413, 426-27 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 869 (1996); United\n\nStates v. Arango-Montoya, 61 F.3d 1331, 1338 (7th Cir. 1995);\n\nUnited States v. McChristian, 47 F.3d 1499, 1503 (9th Cir. 1995);\n\nUnited States v. Williams, 954 F.2d 668, 673 (11th Cir. 1992),\n\ncert. denied, 517 U.S. 1157 (1996).       He urges us to depart from\n\nthis precedent on the ground that some of these circuits have found\n\nsection 851(e) constitutional based upon a misplaced reliance on\n\nCustis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485 (1994).              According to\n\nHenderson, Custis considered only the constitutionality of 18\n\nU.S.C. ยง 924(e)(1), and not section 851(e), and therefore has no\n\nbearing on our determination.    We disagree.\n\n           In Custis, the Supreme Court examined section 924(e)(1),\n\nwhich provides no statutory right to collaterally challenge state\n\ncourt convictions that are used to enhance federal sentences under\n\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984.       Section 924(e)(1) raises\n\nthe penalty for possession of a firearm by a felon from a maximum\n\nof 10 years in prison to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years\n\nand a maximum of life in prison without parole if the defendant\n\n\"has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a\n\nserious drug offense.\"    The Court held that Congress' omission of\n\nlanguage   authorizing   collateral    attacks   in   section   924(e)(1)\n\n\n                                -19-\n\findicated that it did not intend to give defendants the right to\n\nchallenge the validity of prior convictions under this statute.\n\nCustis, 511 U.S. at 497.        Thus, if Congress has the power to\n\nforeclose    collateral   challenges   by   merely     omitting   statutory\n\nlanguage that authorizes such attacks, see 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e)(1),\n\nthen Congress can certainly preclude collateral challenges after\n\nfive years where it explicitly includes such language in a statute.\n\n            Notwithstanding, Henderson counters that once Congress\n\nallows the use of collateral challenges, as it has for convictions\n\nless than five years old under section 851(e), any conditions\n\nimposed on the use of those challenges must accommodate fundamental\n\nliberties.    He claims that the selection of a particular number of\n\nyears to establish a time bar is patently arbitrary, and that the\n\nfive year limitations period violates the Equal Protection Clause\n\nbecause it unfairly discriminates against those who commit a\n\nfederal offense more than five years after a prior conviction. His\n\narguments are not well taken.\n\n             The ban against challenging convictions over five years\n\nneed only be supported by a rational legislative purpose because no\n\nfundamental right or suspect class is at issue in this case.            See\n\nReed, 107 F.3d at 661.      The five year limitation on the right to\n\ncollaterally    challenge   prior   convictions   at    sentencing   has   a\n\nrational basis in light of both the administrative difficulties\n\ninherent in challenges to prior convictions, such as lost or\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fdestroyed records, unavailable witnesses, and fading memories, and\n\nthe interest in finality.     See, e.g., Arango-Montoya, 61 F.3d at\n\n1338.    We therefore have no difficulty concluding that section\n\n851(e) does not violate Henderson's right to due process and equal\n\nprotection of the law.\n\nE.   Closing Argument\n\n            Henderson also takes issue with the government's closing\n\nargument.    Specifically, he urges that the prosecutor improperly\n\npersuaded the jury to convict him by allegedly interjecting his\n\npersonal opinion of the evidence, vouching for a witness, shifting\n\nthe burden of proof and inflaming the jury.   We address each of his\n\narguments in turn.\n\n            1.   Standard of Review\n\n            Where, as here, the defendant made no objection to the\n\ngovernment's closing argument at trial, the standard of review is\n\n\"plain error.\" United States v. Hernandez-Vegas, 235 F.3d 705, 710\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).      Henderson faces a high hurdle because it is\n\nestablished that plain error review \"is ordinarily limited to\n\n'blockbusters' and does not consider 'the ordinary backfires --\n\nwhether or not harmful to a litigant's cause -- which may mar a\n\ntrial record.'\"      United States v. Griffen, 818 F.2d 97, 100.\n\nHenderson bears the burden of demonstrating that the prosecutor's\n\nremarks were prejudicial and affected his substantial rights.   Id.\n\nat 55.   Even then, error will not be recognized unless it caused a\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f\"miscarriage of justice\" or seriously undermined the \"integrity or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                    United States v.\n\nOlano,   507    U.S.    725,   736    (1993).       We    consider     whether   the\n\nprosecutor's remarks had any likely impact on the jury based on the\n\nentire record, including the closing argument presented by the\n\ndefense.   See Joyner, 191 F.3d at 55.\n\n           2.    Personal Opinion of the Evidence\n\n           We    reject    Henderson's        argument    that   the    prosecutor\n\nimproperly interjected his personal opinion of the evidence when he\n\ncharacterized as \"absurd\" the defense's assertion that Powers was\n\nunder the influence of drugs during the transactions. A prosecutor\n\n\"may attempt to persuade the jury to draw suggested inferences\n\nunfavorable to the defense, as long as the prosecutor's own opinion\n\nas to the witness' credibility is not urged on the jury.\"                     United\n\nStates v. Smith, 982 F.2d 681, 683 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           In    this     case,      the     prosecutor    offered     no    opinion\n\nconcerning the credibility of the defense witnesses.                        Instead,\n\nduring   his    closing    argument,        the   prosecutor     responded     to   a\n\npersistent suggestion made by the defendant that Powers had been on\n\ndrugs during the transactions and thus could not remember the\n\ndetailed information she provided during her testimony.                          The\n\nprosecutor did this by asking the jury to focus on the tape\n\nrecordings made of those transactions:\n\n           And don't the tapes prove to you how absurd\n           the defendant's claims are that Powers was too\n\n                                           -22-\n\f          high or too crazy to have accurately perceived\n          the   events   which   occurred   during   the\n          conspiracy? Don't the tapes, in fact, prove\n          that Powers became suspicious that Special\n          Agent Guerard might be a cop right after she\n          met him?\n\nIt is apparent that the prosecutor asked the jury to consider\n\nwhether the evidence before it -- tape recordings in which Powers\n\ncorrectly perceived that Mozynski's alleged drug customer was an\n\nundercover police officer -- refuted defendant's contention that\n\nPowers' mind was too altered to observe and remember the drug\n\ntransactions.      There    was   nothing    improper     in   the    government\n\nidentifying for the jury a specific item of evidence and arguing\n\nthat the jury should infer from that piece of evidence that the\n\ndefendant's theory was not worthy of belief.             See United States v.\n\nMount, 896 F.2d 612, 625 (1st Cir. 1990); United States v. Garcia,\n\n818 F.2d 135, 143 (1st Cir. 1987). Accordingly, the district court\n\ndid not commit plain error by allowing the prosecutor's statement.\n\n          Henderson challenges other statements in the government's\n\nclosing on   the   ground    that   the     prosecutor    again      offered   his\n\npersonal opinion of the evidence when he told the jury:\n\n          Look at the evidence with a very stern and\n          suspicious eye.   And if you do that, you'll\n          have no doubt that the government has\n          sustained its burden.\n\n\nHenderson says these statements implied that the jury \"could not\n\nreturn a verdict of not guilty without failing to consider the\n\nevidence closely.\"     What Henderson fails to consider is that a\n\n                                    -23-\n\fprosecutor has a right to comment on the plausibility of the\n\ndefense theory.    See Garcia, 818 F.2d at 143.       Here, the prosecutor\n\nsuggested that a careful review of the evidence would reveal that\n\nthe government's     theory   of   the   case   was   more   plausible   than\n\nHenderson's theory of the case.      This suggestion properly directed\n\nthe jury's attention to the evidence presented at trial.\n\n          We also disagree with Henderson that the prosecutor\n\ninterjected his personal opinion of the evidence in rebuttal when\n\nhe commented \"if you ask the wrong questions, you get the wrong\n\nanswers,\" and \"if you ask the right questions in this case, there's\n\nno doubt but that their clients will be convicted.\" These comments\n\nwere not inappropriate because \"[a]lthough it is the jury's job to\n\ndraw inferences, there is nothing improper in the Government's\n\nsuggesting which inferences should be drawn.\"           Mount, 896 F.2d at\n\n625.\n\n          Here, the prosecutor argued that Henderson's theory of\n\nthe case directed the jury to the \"wrong\" questions, whereas the\n\ngovernment's    theory   directed    it    to   the    \"right\"   questions;\n\npresumably, these were questions based on the evidence.           We see no\n\nreason why the prosecutor should be prohibited from suggesting that\n\nthe government's theory of the case did a better job of focusing on\n\nthe evidence.     The prosecutor was entitled to argue that the jury\n\nshould look at the evidence to determine Henderson's guilt. We see\n\nno plain error.\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\f              3.    Vouching\n\n              Henderson next maintains that the prosecutor vouched for\n\nPowers   in    his     closing       argument   when   he    stated   that   Powers\n\n\"repeatedly told you that she was told to tell the truth, to tell\n\nthe truth when she took the stand.\"                A prosecutor may not place\n\n\"the prestige of the government behind a witness by making personal\n\nassurances about the witness' credibility.\" United States v. Neal,\n\n36 F.3d 1190, 1207 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n              There    were     no    such     personal     assurances   from   the\n\ngovernment     in     this    case.      The    prosecutor's    statement    merely\n\nsummarized Powers' prior testimony, and was within the accepted\n\nbounds of argument.          See United States v. Auch, 187 F.3d 125, 131\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).        We note that the prosecutor did not express his\n\npersonal opinion about Powers' credibility; nor did the prosecutor\n\nsuggest that special circumstances, such as Powers' plea agreement,\n\nensured her honesty.          See United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 772\n\n(1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Dockray, 943 F.2d 152, 156 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).        Furthermore, the prosecutor's statement came after\n\ndefense counsel suggested in cross-examination that Powers had been\n\ncoached by the government. We find that the prosecutor's statement\n\ndid not constitute improper vouching.\n\n              4.    Shifting the Burden of Proof\n\n              Henderson also complains that the prosecutor improperly\n\ncommented on his right to remain silent when he responded to\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fdefense allegations that the government had failed to call a\n\nsupposedly percipient witness.          It is established that any comment\n\nby a prosecutor on a defendant's exercise of the right to remain\n\nsilent violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against self-\n\nincrimination.         See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 769.\n\n               In the closing argument, defense counsel suggested that\n\nthe    government      was   hiding    something   by   not   producing     Lynn\n\nCappulett, an individual whom Powers and Mozynski each identified\n\nas    having    been    at   Carey's   residence   during     the   first   drug\n\ntransaction on October 19:\n\n               [The government] never tracked down Lynn\n               Cappulett. Mozynski and Powers both said that\n               she was at 6 Denny Street on October 19, 1998.\n               And according to Mozynski the first deal\n               happened right in front of her eyes. Yet, did\n               you hear any evidence that Agent Anderson or\n               Agent Guerard ever tried to find her or talk\n               to her? This was an eyewitness to what went\n               on inside the building.\n\nIn rebuttal, the prosecutor replied:\n\n               Where is Lynn Cappulett, both counsel ask you?\n               Well, that's a good question. Why don't they\n               tell us?    Maybe defense counsel could have\n               interviewed Lynn Cappulett.\n\n               The prosecutor's response was not such that \"jurors would\n\nprobably interpret it as commentary on the accused's failure to\n\ntake the stand,\"         United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 979 (1st\n\nCir. 1995), particularly because it was made in rebuttal after\n\ndefense counsel had themselves raised the issue. See United States\n\nv. Nickens, 955 F.2d 112, 122 (1st Cir. 1992) (evaluating effect of\n\n                                       -26-\n\fstatement made in rebuttal argument).               Under the invited response\n\nrule, if the prosecutor's remarks were \"invited,\" and \"did no more\n\nthan respond substantially in order to right the scale,\" such\n\ncomments    do    not    warrant     reversal.          Id.   (internal   quotations\n\nomitted).    Here, defense counsel invited a response by raising the\n\nissue of Lynn Cappulett's whereabouts in the first instance.                       The\n\nprosecutor's remarks were limited and addressed only the defense\n\ncounsel's own comments.          See id. at 123.         Thus, there was no plain\n\nerror when the district court did not, on its own initiative,\n\nstrike portions of the government's rebuttal argument.\n\n            5.    Inflaming the Passions of the Jury\n\n            We cannot agree with Henderson that the district court\n\nerred   when     it     did   not,    on   its    own    initiative,      strike   the\n\nprosecutor's description of Henderson as \"a successful businessman\n\nin the business of crack cocaine,\" who wanted a \"windfall\" verdict\n\nin his favor.      When the evidence of a defendant's guilt is strong,\n\na court should be very reluctant to find plain error in \"misguided\n\nrhetoric.\"       United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1188 (1st\n\nCir. 1993). Under plain error review, improper remarks are grounds\n\nfor reversal only if they \"so poisoned the well that the trial's\n\noutcome was likely affected.\" Id. (internal quotations omitted).\n\nWe place a prosecutor's remarks in context when determining whether\n\nthey were inappropriate.             See id. at 1187.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -27-\n\f                 Henderson    posits    that   the   prosecutor's       comments\n\nimproperly appealed to the passions of the jury.               To the contrary,\n\nwe fail to see how these remarks would distract the jury from\n\nfocusing    on    whether    the    evidence   established     guilt    beyond    a\n\nreasonable doubt.         See United States v. Manning, 23 F.3d 570, 574\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).       Defense counsel suggested in his opening that\n\nHenderson was a legitimate businessman; the prosecutor countered\n\nthat suggestion by arguing that Henderson was in the business of\n\nselling    drugs.     Here,    defense    counsel    invited    a    response    by\n\nsuggesting that Henderson \"worked hard\" in the \"music promotion\n\nbusiness,\" and was \"successful.\"          The prosecutor, in turn, offered\n\na reply that was not only supported by the evidence but was\n\nproperly limited and addressed only the defense counsel's own\n\ncomments.        See Nickens, 955 F.2d at 123.             There was nothing\n\nimproper in this suggestion.\n\n            Nor did the district court err when it permitted, as\n\nHenderson claims, the prosecutor to tell the jury that it could\n\nconvict him \"even if they found that the defendant was not the\n\ndistributor of the cocaine.\"           This is somewhat misleading.        In his\n\nclosing, Henderson's counsel suggested that someone other than\n\nHenderson    was    the     crack    cocaine   supplier.       The     prosecutor\n\nresponded:\n\n            What are the odds that there was a different\n            supplier in this case in light of the\n            following facts:   First, a person that you\n            might well find at a minimum bears a striking\n\n                                       -28-\n\f            resemblance to this individual, even if you\n            don't find that it's him, walks into 6 Denny\n            Street at the exact time of a crack\n            distribution on October 19th. Coincidence?\n\nWhen read in its proper context, it is apparent that this comment,\n\nwhile unartfully expressed, is innocuous.    It certainly would not\n\nsuggest to the jury that it could convict the defendant even if it\n\nfound that the person alleged to be the supplier of the cocaine was\n\nnot the defendant.    Furthermore, the court's instructions to the\n\njury clearly explained that the ultimate question for the jury was\n\nwhether Henderson was the supplier of crack cocaine on the dates in\n\nquestion.    We conclude that Henderson's conviction should not be\n\ndisturbed on the basis of these statements.\n\n            We also disagree with Henderson that the prosecutor\n\nimproperly appealed to the passions of the jury during rebuttal by\n\ncommenting, with regard to Henderson's defense theory, \"[w]hat is\n\nthis, the Jerry Springer show?\"    Given the strong evidence against\n\nHenderson, the prosecutor's \"misguided rhetoric,\" Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d at 1188, if it was even that, does not rise to the level of\n\nplain error.     See Joyner, 191 F.3d at 55.      We conclude that\n\nHenderson's conviction should not be disturbed on account of the\n\nprosecutor's reference to the Jerry Springer show.\n\nF.   Co-conspirator's Statements\n\n            Henderson argues, in summary fashion, that the only\n\nevidence that indicates he engaged in any conspiracy was the\n\nsuggestive identifications of Mozynski and Powers, which, according\n\n                                -29-\n\fto Henderson, should have been excluded in the first instance.\n\nBecause his challenge to the co-conspirator statements is premised\n\nsolely on the identifications being improperly admitted, we need\n\nnot consider the admissibility of these statements in light of our\n\nconclusion that the district court did not err in admitting the\n\nidentifications.\n\n            In any event, we are satisfied that even without the\n\nidentification testimony the evidence was sufficient for a jury to\n\nconclude that Henderson was part of a conspiracy to sell crack\n\ncocaine.    This includes:    the videotape of Henderson taken by the\n\nDEA at 6 Denny Street at the October 19, 1998 drug transaction;\n\nAgent Anderson's identification of Henderson; the fact that the\n\npager used in the drug transactions was subscribed to by D.\n\nHenderson of 27 Wahuset Street in Worcester; and the fact that\n\nHenderson lived at 27 Wachusett Street, where two of the drug\n\ntransactions    took   place.         This   evidence,   aside     from   the\n\nidentifications of Mozynski and Powers, was sufficient for a\n\nrational trier of fact to find Henderson guilty beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.     See United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 589 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).\n\nG.   Jury Instructions\n\n            Henderson alleges three errors in the district court's\n\njury instructions, which he believes \"incorrectly diminished the\n\nevidentiary    requirements     for    finding   the   defendant    guilty.\"\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\fSpecifically,   he    challenges    the    jury   instructions   concerning\n\nidentification, aiding and abetting and conspiracy.           We review for\n\n\"plain error\" because Henderson did not raise his objections to the\n\njury instructions at trial.        See Gomez, 255 F.3d at 37.\n\n          Turning to the identification instruction, we begin by\n\nnoting that the district court provided a lengthy instruction:\n\n          Identification testimony is an expression of\n          belief or impression by the witness.       Its\n          value depends on the opportunity the witness\n          had to observe the offender at the time of the\n          offense and to make a reliable identification\n          later.   Whether the witness had an adequate\n          and effective opportunity to observe the\n          offender at the time of the offense may be\n          affected by such matters as: (1) how long or\n          short a time was available; (2) how far or\n          close the witness was to the scene of the\n          offense; (3) how good was the lighting; (4)\n          whether the witness was under the influence of\n          drugs; and (5) whether, and the extent to\n          which, the witness had occasion in the past to\n          see or know the person identified.      If the\n          identification by the witness may have been\n          influenced by circumstances under which an\n          image of the defendant was presented to the\n          witness for identification, you may consider\n          those circumstances as well.     You may also\n          take into account that an identification made\n          by picking the defendant out of a group of\n          similar individuals is generally more reliable\n          than one which results from the presentation\n          of an image of the defendant alone to the\n          witness.\n\n          Henderson, without citing any authority, complains that\n\nthis instruction \"fell far short of the detail required by this\n\ncase.\" We disagree. Contrary to Henderson's view, the instruction\n\nwas thorough    and   suitably     focused   on   the   reliability   of   the\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\fidentification as contemplated by the case law.              See Manson, 432\n\nU.S. at 114 (\"[R]eliability is the linchpin in determining the\n\nadmissibility of identification testimony\"); Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d\n\nat 10-11; Watson, 76 F.3d            at 6.   The district court was not\n\nrequired to accept Henderson's alternative instruction because its\n\nown instruction was proper.          See United States v. Arcadipane, 41\n\nF.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1994) (a defendant \"is not entitled to the\n\nnuances of phrasing that he finds most soothing\").\n\n              Henderson further avers that the district court's aiding\n\nand abetting instruction permitted the jury to convict without\n\nfinding specific intent.         See Loder, 23 F.3d at 591 (discussing\n\nspecific intent requirement for aiding and abetting).            In order to\n\nsustain a conviction for aiding and abetting the government must\n\nprove,   in    addition   to   the   commission   of   the   offense   by   the\n\nprincipal, that the defendant consciously shared the principal's\n\nknowledge of the underlying criminal act, and intended to help the\n\nprincipal.      See United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 235 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n              With this in mind, the district court instructed the jury\n\nthat, inter alia, the government must prove beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, first that someone committed the charged crime, and second,\n\n              that the defendant then under consideration\n              willfully associated himself in some way with\n              the crime and willfully participated in it as\n              he would in something he wished to bring\n              about.   This means that the government must\n              prove that the defendant consciously shared\n\n                                      -32-\n\f            the other person's knowledge of the underlying\n            criminal act and intended to help him.\n\nThis is all the law requires; the district court's instruction\n\nadequately set forth the elements of aiding and abetting.\n\n            Finally,   Henderson     asserts    that   the   conspiracy\n\ninstruction allowed the jury to convict him without finding the\n\nnecessary intent. This argument is without merit. To prove intent\n\nfor conspiracy, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat the defendant intended to join in the conspiracy and intended\n\nthe substantive offense to be committed.         See Gomez, 255 F.3d at\n\n35.     The district court properly instructed the jury on the\n\nrequisite intent to support a conspiracy conviction:\n\n            The government must prove two kinds of intent\n            beyond a reasonable doubt before Chamond\n            Henderson . . . can be said to have willfully\n            joined the conspiracy: an intent to agree and\n            an intent, whether reasonable or not, that the\n            underlying crime be committed.\n\nThis formulation accurately states the requisite intent needed for\n\na conspiracy conviction. See United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872\n\nF.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir. 1989).          Accordingly, we are confident\n\nthat the jury instructions do not constitute plain error.\n\nH.    Apprendi\n\n            Henderson's last argument is that the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), requires\n\nthe government to prove his 1991 South Carolina conviction beyond\n\n\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fa reasonable doubt.   Our review is de novo.    See United States v.\n\nSacko, 247 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          We   have   consistently   observed   with   a    \"regularity\n\nbordering on the monotonous,\" that Apprendi does not apply to\n\nsentencing enhancements based on prior convictions.        United States\n\nv. Moore, 286 F.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir. 2002); see also United States\n\nv. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278, 294 (1st Cir. 2002); United States v.\n\nGomez-Estrada, 273 F.3d 400, 402 (1st Cir. 2001).      Accordingly, we\n\nreject Henderson's argument.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -34-\n\f",

In October 1998 the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") began an investigation of crack cocaine trafficking in Worcester, Massachusetts. The DEA contacted a known crack cocaine user, Joseph Mozynski (\"Mozynski\"), to serve as a cooperating witness in its investigation. Mozynski knew Henderson and had seen him once or twice before becoming a cooperating witness. Mozynski facilitated four purchases of crack cocaine from Henderson during the course of the investigation. Henderson and Mozynski were present at all four sales. Two of these four purchases were made in the basement of the apartment building in which Henderson lived, 27 Wachusett Street. The other sales took place within two blocks of Wachusett Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The First Sale</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sale occurred on October 19, 1998. It took place at 6 Denny Street in Worcester. Carey and Powers were living there at the time. Mozynski talked to Carey about wanting to buy crack cocaine and was told by Carey that he could get it from a person called \"Butter.\" The deal was that Mozynski would pay $1,200 for 25 grams of crack cocaine. Carey was to get $200 for setting up the sale. It was agreed that Mozynski would pick up the crack cocaine at 6 Denny Street on October 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that day, Mozynski met with DEA Special Agents Timothy Anderson and Robert Guerard. They searched him and then wired him with a concealed monitoring device, enabling the DEA to tape record the drug transactions, and gave him $1,200. The agents watched Mozynski enter 6 Denny Street. After he was inside the house, he was met by Powers, Carey, and a woman named Lynn Cappulett. Mozynski showed Powers the $1,200 and Powers told Carey to page Butter. After speaking to Butter on the phone and telling him that Mozynski was here with the money, Powers told Mozynski that Butter would be there within five minutes. Agent Anderson videotaped Henderson walking down Denny Street and then turning into the driveway at 6 Denny Street. Mozynski gave Henderson the $1,200 and received from him a package. Mozynski and Henderson discussed future transactions, and Henderson told Mozynski to contact him only through Powers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A short time after Mozynski had entered 6 Denny Street, Agent Anderson observed and videotaped him leaving the premises. Mozynski went straight to the DEA agents and gave them the package Henderson had given him. Mozynski also made a written statement describing the events that took place inside 6 Denny Street. As part of the statement, Mozynski described Henderson as five feet, ten inches tall, 175 or 180 pounds and of medium complexion. A couple of minutes later, Agent Anderson observed and videotaped Henderson leaving 6 Denny Street. A chemical analysis of the contents of the package given by Mozynski to the DEA agents showed that it contained 23.7 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Second Sale</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second sale, which took place on October 27, 1998, was also a face-to-face purchase by Mozynski. Mozynski met Powers at 6 Denny Street to purchase three ounces of crack cocaine from Henderson. After leaving Denny Street, Mozynski and Powers met Agent Guerard in the car he used for undercover work. Agent Guerard said he was a customer of Mozynski. Powers told Guerard to drive to a nearby location where Powers and Mozynski got out of the car. Mozynski and Powers met Henderson in the basement of Henderson's apartment building at 27 Wachusett Street. Mozynski paid Henderson $3,000 and was given a piece of newspaper containing a plastic bag. Mozynski then delivered the package to Agent Guerard, who searched him. The subsequent chemical analysis showed the substance in the plastic bag contained 73.2 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Third Sale</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third sale took place on November 3, 1998. Mozynski contacted Powers prior to November 3. Powers told him to contact Butter directly by his pager, which he did. Butter returned the page; they talked over the phone and agreed to another drug sale using the same format as the prior sale. On November 3, Mozynski met Powers at 6 Denny Street. They both met Agent Guerard in his car. Powers and Mozynski again met Henderson in the basement of Henderson's apartment building at 27 Wachusett Street. Mozynski gave Henderson $3,000 and Henderson gave Mozynski a package. The package was delivered to Agent Guerard. Subsequent analysis disclosed that the contents of the package contained 81.09 grams of cocaine. A DEA agent took photos of Powers and Mozynski entering 27 Wachusett Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>The Fourth Sale</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were actually two more sales. On November 16, Powers met with Henderson on the street while Mozynski waited a short distance away. It was dark outside and Mozynski could not positively identify Henderson. Henderson gave Powers a package, which Powers gave to Mozynski. Analysis of the package disclosed that it contained wax, not crack cocaine. Mozynski called Butter from Carey's apartment the evening of the wax sale. Butter said that he would give Mozynski the crack cocaine he owed him. Mozynski then met with Agent Guerard and gave him Butter's pager number, which Guerard called. The agent spoke to Butter, who promised that he would give Guerard one ounce of crack cocaine the next day, November 17, and two and one half ounces the day after, November 18. The beeper number Agent Guerard used to contact Butter was listed to \"D. Henderson\" of \"27 Wachusett Street, Worcester, MA.\" Henderson, whose middle name is David, lived at \"27 Wachusett Street\" in Worcester. On November 17, Powers met Henderson at 27 Wachusett Street and Henderson gave her a package to give Mozynski. Powers then met Mozynski and handed him the package which Mozynski gave to Agent Guerard. An analysis showed that the package contained 19.68 grams of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to this evidence there was testimony by Powers that she bought crack cocaine from Henderson on a daily basis throughout the period of the conspiracy; that at times she made purchases of crack cocaine several times a day; that she usually purchased crack cocaine one ounce at a time which she sold to her customers. Powers further testified that Carey regularly bought crack cocaine from Henderson during the period of the conspiracy. She also testified that Carey either used the crack cocaine himself or resold it to his own customers. Powers and Carey lived together during most of the conspiracy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>THE ISSUES</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the issues in the order set forth in appellant's brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Admissibility of the Identification Testimony</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant filed a Motion to Suppress Identifications. There was a hearing on the motion prior to trial. The district court denied the motion by a margin notation, \"Motion Denied.\" There were no findings of facts or rulings of law. \"We will uphold a district court's decision to deny a suppression motion if the decision is supported by any reasonable view of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Campa,</i> 234 F.3d 733, 737 (1st Cir.2000). \"Our review of a district court's decision to grant or deny a suppression motion is plenary.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>United States v. McCarthy,</i> 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an additional factor, however, that must be addressed in our consideration of the pretrial review of the suppression motion. There were two identification witnesses who testified at the hearing, Powers and Mozynski. In January 1999, Mozynski was shown a single booking photo of the defendant. Mozynski was asked \"Who is this?\" He replied, \"It looks like Butter.\" In mid-February 1999, Powers was shown the same photo. Powers was asked if it was \"Butter.\" She answered, \"Yes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has dealt directly with this problem. In <i>Simmons v. United States,</i> 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968), the Court held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the hazards of initial identification by photograph, this procedure has been used widely and effectively in criminal law enforcement, from the standpoint both of apprehending offenders and of sparing innocent suspects the ignominy of arrest by allowing eyewitnesses to exonerate them through scrutiny of photographs. The danger that use of the technique may result in convictions based on misidentification may be substantially lessened by a course of cross-examination at trial which exposes to the jury the method's potential for error. We are unwilling to prohibit its employment, either in the exercise of our supervisory power or, still less, as a matter of constitutional requirement. Instead, <i>we hold that each case must be considered on its own facts, and that convictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside on that ground only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise</i> <i>to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). We have, of course, followed this teaching:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before excluding identification evidence, the court must be persuaded that there was a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. A court must also be mindful that it is only in extraordinary cases that identification evidence should be withheld from the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. de Jesus-Rios,</i> 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir.1993) (citations and quotation marks omitted); <i>see also United States v. Watson,</i> 76 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1996); <i>United States v. Guzman-Rivera,</i> 990 F.2d 681, 682 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We use a two-step test to make this determination. <i>See United States v. Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2002). The first step is to decide whether there was an impermissibly suggestive procedure. <i>See id.</i> We skip this step because the government has conceded that the photographic procedure was suggestive. Our next step is to \"decide whether the identification itself was reliable under the totality of the circumstances, notwithstanding the suggestive procedure.\" <i>Id.</i> at 10-11 (quoting <i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 6). <i>Neil v. Biggers,</i> 409 U.S. 188, 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972), is the keystone case on the determination of identification reliability. It enumerates five factors in the analysis: (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness' degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the defendant; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We make our analysis bearing in mind that \"reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony.\" <i>Manson v. Brathwaite,</i> 432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977). We start with the testimony of Mozynski. As far as the first factor, Mozynski had at least three opportunities to view the defendant closely. This was not a single event crime. There were three face-to-face sales by the defendant to Mozynski. In addition, Mozynski had seen Henderson on one or two occasions before he started working for the government as an informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next factor is the witness' degree of attention. The evidence demonstrates that Mozynski had a sufficient degree of attention; he testified at trial to specific details about the crack cocaine transactions with Henderson. Mozynski, for example, described how in one transaction Henderson wore a black, gold and white football jersey and a baseball hat; Mozynski also remembered receiving the crack cocaine in a plastic bag wrapped in newspaper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third factor is the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the criminal. Mozynski's prior description of Henderson was not perfect. Mozynski described Henderson as weighing between 175 and 180 pounds when he actually weighed 150 pounds. Mozynski reported that Henderson was five feet, ten inches tall, when Henderson claims he is five feet, nine inches tall. Mozynski also said that Henderson had a medium complexion; Henderson says that he has a dark complexion. We are satisfied, however, that the other reliability factors are sufficiently persuasive to defeat any suspicion of unreliability raised by Mozynski's prior description. <i>See United States v. Flores-Rivera,</i> 56 F.3d 319, 331 (1st Cir.1995) (other reliability criteria under <i>Biggers</i> sufficient to overcome unreliability engendered by one factor); <i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 7 n. 1 (upholding district court's finding that identification was reliable under <i>Biggers</i> where there was no prior description of the assailant but the witness had ample opportunity to focus on suspect and identified him within minutes of the assault).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth factor, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at confrontation, does not give us reason to pause. Mozynski \"remained steadfast in the positiveness of his identification[],\" despite defense counsel's rigorous cross-examination. <i>Souza v. Howard,</i> 488 F.2d 462, 465-66 (1st Cir.1973). The fifth <i>Biggers</i> factor is the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. The last time Mozynski observed Henderson was in November 1998. Mozynski identified Henderson's photograph in January 1999. The six day jury trial ended on April 30, 2001. We do not find that this lapse of time militates against the reliability of Mozynski's in-court identification given the strength of the other factors. <i>See Flores-Rivera,</i> 56 F.3d at 331 (seven year gap between crime and identification permissible because other reliability criteria were sufficiently persuasive); <i>Drougas,</i> 748 F.2d at 28 (five year gap between crime and photographic identification permissible because witness spent considerable time with defendant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our thorough review of the record and application of the pertinent law to the facts we rule that Mozynski's identification of Henderson was sufficiently reliable to overcome the admittedly suggestive photo showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson advances a plethora of reasons why Mozynski's identification should not pass muster: he argues that Mozynski did not know the defendant by his actual name; that Mozynski lied to the government when he said that he had met with Butter on at least one occasion; that Mozynski wore glasses because he suffered from blurred vision and double vision; that when shown the photo, Mozynski stated that \"[i]t looks like `Butter';\" that Mozynski was mistaken as to the weight and complexion of the defendant; and that \"during the entire period of Mozynski's observations of Butter, he suffered a worsening problem of memory loss.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion regarding the reliability of Mozynski's identification makes a detailed examination of each argument unnecessary. For as the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surely, we cannot say that under all the circumstances of this case there is a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Short of that point, such evidence is for the jury to weigh. We are content to rely upon the good sense and judgment of American juries, for evidence with some element of untrustworthiness is customary grist for the jury mill. Juries are not so susceptible that they cannot measure intelligently the weight of identification testimony that has some questionable feature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Manson,</i> 432 U.S. at 116, 97 S.Ct. 2243 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor need we dwell too long on Powers' identification of defendant. There was evidence from which it could be found that she had known Henderson going back to 1994. Powers bought crack cocaine from Henderson for her own use and resale. She saw Henderson at her apartment daily during a six month period in 1994, at times spending an hour or more with him. Powers was present at all crack cocaine sales to Mozynski, as an ally of Henderson. During October and November 1998, Powers saw Henderson every day. Powers' identification of Henderson at the pretrial hearing and at the jury trial was positive and firm. In addition, we do not think the gap in time between Powers' last transaction with Henderson and her identification of Henderson's photograph calls into question the reliability of her in-court identification, particularly given her close interaction with Henderson. <i>See Flores-Rivera,</i> 56 F.3d at 331; <i>Drougas,</i> 748 F.2d at 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like those made regarding Mozynski, all of the defendant's arguments pertaining to Powers focus on her reliability: that she was under the influence of cocaine during the four sales; that she did not know the amount of money involved in the sales; that she was unable to tell how the cocaine was packaged. Suffice it to say that all of these factors were brought to the jury's attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rule that Powers' testimony was properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Admissibility of the Pawn Shop Receipt</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson alleges that the court below committed \"constitutional error\" when it admitted into evidence a pawn shop sales receipt found in Henderson's wallet when he was arrested. The pawn shop receipt was signed by Henderson and indicated that Henderson pawned a watch on March 21, 1998, and redeemed it by paying $320 on November 6, 1998, just days after the November 3, 1998 drug sale. While Henderson objected at trial to the admission of the receipt, he did so on relevancy, not constitutional, grounds. If a new basis for objection is raised for the first time on appeal, that ground is not subject to harmless error review, and may only be reviewed for plain error. <i>See United States v. Walsh,</i> 75 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1996). Review for plain error requires four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding. <i>See United States v. Gomez,</i> 255 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson attacks the admission of the pawn shop receipt on the grounds that it both impermissibly shifted the burden of proof by requiring him to explain where he got the money to redeem the watch and, at the same time, constituted a \"direct statement\" to the jurors that they could make an inference against him based on his choice not to testify. Both contentions lack merit. Henderson overlooks the fact that the admission of <i>any</i> evidence offered by the government in a criminal trial gives the defendant a reason to testify if he has a basis for rebutting the government's theory of the case. The jury was properly instructed both as to the government's burden of proof and as to the defendant's right to remain silent. In light of these instructions, we fail to see how the admission of the pawn shop sales receipt, in and of itself, impermissibly shifted the burden of proof, or how it invited the jury to draw an inference of guilt from the defendant's choice not to testify. The district court's admission of the pawn shop sales receipt did not constitute plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Remaining Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we are satisfied that the eyewitness testimony (including the identification evidence) and pawn shop sales receipt were sufficient to support Henderson's conviction on all five counts, we need only address whether there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict involving proximity to a school zone under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860. In determining the evidentiary sufficiency of a guilty verdict, \"the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Woodward,</i> 149 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir.1998). \"The scope of review is over the totality of the evidence, both direct and circumstantial.\" <i>United States v. Czubinski,</i> 106 F.3d 1069, 1073 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson avers that the district court erred when it did not grant his Rule 29 motion concerning the school zone violations attendant to the two transactions that took place at 27 Wachusett Street. In particular, Henderson is \"perplexed\" by the fact that the district court denied the motion even though Agent Anderson testified that the distance from the Elm Park Community School to 27 Wachusett Street was 1,095 feet, which he measured by walking the sidewalks. As Henderson correctly observes, 1,095 feet exceeds the statutory 1,000 feet needed to support a conviction in connection with section 860.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Be that as it may, Henderson neglects the fact that the proper way to determine whether a sale was 1,000 feet or less from a school is by measuring a straight line, rather than a pedestrian travel route. <i>See United States v. Soler,</i> 275 F.3d 146, 155 n. 6 (1st Cir.2002) (explaining that \"the schoolyard statute envisions straight-line rather than pedestrian-route measurements\"). Here, the government introduced into evidence, without objection, a map of the Elm Park Community School area which provided a detailed illustration of the distance between 27 Wachusett Street, where the drug transactions took place, and the school. This map demonstrated that each of the drug transactions occurred within 1,000 feet of the school; the government, in closing argument, pointed out as much to the jury. We do not hesitate to find that this evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>The Five Year Limitation Contained in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(e)is Constitutional</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 2001, the government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a), notifying Henderson that the government would seek a twenty year minimum sentence based upon his 1991 South Carolina state court conviction for drug trafficking. The information charged that, on or about June 13, 1991, Henderson was convicted in South Carolina state court for distribution of cocaine. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(e) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part may challenge the validity of any prior conviction alleged under this section which occurred more than five years before the date of the information alleging such prior conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because his prior conviction occurred more than five years before the filing of the government's information, the district court concluded that the plain language of section 851(e) precluded Henderson from denying the conviction, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 851(b), or challenging its validity, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 851(c). Based upon this prior conviction, Henderson was sentenced to a mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we have previously recognized that section 851(e) bars an appellant from challenging the validity of prior convictions that are more than five years old, <i>see United States v. Romero-Carrion,</i> 54 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.1995), we have not, until now, been asked to decide whether section 851(e) is constitutional. Henderson now poses the following question of first impression in this circuit: Does the five year limitation period set forth in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(e) violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution? We hold that it does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review de novo constitutional challenges to federal statutes.\" <i>United</i> <i>States v. Robinson,</i> 137 F.3d 652, 653 (1st Cir.1998). As an initial matter, Henderson faces the hurdle that no court has sustained a constitutional challenge to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(e), and at least six circuits have found the provision constitutional on both due process and equal protection grounds. See <i>United States v. Reed,</i> 141 F.3d 644, 652 (6th Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Prior,</i> 107 F.3d 654, 660-61 (8th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 522 U.S. 824, 118 S.Ct. 84, 139 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997); <i>United States v. Gonzales,</i> 79 F.3d 413, 426-27 (5th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 519 U.S. 869, 117 S.Ct. 183, 136 L.Ed.2d 122 (1996); <i>United States v. Arango-Montoya,</i> 61 F.3d 1331, 1338 (7th Cir.1995); <i>United States v. McChristian,</i> 47 F.3d 1499, 1503 (9th Cir.1995); <i>United States v.

He urges us to depart from this precedent on the ground that some of these circuits have found section 851(e) constitutional based upon a misplaced reliance on <i>Custis v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 485, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994). According to Henderson, <i>Custis</i> considered only the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), and not section 851(e), and therefore has no bearing on our determination. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Custis,</i> the Supreme Court examined section 924(e)(1), which provides no statutory right to collaterally challenge state court convictions that are used to enhance federal sentences under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984. Section 924(e)(1) raises the penalty for possession of a firearm by a felon from a maximum of 10 years in prison to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum of life in prison without parole if the defendant \"has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\" The Court held that Congress' omission of language authorizing collateral attacks in section 924(e)(1) indicated that it did not intend to give defendants the right to challenge the validity of prior convictions under this statute. <i>Custis,</i> 511 U.S. at 497, 114 S.Ct. 1732. Thus, if Congress has the power to foreclose collateral challenges by merely omitting statutory language that authorizes such attacks, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), then Congress can certainly preclude collateral challenges after five years where it explicitly includes such language in a statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding, Henderson counters that once Congress allows the use of collateral challenges, as it has for convictions less than five years old under section 851(e), any conditions imposed on the use of those challenges must accommodate fundamental liberties. He claims that the selection of a particular number of years to establish a time bar is patently arbitrary, and that the five year limitations period violates the Equal Protection Clause because it unfairly discriminates against those who commit a federal offense more than five years after a prior conviction. His arguments are not well taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ban against challenging convictions over five years need only be supported by a rational legislative purpose because no fundamental right or suspect class is at issue in this case. <i>See Reed,</i> 107 F.3d at 661. The five year limitation on the right to collaterally challenge prior convictions at sentencing has a rational basis in light of both the administrative difficulties inherent in challenges to prior convictions, such as lost or destroyed records, unavailable witnesses, and fading memories, and the interest in finality. <i>See, e.g., Arango-Montoya,</i> 61 F.3d at 1338. We therefore have no difficulty concluding that section 851(e) does not violate Henderson's right to due process and equal protection of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Closing Argument</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson also takes issue with the government's closing argument. Specifically, he urges that the prosecutor improperly persuaded the jury to convict him by allegedly interjecting his personal opinion of the evidence, vouching for a witness, shifting the burden of proof and inflaming the jury. We address each of his arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the defendant made no objection to the government's closing argument at trial, the standard of review is \"plain error.\" <i>United States v. Hernandez-Vega,</i> 235 F.3d 705, 710 (1st Cir.2000). Henderson faces a high hurdle because it is established that plain error review \"is ordinarily limited to `blockbusters' and does not consider `the ordinary backfires &#8212; whether or not harmful to a litigant's cause &#8212; which may mar a trial record.'\" <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.1987). Henderson bears the burden of demonstrating that the prosecutor's remarks were prejudicial and affected his substantial rights. <i>Id.</i> at 55. Even then, error will not be recognized unless it caused a \"miscarriage of justice\" or seriously undermined the \"integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We consider whether the prosecutor's remarks had any likely impact on the jury based on the entire record, including the closing argument presented by the defense. <i>See Joyner,</i> 191 F.3d at 55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Personal Opinion of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Henderson's argument that the prosecutor improperly interjected his personal opinion of the evidence when he characterized as \"absurd\" the defense's assertion that Powers was under the influence of drugs during the transactions. A prosecutor \"may attempt to persuade the jury to draw suggested inferences unfavorable to the defense, as long as the prosecutor's own opinion as to the witness' credibility is not urged on the jury.\" <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 982 F.2d 681, 683 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the prosecutor offered no opinion concerning the credibility of the defense witnesses. Instead, during his closing argument, the prosecutor responded to a persistent suggestion made by the defendant that Powers had been on drugs during the transactions and thus could not remember the detailed information she provided during her testimony. The prosecutor did this by asking the jury to focus on the tape recordings made of those transactions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And don't the tapes prove to you how absurd the defendant's claims are that Powers was too high or too crazy to have accurately perceived the events which occurred during the conspiracy? Don't the tapes, in fact, prove that Powers became suspicious that Special Agent Guerard might be a cop right after she met him?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that the prosecutor asked the jury to consider whether the evidence before it &#8212; tape recordings in which Powers correctly perceived that Mozynski's alleged drug customer was an undercover police officer &#8212; refuted defendant's contention that Powers' mind was too altered to observe and remember the drug transactions. There was nothing improper in the government identifying for the jury a specific item of evidence and arguing that the jury should infer from that piece of evidence that the defendant's theory was not worthy of belief. <i>See United States v. Mount,</i> 896 F.2d 612, 625 (1st Cir.1990); <i>United States v. Garcia,</i> 818 F.2d 136, 143 (1st Cir.1987). Accordingly, the district court did not commit plain error by allowing the prosecutor's statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson challenges other statements in the government's closing on the ground that the prosecutor again offered his personal opinion of the evidence when he told the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Look at the evidence with a very stern and suspicious eye. And if you do that, you'll have no doubt that the government has sustained its burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson says these statements implied that the jury \"could not return a verdict of not guilty without failing to consider the evidence closely.\" What Henderson fails to consider is that a prosecutor has a right to comment on the plausibility of the defense theory. <i>See Garcia,</i> 818 F.2d at 143. Here, the prosecutor suggested that a careful review of the evidence would reveal that the government's theory of the case was more plausible than Henderson's theory of the case. This suggestion properly directed the jury's attention to the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also disagree with Henderson that the prosecutor interjected his personal opinion of the evidence in rebuttal when he commented \"if you ask the wrong questions, you get the wrong answers,\" and \"if you ask the right questions in this case, there's no doubt but that their clients will be convicted.\" These comments were not inappropriate because \"[a]lthough it is the jury's job to draw inferences, there is nothing improper in the Government's suggesting which inferences should be drawn.\" <i>Mount,</i> 896 F.2d at 625.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the prosecutor argued that Henderson's theory of the case directed the jury to the \"wrong\" questions, whereas the government's theory directed it to the \"right\" questions; presumably, these were questions based on the evidence. We see no reason why the prosecutor should be prohibited from suggesting that the government's theory of the case did a better job of focusing on the evidence. The prosecutor was entitled to argue that the jury should look at the evidence to determine Henderson's guilt. We see no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Vouching</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson next maintains that the prosecutor vouched for Powers in his closing argument when he stated that Powers \"repeatedly told you that she was told to tell the truth, to tell the truth when she took the stand.\" A prosecutor may not place \"the prestige of the government behind a witness by making personal assurances about the witness' credibility.\" <i>United States v. Neal,</i> 36 F.3d 1190, 1207 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were no such personal assurances from the government in this case. The prosecutor's statement merely summarized Powers' prior testimony, and was within the accepted bounds of argument. <i>See United States v. Auch,</i> 187 F.3d 125, 131 (1st Cir.1999). We note that the prosecutor did not express his personal opinion about Powers' credibility; nor did the prosecutor suggest that special circumstances, such as Powers' plea agreement, ensured her honesty. <i>See United States v. Wihbey,</i> 75 F.3d 761, 772 (1st Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Dockray,</i> 943 F.2d 152, 156 (1st Cir.1991). Furthermore, the prosecutor's statement came after defense counsel suggested in cross-examination that Powers had been coached by the government. We find that the prosecutor's statement did not constitute improper vouching.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Shifting the Burden of Proof</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson also complains that the prosecutor improperly commented on his right to remain silent when he responded to defense allegations that the government had failed to call a supposedly percipient witness. It is established that any comment by a prosecutor on a defendant's exercise of the right to remain silent violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against self-incrimination. <i>See Wihbey,</i> 75 F.3d at 769.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the closing argument, defense counsel suggested that the government was hiding something by not producing Lynn Cappulett, an individual whom Powers and Mozynski each identified as having been at Carey's residence during the first drug transaction on October 19:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The government] never tracked down Lynn Cappulett. Mozynski and Powers both said that she was at 6 Denny Street on October 19, 1998. And according to Mozynski the first deal happened right in front of her eyes. Yet, did you hear any evidence that Agent Anderson or Agent Guerard ever tried to find her or talk to her? This was an eyewitness to what went on inside the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In rebuttal, the prosecutor replied:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where is Lynn Cappulett, both counsel ask you? Well, that's a good question. Why don't they tell us? Maybe defense counsel could have interviewed Lynn Cappulett.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's response was not such that \"jurors would probably interpret it as commentary on the accused's failure to take the stand,\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 979 (1st Cir.1995), particularly because it was made in rebuttal <i>after</i> defense counsel had themselves raised the issue. <i>See United States v. Nickens,</i> 955 F.2d 112, 122 (1st Cir.1992) (evaluating effect of statement made in rebuttal argument). Under the invited response rule, if the prosecutor's remarks were \"invited,\" and \"did no more than respond substantially in order to right the scale,\" such comments do not warrant reversal. <i>Id.</i> (internal quotations omitted). Here, defense counsel invited a response by raising the issue of Lynn Cappulett's whereabouts in the first instance. The prosecutor's remarks were limited and addressed only the defense counsel's own comments. <i>See id.</i> at 123. Thus, there was no plain error when the district court did not, on its own initiative, strike portions of the government's rebuttal argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Inflaming the Passions of the Jury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree with Henderson that the district court erred when it did not, on its own initiative, strike the prosecutor's description of Henderson as \"a successful businessman in the business of crack cocaine,\" who wanted a \"windfall\" verdict in his favor. When the evidence of a defendant's guilt is strong, a court should be very reluctant to find plain error in \"misguided rhetoric.\" <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1188 (1st Cir.1993). Under plain error review, improper remarks are grounds for reversal only if they \"so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotations omitted). We place a prosecutor's remarks in context when determining whether they were inappropriate. <i>See id.</i> at 1187.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson posits that the prosecutor's comments improperly appealed to the passions of the jury. To the contrary, we fail to see how these remarks would distract the jury from focusing on whether the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See United States v. Manning,</i> 23 F.3d 570, 574 (1st Cir.1994). Defense counsel suggested in his opening that Henderson was a legitimate businessman; the prosecutor countered that suggestion by arguing that Henderson was in the business of selling drugs. Here, defense counsel invited a response by suggesting that Henderson \"worked hard\" in the \"music promotion business,\" and was \"successful.\" The prosecutor, in turn, offered a reply that was not only supported by the evidence but was properly limited and addressed only the defense counsel's own comments. <i>See Nickens,</i> 955 F.2d at 123. There was nothing improper in this suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the district court err when it permitted, as Henderson claims, the prosecutor to tell the jury that it could convict him \"even if they found that the defendant was not the distributor of the cocaine.\" This is somewhat misleading. In his closing, Henderson's counsel suggested that someone other than Henderson was the crack cocaine supplier. The prosecutor responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What are the odds that there was a different supplier in this case in light of the following facts: First, a person that you might well find at a minimum bears a striking resemblance to this individual, even if you don't find that it's him, walks into 6 Denny Street at the exact time of a crack distribution on October 19th. Coincidence?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When read in its proper context, it is apparent that this comment, while unartfully expressed, is innocuous. It certainly would not suggest to the jury that it could convict the defendant even if it found that the person alleged to be the supplier of the cocaine was not the defendant. Furthermore, the court's instructions to the jury clearly explained that the ultimate question for the jury was whether Henderson was the supplier of crack cocaine on the dates in question. We conclude that Henderson's conviction should not be disturbed on the basis of these statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also disagree with Henderson that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the passions of the jury during rebuttal by commenting, with regard to Henderson's defense theory, \"[w]hat is this, the Jerry Springer show?\" Given the strong evidence against Henderson, the prosecutor's \"misguided rhetoric,\" <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1188, if it was even that, does not rise to the level of plain error. <i>See Joyner,</i> 191 F.3d at 55. We conclude that Henderson's conviction should not be disturbed on account of the prosecutor's reference to the Jerry Springer show.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>Co-conspirator's Statements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson argues, in summary fashion, that the only evidence that indicates he engaged in any conspiracy was the suggestive identifications of Mozynski and Powers, which, according to Henderson, should have been excluded in the first instance. Because his challenge to the co-conspirator statements is premised solely on the identifications being improperly admitted, we need not consider the admissibility of these statements in light of our conclusion that the district court did not err in admitting the identifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, we are satisfied that even without the identification testimony the evidence was sufficient for a jury to conclude that Henderson was part of a conspiracy to sell crack cocaine. This includes: the videotape of Henderson taken by the DEA at 6 Denny Street at the October 19, 1998 drug transaction; Agent Anderson's identification of Henderson; the fact that the pager used in the drug transactions was subscribed to by D. Henderson of 27 Wachusett Street in Worcester; and the fact that Henderson lived at 27 Wachusett Street, where two of the drug transactions took place. This evidence, aside from the identifications of Mozynski and Powers, was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find Henderson guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See</i> <i>United States v. Loder,</i> 23 F.3d 586, 589 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G. <i>Jury Instructions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson alleges three errors in the district court's jury instructions, which he believes \"incorrectly diminished the evidentiary requirements for finding the defendant guilty.\" Specifically, he challenges the jury instructions concerning identification, aiding and abetting and conspiracy. We review for \"plain error\" because Henderson did not raise his objections to the jury instructions at trial. <i>See Gomez,</i> 255 F.3d at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the identification instruction, we begin by noting that the district court provided a lengthy instruction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Identification testimony is an expression of belief or impression by the witness. Its value depends on the opportunity the witness had to observe the offender at the time of the offense and to make a reliable identification later. Whether the witness had an adequate and effective opportunity to observe the offender at the time of the offense may be affected by such matters as: (1) how long or short a time was available; (2) how far or close the witness was to the scene of the offense; (3) how good was the lighting; (4) whether the witness was under the influence of drugs; and (5) whether, and the extent to which, the witness had occasion in the past to see or know the person identified. If the identification by the witness may have been influenced by circumstances under which an image of the defendant was presented to the witness for identification, you may consider those circumstances as well. You may also take into account that an identification made by picking the defendant out of a group of similar individuals is generally more reliable than one which results from the presentation of an image of the defendant alone to the witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson, without citing any authority, complains that this instruction \"fell far short of the detail required by this case.\" We disagree. Contrary to Henderson's view, the instruction was thorough and suitably focused on the reliability of the identification as contemplated by the case law. <i>See Manson,</i> 432 U.S. at 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243 (\"[R]eliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony\"); <i>Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d at 10-11; <i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 6. The district court was not required to accept Henderson's alternative instruction because its own instruction was proper. <i>See United States v. Arcadipane,</i> 41 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1994) (a defendant \"is not entitled to the nuances of phrasing that he finds most soothing\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson further avers that the district court's aiding and abetting instruction permitted the jury to convict without finding specific intent. <i>See Loder,</i> 23 F.3d at 591 (discussing specific intent requirement for aiding and abetting). In order to sustain a conviction for aiding and abetting the government must prove, in addition to the commission of the offense by the principal, that the defendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act, and intended to help the principal. <i>See United States v. Spinney,</i> 65 F.3d 231, 235 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this in mind, the district court instructed the jury that, inter alia, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, first that someone committed the charged crime, and second,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that the defendant then under consideration willfully associated himself in some way with the crime and willfully participated in it as he would in something he wished to bring about. This means that the government must prove that the defendant consciously shared the other person's knowledge of the underlying criminal act and intended to help him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is all the law requires; the district court's instruction adequately set forth the elements of aiding and abetting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Henderson asserts that the conspiracy instruction allowed the jury to convict him without finding the necessary intent. This argument is without merit. To prove intent for conspiracy, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to join in the conspiracy and intended the substantive offense to be committed. <i>See Gomez,</i> 255 F.3d at 35. The district court properly instructed the jury on the requisite intent to support a conspiracy conviction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government must prove two kinds of intent beyond a reasonable doubt before Chamond Henderson ... can be said to have willfully joined the conspiracy: an intent to agree and an intent, whether reasonable or not, that the underlying crime be committed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This formulation accurately states the requisite intent needed for a conspiracy conviction. <i>See United States v. Rivera-Santiago,</i> 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir.1989). Accordingly, we are confident that the jury instructions do not constitute plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">H. <i>Apprendi</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson's last argument is that the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), requires the government to prove his 1991 South Carolina conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. Our review is de novo. <i>See United States v. Sacko,</i> 247 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have consistently observed with a \"regularity bordering on the monotonous,\" that <i>Apprendi</i> does not apply to sentencing enhancements based on prior convictions. <i>United States v. Moore,</i> 286 F.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also United States v. Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d 278, 294 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Gomez-Estrada,</i> 273 F.3d 400, 402 (1st Cir.2001).

Powers entered into a plea bargain with the government and testified at the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>THE EVIDENCE</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the facts as the jury rationally could have found them, consistent with record support. In October 1998 the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") began an investigation of crack cocaine trafficking in Worcester, Massachusetts. The DEA contacted a known crack cocaine user, Joseph Mozynski (\"Mozynski\"), to serve as a cooperating witness in its investigation. Mozynski knew Henderson and had seen him once or twice before becoming a cooperating witness. Mozynski facilitated four purchases of crack cocaine from Henderson during the course of the investigation. Henderson and Mozynski were present at all four sales. Two of these four purchases were made in the basement of the apartment building in which Henderson lived, 27 Wachusett Street. The other sales took place within two blocks of Wachusett Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The First Sale</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sale occurred on October 19, 1998. It took place at 6 Denny Street in Worcester. Carey and Powers were living there at the time. Mozynski talked to Carey about wanting to buy crack cocaine and was told by Carey that he could get it from a person called \"Butter.\" The deal was that Mozynski would pay $1,200 for 25 grams of crack cocaine. Carey was to get $200 for setting up the sale. It was agreed that Mozynski would pick up the crack cocaine at 6 Denny Street on October 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that day, Mozynski met with DEA Special Agents Timothy Anderson and Robert Guerard. They searched him and then wired him with a concealed monitoring device, enabling the DEA to tape record the drug transactions, and gave him $1,200. The agents watched Mozynski enter 6 Denny Street. After he was inside the house, he was met by Powers, Carey, and a woman named Lynn Cappulett. Mozynski showed Powers the $1,200 and Powers told Carey to page Butter. After speaking to Butter on the phone and telling him that Mozynski was here with the money, Powers told Mozynski that Butter would be there within five minutes. Agent Anderson videotaped Henderson walking down Denny Street and then turning into the driveway at 6 Denny Street. Mozynski gave Henderson the $1,200 and received from him a package. Mozynski and Henderson discussed future transactions, and Henderson told Mozynski to contact him only through Powers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A short time after Mozynski had entered 6 Denny Street, Agent Anderson observed and videotaped him leaving the premises. Mozynski went straight to the DEA agents and gave them the package Henderson had given him. Mozynski also made a written statement describing the events that took place inside 6 Denny Street. As part of the statement, Mozynski described Henderson as five feet, ten inches tall, 175 or 180 pounds and of medium complexion. A couple of minutes later, Agent Anderson observed and videotaped Henderson leaving 6 Denny Street. A chemical analysis of the contents of the package given by Mozynski to the DEA agents showed that it contained 23.7 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Second Sale</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second sale, which took place on October 27, 1998, was also a face-to-face purchase by Mozynski. Mozynski met Powers at 6 Denny Street to purchase three ounces of crack cocaine from Henderson. After leaving Denny Street, Mozynski and Powers met Agent Guerard in the car he used for undercover work. Agent Guerard said he was a customer of Mozynski. Powers told Guerard to drive to a nearby location where Powers and Mozynski got out of the car. Mozynski and Powers met Henderson in the basement of Henderson's apartment building at 27 Wachusett Street. Mozynski paid Henderson $3,000 and was given a piece of newspaper containing a plastic bag. Mozynski then delivered the package to Agent Guerard, who searched him. The subsequent chemical analysis showed the substance in the plastic bag contained 73.2 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Third Sale</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third sale took place on November 3, 1998. Mozynski contacted Powers prior to November 3. Powers told him to contact Butter directly by his pager, which he did. Butter returned the page; they talked over the phone and agreed to another drug sale using the same format as the prior sale. On November 3, Mozynski met Powers at 6 Denny Street. They both met Agent Guerard in his car. Powers and Mozynski again met Henderson in the basement of Henderson's apartment building at 27 Wachusett Street. Mozynski gave Henderson $3,000 and Henderson gave Mozynski a package. The package was delivered to Agent Guerard. Subsequent analysis disclosed that the contents of the package contained 81.09 grams of cocaine. A DEA agent took photos of Powers and Mozynski entering 27 Wachusett Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>The Fourth Sale</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were actually two more sales. On November 16, Powers met with Henderson on the street while Mozynski waited a short distance away. It was dark outside and Mozynski could not positively identify Henderson. Henderson gave Powers a package, which Powers gave to Mozynski. Analysis of the package disclosed that it contained wax, not crack cocaine. Mozynski called Butter from Carey's apartment the evening of the wax sale. Butter said that he would give Mozynski the crack cocaine he owed him. Mozynski then met with Agent Guerard and gave him Butter's pager number, which Guerard called. The agent spoke to Butter, who promised that he would give Guerard one ounce of crack cocaine the next day, November 17, and two and one half ounces the day after, November 18. The beeper number Agent Guerard used to contact Butter was listed to \"D. Henderson\" of \"27 Wachusett Street, Worcester, MA.\" Henderson, whose middle name is David, lived at \"27 Wachusett Street\" in Worcester. On November 17, Powers met Henderson at 27 Wachusett Street and Henderson gave her a package to give Mozynski. Powers then met Mozynski and handed him the package which Mozynski gave to Agent Guerard. An analysis showed that the package contained 19.68 grams of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to this evidence there was testimony by Powers that she bought crack cocaine from Henderson on a daily basis throughout the period of the conspiracy; that at times she made purchases of crack cocaine several times a day; that she usually purchased crack cocaine one ounce at a time which she sold to her customers. Powers further testified that Carey regularly bought crack cocaine from Henderson during the period of the conspiracy. She also testified that Carey either used the crack cocaine himself or resold it to his own customers. Powers and Carey lived together during most of the conspiracy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>THE ISSUES</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the issues in the order set forth in appellant's brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Admissibility of the Identification Testimony</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant filed a Motion to Suppress Identifications. There was a hearing on the motion prior to trial. The district court denied the motion by a margin notation, \"Motion Denied.\" There were no findings of facts or rulings of law. \"We will uphold a district court's decision to deny a suppression motion if the decision is supported by any reasonable view of the evidence.\" <i>United States v.

There were two identification witnesses who testified at the hearing, Powers and Mozynski. In January 1999, Mozynski was shown a single booking photo of the defendant. Mozynski was asked \"Who is this?\" He replied, \"It looks like Butter.\" In mid-February 1999, Powers was shown the same photo. Powers was asked if it was \"Butter.\" She answered, \"Yes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has dealt directly with this problem.

The danger that use of the technique may result in convictions based on misidentification may be substantially lessened by a course of cross-examination at trial which exposes to the jury the method's potential for error. We are unwilling to prohibit its employment, either in the exercise of our supervisory power or, still less, as a matter of constitutional requirement. Instead, <i>we hold that each case must be considered on its own facts, and that convictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside on that ground only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise</i> <i>to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).

The first step is to decide whether there was an impermissibly suggestive procedure. <i>See id.</i> We skip this step because the government has conceded that the photographic procedure was suggestive.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span> (1972), is the keystone case on the determination of identification reliability. It enumerates five factors in the analysis: (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness' degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the defendant; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We make our analysis bearing in mind that \"reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony.\" <i>Manson v. Brathwaite,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109693\"><a href=\"/opinion/109693/manson-v-brathwaite/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 114, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109693\"><a href=\"/opinion/109693/manson-v-brathwaite/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2243</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109693\"><a href=\"/opinion/109693/manson-v-brathwaite/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span> (1977). We start with the testimony of Mozynski. As far as the first factor, Mozynski had at least three opportunities to view the defendant closely. This was not a single event crime. There were three face-to-face sales by the defendant to Mozynski. In addition, Mozynski had seen Henderson on one or two occasions before he started working for the government as an informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next factor is the witness' degree of attention. The evidence demonstrates that Mozynski had a sufficient degree of attention; he testified at trial to specific details about the crack cocaine transactions with Henderson. Mozynski, for example, described how in one transaction Henderson wore a black, gold and white football jersey and a baseball hat; Mozynski also remembered receiving the crack cocaine in a plastic bag wrapped in newspaper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third factor is the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the criminal. Mozynski's prior description of Henderson was not perfect. Mozynski described Henderson as weighing between 175 and 180 pounds when he actually weighed 150 pounds. Mozynski reported that Henderson was five feet, ten inches tall, when Henderson claims he is five feet, nine inches tall. Mozynski also said that Henderson had a medium complexion; Henderson says that he has a dark complexion. We are satisfied, however, that the other reliability factors are sufficiently persuasive to defeat any suspicion of unreliability raised by Mozynski's prior description. <i>See United States v. Flores-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196112\"><a href=\"/opinion/196112/united-states-v-flores-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 331 (1st Cir.1995) (other reliability criteria under <i>Biggers</i> sufficient to overcome unreliability engendered by one factor); <i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 7 n. 1 (upholding district court's finding that identification was reliable under <i>Biggers</i> where there was no prior description of the assailant but the witness had ample opportunity to focus on suspect and identified him within minutes of the assault).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth factor, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at confrontation, does not give us reason to pause. Mozynski \"remained steadfast in the positiveness of his identification[],\" despite defense counsel's rigorous cross-examination. <i>Souza v. Howard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"315435\"><a href=\"/opinion/315435/anthony-souza-v-francis-a-howard-warden-adult-correctional-institutions/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 465-66 (1st Cir.1973). The fifth <i>Biggers</i> factor is the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. The last time Mozynski observed Henderson was in November 1998. Mozynski identified Henderson's photograph in January 1999. The six day jury trial ended on April 30, 2001. We do not find that this lapse of time militates against the reliability of Mozynski's in-court identification given the strength of the other factors. <i>See Flores-Rivera,</i> 56 F.3d at 331 (seven year gap between crime and identification permissible because other reliability criteria were sufficiently persuasive); <i>Drougas,</i> 748 F.2d at 28 (five year gap between crime and photographic identification permissible because witness spent considerable time with defendant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our thorough review of the record and application of the pertinent law to the facts we rule that Mozynski's identification of Henderson was sufficiently reliable to overcome the admittedly suggestive photo showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson advances a plethora of reasons why Mozynski's identification should not pass muster: he argues that Mozynski did not know the defendant by his actual name; that Mozynski lied to the government when he said that he had met with Butter on at least one occasion; that Mozynski wore glasses because he suffered from blurred vision and double vision; that when shown the photo, Mozynski stated that \"[i]t looks like `Butter';\" that Mozynski was mistaken as to the weight and complexion of the defendant; and that \"during the entire period of Mozynski's observations of Butter, he suffered a worsening problem of memory loss.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion regarding the reliability of Mozynski's identification makes a detailed examination of each argument unnecessary. For as the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surely, we cannot say that under all the circumstances of this case there is a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Short of that point, such evidence is for the jury to weigh. We are content to rely upon the good sense and judgment of American juries, for evidence with some element of untrustworthiness is customary grist for the jury mill. Juries are not so susceptible that they cannot measure intelligently the weight of identification testimony that has some questionable feature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Manson,</i> 432 U.S. at 116, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109693\"><a href=\"/opinion/109693/manson-v-brathwaite/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There was evidence from which it could be found that she had known Henderson going back to 1994. Powers bought crack cocaine from Henderson for her own use and resale. She saw Henderson at her apartment daily during a six month period in 1994, at times spending an hour or more with him. Powers was present at all crack cocaine sales to Mozynski, as an ally of Henderson. During October and November 1998, Powers saw Henderson every day. Powers' identification of Henderson at the pretrial hearing and at the jury trial was positive and firm. In addition, we do not think the gap in time between Powers' last transaction with Henderson and her identification of Henderson's photograph calls into question the reliability of her in-court identification, particularly given her close interaction with Henderson. <i>See Flores-Rivera,</i> 56 F.3d at 331; <i>Drougas,</i> 748 F.2d at 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like those made regarding Mozynski, all of the defendant's arguments pertaining to Powers focus on her reliability: that she was under the influence of cocaine during the four sales; that she did not know the amount of money involved in the sales; that she was unable to tell how the cocaine was packaged. Suffice it to say that all of these factors were brought to the jury's attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rule that Powers' testimony was properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Admissibility of the Pawn Shop Receipt</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson alleges that the court below committed \"constitutional error\" when it admitted into evidence a pawn shop sales receipt found in Henderson's wallet when he was arrested. The pawn shop receipt was signed by Henderson and indicated that Henderson pawned a watch on March 21, 1998, and redeemed it by paying $320 on November 6, 1998, just days after the November 3, 1998 drug sale. While Henderson objected at trial to the admission of the receipt, he did so on relevancy, not constitutional, grounds. If a new basis for objection is raised for the first time on appeal, that ground is not subject to harmless error review, and may only be reviewed for plain error. <i>See United States v.

Both contentions lack merit. Henderson overlooks the fact that the admission of <i>any</i> evidence offered by the government in a criminal trial gives the defendant a reason to testify if he has a basis for rebutting the government's theory of the case. The jury was properly instructed both as to the government's burden of proof and as to the defendant's right to remain silent. In light of these instructions, we fail to see how the admission of the pawn shop sales receipt, in and of itself, impermissibly shifted the burden of proof, or how it invited the jury to draw an inference of guilt from the defendant's choice not to testify.

In particular, Henderson is \"perplexed\" by the fact that the district court denied the motion even though Agent Anderson testified that the distance from the Elm Park Community School to 27 Wachusett Street was 1,095 feet, which he measured by walking the sidewalks.

This map demonstrated that each of the drug transactions occurred within 1,000 feet of the school; the government, in closing argument, pointed out as much to the jury.

He urges us to depart from this precedent on the ground that some of these circuits have found section 851(e) constitutional based upon a misplaced reliance on <i>Custis v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span> (1994). According to Henderson, <i>Custis</i> considered only the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), and not section 851(e), and therefore has no bearing on our determination. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Custis,</i> the Supreme Court examined section 924(e)(1), which provides no statutory right to collaterally challenge state court convictions that are used to enhance federal sentences under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984. Section 924(e)(1) raises the penalty for possession of a firearm by a felon from a maximum of 10 years in prison to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum of life in prison without parole if the defendant \"has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\" The Court held that Congress' omission of language authorizing collateral attacks in section 924(e)(1) indicated that it did not intend to give defendants the right to challenge the validity of prior convictions under this statute. <i>Custis,</i> 511 U.S. at 497, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1732</span></a></span>. Thus, if Congress has the power to foreclose collateral challenges by merely omitting statutory language that authorizes such attacks, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), then Congress can certainly preclude collateral challenges after five years where it explicitly includes such language in a statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding, Henderson counters that once Congress allows the use of collateral challenges, as it has for convictions less than five years old under section 851(e), any conditions imposed on the use of those challenges must accommodate fundamental liberties. He claims that the selection of a particular number of years to establish a time bar is patently arbitrary, and that the five year limitations period violates the Equal Protection Clause because it unfairly discriminates against those who commit a federal offense more than five years after a prior conviction. His arguments are not well taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ban against challenging convictions over five years need only be supported by a rational legislative purpose because no fundamental right or suspect class is at issue in this case. <i>See Reed,</i> 107 F.3d at 661. The five year limitation on the right to collaterally challenge prior convictions at sentencing has a rational basis in light of both the administrative difficulties inherent in challenges to prior convictions, such as lost or destroyed records, unavailable witnesses, and fading memories, and the interest in finality. <i>See, e.g., Arango-Montoya,</i> 61 F.3d at 1338. We therefore have no difficulty concluding that section 851(e) does not violate Henderson's right to due process and equal protection of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Closing Argument</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson also takes issue with the government's closing argument. Specifically, he urges that the prosecutor improperly persuaded the jury to convict him by allegedly interjecting his personal opinion of the evidence, vouching for a witness, shifting the burden of proof and inflaming the jury. We address each of his arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the defendant made no objection to the government's closing argument at trial, the standard of review is \"plain error.\" <i>United States v. Hernandez-Vega,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199216\"><a href=\"/opinion/199216/united-states-v-hernandez-vega/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>, 710 (1st Cir.2000). Henderson faces a high hurdle because it is established that plain error review \"is ordinarily limited to `blockbusters' and does not consider `the ordinary backfires &#8212; whether or not harmful to a litigant's cause &#8212; which may mar a trial record.'\" <i>United States v.

Henderson bears the burden of demonstrating that the prosecutor's remarks were prejudicial and affected his substantial rights. <i>Id.</i> at 55. Even then, error will not be recognized unless it caused a \"miscarriage of justice\" or seriously undermined the \"integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 736, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We consider whether the prosecutor's remarks had any likely impact on the jury based on the entire record, including the closing argument presented by the defense. <i>See Joyner,</i> 191 F.3d at 55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Personal Opinion of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Henderson's argument that the prosecutor improperly interjected his personal opinion of the evidence when he characterized as \"absurd\" the defense's assertion that Powers was under the influence of drugs during the transactions. A prosecutor \"may attempt to persuade the jury to draw suggested inferences unfavorable to the defense, as long as the prosecutor's own opinion as to the witness' credibility is not urged on the jury.\" <i>United States v.

Instead, during his closing argument, the prosecutor responded to a persistent suggestion made by the defendant that Powers had been on drugs during the transactions and thus could not remember the detailed information she provided during her testimony. The prosecutor did this by asking the jury to focus on the tape recordings made of those transactions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And don't the tapes prove to you how absurd the defendant's claims are that Powers was too high or too crazy to have accurately perceived the events which occurred during the conspiracy? Don't the tapes, in fact, prove that Powers became suspicious that Special Agent Guerard might be a cop right after she met him?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that the prosecutor asked the jury to consider whether the evidence before it &#8212; tape recordings in which Powers correctly perceived that Mozynski's alleged drug customer was an undercover police officer &#8212; refuted defendant's contention that Powers' mind was too altered to observe and remember the drug transactions. There was nothing improper in the government identifying for the jury a specific item of evidence and arguing that the jury should infer from that piece of evidence that the defendant's theory was not worthy of belief. <i>See United States v.

Here, the prosecutor suggested that a careful review of the evidence would reveal that the government's theory of the case was more plausible than Henderson's theory of the case.

We see no reason why the prosecutor should be prohibited from suggesting that the government's theory of the case did a better job of focusing on the evidence. The prosecutor was entitled to argue that the jury should look at the evidence to determine Henderson's guilt. We see no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3.

Furthermore, the prosecutor's statement came after defense counsel suggested in cross-examination that Powers had been coached by the government. We find that the prosecutor's statement did not constitute improper vouching.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Shifting the Burden of Proof</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson also complains that the prosecutor improperly commented on his right to remain silent when he responded to defense allegations that the government had failed to call a supposedly percipient witness. It is established that any comment by a prosecutor on a defendant's exercise of the right to remain silent violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against self-incrimination. <i>See Wihbey,</i> 75 F.3d at 769.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the closing argument, defense counsel suggested that the government was hiding something by not producing Lynn Cappulett, an individual whom Powers and Mozynski each identified as having been at Carey's residence during the first drug transaction on October 19:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The government] never tracked down Lynn Cappulett. Mozynski and Powers both said that she was at 6 Denny Street on October 19, 1998. And according to Mozynski the first deal happened right in front of her eyes. Yet, did you hear any evidence that Agent Anderson or Agent Guerard ever tried to find her or talk to her? This was an eyewitness to what went on inside the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In rebuttal, the prosecutor replied:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where is Lynn Cappulett, both counsel ask you? Well, that's a good question. Why don't they tell us? Maybe defense counsel could have interviewed Lynn Cappulett.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's response was not such that \"jurors would probably interpret it as commentary on the accused's failure to take the stand,\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 979 (1st Cir.1995), particularly because it was made in rebuttal <i>after</i> defense counsel had themselves raised the issue. <i>See United States v. Nickens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577009\"><a href=\"/opinion/577009/united-states-v-david-lloyd-nickens/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 122 (1st Cir.1992) (evaluating effect of statement made in rebuttal argument). Under the invited response rule, if the prosecutor's remarks were \"invited,\" and \"did no more than respond substantially in order to right the scale,\" such comments do not warrant reversal. <i>Id.</i> (internal quotations omitted). Here, defense counsel invited a response by raising the issue of Lynn Cappulett's whereabouts in the first instance. The prosecutor's remarks were limited and addressed only the defense counsel's own comments. <i>See id.</i> at 123. Thus, there was no plain error when the district court did not, on its own initiative, strike portions of the government's rebuttal argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Inflaming the Passions of the Jury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree with Henderson that the district court erred when it did not, on its own initiative, strike the prosecutor's description of Henderson as \"a successful businessman in the business of crack cocaine,\" who wanted a \"windfall\" verdict in his favor. When the evidence of a defendant's guilt is strong, a court should be very reluctant to find plain error in \"misguided rhetoric.\" <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1188 (1st Cir.1993). Under plain error review, improper remarks are grounds for reversal only if they \"so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotations omitted). We place a prosecutor's remarks in context when determining whether they were inappropriate. <i>See id.</i> at 1187.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson posits that the prosecutor's comments improperly appealed to the passions of the jury. To the contrary, we fail to see how these remarks would distract the jury from focusing on whether the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See United States v. Manning,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195356\"><a href=\"/opinion/195356/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 574 (1st Cir.1994). Defense counsel suggested in his opening that Henderson was a legitimate businessman; the prosecutor countered that suggestion by arguing that Henderson was in the business of selling drugs. Here, defense counsel invited a response by suggesting that Henderson \"worked hard\" in the \"music promotion business,\" and was \"successful.\" The prosecutor, in turn, offered a reply that was not only supported by the evidence but was properly limited and addressed only the defense counsel's own comments. <i>See Nickens,</i> 955 F.2d at 123. There was nothing improper in this suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the district court err when it permitted, as Henderson claims, the prosecutor to tell the jury that it could convict him \"even if they found that the defendant was not the distributor of the cocaine.\" This is somewhat misleading. In his closing, Henderson's counsel suggested that someone other than Henderson was the crack cocaine supplier. The prosecutor responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What are the odds that there was a different supplier in this case in light of the following facts: First, a person that you might well find at a minimum bears a striking resemblance to this individual, even if you don't find that it's him, walks into 6 Denny Street at the exact time of a crack distribution on October 19th. Coincidence?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When read in its proper context, it is apparent that this comment, while unartfully expressed, is innocuous. It certainly would not suggest to the jury that it could convict the defendant even if it found that the person alleged to be the supplier of the cocaine was not the defendant. Furthermore, the court's instructions to the jury clearly explained that the ultimate question for the jury was whether Henderson was the supplier of crack cocaine on the dates in question. We conclude that Henderson's conviction should not be disturbed on the basis of these statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also disagree with Henderson that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the passions of the jury during rebuttal by commenting, with regard to Henderson's defense theory, \"[w]hat is this, the Jerry Springer show?\" Given the strong evidence against Henderson, the prosecutor's \"misguided rhetoric,\" <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1188, if it was even that, does not rise to the level of plain error. <i>See Joyner,</i> 191 F.3d at 55. We conclude that Henderson's conviction should not be disturbed on account of the prosecutor's reference to the Jerry Springer show.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>Co-conspirator's Statements</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson argues, in summary fashion, that the only evidence that indicates he engaged in any conspiracy was the suggestive identifications of Mozynski and Powers, which, according to Henderson, should have been excluded in the first instance. Because his challenge to the co-conspirator statements is premised solely on the identifications being improperly admitted, we need not consider the admissibility of these statements in light of our conclusion that the district court did not err in admitting the identifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, we are satisfied that even without the identification testimony the evidence was sufficient for a jury to conclude that Henderson was part of a conspiracy to sell crack cocaine. This includes: the videotape of Henderson taken by the DEA at 6 Denny Street at the October 19, 1998 drug transaction; Agent Anderson's identification of Henderson; the fact that the pager used in the drug transactions was subscribed to by D. Henderson of 27 Wachusett Street in Worcester; and the fact that Henderson lived at 27 Wachusett Street, where two of the drug transactions took place. This evidence, aside from the identifications of Mozynski and Powers, was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find Henderson guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See</i> <i>United States v. Loder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195365\"><a href=\"/opinion/195365/united-states-v-loder/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 589 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G. <i>Jury Instructions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson alleges three errors in the district court's jury instructions, which he believes \"incorrectly diminished the evidentiary requirements for finding the defendant guilty.\" Specifically, he challenges the jury instructions concerning identification, aiding and abetting and conspiracy. We review for \"plain error\" because Henderson did not raise his objections to the jury instructions at trial. <i>See Gomez,</i> 255 F.3d at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the identification instruction, we begin by noting that the district court provided a lengthy instruction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Identification testimony is an expression of belief or impression by the witness. Its value depends on the opportunity the witness had to observe the offender at the time of the offense and to make a reliable identification later. Whether the witness had an adequate and effective opportunity to observe the offender at the time of the offense may be affected by such matters as: (1) how long or short a time was available; (2) how far or close the witness was to the scene of the offense; (3) how good was the lighting; (4) whether the witness was under the influence of drugs; and (5) whether, and the extent to which, the witness had occasion in the past to see or know the person identified. If the identification by the witness may have been influenced by circumstances under which an image of the defendant was presented to the witness for identification, you may consider those circumstances as well. You may also take into account that an identification made by picking the defendant out of a group of similar individuals is generally more reliable than one which results from the presentation of an image of the defendant alone to the witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson, without citing any authority, complains that this instruction \"fell far short of the detail required by this case.\" We disagree. Contrary to Henderson's view, the instruction was thorough and suitably focused on the reliability of the identification as contemplated by the case law. <i>See Manson,</i> 432 U.S. at 114, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109693\"><a href=\"/opinion/109693/manson-v-brathwaite/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2243</span></a></span> (\"[R]eliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony\"); <i>Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d at 10-11; <i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 6. The district court was not required to accept Henderson's alternative instruction because its own instruction was proper. <i>See United States v. Arcadipane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195748\"><a href=\"/opinion/195748/united-states-v-arcadipane/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1994) (a defendant \"is not entitled to the nuances of phrasing that he finds most soothing\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson further avers that the district court's aiding and abetting instruction permitted the jury to convict without finding specific intent. <i>See Loder,</i> 23 F.3d at 591 (discussing specific intent requirement for aiding and abetting). In order to sustain a conviction for aiding and abetting the government must prove, in addition to the commission of the offense by the principal, that the defendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act, and intended to help the principal. <i>See United States v. Spinney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196301\"><a href=\"/opinion/196301/united-states-v-spinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 235 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this in mind, the district court instructed the jury that, inter alia, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, first that someone committed the charged crime, and second,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that the defendant then under consideration willfully associated himself in some way with the crime and willfully participated in it as he would in something he wished to bring about. This means that the government must prove that the defendant consciously shared the other person's knowledge of the underlying criminal act and intended to help him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is all the law requires; the district court's instruction adequately set forth the elements of aiding and abetting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Henderson asserts that the conspiracy instruction allowed the jury to convict him without finding the necessary intent. This argument is without merit. To prove intent for conspiracy, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to join in the conspiracy and intended the substantive offense to be committed. <i>See Gomez,</i> 255 F.3d at 35. The district court properly instructed the jury on the requisite intent to support a conspiracy conviction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government must prove two kinds of intent beyond a reasonable doubt before Chamond Henderson ... can be said to have willfully joined the conspiracy: an intent to agree and an intent, whether reasonable or not, that the underlying crime be committed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This formulation accurately states the requisite intent needed for a conspiracy conviction. <i>See United States v.

Accordingly, we are confident that the jury instructions do not constitute plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">H. <i>Apprendi</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson's last argument is that the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Apprendi v.
