Paul J. Barbadoro,   U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Torruella, Ripple,* and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert Herrick for appellant.\n     Seth R. Aframe, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nJohn P. Kacavas, Acting United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                            July 27, 2011\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Defendant-appellant Vincent Chaney\n\nappeals the denial of a motion to suppress evidence seized from him\n\nin the raid of a motel room in which Chaney was a guest.   Placed on\n\nthe floor and handcuffed in the wake of his host's arrest on drug\n\ncharges, Chaney consented to a search of his pants pocket to locate\n\nidentification; the search turned up seven small bags of crack\n\ncocaine.   A dozen rounds of .38-caliber ammunition were later\n\ndiscovered in the pocket of his jacket.\n\n           After unsuccessfully moving to suppress this evidence,\n\nChaney entered a conditional guilty plea to charges of simple\n\npossession of cocaine and possession of a firearm after a prior\n\nfelony conviction.    On appeal, Chaney argues that the police\n\nexceeded the scope of his consent by removing cocaine, rather than\n\nidentification, from his pocket; that his consent was the product\n\nof a coercive atmosphere and hence not voluntary; and that all\n\nevidence seized was the fruit of an unlawful de facto arrest.\n\nFinding no reversible error in the district court's rulings, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n           The events giving rise to this appeal took place in the\n\ncourse of a police raid on a Manchester, New Hampshire motel room\n\nin late 2005.    In reciting the facts, we draw on the district\n\ncourt's oral findings of fact at Chaney's suppression hearings as\n\nwell as testimony taken at those hearings.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f           On November 30, 2005, state and federal law enforcement\n\nofficials in possession of a federal arrest warrant for a man named\n\nPeter Boyd, suspected of distributing crack cocaine, went to the\n\nQueen City Inn in Manchester, New Hampshire.             Past experience\n\nflagged the motel as a likely choice for local drug dealers looking\n\nfor temporary lodging.      Shown a picture of Boyd, a clerk at the\n\nQueen City Inn confirmed to an investigating United States Marshal\n\nthat a man of Boyd's appearance was staying in a room at the motel.\n\nThe   marshal   summoned   four   additional   federal   and   local    law\n\nenforcement officers to the motel to aid in executing the warrant.\n\n           The motel room in which Boyd was staying was registered\n\nin the name of Brigit Hebert, a woman familiar to the authorities\n\nas the subject of several past drug-related arrest warrants.\n\nUnbeknownst to the officers, also present in Hebert's motel room\n\nwas Vincent Chaney.    According to his testimony at the suppression\n\nhearings, Chaney had come the previous night from Virginia, hoping\n\nto visit two of his daughters who were living with their mother in\n\nManchester.     Arriving too late to visit with his daughters, Chaney\n\nwent to a bar and happened upon Boyd, an old acquaintance.             Boyd\n\noffered to put Chaney up for the night in the room he was sharing\n\nwith Hebert at the Queen City Inn.       Boyd, Hebert, and Chaney were\n\nthus all present in Hebert's motel room when the officers arrived\n\nearly in the afternoon of the next day to execute Boyd's arrest\n\nwarrant.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f             Two local detectives were dispatched to cover the rear\n\ndoor to Hebert's motel room while three marshals approached from\n\nthe front, knocking on the door and announcing their presence. The\n\ndoor opened to reveal Boyd, wearing pajama pants but shirtless and\n\nwithout shoes.      Boyd was taken into custody, and the marshals\n\nentered the room with their weapons drawn to perform a protective\n\nsweep.    They found the room darkened and clothing scattered across\n\nthe floor, with Hebert lying in bed and Chaney, whom the officers\n\ndid not recognize, standing next to it.             The marshals told Hebert\n\nto get out of bed and put her hands up, which she did.                Chaney was\n\nless compliant,     edging   toward    the       corner   of   the   bed   despite\n\nrepeated commands to stop moving and lie on the ground.                After six\n\nor more warnings, Chaney acquiesced and was handcuffed on the\n\nfloor.    The marshals completed their sweep of the main room, the\n\nspace underneath the bed, and the bathroom, finding in plain view\n\ntwo   bags   of   what   appeared     to    be    marijuana     (sitting    on   a\n\nwindowsill), three crack pipes (on the windowsill and on a chair),\n\nand a number of rounds of .22-caliber ammunition (located in a\n\nclear bag in the closet).1\n\n\n      1\n       A further search of the premises, conducted later in the day\nwith Hebert's consent, unearthed two firearms (a .22-caliber, pump-\naction rifle with ammunition in it and a .38-caliber Derringer\npistol), a bowl containing a white powdery substance that field-\ntested positive for cocaine, and various items associated with drug\nmanufacture (baking soda, lighter fluid, and glassine bags).\nNotably, the Derringer pistol was found under the corner of the\nbed's mattress, the point toward which Chaney had been edging when\nthe police first entered the motel room.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            As the protective sweep was being conducted, the marshals\n\nopened the rear door of the motel to admit the local detectives.\n\nDetective Brian Newcomb approached Chaney, patted him down for\n\nweapons, and then attempted to learn his identity.                Chaney was not\n\nimmediately forthright, telling Detective Newcomb only that his\n\nname was Vincent and providing him with several false dates of\n\nbirth.    After the local dispatch reported that it was unable to\n\nfind a match for the dates of birth in their database, Newcomb\n\nasked Chaney if he had any identification.            Chaney indicated that\n\nhe did, and that it could be found in his back pocket.                 Detective\n\nNewcomb    asked   for    and    was    granted   consent    to   retrieve     the\n\nidentification from Chaney's back pocket, but the pocket turned out\n\nto   be   empty.   Asked    if    the    identification     might     be   located\n\nelsewhere, Chaney suggested that it might be in his left front\n\npocket.    Chaney again consented to have Newcomb search his pocket\n\nfor the identification.\n\n            Detective Newcomb placed his hand in Chaney's left front\n\npocket and removed first a plastic bag that held seven individual\n\nplastic    bags,   each    of    which    contained   a     \"chunky    off-white\n\nsubstance\"; he then reentered Chaney's pocket and removed a social\n\nsecurity card.2     Newcomb believed the off-white substance in the\n\n\n      2\n       Chaney disputed the sequence of events in his testimony at\nthe suppression hearing.    According to Chaney, he responded to\nNewcomb's request for identification by removing the social\nsecurity card from his back pocket and turning it over to Newcomb.\nDetective Newcomb then allegedly asked Chaney if he had any sharp\n\n                                        -5-\n\fbags to be crack cocaine, having seen the substance in his prior\n\nlaw enforcement experience some fifty to one hundred times (a field\n\ntest later confirmed his suspicions). Newcomb informed Chaney that\n\nhe was under arrest for possession of crack cocaine with intent to\n\ndistribute.   After learning from dispatch that the social security\n\ncard found in Chaney's pocket, which bore the name \"Vincent Earold\n\nChaney,\" belonged to a four-year-old boy,3 Newcomb again asked\n\nChaney for his date of birth.    Chaney provided the correct date\n\nthis time, and a search of police records confirmed his identity\n\nand revealed an outstanding warrant for his arrest in Massachusetts\n\nfor a probation violation.\n\n          As Detective Newcomb was escorting Chaney to a police car\n\noutside the motel, Chaney asked Newcomb to retrieve a backpack and\n\njacket Chaney had left in the room.   Newcomb retrieved a backpack\n\nand jacket matching the description provided by Chaney.      After\n\nChaney confirmed that they belonged to him, Newcomb searched both\n\nitems, locating in the jacket pocket a plastic bag containing\n\ntwelve rounds of .38-caliber ammunition.\n\n\n\nobjects in his pockets, Chaney told Newcomb that he did not, and\nNewcomb proceeded to search Chaney's other pockets and remove items\n(including the plastic bags containing cocaine) without consent.\nIn his oral findings of fact, Judge DiClerico adopted Detective\nNewcomb's version of the consensual search, implicitly discrediting\nChaney's account.\n     3\n       The card belonged to Chaney's deceased son, Vincent Chaney,\nJr.   Chaney stated that he had mistakenly grabbed the wrong\nidentification card when he left his home in Virginia.\n\n                                -6-\n\f          Chaney was eventually indicted in the district court on\n\ntwo counts arising out of the incident: one count of simple\n\npossession of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a), and\n\none count of unlawful possession of a firearm after a prior felony\n\nconviction, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922 and 924(a)(2).4\n\nChaney moved to suppress all of the evidence seized in the course\n\nof his detention and arrest.\n\n          The district court held two evidentiary hearings to\n\nevaluate possible grounds for suppression.     The first, held by\n\nJudge DiClerico on September 4, 2008, addressed Chaney's argument\n\nthat the search of Hebert's motel room was unlawful due to the\n\nabsence of a valid search warrant. After testimony from Chaney and\n\nthree of the police officers who conducted the search and arrest,\n\nJudge DiClerico ruled that Chaney lacked standing to challenge the\n\nsearch of the motel room.   The judge also found that Chaney had\n\nconsented to a search of his pockets, and that the search of\n\nChaney's jacket before turning it over to him had been reasonable\n\nin light of officer safety concerns.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n        Chaney's indictment charged one additional felon-in-\npossession count related to a 2007 incident where an officer\nnoticed a handgun in Chaney's pocket during a routine traffic stop.\nChaney successfully moved to sever trial on the 2007 charge from\nthe 2005 charges. Though the district court initially suppressed\nall evidence seized in the 2007 traffic stop, we reversed in an\nearlier appeal filed by the government.       See United States v.\nChaney, 584 F.3d 20 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                               -7-\n\f            A second hearing was held before Judge Barbadoro on\n\nSeptember 17, 2008.5        After brief supplemental testimony from two\n\nof the officers, Chaney's counsel presented arguments that the\n\nsearch of Chaney's pockets occurred during an unlawful de facto\n\narrest and that Chaney's consent to the search was invalid because\n\nit was the product of coercion.                Judge Barbadoro rejected the\n\narguments, ruling that Chaney's detention was not a de facto\n\narrest, being limited in duration and reasonable in scope, and that\n\nChaney's consent was voluntary.          At the close of the hearing, the\n\njudge    confirmed   that    all   of    the    issues   concerning   Chaney's\n\ndetention and consent were preserved for appeal:\n\n            It's preserved for purposes of appeal that the\n            entry was illegal.       It's preserved for\n            purposes of appeal that the scope of the\n            detention after the entry was improper, and\n            it's preserved for purposes of appeal that any\n            consent given was not valid and does not\n            justify and make lawful the seizure that\n            followed.   I think you've presented every\n            possible suppression argument that can be\n            presented.\n\n            Chaney   subsequently       entered into     a   conditional   plea\n\nagreement by which he reserved his right to appeal the district\n\ncourt's suppression rulings.            Subject to that agreement, Chaney\n\npled guilty to one count of simple possession and one count of\n\n\n\n     5\n       Following the first suppression hearing, the case was\nreassigned   to  Judge   Barbadoro  due   to  Judge   DiClerico's\nunavailability for trial.    Judge Barbadoro set the additional\nsuppression hearing in response to concerns from Chaney that\ncertain arguments had not been addressed in the first hearing.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fpossession of a firearm after a felony conviction.           Judgment was\n\nentered against Chaney in April 2009, and this timely appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                  II.\n\n            In evaluating the district court's denial of Chaney's\n\nsuppression motion, we review the court's findings of fact for\n\nclear error and its legal conclusions de novo.           United States v.\n\nLarios, 593 F.3d 82, 92 (1st Cir. 2010).              Chaney raises three\n\nchallenges to the district court's ruling.       First, he argues that\n\nthe removal from his pocket of plastic bags containing cocaine\n\nexceeded the scope of his consent, which, he asserts, was limited\n\nto a search of his pocket to locate identification.            Second, he\n\nargues that, even if he consented to a general search of his pants\n\npocket, the consent was involuntary because of an unduly coercive\n\natmosphere.   Third, he argues that the consent was the fruit of an\n\nunlawful, de facto arrest, and thus any evidence found in the\n\ncourse of the search must be excluded.     We address each of Chaney's\n\ncontentions in turn.\n\nA.   Scope of Consent\n\n            It is a fundamental principle of Fourth Amendment law\n\nthat a warrantless search may be conducted with the voluntary\n\nconsent of a person authorized to give such consent.           See United\n\nStates v. Stierhoff, 549 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing\n\nSchneckloth   v.   Bustamonte,   412    U.S.   218,    222   (1973)).   A\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fwarrantless search may not, however, exceed the scope of the\n\nconsent granted. United States v. Marshall, 348 F.3d 281, 286 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).   The scope of the consented-to search is generally\n\ndefined by the expressed object of the search, which is \"measured\n\nby a test of objective reasonableness: 'what would the typical\n\nreasonable person have understood by the exchange between the\n\nofficer and subject?'\"   Id. at 286-87 (quoting Florida v. Jimeno,\n\n500 U.S. 248, 251 (1991)).\n\n          The United States raises a threshold objection to our\n\nconsideration of Chaney's scope-of-consent argument, contending\n\nthat the issue is forfeited due to Chaney's failure to squarely\n\nraise it in the suppression hearings.6   There may be some force to\n\nthe government's argument, as the scope-of-consent argument Chaney\n\npresses on appeal does not appear to have been made below.     See\n\nUnited States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998) (forfeiture\n\n\"applies not only when a defendant has failed altogether to make a\n\nsuppression motion but also when, having made one, he has neglected\n\nto include the particular ground that he later seeks to argue\").\n\nOn the other hand, Chaney raised generally the issue of the\n\n\n     6\n       The government identifies this argument as a claim of\nwaiver, but it is actually one of forfeiture. As we have often\nexplained, an argument or right is waived only when it is\nintentionally abandoned; mere failure to raise an argument or right\ndue to inattention or neglect constitutes forfeiture. See United\nStates v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).         The\ndistinction is a substantive one. Waiver generally bars an issue\nfrom being raised on appeal, whereas forfeiture allows the issue to\nbe reviewed for plain error. Id.\n\n                               -10-\n\fadequacy of his consent before the district court, and the court\n\nassured him that it was \"preserved for purposes of appeal that any\n\nconsent given . . . does not justify and make lawful the seizure\n\nthat followed.\"       Because we     may readily       dispose    of   Chaney's\n\nargument on the merits, we sidestep the government's claim of\n\nforfeiture and address the scope-of-consent issue head-on.                    See\n\nStierhoff, 549 F.3d at 23.\n\n          According       to   testimony    from    Detective    Newcomb,    who\n\nperformed the search of Chaney's pocket, Chaney \"stated that [the\n\ndetective]   could   go    through   his    left    front     pocket   and   find\n\n[Chaney's] identification.\"          Chaney argues that the \"expressed\n\nobject\"   of   this       consented-to      search      was     retrieval     of\n\nidentification, and thus the removal of the plastic bags from his\n\npocket fell outside of the scope of his consent.               We disagree.\n\n          The tight confines of a pants pocket leave a searching\n\nhand little room for maneuvering and distinguishing between various\n\nobjects that may be contained therein.             Given consent to retrieve\n\nan object from such a cramped space, it is objectively reasonable\n\nto assume that the consent extends to the removal of items that\n\neither may constitute the object of the search and cannot be\n\nimmediately identified or that obstruct further access to other\n\nitems in the pocket.       Nothing in Chaney's exchange with Detective\n\nNewcomb suggests that he intended to withhold consent for these\n\nsorts of practical measures that are reasonable incidents to the\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fsearch of a pocket.         Chaney's argument appears to be that, absent\n\nexplicit   permission       to     remove    items   other   than    evidence   of\n\nidentification, the detective was required to fish around in the\n\npocket until he located an item that he could positively identify\n\nto be some form of identification and that could be removed without\n\ndislodging other items.          The \"typical reasonable person\" would not\n\nso interpret Chaney's exchange with the officer.7\n\n           Because     it    was    objectively      reasonable     for Detective\n\nNewcomb to believe that the scope of consent extended to the\n\nremoval of plastic bags from Chaney's pocket in the course of\n\nsearching for identification, we find no unconstitutional excursion\n\nbeyond the boundaries of Chaney's consent. See Jimeno, 500 U.S. at\n\n249   (\"The   Fourth        Amendment       is   satisfied   when,     under    the\n\ncircumstances, it is objectively reasonable for the officer to\n\nbelieve that the scope of the suspect's consent permitted [the\n\nchallenged search].\").8\n\n\n      7\n       This is not to say that Chaney's consent should be read as\na generalized authorization to search his entire pocket, however.\nIf the detective had immediately located identification, turning\nout the rest of Chaney's pocket would surely exceed the scope of\nconsent. But the record does not suggest that such was the case:\nDetective Newcomb testified at the second suppression hearing that\nhe removed the plastic bag from Chaney's pocket before the\nidentification card.\n      8\n       Both parties discuss the possible application of the \"plain\nfeel\" doctrine of Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993) to\nthe present case. That rule, an extension of the familiar \"plain\nview\" doctrine, allows the seizure of contraband readily identified\nby feel during a Terry frisk. While we agree with Chaney that the\ndoctrine would have no application where testimony suggests that\n\n                                        -12-\n\fB.   Voluntariness of Consent\n\n           Chaney next raises a more fundamental challenge to the\n\nconsent search of his pocket, arguing that the coercive atmosphere\n\nof the police raid rendered his consent involuntary.                Whether a\n\nsuspect's consent to a warrantless search was truly voluntary or,\n\ninstead, the product of coercion \"is a question of fact to be\n\ndetermined from an examination of the totality of circumstances.\"\n\nMarshall, 348 F.3d at 286.       Among the factors we will consider in\n\nmaking   that   determination    are     the    suspect's   \"age,   education,\n\nexperience,     knowledge   of   the    right    to   withhold   consent,   and\n\nevidence of coercive tactics.\"            Id.     Upon close review of the\n\nrecord, we can find no clear error in the district court's finding\n\nthat Chaney freely and voluntarily consented to the search of his\n\npants pocket.\n\n           Chaney draws on a number of factors in trying to paint a\n\npicture of coercion.    First, Chaney highlights the officers' \"show\n\nof force\" in entering the motel room with guns drawn.                 Setting\n\naside the fact that his consent was given after all occupants of\n\nthe room were handcuffed and the excitement of the initial entry\n\nhad passed, neither the number of officers who entered the room\n\n(five) nor the readiness of their weapons suggests an overwhelming\n\n\nthe contraband was not identified by feel but instead by visual\ninspection after removal from his pocket, we need not directly\naddress these arguments given our holding that the removal of\ncocaine from Chaney's pocket fell within the scope of the consent\ngranted.\n\n                                       -13-\n\fshow of force.     See United States v. Jones, 523 F.3d 31, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (finding the fact that ten to fifteen officers entered\n\nhotel room with guns drawn insufficient to void voluntariness of\n\nconsent).   Chaney notes as well that the occupants of the room were\n\nasleep when law enforcement arrived at the motel room.                   The\n\nevidence is mixed as to whether Chaney, who was standing and fully\n\nclothed when the officers entered the room, was actually awakened\n\nby the officers' arrival. Regardless, the mere fact of having been\n\nrecently asleep does not necessarily affect one's capacity to\n\nvoluntarily grant consent.         Although Chaney cites the officers'\n\nfailure to advise him of his right to refuse consent to the search,\n\na factor that is certainly relevant to voluntariness of consent,\n\n\"[w]e have repeatedly held that the failure to advise a defendant\n\nof his right to refuse consent does not automatically render such\n\nconsent invalid.\"    Id.\n\n            Importantly, this was not Chaney's first encounter with\n\nlaw enforcement.    He had been arrested on more than a dozen prior\n\noccasions   and   convicted   of    a    comparable   number   of   criminal\n\noffenses.   It is reasonable to infer that a veteran of the criminal\n\njustice system will be \"less likely than most to be intimidated by\n\nthe agents' show of force.\"         United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d\n\n546, 556 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v. Cepulonis, 530\n\nF.2d 238, 244 (1st Cir. 1976)).         Moreover, Chaney's conduct during\n\nthe police raid betrayed no evidence of intimidation; to the\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fcontrary, he ignored repeated commands from the police to stop\n\nmoving when they first entered the motel room.\n\n           In short, on this record, we can discern no clear error\n\nin the district court's finding that Chaney voluntarily consented\n\nto the search of his pocket.9\n\nC.   De Facto Arrest\n\n           Chaney alternatively contends that the evidence seized\n\nfrom him was the fruit of an unlawful de facto arrest.10         While the\n\nperiod of detention leading to the discovery of crack cocaine in\n\nChaney's pocket certainly bore some typical indicia of an arrest,\n\nwe   concur   with   the    district   court's    conclusion     that   the\n\ncircumstances did not rise to the level of a de facto arrest.\n\n           Any detention of an individual by a police officer\n\nconstitutes   a   seizure   and, to    be   lawful,   must   be adequately\n\njustified under the Fourth Amendment. Morelli v. Webster, 552 F.3d\n\n\n     9\n       We note as well that we have been reluctant to find coercion\nin the commonplace context of a request for identification. See\nUnited States v. Winston, 444 F.3d 115, 122 (1st Cir. 2006) (noting\nthat the \"mundaneness of identification makes it unlikely that\nagents would bother to use coercive methods to obtain it\").\n     10\n        There appear to be two aspects to his \"fruit of the\npoisonous tree\" argument, see Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S.\n471, 484-85 (1963): first, that the purported de facto arrest\ncaused Chaney to consent to the search of his pocket, cf. United\nStates v. Navedo-Colón, 996 F.2d 1337, 1338-39 (1st Cir. 1993)\n(examining whether consent to search was fruit of illegal search),\nand second, that the search of Chaney's jacket pocket incident to\nhis being taken into custody was a product of the de facto arrest.\nBecause we find no de facto arrest, we do not reach the question of\nwhether such a finding would require suppression of the evidence\nlocated during those two searches.\n\n                                  -15-\n\f12, 19 (1st Cir. 2009).    The contours of the showing necessary to\n\nsatisfy the Fourth Amendment depend on the nature of the detention:\n\narrests, whether formal or de facto, require that the detaining\n\nofficer   have   grounds   for    probable    cause,    whereas    temporary\n\ndetentions (including investigatory or Terry stops, see Terry v.\n\nOhio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968)) \"may be grounded on a lesser showing\n\nequivalent to reasonable suspicion.\"          Id.\n\n           Chaney does not contest that the police had reasonable\n\ngrounds to temporarily detain him and ascertain his identity in the\n\ncourse of securing the motel room.           Instead, he argues that the\n\nconduct of the detention -- in particular, that the officers\n\nentered with guns drawn, ordered him to the ground, and handcuffed\n\nhim -- transformed it from investigatory stop into de facto arrest.\n\nThe distinction is critical.        Chaney argues, correctly, that no\n\nprobable cause existed at the time of his detention,11 and thus the\n\ndetention can survive constitutional scrutiny only if it was in the\n\nnature of a temporary investigative stop.\n\n           There exist \"no scientifically precise benchmarks for\n\ndistinguishing between temporary detentions and de facto arrests.\"\n\nId. at 20.   Instead, we inquire, in light of the totality of the\n\ncircumstances,   whether   a     reasonable    person   in   the   suspect's\n\nposition would have understood her position \"to be tantamount to\n\n\n     11\n       The officers had no knowledge of who Chaney was or why he\nwas present in the motel room, and thus plainly could have no\nprobable cause for arrest.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fbeing under arrest.\"   United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (citing Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 442\n\n(1984)).   This objective, suspect-focused inquiry is informed by\n\nour assessment of the reasonableness of the detaining officer or\n\nofficers' actions in response to developing conditions.         Where an\n\ninvestigatory stop is justified at its inception, it will generally\n\nnot morph into a de facto arrest as long as \"the actions undertaken\n\nby the officer[s] following the stop were reasonably responsive to\n\nthe circumstances   justifying   the    stop   in the   first   place as\n\naugmented by information gleaned by the officer[s] during the\n\nstop.\"   United States v. Trueber, 238 F.3d 79, 92 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(quoting United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 748 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(alterations in original)).\n\n           The crux of the issue before us is whether the officers'\n\nentry into the motel room with drawn guns and their handcuffing of\n\nChaney were reasonable. The use of drawn guns and handcuffs, being\n\nsome \"of the most recognizable indicia of a traditional arrest,\"\n\nwill generally tilt the scale to some significant degree toward a\n\nfinding of de facto arrest. See United States v. Acosta-Colon, 157\n\nF.3d 9, 18 (1st Cir. 1998).   However, we have repeatedly noted that\n\nneither factor is alone determinative.          See United States v.\n\nFornia-Castillo, 408 F.3d 52, 64 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[N]either the\n\nuse of handcuffs nor the drawing of a weapon necessarily transforms\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fa valid Terry stop into a de facto arrest.\").12            In Acosta-Colon,\n\nwe explained that \"when the government seeks to prove that an\n\ninvestigatory detention involving the use of handcuffs did not\n\nexceed the limits of a Terry stop, it must be able to point to some\n\nspecific    fact    or   circumstance      that   could   have   supported   a\n\nreasonable belief that the use of such restraints was necessary to\n\ncarry out the legitimate purposes of the stop without exposing law\n\nenforcement officers, the public, or the suspect himself to an\n\nundue risk of harm.\"         Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d at 18-19 (emphasis\n\nomitted).        We think this inquiry applies with equal force in\n\nassessing whether the use of drawn handguns was reasonable in\n\ninitiating a stop.\n\n            We can locate no error in the district court's finding\n\nthat the specific circumstances of the November 30, 2005 raid gave\n\nrise to a reasonable concern for officer security that justified\n\nthe use     of   handcuffs   and   drawn    handguns.     The    unanticipated\n\npresence, in a darkened motel room inhabited by two suspected drug\n\ndealers, of an unfamiliar man who ignored repeated orders from the\n\npolice to stop moving and drop to the ground might alone be enough\n\nto justify more intrusive measures for briefly securing him during\n\n\n     12\n         See also Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d at 18 (\"[T]he use of\nhandcuffs in the course of an investigatory stop does not\nautomatically convert the encounter into a de facto arrest.\");\nUnited States v. Lee, 317 F.3d 26, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2003) (fact that\nofficers drew guns and blocked defendant's vehicle from leaving did\nnot convert investigative stop into de facto arrest); United States\nv. Taylor, 162 F.3d 12, 21 (1st Cir. 1998) (same).\n\n                                     -18-\n\fan investigative stop. See United States v. Andrade, 551 F.3d 103,\n\n113 (1st Cir. 2008) (more physically intrusive Terry stop justified\n\nwhere suspect refused officer's order to stop); United States v.\n\nTaylor, 716 F.2d 701, 709 (9th Cir. 1983) (holding that no de facto\n\narrest had occurred where police approached the suspect with guns\n\ndrawn and handcuffed him after he twice refused to raise his hands\n\nand \"ma[de] furtive movements inside the truck where his hands\n\ncould not be seen\"). There were, however, still other factors here\n\nthat counseled particular caution.    The officers knew that Boyd,\n\nthe subject of the arrest warrant, had an extensive criminal\n\nhistory, and a preliminary protective sweep of the motel room\n\nlocated not just drug paraphernalia but also ammunition. Moreover,\n\nthe motel room was littered with clothing, which easily could --\n\nand, as was later discovered, did -- conceal a weapon within close\n\nreach of the occupants.\n\n          Under circumstances such as these, especially in the\n\nclose quarters of a motel room, we are mindful of the need for\n\nofficers to safely secure the scene. \"[T]he ultimate touchstone of\n\nthe Fourth Amendment is 'reasonableness,'\" Brigham City v. Stuart,\n\n547 U.S. 398, 403 (2006), and \"[p]olice officers engaged in an\n\notherwise lawful stop must be permitted to take measures . . . they\n\nbelieve reasonably necessary to protect themselves from harm, or to\n\nsafeguard the security of others,\" Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d at 18.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fWe find the use of handcuffs and entry into the motel room with\n\ndrawn guns to have been a reasonable precaution here.13\n\n            Nor do the other relevant aspects of Chaney's detention\n\nsupport a finding of de facto arrest.            Chaney was detained for\n\nfewer than five minutes before being arrested for possession of\n\ncocaine. We have held significantly longer periods of detention to\n\nfall short of de facto arrest.         See, e.g., Owens, 167 F.3d at 749\n\n(noting that there is no talismanic time beyond which a Terry stop\n\nbecomes unreasonable and holding that detention of fifty minutes\n\nwas not de facto arrest); United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522,\n\n531 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding that seventy-five-minute detention in\n\nlocked rear passenger compartment of police car was not de facto\n\narrest).    Moreover, during the short period for which Chaney was\n\ndetained,   the   police    officers    worked   diligently      towards     the\n\ninvestigative purpose for which he was being held -- namely,\n\ndetermining   Chaney's     identity.      See   Trueber,   238   F.3d   at    94\n\n(finding no de facto arrest where defendant was detained for\n\nfifteen minutes of questions that were \"brief and to the point[,]\n\n. . . targeted at ascertaining [the defendant's] identity, his\n\nreasons for being in the country, and whether he was involved in\n\nthe suspected illegal activity\").          Finally, it should have been\n\nreasonably clear to Chaney that Boyd, not Chaney, was the intended\n\n\n     13\n        We emphasize, however, that such forceful and intrusive\nmeasures have no place in routine investigatory detentions.\nAcosta-Colon, 157 F.3d at 18.\n\n                                   -20-\n\ftarget of the raid: Boyd was immediately seized and handcuffed by\n\nthe police upon their entry and was quickly led out of the motel\n\nroom.   The fact that Chaney and Hebert were not similarly seized,\n\nbut instead held in the room for follow-up questioning, should have\n\nsuggested that their detention was merely incidental to Boyd's\n\narrest.\n\n           In light of these circumstances, we do not think that a\n\nreasonable person standing in Chaney's shoes would understand that\n\nhe was subject to anything other than \"a brief period of detention\n\nat the scene while the police sought by means of a moderate number\n\nof questions to determine his identity and to obtain information\n\nconfirming or dispelling their suspicions.\"    Id., 238 F.3d at 93\n\n(quoting United States v. Streifel, 781 F.2d 953, 962 (1st Cir.\n\n1986)).   Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's\n\nconclusion that Chaney's detention did not constitute a de facto\n\narrest warranting the suppression of evidence.\n\n                                III.\n\n           Having closely reviewed the record, we are persuaded that\n\nthe district court did not err in declining to suppress evidence\n\nseized from Chaney during the November 30, 2005 raid. The district\n\ncourt's judgment is therefore affirmed.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\f",

Paul J. Barbadoro,   U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Torruella, Ripple,* and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert Herrick for appellant.\n     Seth R.

Defendant-appellant Vincent Chaney\n\nappeals the denial of a motion to suppress evidence seized from him\n\nin the raid of a motel room in which Chaney was a guest.   Placed on\n\nthe floor and handcuffed in the wake of his host's arrest on drug\n\ncharges, Chaney consented to a search of his pants pocket to locate\n\nidentification; the search turned up seven small bags of crack\n\ncocaine.   A dozen rounds of .38-caliber ammunition were later\n\ndiscovered in the pocket of his jacket.\n\n           After unsuccessfully moving to suppress this evidence,\n\nChaney entered a conditional guilty plea to charges of simple\n\npossession of cocaine and possession of a firearm after a prior\n\nfelony conviction.    On appeal, Chaney argues that the police\n\nexceeded the scope of his consent by removing cocaine, rather than\n\nidentification, from his pocket; that his consent was the product\n\nof a coercive atmosphere and hence not voluntary; and that all\n\nevidence seized was the fruit of an unlawful de facto arrest.\n\nFinding no reversible error in the district court's rulings, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n           The events giving rise to this appeal took place in the\n\ncourse of a police raid on a Manchester, New Hampshire motel room\n\nin late 2005.    In reciting the facts, we draw on the district\n\ncourt's oral findings of fact at Chaney's suppression hearings as\n\nwell as testimony taken at those hearings.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f           On November 30, 2005, state and federal law enforcement\n\nofficials in possession of a federal arrest warrant for a man named\n\nPeter Boyd, suspected of distributing crack cocaine, went to the\n\nQueen City Inn in Manchester, New Hampshire.             Past experience\n\nflagged the motel as a likely choice for local drug dealers looking\n\nfor temporary lodging.      Shown a picture of Boyd, a clerk at the\n\nQueen City Inn confirmed to an investigating United States Marshal\n\nthat a man of Boyd's appearance was staying in a room at the motel.\n\nThe   marshal   summoned   four   additional   federal   and   local    law\n\nenforcement officers to the motel to aid in executing the warrant.\n\n           The motel room in which Boyd was staying was registered\n\nin the name of Brigit Hebert, a woman familiar to the authorities\n\nas the subject of several past drug-related arrest warrants.\n\nUnbeknownst to the officers, also present in Hebert's motel room\n\nwas Vincent Chaney.    According to his testimony at the suppression\n\nhearings, Chaney had come the previous night from Virginia, hoping\n\nto visit two of his daughters who were living with their mother in\n\nManchester.     Arriving too late to visit with his daughters, Chaney\n\nwent to a bar and happened upon Boyd, an old acquaintance.             Boyd\n\noffered to put Chaney up for the night in the room he was sharing\n\nwith Hebert at the Queen City Inn.       Boyd, Hebert, and Chaney were\n\nthus all present in Hebert's motel room when the officers arrived\n\nearly in the afternoon of the next day to execute Boyd's arrest\n\nwarrant.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f             Two local detectives were dispatched to cover the rear\n\ndoor to Hebert's motel room while three marshals approached from\n\nthe front, knocking on the door and announcing their presence. The\n\ndoor opened to reveal Boyd, wearing pajama pants but shirtless and\n\nwithout shoes.      Boyd was taken into custody, and the marshals\n\nentered the room with their weapons drawn to perform a protective\n\nsweep.    They found the room darkened and clothing scattered across\n\nthe floor, with Hebert lying in bed and Chaney, whom the officers\n\ndid not recognize, standing next to it.             The marshals told Hebert\n\nto get out of bed and put her hands up, which she did.                Chaney was\n\nless compliant,     edging   toward    the       corner   of   the   bed   despite\n\nrepeated commands to stop moving and lie on the ground.                After six\n\nor more warnings, Chaney acquiesced and was handcuffed on the\n\nfloor.    The marshals completed their sweep of the main room, the\n\nspace underneath the bed, and the bathroom, finding in plain view\n\ntwo   bags   of   what   appeared     to    be    marijuana     (sitting    on   a\n\nwindowsill), three crack pipes (on the windowsill and on a chair),\n\nand a number of rounds of .22-caliber ammunition (located in a\n\nclear bag in the closet).1\n\n\n      1\n       A further search of the premises, conducted later in the day\nwith Hebert's consent, unearthed two firearms (a .22-caliber, pump-\naction rifle with ammunition in it and a .38-caliber Derringer\npistol), a bowl containing a white powdery substance that field-\ntested positive for cocaine, and various items associated with drug\nmanufacture (baking soda, lighter fluid, and glassine bags).\nNotably, the Derringer pistol was found under the corner of the\nbed's mattress, the point toward which Chaney had been edging when\nthe police first entered the motel room.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            As the protective sweep was being conducted, the marshals\n\nopened the rear door of the motel to admit the local detectives.\n\nDetective Brian Newcomb approached Chaney, patted him down for\n\nweapons, and then attempted to learn his identity.                Chaney was not\n\nimmediately forthright, telling Detective Newcomb only that his\n\nname was Vincent and providing him with several false dates of\n\nbirth.    After the local dispatch reported that it was unable to\n\nfind a match for the dates of birth in their database, Newcomb\n\nasked Chaney if he had any identification.            Chaney indicated that\n\nhe did, and that it could be found in his back pocket.                 Detective\n\nNewcomb    asked   for    and    was    granted   consent    to   retrieve     the\n\nidentification from Chaney's back pocket, but the pocket turned out\n\nto   be   empty.   Asked    if    the    identification     might     be   located\n\nelsewhere, Chaney suggested that it might be in his left front\n\npocket.    Chaney again consented to have Newcomb search his pocket\n\nfor the identification.\n\n            Detective Newcomb placed his hand in Chaney's left front\n\npocket and removed first a plastic bag that held seven individual\n\nplastic    bags,   each    of    which    contained   a     \"chunky    off-white\n\nsubstance\"; he then reentered Chaney's pocket and removed a social\n\nsecurity card.2     Newcomb believed the off-white substance in the\n\n\n      2\n       Chaney disputed the sequence of events in his testimony at\nthe suppression hearing.    According to Chaney, he responded to\nNewcomb's request for identification by removing the social\nsecurity card from his back pocket and turning it over to Newcomb.\nDetective Newcomb then allegedly asked Chaney if he had any sharp\n\n                                        -5-\n\fbags to be crack cocaine, having seen the substance in his prior\n\nlaw enforcement experience some fifty to one hundred times (a field\n\ntest later confirmed his suspicions). Newcomb informed Chaney that\n\nhe was under arrest for possession of crack cocaine with intent to\n\ndistribute.   After learning from dispatch that the social security\n\ncard found in Chaney's pocket, which bore the name \"Vincent Earold\n\nChaney,\" belonged to a four-year-old boy,3 Newcomb again asked\n\nChaney for his date of birth.    Chaney provided the correct date\n\nthis time, and a search of police records confirmed his identity\n\nand revealed an outstanding warrant for his arrest in Massachusetts\n\nfor a probation violation.\n\n          As Detective Newcomb was escorting Chaney to a police car\n\noutside the motel, Chaney asked Newcomb to retrieve a backpack and\n\njacket Chaney had left in the room.   Newcomb retrieved a backpack\n\nand jacket matching the description provided by Chaney.      After\n\nChaney confirmed that they belonged to him, Newcomb searched both\n\nitems, locating in the jacket pocket a plastic bag containing\n\ntwelve rounds of .38-caliber ammunition.\n\n\n\nobjects in his pockets, Chaney told Newcomb that he did not, and\nNewcomb proceeded to search Chaney's other pockets and remove items\n(including the plastic bags containing cocaine) without consent.\nIn his oral findings of fact, Judge DiClerico adopted Detective\nNewcomb's version of the consensual search, implicitly discrediting\nChaney's account.\n     3\n       The card belonged to Chaney's deceased son, Vincent Chaney,\nJr.   Chaney stated that he had mistakenly grabbed the wrong\nidentification card when he left his home in Virginia.\n\n                                -6-\n\f          Chaney was eventually indicted in the district court on\n\ntwo counts arising out of the incident: one count of simple\n\npossession of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a), and\n\none count of unlawful possession of a firearm after a prior felony\n\nconviction, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922 and 924(a)(2).4\n\nChaney moved to suppress all of the evidence seized in the course\n\nof his detention and arrest.\n\n          The district court held two evidentiary hearings to\n\nevaluate possible grounds for suppression.     The first, held by\n\nJudge DiClerico on September 4, 2008, addressed Chaney's argument\n\nthat the search of Hebert's motel room was unlawful due to the\n\nabsence of a valid search warrant. After testimony from Chaney and\n\nthree of the police officers who conducted the search and arrest,\n\nJudge DiClerico ruled that Chaney lacked standing to challenge the\n\nsearch of the motel room.   The judge also found that Chaney had\n\nconsented to a search of his pockets, and that the search of\n\nChaney's jacket before turning it over to him had been reasonable\n\nin light of officer safety concerns.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n        Chaney's indictment charged one additional felon-in-\npossession count related to a 2007 incident where an officer\nnoticed a handgun in Chaney's pocket during a routine traffic stop.\nChaney successfully moved to sever trial on the 2007 charge from\nthe 2005 charges. Though the district court initially suppressed\nall evidence seized in the 2007 traffic stop, we reversed in an\nearlier appeal filed by the government.

Judge Barbadoro rejected the\n\narguments, ruling that Chaney's detention was not a de facto\n\narrest, being limited in duration and reasonable in scope, and that\n\nChaney's consent was voluntary.          At the close of the hearing, the\n\njudge    confirmed   that    all   of    the    issues   concerning   Chaney's\n\ndetention and consent were preserved for appeal:\n\n            It's preserved for purposes of appeal that the\n            entry was illegal.

Chaney raises three\n\nchallenges to the district court's ruling.       First, he argues that\n\nthe removal from his pocket of plastic bags containing cocaine\n\nexceeded the scope of his consent, which, he asserts, was limited\n\nto a search of his pocket to locate identification.            Second, he\n\nargues that, even if he consented to a general search of his pants\n\npocket, the consent was involuntary because of an unduly coercive\n\natmosphere.   Third, he argues that the consent was the fruit of an\n\nunlawful, de facto arrest, and thus any evidence found in the\n\ncourse of the search must be excluded.     We address each of Chaney's\n\ncontentions in turn.\n\nA.   Scope of Consent\n\n            It is a fundamental principle of Fourth Amendment law\n\nthat a warrantless search may be conducted with the voluntary\n\nconsent of a person authorized to give such consent.           See United\n\nStates v.

See\n\nUnited States v. Torres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198221\"><a href=\"/opinion/198221/united-states-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (1st Cir. 1998) (forfeiture\n\n\"applies not only when a defendant has failed altogether to make a\n\nsuppression motion but also when, having made one, he has neglected\n\nto include the particular ground that he later seeks to argue\").\n\nOn the other hand, Chaney raised generally the issue of the\n\n\n     6\n       The government identifies this argument as a claim of\nwaiver, but it is actually one of forfeiture. As we have often\nexplained, an argument or right is waived only when it is\nintentionally abandoned; mere failure to raise an argument or right\ndue to inattention or neglect constitutes forfeiture. See United\nStates v. Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200202\"><a href=\"/opinion/200202/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).         The\ndistinction is a substantive one. Waiver generally bars an issue\nfrom being raised on appeal, whereas forfeiture allows the issue to\nbe reviewed for plain error.

See\n\nStierhoff, 549 F.3d at 23.\n\n          According       to   testimony    from    Detective    Newcomb,    who\n\nperformed the search of Chaney's pocket, Chaney \"stated that [the\n\ndetective]   could   go    through   his    left    front     pocket   and   find\n\n[Chaney's] identification.\"          Chaney argues that the \"expressed\n\nobject\"   of   this       consented-to      search      was     retrieval     of\n\nidentification, and thus the removal of the plastic bags from his\n\npocket fell outside of the scope of his consent.               We disagree.\n\n          The tight confines of a pants pocket leave a searching\n\nhand little room for maneuvering and distinguishing between various\n\nobjects that may be contained therein.             Given consent to retrieve\n\nan object from such a cramped space, it is objectively reasonable\n\nto assume that the consent extends to the removal of items that\n\neither may constitute the object of the search and cannot be\n\nimmediately identified or that obstruct further access to other\n\nitems in the pocket.       Nothing in Chaney's exchange with Detective\n\nNewcomb suggests that he intended to withhold consent for these\n\nsorts of practical measures that are reasonable incidents to the\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fsearch of a pocket.         Chaney's argument appears to be that, absent\n\nexplicit   permission       to     remove    items   other   than    evidence   of\n\nidentification, the detective was required to fish around in the\n\npocket until he located an item that he could positively identify\n\nto be some form of identification and that could be removed without\n\ndislodging other items.          The \"typical reasonable person\" would not\n\nso interpret Chaney's exchange with the officer.7\n\n           Because     it    was    objectively      reasonable     for Detective\n\nNewcomb to believe that the scope of consent extended to the\n\nremoval of plastic bags from Chaney's pocket in the course of\n\nsearching for identification, we find no unconstitutional excursion\n\nbeyond the boundaries of Chaney's consent. See Jimeno, 500 U.S. at\n\n249   (\"The   Fourth        Amendment       is   satisfied   when,     under    the\n\ncircumstances, it is objectively reasonable for the officer to\n\nbelieve that the scope of the suspect's consent permitted [the\n\nchallenged search].\").8\n\n\n      7\n       This is not to say that Chaney's consent should be read as\na generalized authorization to search his entire pocket, however.\nIf the detective had immediately located identification, turning\nout the rest of Chaney's pocket would surely exceed the scope of\nconsent. But the record does not suggest that such was the case:\nDetective Newcomb testified at the second suppression hearing that\nhe removed the plastic bag from Chaney's pocket before the\nidentification card.\n      8\n       Both parties discuss the possible application of the \"plain\nfeel\" doctrine of Minnesota v. Dickerson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112873\"><a href=\"/opinion/112873/minnesota-v-dickerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993) to\nthe present case. That rule, an extension of the familiar \"plain\nview\" doctrine, allows the seizure of contraband readily identified\nby feel during a Terry frisk. While we agree with Chaney that the\ndoctrine would have no application where testimony suggests that\n\n                                        -12-\n\fB.   Voluntariness of Consent\n\n           Chaney next raises a more fundamental challenge to the\n\nconsent search of his pocket, arguing that the coercive atmosphere\n\nof the police raid rendered his consent involuntary.                Whether a\n\nsuspect's consent to a warrantless search was truly voluntary or,\n\ninstead, the product of coercion \"is a question of fact to be\n\ndetermined from an examination of the totality of circumstances.\"\n\nMarshall, 348 F.3d at 286.       Among the factors we will consider in\n\nmaking   that   determination    are     the    suspect's   \"age,   education,\n\nexperience,     knowledge   of   the    right    to   withhold   consent,   and\n\nevidence of coercive tactics.\"            Id.     Upon close review of the\n\nrecord, we can find no clear error in the district court's finding\n\nthat Chaney freely and voluntarily consented to the search of his\n\npants pocket.\n\n           Chaney draws on a number of factors in trying to paint a\n\npicture of coercion.    First, Chaney highlights the officers' \"show\n\nof force\" in entering the motel room with guns drawn.                 Setting\n\naside the fact that his consent was given after all occupants of\n\nthe room were handcuffed and the excitement of the initial entry\n\nhad passed, neither the number of officers who entered the room\n\n(five) nor the readiness of their weapons suggests an overwhelming\n\n\nthe contraband was not identified by feel but instead by visual\ninspection after removal from his pocket, we need not directly\naddress these arguments given our holding that the removal of\ncocaine from Chaney's pocket fell within the scope of the consent\ngranted.\n\n                                       -13-\n\fshow of force.     See United States v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (finding the fact that ten to fifteen officers entered\n\nhotel room with guns drawn insufficient to void voluntariness of\n\nconsent).   Chaney notes as well that the occupants of the room were\n\nasleep when law enforcement arrived at the motel room.                   The\n\nevidence is mixed as to whether Chaney, who was standing and fully\n\nclothed when the officers entered the room, was actually awakened\n\nby the officers' arrival. Regardless, the mere fact of having been\n\nrecently asleep does not necessarily affect one's capacity to\n\nvoluntarily grant consent.         Although Chaney cites the officers'\n\nfailure to advise him of his right to refuse consent to the search,\n\na factor that is certainly relevant to voluntariness of consent,\n\n\"[w]e have repeatedly held that the failure to advise a defendant\n\nof his right to refuse consent does not automatically render such\n\nconsent invalid.\"    Id.\n\n            Importantly, this was not Chaney's first encounter with\n\nlaw enforcement.    He had been arrested on more than a dozen prior\n\noccasions   and   convicted   of    a    comparable   number   of   criminal\n\noffenses.   It is reasonable to infer that a veteran of the criminal\n\njustice system will be \"less likely than most to be intimidated by\n\nthe agents' show of force.\"         United States v.

De Facto Arrest\n\n           Chaney alternatively contends that the evidence seized\n\nfrom him was the fruit of an unlawful de facto arrest.10         While the\n\nperiod of detention leading to the discovery of crack cocaine in\n\nChaney's pocket certainly bore some typical indicia of an arrest,\n\nwe   concur   with   the    district   court's    conclusion     that   the\n\ncircumstances did not rise to the level of a de facto arrest.\n\n           Any detention of an individual by a police officer\n\nconstitutes   a   seizure   and, to    be   lawful,   must   be adequately\n\njustified under the Fourth Amendment.

Where an\n\ninvestigatory stop is justified at its inception, it will generally\n\nnot morph into a de facto arrest as long as \"the actions undertaken\n\nby the officer[s] following the stop were reasonably responsive to\n\nthe circumstances   justifying   the    stop   in the   first   place as\n\naugmented by information gleaned by the officer[s] during the\n\nstop.\"   United States v.

The use of drawn guns and handcuffs, being\n\nsome \"of the most recognizable indicia of a traditional arrest,\"\n\nwill generally tilt the scale to some significant degree toward a\n\nfinding of de facto arrest. See United States v. Acosta-Colon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198134\"><a href=\"/opinion/198134/united-states-v-acosta-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir. 1998).   However, we have repeatedly noted that\n\nneither factor is alone determinative.

We think this inquiry applies with equal force in\n\nassessing whether the use of drawn handguns was reasonable in\n\ninitiating a stop.\n\n            We can locate no error in the district court's finding\n\nthat the specific circumstances of the November 30, 2005 raid gave\n\nrise to a reasonable concern for officer security that justified\n\nthe use     of   handcuffs   and   drawn    handguns.     The    unanticipated\n\npresence, in a darkened motel room inhabited by two suspected drug\n\ndealers, of an unfamiliar man who ignored repeated orders from the\n\npolice to stop moving and drop to the ground might alone be enough\n\nto justify more intrusive measures for briefly securing him during\n\n\n     12\n         See also Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d at 18 (\"[T]he use of\nhandcuffs in the course of an investigatory stop does not\nautomatically convert the encounter into a de facto arrest.\");\nUnited States v.

There were, however, still other factors here\n\nthat counseled particular caution.    The officers knew that Boyd,\n\nthe subject of the arrest warrant, had an extensive criminal\n\nhistory, and a preliminary protective sweep of the motel room\n\nlocated not just drug paraphernalia but also ammunition. Moreover,\n\nthe motel room was littered with clothing, which easily could --\n\nand, as was later discovered, did -- conceal a weapon within close\n\nreach of the occupants.\n\n          Under circumstances such as these, especially in the\n\nclose quarters of a motel room, we are mindful of the need for\n\nofficers to safely secure the scene. \"[T]he ultimate touchstone of\n\nthe Fourth Amendment is 'reasonableness,'\" Brigham City v.

Chaney was detained for\n\nfewer than five minutes before being arrested for possession of\n\ncocaine. We have held significantly longer periods of detention to\n\nfall short of de facto arrest.         See, e.g., Owens, 167 F.3d at 749\n\n(noting that there is no talismanic time beyond which a Terry stop\n\nbecomes unreasonable and holding that detention of fifty minutes\n\nwas not de facto arrest); United States v.

Moreover, during the short period for which Chaney was\n\ndetained,   the   police    officers    worked   diligently      towards     the\n\ninvestigative purpose for which he was being held -- namely,\n\ndetermining   Chaney's     identity.      See   Trueber,   238   F.3d   at    94\n\n(finding no de facto arrest where defendant was detained for\n\nfifteen minutes of questions that were \"brief and to the point[,]\n\n. . . targeted at ascertaining [the defendant's] identity, his\n\nreasons for being in the country, and whether he was involved in\n\nthe suspected illegal activity\").          Finally, it should have been\n\nreasonably clear to Chaney that Boyd, not Chaney, was the intended\n\n\n     13\n        We emphasize, however, that such forceful and intrusive\nmeasures have no place in routine investigatory detentions.\nAcosta-Colon, 157 F.3d at 18.\n\n                                   -20-\n\ftarget of the raid: Boyd was immediately seized and handcuffed by\n\nthe police upon their entry and was quickly led out of the motel\n\nroom.   The fact that Chaney and Hebert were not similarly seized,\n\nbut instead held in the room for follow-up questioning, should have\n\nsuggested that their detention was merely incidental to Boyd's\n\narrest.\n\n           In light of these circumstances, we do not think that a\n\nreasonable person standing in Chaney's shoes would understand that\n\nhe was subject to anything other than \"a brief period of detention\n\nat the scene while the police sought by means of a moderate number\n\nof questions to determine his identity and to obtain information\n\nconfirming or dispelling their suspicions.\"    Id., 238 F.3d at 93\n\n(quoting United States v.
