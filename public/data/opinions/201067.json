R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 03-1747\n\n                          RUBLE HECK-DANCE,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                     JOSE F.

Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Ruble L. Heck on brief pro se.\n     Jose O. Ramos Gonzalez and Ramos Gonzalez & Toyos Olascoaga\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             June 15, 2004\n\f            PER CURIAM.       Pro se plaintiff-appellant Ruble Heck-Dance\n\n(\"Heck\")    appeals     the   grant   of   summary     judgment    in     favor   of\n\ndefendant-appellee Jose F. Cardona-Jimenez (\"Cardona\").                   We review\n\nthe grant     of   summary     judgment    de novo,    examining     the    record\n\nindependently and drawing any factual inferences in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-movant.          Gu v. Boston Police Dep't, 312 F.3d\n\n6, 10 (1st Cir. 2002).            After carefully reviewing the parties'\n\nbriefs and the record, we affirm the grant of summary judgment\n\nsubstantially for the reasons stated in the district court's\n\nopinion and order entered on February 5, 2003.                   We add only the\n\nfollowing comments.\n\n            We agree with Heck that diversity of citizenship appears\n\nto    be   lacking    in   this    case,     and    that   the    lower    court's\n\ncharacterization of this case as a diversity action appears to have\n\nbeen in error.       We are satisfied, however, that the district court\n\nhad subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1334(b) because Heck's legal malpractice claim is based on\n\nthe   defendant      attorney's    handling    of   Heck's   bankruptcy      case.\n\nGrausz v. Englander, 321 F.3d 467, 471-72 (4th Cir. 2003) (holding\n\nthat debtors' legal malpractice claim was a claim \"arising in\"\n\nTitle 11 for purposes of federal jurisdiction since the proceeding\n\nwould have no practical existence but for the bankruptcy).\n\n            Heck's other claimed errors lack merit.                     First, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in applying Puerto Rico's one-year\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fstatute of limitations for tort actions to Heck's legal malpractice\n\ncase.   Colon Prieto v. Geigel, 115 D.P.R. 232, 236 & n.4, 115 P.R.\n\nOffic. Trans. 313, 318 & n.4 (1984).    Further, the district court\n\ndid not err in ruling that Heck's legal malpractice case was time-\n\nbarred.    We agree with the lower court that Heck's June 19, 2000\n\narticle in the San Juan Star demonstrated Heck's awareness of his\n\nlegal malpractice claim against Cardona, and that his malpractice\n\naction - filed at the earliest on July 18, 2001 in bankruptcy court\n\n- was untimely.\n\n             Heck's attempt to toll the statute of limitations by\n\ninvoking various bankruptcy laws is to no avail.        First, Heck\n\ncannot rely on the automatic stay provision in 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)\n\nbecause it applies only to actions \"against\" the debtor. Heck's\n\nreliance on Simon v. Navon, 116 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997), is\n\nmisplaced.    In that case, we held that section 362 stays appellate\n\nproceedings in actions originally brought \"against\" the debtor,\n\neven when it is the debtor who files the appeal.    Simon, 116 F.3d\n\nat 4.     Second, Heck was not entitled to an extension of time to\n\nfile his malpractice action pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 108(a).   By its\n\nterms section 108(a) applies only to extend time for actions which\n\nthe debtor had on the date of filing the bankruptcy petition.   See\n\n11 U.S.C. § 108(a) (\"If applicable law . . . fixes a period within\n\nwhich the debtor may commence an action, and such period has not\n\nexpired before the date of the filing of the petition . . .\")\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f(emphasis   added).    In   this   action,   Heck   claims   that   Cardona\n\nmishandled his bankruptcy case.      Obviously, the claim arose post-\n\npetition.    Therefore, section 108(a) is inapplicable.         Matter of\n\nPhillip, 948 F.2d 985, 987 (5th Cir. 1991) (noting that causes of\n\naction acquired post-petition are not protected by section 108).\n\nFinally, even assuming that Heck could not bring this action until\n\nthe bankruptcy trustee abandoned the claim, Heck does not assert\n\nthat he sought to have the trustee abandon the claim prior to the\n\nrunning of the limitations period.       In re Price, 173 B.R. 434, 443\n\n(Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1994) (noting that, to extent timing is important,\n\ndebtor may move for order requiring trustee to abandon claim).\n\nThus, there is no basis to toll the limitations period.\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed.         See 1st\n\nCir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f",
