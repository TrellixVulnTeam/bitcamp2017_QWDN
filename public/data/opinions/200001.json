James R. Muirhead, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Steven A.

After carefully reviewing the record and\n\nbriefs on appeal, we affirm the judgment for substantially the\n\nreasons given below.\n\n             The appellant’s primary argument on appeal is that\n\nthe court’s federal question jurisdiction covered his Sixteenth\n\nAmendment     challenge      to     his       income   taxes.   A    frivolous\n\nconstitutional      issue    does       not    raise   a   federal   question,\n\nhowever.     Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528 (1974); Molina-Crespo\n\nv. Califano, 583 F.2d 572 (1st Cir. 1978). The appellant argues\n\nthat the constitutional issue could not be frivolous because he\nadduced credible evidence that Congress intended a narrower\nincome tax.        He misses the point.            The issue is frivolous\nbecause it has already been decided, not because the evidence\n\nis univocal.        The income tax has survived constitutional\n\nchallenge. See, e.g., Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189 (1920);\n\nQuijano v. United States, 93 F.3d 26 (1st Cir. 1996); United\n\nStates v. Turano, 802 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1986).\n             The appellant’s remaining arguments merit little\n\ndiscussion.    Given the resolution of the constitutional issue,\n\nthe appellant could not show that he was certain to prevail,\n\nprecluding equitable relief.              Bob Jones University v. Simon,\n\n416   U.S.   725   (1974).        The     appellant    failed   to   establish\njurisdiction under I.R.C. § 7422(a) by showing that he paid the\n\ntaxes and filed claims for refunds.               McMillen v. United States\n\nDepartment of Treasury, 960 F.2d 187 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f         We hereby deny the appellant’s motion for return of\n\nproperty and an investigation.\n\n          Affirmed.
