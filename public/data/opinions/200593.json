Palmer, for appellant Santo Ruiz.\n     Melvin Norris, for appellant Virgilio Ruiz.\n     Timothy Q. Feeley, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                          August 7, 2003\n\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f          R. ARNOLD, Senior Circuit Judge. Virgilio and Santo Ruiz\n\nwere convicted in 1994 on four charges stemming from a fire that\n\nburned down their business in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1990.                    The\n\nbrothers now challenge their convictions on the basis of new\n\nevidence that Virgilio uncovered in 2000 that had been in the\n\npossession of the Boston Police Department.                    The District Court\n\nreviewed and rejected their pro se § 2255 motion, containing an\n\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The Court also considered\n\na later-filed motion (of an ambiguous nature) as both a § 2255\n\nmotion and as a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure.          The Court concluded that it\n\nwas time-barred regardless of its form.                   The Court went on,\n\nhowever, to address the substantive arguments raised in the motion\n\nand determined    that    they    were    without    merit       because   the   new\n\nevidence was not significant enough to raise any doubt about the\n\ndefendants’ convictions.         We affirm on the merits.\n\n                                      I.\n\n          The    defendants,      Virgilio    Ruiz       and    Santo   Ruiz,    are\n\nbrothers who owned and operated a clothing store. The store burned\n\ndown under suspicious circumstances, and two-and-a-half years later\n\nthe brothers were indicted and convicted of conspiracy, use of a\n\nfire to commit a felony, arson, and mail fraud.                 18 U.S.C. §§ 371,\n\n844(h)(1),   844(i),     1341.      The    facts    of    the    case   have     been\n\nthoroughly recited elsewhere.        See United States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f1492 (1st Cir. 1997).         This Court affirmed their convictions but\n\nremanded the case for resentencing.               The Ruizes were resentenced,\n\nand the defendants’ final opportunity to challenge their new\n\nsentences by direct appeal expired on April 20, 1998.1\n\n            The defendants then filed a pro se § 2255 motion in May\n\nof 1998. They argued that they had received ineffective assistance\n\nfrom their attorneys.          For the most part, their claims second-\n\nguessed their attorneys’ tactical decisions at trial.                      As this\n\nmotion worked its way through the system, Virgilio Ruiz searched\n\nfor exonerating evidence.\n\n            Virgilio filed a public records act request with the\n\nBoston Police Department at the end of 1999.                       He received a\n\nresponse at the beginning of 2000, in the form of a report, which\n\nproved that there had been a gas leak at the business on June 1,\n\n1989, when the business was owned by the defendants’ brother,\n\nRafael   Ruiz.        The   report   would    have   been      useful   during   the\n\ndefendants’ trial – it bolstered the defendants’ theory that a gas\n\nleak might have caused the fire that destroyed their business.\n\nAdditionally, the defendants would have been able to counter the\n\ntestimony    of   a    representative        of    the   gas    company   who    had\n\ncontradicted the defendants by testifying that the company had no\n\nrecords from the prior six years of ever visiting the store because\n\n\n     1\n      Both defendants have served their sentences. Santo Ruiz has\nbeen deported. Virgilio Ruiz remains in the country in the custody\nof the INS pending the outcome of this appeal.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fof a gas leak.        In reliance on this new evidence, defendants filed\n\na joint motion to expand the record on November 30, 2000.                       The\n\nDistrict Court decided that the motion was really some sort of\n\nmotion for a new trial and appointed attorneys to represent the\n\ndefendants from then on.\n\n                 In its thorough memorandum and order, Ruiz v. United\n\nStates, 221 F. Supp. 2d 66 (D. Mass. 2002), the District Court\n\nrejected the         defendants’   pro   se    §   2255   motion,    which   raised\n\nquestions of ineffective assistance of counsel.2                     The District\n\nCourt determined that it was not objectively unreasonable for\n\ncounsel to miss the report.           The defense advanced by the attorneys\n\nat trial did not rely on the gas-leak theory that the defendants\n\nvigorously advance now.            The District Court believed counsels’\n\napproach at trial was a reasonable one, and counsel could not be\n\nexpected to search out evidence supporting other explanations for\n\nthe fire.\n\n                 The District Court went on to consider whether the\n\nabsence of the police report prejudiced the defendants.                      It did\n\nnot,       the   Court   concluded,    because     the    evidence   against    the\n\ndefendants was so strong that the report would not have made a\n\ndifference, i.e., it did not satisfy the second requirement of the\n\n\n       2\n      The defendants also raise a Brady due-process claim.\nAssuming we could consider the Brady argument on its merits, it\nwould fail for the same reason the ineffective-assistance claim\nmust fail — the absence of prejudice under the applicable legal\nstandard.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fStrickland test.     Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694\n\n(1984) (“The    defendant   must    show    that   there   is    a   reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the\n\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.”).\n\n          The District Court then analyzed the status of the\n\ndefendants’ joint motion, which had been filed after the discovery\n\nof the police report in 2000.       Because the motion focused on the\n\neffect the new evidence had on the case, the District Court decided\n\nthat it was, more likely than not, a Rule 33 motion.             Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 33.    To be thorough, the Court also considered whether the\n\nmotion could be successful if treated as a § 2255 motion.\n\n          In either case, the Court said, the motion would be time-\n\nbarred.   The defendants attempted to circumvent this problem by\n\narguing that the statute of limitations that applied to their\n\nmotion was tolled on various grounds.         The District Court rejected\n\nall three proffered grounds for tolling.\n\n          The   District    Court    also    addressed     the       substantive\n\nquestion of whether the newly discovered evidence could have any\n\neffect on the defendants’ convictions. Under either § 2255 or Rule\n\n33, the defendants had to show that the uncovering of the report\n\nwarranted a new trial.      Barrett v. United States, 965 F.2d 1184,\n\n1194-95 (1st Cir. 1992).        Under the more lenient of the two\n\nstandards, the § 2255 standard, the report had (among other things)\n\nto create a reasonable probability that an acquittal would have\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fresulted had the report been available.      United States v. Josleyn,\n\n206 F.3d 144, 151 (1st Cir. 2000).        The District Court admitted\n\nthat the evidence would have bolstered the defendants’ explanation\n\nfor the fire and would have countered some of the evidence of a\n\ngovernment witness.       However, the government’s case was very\n\nstrong, and the new evidence did not significantly diminish it.\n\nThe District Court concluded that the joint motion could not\n\nprevail even if it were timely.\n\n                                  II.\n\n             We have two issues before us.   The first is whether the\n\ndefendants’ § 2255 motion (the ineffective-assistance motion) had\n\nany merit.    The second issue is multi-tiered.   It consists of three\n\nquestions:     what kind of motion was the joint motion; was it\n\ntimely; and, if we reach its merits, does it warrant granting a new\n\ntrial?   We do not have to engage in a detailed discussion of all\n\nthe questions raised by these two issues.      The District Court has\n\nalready done so.       Instead, we note that both issues share the\n\nrequirement that the report have a certain significance relative to\n\nthe evidence that convicted the defendants.\n\n                 A.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n             The question of ineffective assistance of counsel is a\n\nmixed question of fact and law. Gonzalez-Soberal v. United States,\n\n244 F.3d 273, 277 (1st Cir. 2001).      We review the District Court’s\n\nlegal conclusions de novo and its underlying findings of fact for\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fclear error.       Cody v. United States, 249 F.3d 47, 52 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).     On appeal, defendants continue to argue that it was\n\nineffective assistance for their lawyers to fail to find the\n\nreport.    Even if the lawyers were ineffective, the defendants must\n\nshow that this mistake prejudiced them.             Specifically, they must\n\nshow that the absence of the report undermines confidence in the\n\noutcome of their trial.          Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.      This they\n\ncannot do.\n\n               The report was not so significant as the defendants\n\nclaim.    At the time of trial, the defendants already had a Boston\n\nFire Department document saying that firefighters had responded to\n\na reported gas leak at the store on June 1, 1989.              To the extent\n\nthat the police report proved the same, it was cumulative evidence.\n\n               Additionally, there is a host of evidence that the\n\nbrothers started the fire. The insurance agent who sold them their\n\npolicy indicated that when the brothers obtained insurance on the\n\nbuilding they expressed an unusual interest in how claims would be\n\nprocessed and paid by the insurance company.             Two weeks before the\n\nfire, Santo Ruiz stopped setting the alarm, which would have\n\nalerted the authorities to a fire.             A government expert testified\n\nthat     the    fire   started     in    two    places   inside   the   store\n\nsimultaneously, which is inconsistent with the theory that a gas\n\nleak caused the fire.     An expert also said that an accelerant, such\n\nas gasoline, played a role in the fire.            And there was no evidence\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fpointing to an electrical or gas failure as the source of the fire.\n\nFinally, a government witness testified that there was reason to\n\nthink that the store’s contents had been removed before the fire\n\nstarted.\n\n            We agree with the District Court that the cumulative\n\nweight of this evidence is overwhelming.           The defendants cannot\n\nprevail on this claim because, even if their counsel had been\n\nremiss in their duties, the introduction of evidence of a gas leak\n\neighteen months before the fire would not have been enough to\n\nundermine confidence in the outcome of this case.\n\n                           B.   The Joint Motion\n\n            The joint motion suffers from the same problem.         Brady\n\nclaims     are   subject   to   the    same   prejudice   requirement   as\n\nineffective-assistance claims.         See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694\n\n(“The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability\n\nthat, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the\n\nproceeding would have been different.”); McCambridge v. Hall, 303\n\nF.3d 24, 37 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (“[T]here is no prejudice\n\nunder Brady . . . unless there is ‘a reasonable probability that,\n\nhad the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the\n\nproceeding would have been different.’ ” (quoting United States v.\n\nBagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985) (plurality opinion))).\n\n            The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law. <i>Gonzalez-Soberal v. United States,</i> 244 F.3d 273, 277 (1st Cir.2001). We review the District Court's legal conclusions <i>de novo</i> and its underlying findings of fact for clear error. <i>Cody v. United States,</i> 249 F.3d 47, 52 (1st Cir.2001). On appeal, defendants continue to argue that it was ineffective assistance for their lawyers to fail to find the report. Even if the lawyers were ineffective, the defendants must show that this mistake prejudiced them. Specifically, they must show that the absence of the report undermines confidence in the outcome of their trial. <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. This they cannot do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The report was not so significant as the defendants claim. At the time of trial, the defendants already had a Boston Fire Department document saying that firefighters had responded to a reported gas leak at the store on June 1, 1989. To the extent that the police report proved the same, it was cumulative evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, there is a host of evidence that the brothers started the fire. The insurance agent who sold them their policy indicated that when the brothers obtained insurance on the building they expressed an unusual interest in how claims would be processed and paid by the insurance company. Two weeks before the fire, Santo Ruiz stopped setting the alarm, which would have alerted the authorities to a fire. A government expert testified that the fire started in two places inside the store simultaneously, which is inconsistent with the theory that a gas leak caused the fire. An expert also said that an accelerant, such as gasoline, played a role in the fire. And there was no evidence pointing to an electrical or gas failure as the source of the fire. Finally, a government witness testified that there was reason to think that the store's contents had been removed before the fire started.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the District Court that the cumulative weight of this evidence is overwhelming. The defendants cannot prevail on this claim because, even if their counsel had been remiss in their duties, the introduction of evidence of a gas leak eighteen months before the fire would not have been enough to undermine confidence in the outcome of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Joint Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The joint motion suffers from the same problem. <i>Brady</i> claims are subject to the same prejudice requirement as ineffective-assistance claims. <i>See Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\"The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"); <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 303 F.3d 24, 37 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc) (\"[T]here is no prejudice under <i>Brady</i> ... unless there is `a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) (plurality opinion))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Both defendants have served their sentences.

The brothers now challenge their convictions on the basis of new evidence that Virgilio uncovered in 2000 that had been in the possession of the Boston Police Department. The District Court reviewed and rejected their <i>pro se</i> &#167; 2255 motion, containing an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The Court also considered a later-filed motion (of an ambiguous nature) as both a &#167; 2255 motion and as a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Court concluded that it was time-barred regardless of its form. The Court went on, however, to address the substantive arguments raised in the motion and determined that they were without merit because the new evidence was not significant enough to raise any doubt about the defendants' convictions. We affirm on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, Virgilio Ruiz and Santo Ruiz, are brothers who owned and operated a clothing store. The store burned down under suspicious circumstances, and two-and-a-half years later the brothers were indicted and convicted of conspiracy, use of a fire to commit a felony, arson, and mail fraud. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 844(h)(1), 844(i), 1341. The facts of the case have been thoroughly recited elsewhere. <i>See United States v. Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197202\"><a href=\"/opinion/197202/united-states-v-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1492</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1997). This Court affirmed their convictions but remanded the case for resentencing. The Ruizes were resentenced, and the defendants' final opportunity to challenge their new sentences by direct appeal expired on April 20, 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants then filed a <i>pro se</i> &#167; 2255 motion in May of 1998. They argued that they had received ineffective assistance from their attorneys. For the most part, their claims second-guessed their attorneys' tactical decisions at trial. As this motion worked its way through the system, Virgilio Ruiz searched for exonerating evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virgilio filed a public records act request with the Boston Police Department at the end of 1999. He received a response at the beginning of 2000, in the form of a report, which proved that there had been a gas leak at the business on June 1, 1989, when the business was owned by the defendants' brother, Rafael Ruiz. The report would have been useful during the defendants' trial &#8212; it bolstered the defendants' theory that a gas leak might have caused the fire that destroyed their business. Additionally, the defendants would have been able to counter the testimony of a representative of the gas company who had contradicted the defendants by testifying that the company had no records from the prior six years of ever visiting the store because of a gas leak. In reliance on this new evidence, defendants filed a joint motion to expand the record on November 30, 2000. The District Court decided that the motion was really some sort of motion for a new trial and appointed attorneys to represent the defendants from then on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its thorough memorandum and order, <i>Ruiz v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2486207\"><a href=\"/opinion/2486207/ruiz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2002), the District Court rejected the defendants' <i>pro se</i> &#167; 2255 motion, which raised questions of ineffective assistance of counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The District Court determined that it was not objectively unreasonable for counsel to miss the report. The defense advanced by the attorneys at trial did not rely on the gas-leak theory that the defendants vigorously advance now. The District Court believed counsels' approach at trial was a reasonable one, and counsel could not be expected to search out evidence supporting other explanations for the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court went on to consider whether the absence of the police report prejudiced the defendants. It did not, the Court concluded, because the evidence against the defendants was so strong that the report would not have made a difference, <i>i.e.,</i> it did not satisfy the second requirement of the <i>Strickland</i> test. <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 694, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984) (\"The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court then analyzed the status of the defendants' joint motion, which had been filed after the discovery of the police report in 2000. Because the motion focused on the effect the new evidence had on the case, the District Court decided that it was, more likely than not, a Rule 33 motion. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. To be thorough, the Court also considered whether the motion could be successful if treated as a &#167; 2255 motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In either case, the Court said, the motion would be time-barred. The defendants attempted to circumvent this problem by arguing that the statute of limitations that applied to their motion was tolled on various grounds. The District Court rejected all three proffered grounds for tolling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court also addressed the substantive question of whether the newly discovered evidence could have any effect on the defendants' convictions. Under either &#167; 2255 or Rule 33, the defendants had to show that the uncovering of the report warranted a new trial. <i>Barrett v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584145\"><a href=\"/opinion/584145/james-barrett-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1194-95 (1st Cir. 1992). Under the more lenient of the two standards, the &#167; 2255 standard, the report had (among other things) to create a reasonable probability that an acquittal would have resulted had the report been available. <i>United States v. Josleyn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767958\"><a href=\"/opinion/767958/united-states-v-dennis-r-josleyn-united-states-of-america-v-john-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 151 (1st Cir.2000). The District Court admitted that the evidence would have bolstered the defendants' explanation for the fire and would have countered some of the evidence of a government witness. However, the government's case was very strong, and the new evidence did not significantly diminish it. The District Court concluded that the joint motion could not prevail even if it were timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have two issues before us. The first is whether the defendants' &#167; 2255 motion (the ineffective-assistance motion) had any merit. The second issue is multi-tiered. It consists of three questions: what kind of motion was the joint motion; was it timely; and, if we reach its merits, does it warrant granting a new trial? We do not have to engage in a detailed discussion of all the questions raised by these two issues. The District Court has already done so. Instead, we note that both issues share the requirement that the report have a certain significance relative to the evidence that convicted the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law. <i>Gonzalez-Soberal v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772565\"><a href=\"/opinion/772565/manuel-gonz-lez-soberal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 277 (1st Cir.2001). We review the District Court's legal conclusions <i>de novo</i> and its underlying findings of fact for clear error. <i>Cody v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199404\"><a href=\"/opinion/199404/cody-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2001). On appeal, defendants continue to argue that it was ineffective assistance for their lawyers to fail to find the report. Even if the lawyers were ineffective, the defendants must show that this mistake prejudiced them. Specifically, they must show that the absence of the report undermines confidence in the outcome of their trial. <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This they cannot do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The report was not so significant as the defendants claim.
