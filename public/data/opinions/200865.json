George S. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Howard, Circuit Judge,\n           Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert E. Mongue for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        February 19, 2004\n\f          COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge. This is an appeal by a\n\njuvenile, Patrick V. (Patrick), from a judgment of delinquency in\n\na proceeding under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (FJDA), 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 5031-5042, for commission of arson causing extensive\n\nproperty damage in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(i) and 2.              The\n\ndistrict court ordered Patrick detained for a period of 30 months,\n\nfollowed by supervised release for 27 months, plus joint liability\n\nwith   another   individual    for    restitution   in   the   amount    of\n\n$728,141.61. Patrick claims that the rehabilitative purpose of the\n\nFJDA requires treatment rather than detention, and weighs against\n\nthe imposition of restitution.\n\n          The challenge to both the detention and the restitution\n\naspects of the judgment reflect the uneasy tension between the\n\nrehabilitation focus of the FJDA and the sterner approach of the\n\nmore recent Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3663A.\n\nFederal intervention in juvenile proceedings is relatively rare, at\n\nleast in this circuit, and we find ourselves in a field as yet\n\nunploughed.\n\n          After careful review, we conclude that the district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in ordering detention and restitution\n\non the record before it.      We do, however, feel that the record is\n\ninsufficient to permit the court, in arriving at its own final\n\ndisposition, to factor in information as to the location and\n\nrehabilitative capabilities of the detention facility chosen by the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fgovernment pursuant to the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 5039.               We\n\nbelieve   such      consideration    should    be   part   of   the   juvenile\n\nsentencing process and therefore retain jurisdiction and remand to\n\nthe district court for this limited purpose.\n\n                          I.   Factual Background\n\n           The Misconduct. Prior to the summer of 2002, Patrick had\n\nno   history   of    delinquent     activity   or   substance   abuse.     His\n\nemotional well-being, however, was affected by earlier traumatic\n\nevents that rendered him potentially more susceptible to the\n\ninfluence of a 19-year old \"adult\" friend, Christopher Conley.              At\n\nthe disposition proceedings, both of Patrick's parents testified\n\nthat their divorce in 1992, when Patrick was five, was acrimonious,\n\nand that Patrick's relationship with his parents likely suffered as\n\na result. A second traumatic interlude occurred when Patrick, when\n\nten years of age, was sexually abused by a camp counselor.               After\n\nPatrick's mother confronted the counselor, the counselor committed\n\nsuicide. Patrick was apparently in therapy as a result of this\n\nlatter experience, but only intermittently.\n\n           The friendship between Patrick and Conley spurred the\n\nabrupt change in Patrick's behavior.            Conley, recently released\n\nfrom a drug rehabilitation program in Pennsylvania, introduced\n\nPatrick to drugs and alcohol. Although Patrick had previously been\n\nan honor-roll student, his grades began to slip during the spring\n\nof 2002, his ninth grade year.           Prior to the arson, Conley and\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fPatrick committed a series of burglaries.               The first burglary was\n\na   vindictive     payback;    the   rest    allegedly      were    thrill-seeking\n\nescapades.\n\n            On the night of the arson, July 7, 2002, Conley and\n\nPatrick illicitly entered one of the buildings of Southern Maine\n\nMarine Services (SMMS), intending to steal a marine radio to enable\n\nthem to monitor police communications.               Once inside, they noticed\n\nsurveillance       cameras     (which,      unbeknownst       to     either,     were\n\ninoperable).         Conley    and    Patrick     attempted        to   locate    the\n\nsurveillance videotape, but when this proved unsuccessful they\n\ndecided to burn down the building and destroy any evidence of their\n\ncrime.    Searching the SMMS premises, they found explosive items\n\nsuch as flares and electronic equipment; they spread gasoline\n\naround the area and near an oil tank, and placed propane tanks near\n\na metal frame repair building and at the corner of a wooden office\n\nbuilding.    After setting fire to the gasoline by lighting a marine\n\nflare, the two fled the scene.\n\n             The    fire,    which   took     over    six    hours      to    control,\n\ncompletely destroyed the building used for repairs and damaged the\n\noffice building.      The property damage was extensive, including the\n\nloss of     two    boats,    three   boat    trailers,      boat   motors,      tools,\n\ntechnical    manuals    and    other     marine      equipment.         The    losses,\n\namounting to over $725,000, were suffered by 26 individuals and\n\ninsurance companies.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f          A month later, a box traced to appellant and Conley was\n\nrecovered from a vacant building and led to their apprehension.\n\n          Initiation   of   Proceedings.   An   information   charged\n\nPatrick with juvenile delinquency, alleging that he aided, abetted,\n\nand committed arson of a building used in interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(i) and 2.       Under the\n\nFederal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 5031-5042, authority\n\nto prosecute requires certification that a precondition to federal\n\njurisdiction exists, in this case the commission of a crime of\n\nviolence and a substantial federal interest.      18 U.S.C. § 5032.\n\nThe certificate in this case identified the basis of the federal\n\ninterest as the crime of arson, damage to structures used in\n\ninterstate commerce (boats owned by citizens of several states) and\n\nsome federally owned property belonging to the Secret Service.     At\n\narraignment on July 3, 2003, appellant admitted the truth of the\n\nversion of events presented by the government and, after careful\n\ninquiry by the court as to his understanding of his rights, signed\n\na plea agreement.\n\n          Pre-Offense Conduct.    Prior to the disposition hearing,\n\nadditional information was given to the court in a Predisposition\n\nReport (bearing the caption \"Presentence Investigation Report\").\n\nIt included a summary of pre-offense conduct, which consisted of\n\nfive burglary and theft charges pending in state juvenile court.\n\nBetween June 5 and July 4, 2002, Patrick and Conley allegedly broke\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\finto two homes, stealing computers and other such equipment valued\n\nat   over    $2,000,        and   into    three      places     of    business,       stealing\n\ncomputers, equipment, and cash.\n\n              Medical Records. A second type of information before the\n\ncourt was in the form of medical and treatment records.                                       A\n\npsychological         evaluation         by    Dr.    Greg     Carbone,       requested      by\n\nappellant, reported that Patrick had from average to superior\n\nintelligence, but also was afflicted with \"marked personality and\n\ndevelopmental         immaturity,\"            post-traumatic         stress,      depressive\n\ndisorder, and impulse control disorder. Dr. Carbone recommended an\n\n18 to 36 month course of treatment.\n\n              A post-apprehension stay at a treatment center in Utah\n\nresulted in a diagnosis of mood disorder, parent-child relational\n\nproblems related to his parents' acrimonious divorce, polysubstance\n\nabuse,      and    narcissistic      traits.           After       five    months,     he    was\n\ninvoluntarily         discharged         for       failure    to     comply    with     rules,\n\ninterference with the facility's computers, sexual misconduct, and\n\nassisting         another    resident         in    obtaining      drugs    for   a    suicide\n\nattempt. His primary therapist noted a \"superficially pleasant and\n\ncharismatic\" personality but also concluded that he was \"sneaky,\n\ndishonest, and without remorse.\"\n\n              Finally, Patrick was sent to a facility in Texas where he\n\nspent three weeks in a restricted setting. The staff reported that\n\nhe   met    its     expectations,         \"performed         very    well,\"    and     had    no\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\finstances of inappropriate behavior. A clinical therapist reported\n\nthat his \"prognosis [was] fair given his prior treatment failure.\"\n\nThe therapist recommended that Patrick be \"in a secured residential\n\nfacility for at least six to nine months\" and then be admitted \"to\n\na less restrictive program.\"\n\n           Appellant's Financial Status.      The Predisposition Report\n\nstated   that   appellant   had   completed   11th   grade   and   had   no\n\nemployment history or income source.1          But it recommended \"a\n\nsignificant order of restitution\" and also noted that if the court\n\nchose to invoke 18 U.S.C. § 3556, full restitution was made\n\nmandatory by the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3663A, since a \"crime of violence\" had been committed.\n\n           The Disposition Hearing Order.       On August 4, 2003, the\n\ncourt held the disposition hearing.      Two victims of the fire made\n\nstatements.     The owner of SMMS described his psychological and\n\neconomic losses, concluding with the probable loss of the business\n\nhe had built over the years.       An employee told how his life and\n\nthat of his wife had been dramatically altered for the worse with\n\nthe loss of his job at SMMS.      Appellant was present and expressed\n\nhis deep sorrow and regret to both victims. Appellant's mother and\n\nfather also spoke, acknowledging the role their bitter divorce had\n\nplayed and stressing their son's need for professional treatment.\n\n\n     1\n      Although the predisposition report states that Patrick\ncompleted the 11th grade, appellant's brief indicates that Patrick\ncompleted the 9th grade, which is more likely.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f               Government counsel urged the maximum term of detention\n\nthat the law permitted for a juvenile in appellant's shoes, 57\n\nmonths.        Appellant's counsel, predicting that appellant would be\n\nsent either to California or to a southern state where he would be\n\nexposed to hardened criminals, urged that Patrick be given three\n\nyears     of     probation,    and   required   to   attend     a   therapeutic\n\neducational program.\n\n               The court, at the end of the hearing, deliberated and\n\nstated its views.            It noted that appellant's 19-year-old co-\n\narsonist Conley had been sentenced to a federal penitentiary for\n\napproximately five years.            It stated that it took account of\n\nPatrick's        age   and    difficulties    encountered,     including    the\n\ncontributory role of his parents, and expressed the hope that\n\nappellant \"will move on and reclaim your life.\" It also recognized\n\nthat apologies to the two victims showed that appellant was \"at\n\nleast on the road to assuming responsibility.\"                But it concluded\n\nthat \"accepting responsibility for what you did requires some\n\ndetention in addition to probation.\"\n\n               The district court ordered appellant detained for 30\n\nmonths, with subsequent supervised release for 27 months.                    It\n\nfurther imposed, as it felt required to do by law, an obligation to\n\npay full restitution, jointly with his co-arsonist.\n\n               Subsequent proceedings.       On October 10, 2003, the court\n\namended the judgment to correct a \"clerical mistake.\"                Instead of\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fordering payment of restitution \"[i]n full immediately,\" it stated\n\nsimply    that    restitution      would   begin     following    release     from\n\ndetention, according to a schedule devised by the supervising\n\nofficer, \"subject always to review\" by the court.                 And instead of\n\nrequiring     interest      on    the   restitution    amount,     interest    was\n\nspecifically waived because of Patrick's inability to pay.\n\n            On   October     13,    appellant   moved   for   a    statement    of\n\nconclusions      of   law    as    to   restitution,    arguing     against    its\n\nimposition.      The court wrote an endorsement on the motion, denying\n\nit and saying, \"[r]estitution is appropriate in this case and would\n\nbe ordered even if it were discretionary.\"\n\n                                  II.   Discussion\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n            Both parties have given us their first preferences for a\n\nstandard of review.         Appellant has made a brief plea for de novo\n\nreview.    The government boldly suggests that review should not be\n\navailable at all.      We reject both invitations in favor of abuse of\n\ndiscretion.      We are persuaded that the task of reconciling the\n\nvarious considerations involved in the disposition of a juvenile\n\nadjudged delinquent following commission of a very serious and\n\ndangerous crime of violence is one that demands a wide range of\n\ndiscretion by the sentencing court. See United States v. Juvenile,\n\n347 F.3d 778, 784 (9th Cir. 2003)(holding that standard of review\n\nfor a juvenile delinquency sentence is abuse of discretion).\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fB.   Restitution\n\n            The government contends that because appellant ostensibly\n\nagreed to restitution in the disposition below, any claim on appeal\n\nas to the inappropriateness of restitution was forfeited.                           The\n\ngovernment points to appellant's counsel's focus on the calculation\n\nof restitution and his argument that it should be based on fair\n\nmarket value      rather      than    replacement      costs.       When    the    court\n\ninquired whether there were objections other than to the amount of\n\nrestitution,      it    received       an     admittedly       vague      answer    from\n\nappellant's counsel: \"In my objections to the presentence report it\n\nwas more in the nature of asking for additions; there is a lot more\n\nthan is reflected.\"\n\n            The    government,         however,       overlooks     the     fact    that\n\nappellant     specifically           objected     to     the      portion     of    the\n\npredisposition report concerning mandatory restitution.                       Morever,\n\nwhen the August 6, 2003, judgment issued without any such specific\n\nruling on his objection, appellant immediately filed a post-\n\njudgment    motion     for    Conclusions       of    Law    with   Respect    to    the\n\nImposition of Restitution.              The court succinctly addressed the\n\nissue   and    denied        the     motion    with     an    endorsement      reading\n\n\"Restitution is appropriate in this case and would be ordered even\n\nif it were discretionary.\"             While appellant's lack of emphasis on\n\nthe issue at the disposition hearing does give pause, it apparently\n\nstemmed from a misunderstanding that the court had already decided\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fthat restitution was mandatory. The additional fact that the court\n\nwas presented with the issue in the post-judgment motion and ruled\n\non the merits convinces us that this is a case where we, too,\n\nshould address the argument.2     Cf. Nat'l Assoc. of Soc. Workers v.\n\nHarwood, 69 F.3d 622, 28 (1st Cir. 1995)(deciding that appellate\n\ncourt could hear an issue not raised below in part because omission\n\nwas inadvertent, not deliberate).        We also see no prejudice to the\n\ngovernment.    See id. at 627.\n\n          We   therefore   turn   to   the   substance   of   appellant's\n\nargument. First, appellant asserts that restitution under the FJDA\n\nis discretionary, even if the underlying offense is a crime of\n\nviolence. Second, appellant argues that the district court abused\n\nits discretion by ordering restitution in this case because it\n\nfailed to properly consider Patrick's financial resources as well\n\nas the detrimental effect such a large debt will have on Patrick's\n\nprospects for rehabilitation.       We first consider the statutory\n\nscheme, and then address its application to Patrick.\n\n          In 1995, in considering what was to become the Mandatory\n\nVictim Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, the Senate Committee on\n\nthe Judiciary, deeply concerned over the impact of violent crime\n\n\n     2\n      Furthermore, because this legal question is likely to arise\nin other cases - all the more likely because of the paucity of case\nlaw regarding federal juvenile dispositions in general and\nrestitution in particular - declining to hear the issue will\nneither promote judicial economy nor aid in the administration of\nthe juvenile justice system. See United States v. Krynicki, 689\nF.2d 289, 292 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n                                  -11-\n\fupon victims, took testimony from the federal judiciary concerning\n\nthe impact of the proposed legislation on the criminal justice\n\nsystem.   Despite testimony from the Criminal Law Committee of the\n\nJudicial Conference that mandatory victim restitution would not\n\nlead to \"any appreciable increase in compensation to victims of\n\ncrime,\"   the      Committee       was   of   the    view   that    even    \"nominal\n\nrestitution       payments\"    serve      \"the     potential     penalogical    [sic]\n\nbenefits of requiring the offender to be accountable . . . .\"                       S.\n\nRep. 104-179, at 18 (1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 924,931.\n\n             The legal atmosphere of the federal act relating to\n\njuveniles    is    marked     by    a    duality    of   objectives    --   that    of\n\nrehabilitation and that of protecting society.                    See infra at 16.\n\nThis is specifically true of the impact of the Mandatory Victim\n\nRestitution Act on juveniles who have committed serious crimes\n\ninflicting losses on victims. But, despite the nominal requirement\n\nof full restitution, the reach of the Act in the case of juveniles\n\nis modest.\n\n            It is first of all necessary to identify the series of\n\nsteps that lead to a juvenile restitution order.                  Misunderstanding\n\nof the discretionary nature of restitution, even when a crime of\n\nviolence has been committed, is revealed by the brief holding in\n\nUnited States v. Juvenile G.Z., 144 F.3d 1148, 1149 (8th Cir.\n\n1998), that when a juvenile pleads guilty to a crime of violence,\n\n\"in   these       circumstances,          restitution       is     mandatory,      not\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fdiscretionary.\"   In fact, however, there are two stages.        There is\n\na threshold choice, followed by a mandatory course.\n\n          This is the sequence of steps.           Under the relevant\n\njuvenile proceeding section, 18 U.S.C. § 5037, the district court\n\n\"may\" order restitution under 18 U.S.C. § 3556.3        Once the court\n\nchooses this route, § 3556 leaves no further choice, stating that\n\nthe court \"shall order restitution in accordance with section\n\n3663A.\"   Under § 3663A, a court must order a defendant to make\n\nrestitution to the victim, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provisions\n\nof law,\" if the offense falls within the definition of a \"crime of\n\nviolence\" under 18 U.S.C. § 16. See 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(1)(A)(i).\n\nSection 16 describes such a crime as involving the \"use of physical\n\nforce against the . . . property of another\" or \"any other. . .\n\nfelony . . . that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that\n\nphysical force against the . . . property of another may be used.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 16(1), (2).        Arson is such a crime.     And, under §\n\n3664(b)(1)(A), restitution must be ordered in the full amount\n\nwithout   consideration   of    the   economic   circumstances   of   the\n\ndefendant.\n\n           This, then, is the applicable law. But its impact on the\n\nappellant is not as draconian as it might appear without taking\n\n\n     3\n      Because the 2002 Amendments to the FJDA did not go into\neffect until November 2, 2002, they do not apply in this case. We\nnote, however, that this does not change our analysis of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 5037. Both the current and previous language of § 5037 state\nthat the court \"may\" order restitution.\n\n                                  -13-\n\fcareful note of the court's order in this case.   We have noted its\n\ndeletion, in an amended judgment, of any requirement of immediate\n\npayment in full and the waiver of both fine and interest.      The\n\ndetermination of amounts payable, the times of payment, and the\n\nduration of the payment period are described as follows:\n\n          Any amount that the defendant is unable to pay\n          now shall be paid in monthly installments, to\n          be initially determined in amount by the\n          supervising officer. Said payments are to be\n          made during the period of his/her supervised\n          release/probation subject always to review by\n          the sentencing judge on request, by either the\n          defendant or the government.\n\n          The critical time for evaluating appellant's ability to\n\npay is, then, when the supervising officer prepares a schedule at\n\nthe beginning of the period of supervised release.      See United\n\nStates v. Stoecker, 215 F.3d 788, 792 (7th Cir. 2000).         The\n\nschedule could allow nominal payments if economic circumstances\n\njustified them, § 3664(b)(3)(B), but more substantial or even full\n\npayment could be required if, for example, appellant were to\n\nreceive an inheritance.\n\n          With respect to the burdensome nature of such a large\n\namount of restitution, appellant's premises are inflated.   In his\n\nmain brief he presents his predicament as that of one who \"will\n\nenter adulthood with a debt unpayable,\" which for his whole life\n\nwill \"doom all hope of rehabilitation.\"    In his reply brief he\n\nexpands on the theme to assume that even a yearly payment of\n\n$14,000, over half the median income of a person in appellant's\n\n                              -14-\n\fshoes, would never pay off the debt -- something he would \"carry to\n\n[his] grave.\"\n\n             Were this predicament a reality, a court might well say\n\nthat such a burden ruled out any vestige of rehabilitation.                 But\n\nthis is far from the reality faced by the appellant.                     As the\n\ngovernment acknowledged at oral argument, and as indicated by the\n\nrestitution order, the duration of appellant's payment period is\n\nthe 27 months of supervised release following detention.\n\n             Given the arguably minimal impact of the order (stemming\n\nfrom   its   limited   duration)    in     combination   with   the   required\n\nevaluation of appellant's financial circumstances at the beginning\n\nof supervised release, we do not find that the imposition of\n\ndiscretionary restitution \"doom[s] all hope\" of rehabilitation. We\n\ntherefore find no abuse of discretion.\n\nC.   Detention\n\n             The thrust of appellant's argument is that the purpose of\n\nthe FJDA is rehabilitation and that this purpose trumps all others.\n\nWhen confronted by the government's \"alarmist\" argument that under\n\nappellant's    view    a   court   could    never   impose   detention    on   a\n\njuvenile, appellant responds that detention must be reserved for\n\nonly those for whom \"rehabilitation is not an option.\"            But in such\n\na case the court would transfer the juvenile case for trial as an\n\nadult.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3502.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f            The absolutist view, while remaining the goal of choice\n\nfor many, does not reflect the extent to which rehabilitation, with\n\nthe growth of youth violence, has increasingly shared the stage\n\nwith goals of the criminal process.              Stacey Sabo, Note, \"Rights of\n\nPassage: An Analysis of Waiver of Juvenile Court Jurisdiction,\" 64\n\nFordham   L.    Rev.   2425,      2434-435      (1996);    Barry    C.    Feld,   \"The\n\nTransformation of the Juvenile Court,\" 75 Minn. L. Rev. 691, 692\n\n(1991).     In United States v. R.L.C, 503 U.S. 291, (1992), Justice\n\nSouter, writing for the Court in a case involving both the FJDA and\n\nthe Sentencing Reform Act, stated, \"We do not think a broader\n\ncongressional purpose points clearly in either party's direction.\"\n\nHe would go no farther than to say that rehabilitation was not\n\nrejected.       Id.    at   298    n.2    (\"While     it    is     true   that    some\n\nrehabilitative tools were removed from the juvenile penalty scheme\n\nin 1984, the Juvenile Delinquency Act does not completely reject\n\nrehabilitative objectives.\")(internal citations omitted).\n\n            Absent, therefore, an absolute bar to detention, we are\n\nleft to determine if the record permitted the district court's\n\ndecision.      Appellant makes an impassioned argument that the only\n\nevidence before the court was that the offense took place during\n\nthe brief period when he was under the sway of an adult, that he\n\ntook responsibility for his actions, had no prior convictions, was\n\nmarkedly immature, was \"already in the process of rehabilitation in\n\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fa secured, locked facility,\" and that there was no evidence that\n\nfederal detention could provide any rehabilitation program.\n\n               This is a view of the evidence highly favorable to\n\nappellant.       But the evidence before the court permitted another\n\nview.    Taking responsibility for one's actions is a multi-layered\n\nconcept, beginning with words and extending to conduct.                       The Utah\n\ntherapist, after a five-month course of treatment, concluded that\n\nappellant      was    \"without       remorse.\"    Although      it    was    true   that\n\nappellant had no prior convictions, he had five recent burglaries\n\npending in the state court.             And while appellant may well have been\n\nunder    the    sway      of   his    adult   companion,      there   was    the    real\n\npossibility that his diagnosed craving for approval might lead him\n\nalong similar paths in the future.                     Finally, the problematic\n\nreports covering the substantial period of time that preceded his\n\nbrief stay at the Texas facility might have weighed more heavily\n\nwith the court than the Texas reports of good behavior and only a\n\n\"fair\" prognosis.\n\n               It remains for us to note the consideration given by the\n\ndistrict court to the relationship between rehabilitation and\n\ndetention.        Appellant argues that the district court gave no\n\nevident consideration to appellant's rehabilitation possibilities,\n\nin contravention of the objectives of the FJDA.                  At the conclusion\n\nof the disposition hearing, the court addressed appellant, giving\n\ncredit    for        at   least      starting    \"on    the    road     to    assuming\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fresponsibility,\"        and    acknowledging       the   difficulties        he    had\n\nencountered, the fact that he was making progress, and the case his\n\nattorney had made for probation.              In the end, however, the court\n\nfelt    that   real     acceptance     of     responsibility      entailed         some\n\ndetention, and ordered a term of 30 months, approximately one half\n\nthe time urged by the government.                 This period, we note, fell\n\nwithin the 18- to 36-month period of treatment recommended by Dr.\n\nCarbone.\n\n           We cannot conclude on this record that there was a\n\nfailure to consider any important factor, an erratic weighing, or\n\nan impermissible view of the law.                 At oral argument, appellant\n\ncited   United    States      v.   Juvenile,   347   F.3d   at    778,      as    being\n\nimpressive precedent for his case.                Like many federal juvenile\n\ncases, that case involved a Native American in a tribal setting.\n\nA 14-year old juvenile had been beset for over half his life by\n\nsexual abuse on a grand scale and finally was himself prosecuted\n\nfor sexual abuse. He signed a plea agreement, and, notwithstanding\n\na government recommendation that he be in custody only until his\n\neighteenth birthday, was sentenced by the court to custody until he\n\nreached twenty-one - a detention of almost seven years.                  The Court\n\nof Appeals reversed and remanded for resentencing.\n\n           This    is    a    good   case   for    appellant     in   its    valiant\n\nassertion that rehabilitation is still alive.                  But the facts are\n\ndistinguishable in a significant respect. As a preliminary matter,\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fwe observe that Juvenile is not authority against all detention for\n\njuveniles found to be delinquent.          More importantly, in Juvenile,\n\nthe court, rejecting the government's more moderate recommendation,\n\nordered a maximum detention to age 21, a detention of a 14-year old\n\nof almost seven years.     By contrast, appellant's two-and-one-half\n\nyear detention will end before his eighteenth birthday.\n\n             In sum, in light of the evidence before the court on\n\nappellant's progress, we cannot say that the court abused its\n\ndiscretion     on the present record in concluding that a 30-month\n\nterm of detention is consistent with the rehabilitative objection\n\nof the FJDA.     We leave it to the district court to consider its\n\njudgment in light of information to be obtained concerning the\n\nlocation and nature of the detention facility to which Patrick was\n\nassigned.\n\n             The Proper Facility.     A juvenile who is detained under\n\nthe FJDA is committed by the district court to the custody of the\n\nAttorney General for placement in an appropriate facility.            See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 5039.    Pursuant to the statute, the facility must provide\n\nthe juvenile not only the necessities of life, but \"counseling,\n\neducation,     training,   and   medical      care     including   necessary\n\npsychiatric, psychological, or other care and treatment.\"               Id.\n\nAdditionally, \"[w]henever possible, the Attorney General shall\n\ncommit a juvenile to a foster home or community-based facility\n\nlocated in or near his home community.\"          Id.\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f            At the disposition hearing, appellant's counsel raised\n\nthe issue of appropriateness of the facility of detention.          He\n\nspeculated that Patrick might be sent to California or another\n\ndistant place where he would be exposed to hardened criminals.\n\nCounsel noted that, \"the reality is that the Bureau of Prisons does\n\nnot have a juvenile facility that will address Patrick's needs.\"\n\nThis was in the context of appellant's effort to stress the goal of\n\nrehabilitation, and his requested disposition of probation coupled\n\nwith the continued treatment he was receiving in the Texas program.\n\n            Appellant's ability to focus on the details of the\n\ndetention was limited, however, because it was undetermined where\n\nhe would serve his detention. At the conclusion of the proceeding,\n\nPatrick's attorney (in response to a question about self-reporting)\n\nanswered, \"I'm at a loss because I'm not sure where he will be\n\ndesignated.    Supposedly it will be in his own state or community\n\nprogram.\"\n\n            The record before the district court is bereft of any\n\ninformation    concerning   the   facility   chosen   for   appellant's\n\ndetention - its location, policies, and programs available to\n\njuveniles in appellant's situation.          On appeal, we have been\n\nprovided only with the brief statements of counsel.           Appellant\n\nstates in his reply brief that the regional office of the Bureau of\n\nPrisons, having neither a facility in the northeast serving only\n\njuveniles nor any contract with the State of Maine, has placed\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fappellant in a state facility in Pennsylvania.          At oral argument,\n\nthe   government's    attorney     confirmed   that    Patrick   is    in     a\n\nPennsylvania facility and added, \"that's the nearest juvenile\n\nfacility to Maine.\"\n\n          As for the nature of the detention facility, appellant\n\nasserts only that a juvenile's communications with family are\n\nseverely limited and that there is little or no evidence in the\n\nrecord that appropriate rehabilitative treatment is available.               At\n\noral argument, the government's attorney responded to a question\n\nconcerning    the   availability    of   psychiatric   treatment      at    the\n\nPennsylvania facility by stating simply that he could not \"imagine\n\nthat the Bureau of Prisons would be staffing a juvenile facility\n\nwithout some professionals at that level.\"\n\n             We are uncomfortable with this state of the record,\n\nparticularly in a case of first impression in this circuit in which\n\nfederal jurisdiction is asserted under the FJDA.           Our task is to\n\ntry to strike a balance between the responsibilities of a court\n\narriving at the disposition of a juvenile matter and the exclusive\n\nauthority of the Attorney General to determine the facility of\n\ndetention in any case.4\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      A court's power to pass upon the adequacy of the care\nactually given by a facility would generally have to await a\nproceeding challenging custody in light of specific conditions of\ndetention alleged by the juvenile to be deficient.\n\n                                    -21-\n\f            Our focus, therefore, is solely on assuring an informed\n\nsentencing decision by the court. Sentencing in a juvenile matter\n\nis in some important respects different from the more restrictive\n\nsituation in adult sentencing.         Section 1B1.12 of the sentencing\n\nguidelines states explicitly that \"[the] guidelines do not apply to\n\na defendant sentenced under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act.\"\n\nA district judge has wide discretion in determining whether any or\n\nhow much detention (not to exceed a maximum applicable to a\n\n\"similarly situated adult defendant\") should be imposed on a\n\njuvenile.     A rational exercise of that decision requires at the\n\nminimum a realistic understanding of the location and nature of\n\nprobable detention facilities available to the government.\n\n            Accordingly, the district court should assemble from the\n\nparties information as to the likely facility and programs to which\n\nthe juvenile would be sent if detention is imposed.        This would not\n\nmean that the Attorney General's hands would be tied then or in the\n\nfuture, but it would help ensure that the court has adequate\n\ninformation to fulfill Congress's mandate that the FJDA preserve a\n\nbalance     between   rehabilitation    and   protection   goals.   Such\n\ninformation might reveal a likely choice of facility allowing ease\n\nof family access and adequate treatment for diagnosed disorders.\n\nThis would seem more in keeping with the rehabilitative goal than\n\none with little likelihood of family access and treatment. In such\n\nevent, a clearly imperfect fit might be mitigated by a shorter\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fcommitment to detention.           Cf. Juvenile, 347 F.3d at 789, 792\n\n(remanding to the district court for further findings of fact\n\nregarding placement of juvenile in a detention facility far from\n\nfamily).\n\n           Without      some     sort   of     pre-confinement        review   of   a\n\nfacility's      ability    to    provide      appropriate      rehabilitation,      a\n\njuvenile - whose term of detention is likely to be limited by the\n\nimminence of adulthood - may be deprived of much of the protection\n\nafforded him by the FJDA; after-the-fact review of a facility's\n\nresources could result in the juvenile spending a substantial\n\nportion    of     his     detention      in     an   inappropriate         setting.\n\n             We therefore remand this case to the district court to\n\ncomplete   the    record    as    to    the    location   of    the    facility     of\n\ndetention, its policies, programs, and resources.5 The court shall\n\nhave broad discretion as to the nature of the proceeding.                           An\n\nevidentiary hearing may be held, but the court may choose to obtain\n\nthe needed information in some other fashion and may request such\n\nadditional briefing as it deems necessary.                     The focus of any\n\nproceeding is not the current care and custody of the appellant,\n\nbut on the appropriateness of the detention facility as of the time\n\n\n     5\n      In this instance, the district court will focus on the actual\nfacility where Patrick is placed. In other juvenile dispositions,\nhowever, we recognize that the precise placement is not necessarily\nascertainable in advance, and thus the court's inquiry may focus on\nthe realm of probable facilities. This is further in keeping with\nour recognition that placement is ultimately the responsibility of\nthe Attorney General.\n\n                                        -23-\n\fof the court's disposition hearing.     Upon receipt of further\n\ninformation, the district court may choose to affirm or modify the\n\noriginal disposition. We shall retain jurisdiction pending receipt\n\nof a report from the court.\n\n\n\n\n                              -24-\n\f",

(Patrick), from a judgment of delinquency in a proceeding under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (FJDA), 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5031-5042, for commission of arson causing extensive property damage in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(i) and 2. The district court ordered Patrick detained for a period of 30 months, followed by supervised release for 27 months, plus joint liability with another individual for restitution in the amount of $728,141.61. Patrick claims that the rehabilitative purpose of the FJDA requires treatment rather than detention, and weighs against the imposition of restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenge to both the detention and the restitution aspects of the judgment reflect the uneasy tension between the rehabilitation focus of the FJDA and the sterner approach of the more recent Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A. Federal intervention in juvenile proceedings is relatively rare, at least in this circuit, and we find ourselves in a field as yet unploughed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering detention and restitution on the record before it. We do, however, feel that the record is insufficient to permit the court, in arriving at its own final disposition, to factor in information as to the location and rehabilitative capabilities of the detention facility chosen by the government pursuant to the requirements of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5039. We believe such consideration should be part of the juvenile sentencing process and therefore retain jurisdiction and remand to the district court for this limited purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Misconduct.</i> Prior to the summer of 2002, Patrick had no history of delinquent activity or substance abuse. His emotional well-being, however, was affected by earlier traumatic events that rendered him potentially more susceptible to the influence of a 19-year old \"adult\" friend, Christopher Conley. At the disposition proceedings, both of Patrick's parents testified that their divorce in 1992, when Patrick was five, was acrimonious, and that Patrick's relationship with his parents likely suffered as a result. A second traumatic interlude occurred when Patrick, when ten years of age, was sexually abused by a camp counselor. After Patrick's mother confronted the counselor, the counselor committed suicide. Patrick was apparently in therapy as a result of this latter experience, but only intermittently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The friendship between Patrick and Conley spurred the abrupt change in Patrick's behavior. Conley, recently released from a drug rehabilitation program in Pennsylvania, introduced Patrick to drugs and alcohol. Although Patrick had previously been an honor-roll student, his grades began to slip during the spring of 2002, his ninth grade year. Prior to the arson, Conley and Patrick committed a series of burglaries. The first burglary was a vindictive payback; the rest allegedly were thrill-seeking escapades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the night of the arson, July 7, 2002, Conley and Patrick illicitly entered one of the buildings of Southern Maine Marine Services (SMMS), intending to steal a marine radio to enable them to monitor police communications. Once inside, they noticed surveillance cameras (which, unbeknownst to either, were inoperable). Conley and Patrick attempted to locate the surveillance videotape, but when this proved unsuccessful they decided to burn down the building and destroy any evidence of their crime. Searching the SMMS premises, they found explosive items such as flares and electronic equipment; they spread gasoline around the area and near an oil tank, and placed propane tanks near a metal frame repair building and at the corner of a wooden office building. After setting fire to the gasoline by lighting a marine flare, the two fled the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fire, which took over six hours to control, completely destroyed the building used for repairs and damaged the office building. The property damage was extensive, including the loss of two boats, three boat trailers, boat motors, tools, technical manuals and other marine equipment. The losses, amounting to over $725,000, were suffered by 26 individuals and insurance companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A month later, a box traced to appellant and Conley was recovered from a vacant building and led to their apprehension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Initiation of Proceedings.</i> An information charged Patrick with juvenile delinquency, alleging that he aided, abetted, and committed arson of a building used in interstate or foreign commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(i) and 2. Under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5031-5042, authority to prosecute requires certification that a precondition to federal jurisdiction exists, in this case the commission of a crime of violence and a substantial federal interest. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5032. The certificate in this case identified the basis of the federal interest as the crime of arson, damage to structures used in interstate commerce (boats owned by citizens of several states) and some federally owned property belonging to the Secret Service. At arraignment on July 3, 2003, appellant admitted the truth of the version of events presented by the government and, after careful inquiry by the court as to his understanding of his rights, signed a plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Pre-Offense Conduct.</i> Prior to the disposition hearing, additional information was given to the court in a Predisposition Report (bearing the caption \"Presentence Investigation Report\"). It included a summary of pre-offense conduct, which consisted of five burglary and theft charges pending in state juvenile court. Between June 5 and July 4, 2002, Patrick and Conley allegedly broke into two homes, stealing computers and other such equipment valued at over $2,000, and into three places of business, stealing computers, equipment, and cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Medical Records.</i> A second type of information before the court was in the form of medical and treatment records. A psychological evaluation by Dr. Greg Carbone, requested by appellant, reported that Patrick had from average to superior intelligence, but also was afflicted with \"marked personality and developmental immaturity,\" post-traumatic stress, depressive disorder, and impulse control disorder. Dr. Carbone recommended an 18 to 36 month course of treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A post-apprehension stay at a treatment center in Utah resulted in a diagnosis of mood disorder, parent-child relational problems related to his parents' acrimonious divorce, polysubstance abuse, and narcissistic traits. After five months, he was involuntarily discharged for failure to comply with rules, interference with the facility's computers, sexual misconduct, and assisting another resident in obtaining drugs for a suicide attempt. His primary therapist noted a \"superficially pleasant and charismatic\" personality but also concluded that he was \"sneaky, dishonest, and without remorse.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Patrick was sent to a facility in Texas where he spent three weeks in a restricted setting. The staff reported that he met its expectations, \"performed very well,\" and had no instances of inappropriate behavior. A clinical therapist reported that his \"prognosis [was] fair given his prior treatment failure.\" The therapist recommended that Patrick be \"in a secured residential facility for at least six to nine months\" and then be admitted \"to a less restrictive program.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Appellant's Financial Status.</i> The Predisposition Report stated that appellant had completed 11th grade and had no employment history or income source.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> But it recommended \"a significant order of restitution\" and also noted that if the court chose to invoke 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3556, full restitution was made mandatory by the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A, since a \"crime of violence\" had been committed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Disposition Hearing Order.</i> On August 4, 2003, the court held the disposition hearing. Two victims of the fire made statements. The owner of SMMS described his psychological and economic losses, concluding with the probable loss of the business he had built over the years. An employee told how his life and that of his wife had been dramatically altered for the worse with the loss of his job at SMMS. Appellant was present and expressed his deep sorrow and regret to both victims. Appellant's mother and father also spoke, acknowledging the role their bitter divorce had played and stressing their son's need for professional treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Government counsel urged the maximum term of detention that the law permitted for a juvenile in appellant's shoes, 57 months. Appellant's counsel, predicting that appellant would be sent either to California or to a southern state where he would be exposed to hardened criminals, urged that Patrick be given three years of probation, and required to attend a therapeutic educational program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, at the end of the hearing, deliberated and stated its views. It noted that appellant's 19-year-old co-arsonist Conley had been sentenced to a federal penitentiary for approximately five years. It stated that it took account of Patrick's age and difficulties encountered, including the contributory role of his parents, and expressed the hope that appellant \"will move on and reclaim your life.\" It also recognized that apologies to the two victims showed that appellant was \"at least on the road to assuming responsibility.\" But it concluded that \"accepting responsibility for what you did requires some detention in addition to probation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ordered appellant detained for 30 months, with subsequent supervised release for 27 months. It further imposed, as it felt required to do by law, an obligation to pay full restitution, jointly with his co-arsonist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Subsequent proceedings.</i> On October 10, 2003, the court amended the judgment to correct a \"clerical mistake.\" Instead of ordering payment of restitution \"[i]n full immediately,\" it stated simply that restitution would begin following release from detention, according to a schedule devised by the supervising officer, \"subject always to review\" by the court. And instead of requiring interest on the restitution amount, interest was specifically waived because of Patrick's inability to pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 13, appellant moved for a statement of conclusions of law as to restitution, arguing against its imposition. The court wrote an endorsement on the motion, denying it and saying, \"[r]estitution is appropriate in this case and would be ordered even if it were discretionary.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties have given us their first preferences for a standard of review. Appellant has made a brief plea for <i>de novo</i> review. The government boldly suggests that review should not be available at all. We reject both invitations in favor of abuse of discretion. We are persuaded that the task of reconciling the various considerations involved in the disposition of a juvenile adjudged delinquent following commission of a very serious and dangerous crime of violence is one that demands a wide range of discretion by the sentencing court. <i>See United States v. Juvenile,</i> 347 F.3d 778, 784 (9th Cir.2003)(holding that standard of review for a juvenile delinquency sentence is abuse of discretion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Restitution</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that because appellant ostensibly agreed to restitution in the disposition below, any claim on appeal as to the inappropriateness of restitution was forfeited. The government points to appellant's counsel's focus on the calculation of restitution and his argument that it should be based on fair market value rather than replacement costs. When the court inquired whether there were objections other than to the amount of restitution, it received an admittedly vague answer from appellant's counsel: \"In my objections to the presentence report it was more in the nature of asking for additions; there is a lot more than is reflected.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, however, overlooks the fact that appellant specifically objected to the portion of the predisposition report concerning mandatory restitution. Moreover, when the August 6, 2003, judgment issued without any such specific ruling on his objection, appellant immediately filed a post-judgment motion for Conclusions of Law with Respect to the Imposition of Restitution. The court succinctly addressed the issue and denied the motion with an endorsement reading \"Restitution is appropriate in this case and would be ordered even if it were discretionary.\" While appellant's lack of emphasis on the issue at the disposition hearing does give pause, it apparently stemmed from a misunderstanding that the court had already decided that restitution was mandatory. The additional fact that the court was presented with the issue in the post-judgment motion and ruled on the merits convinces us that this is a case where we, too, should address the argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Cf. Nat'l Assoc. of Soc. Workers v. Harwood,</i> 69 F.3d 622, 628 (1st Cir.1995)(deciding that appellate court could hear an issue not raised below in part because omission was inadvertent, not deliberate). We also see no prejudice to the government. <i>See id.</i> at 627.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore turn to the substance of appellant's argument. First, appellant asserts that restitution under the FJDA is discretionary, even if the underlying offense is a crime of violence. Second, appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by ordering restitution in this case because it failed to properly consider Patrick's financial resources as well as the detrimental effect such a large debt will have on Patrick's prospects for rehabilitation. We first consider the statutory scheme, and then address its application to Patrick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, in considering what was to become the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, deeply concerned over the impact of violent crime upon victims, took testimony from the federal judiciary concerning the impact of the proposed legislation on the criminal justice system. Despite testimony from the Criminal Law Committee of the Judicial Conference that mandatory victim restitution would not lead to \"any appreciable increase in compensation to victims of crime,\" the Committee was of the view that even \"nominal restitution payments\" serve \"the potential penalogical [sic] benefits of requiring the offender to be accountable....\" S. Rep. 104-179, at 18 (1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 924, 931.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal atmosphere of the federal act relating to juveniles is marked by a duality of objectives &#8212; that of rehabilitation and that of protecting society. <i>See infra</i> at 10-11. This is specifically true of the impact of the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act on juveniles who have committed serious crimes inflicting losses on victims. But, despite the nominal requirement of full restitution, the reach of the Act in the case of juveniles is modest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is first of all necessary to identify the series of steps that lead to a juvenile restitution order. Misunderstanding of the discretionary nature of restitution, even when a crime of violence has been committed, is revealed by the brief holding in <i>United States v. Juvenile G.Z.,</i> 144 F.3d 1148, 1149 (8th Cir.1998), that when a juvenile pleads guilty to a crime of violence, \"in these circumstances, restitution is mandatory, not discretionary.\" In fact, however, there are two stages. There is a threshold choice, followed by a mandatory course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the sequence of steps. Under the relevant juvenile proceeding section, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5037, the district court \"may\" order restitution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3556.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Once the court chooses this route, &#167; 3556 leaves no further choice, stating that the court \"shall order restitution in accordance with section 3663A.\" Under &#167; 3663A, a court must order a defendant to make restitution to the victim, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provisions of law,\" if the offense falls within the definition of a \"crime of violence\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A(c)(1)(A)(i). Section 16 describes such a crime as involving the \"use of physical force against the ... property of another\" or \"any other ... felony ... that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the ... property of another may be used.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16(1), (2). Arson is such a crime. And, under &#167; 3664(f)(1)(A), restitution must be ordered in the full amount without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, then, is the applicable law. But its impact on the appellant is not as draconian as it might appear without taking careful note of the court's order in this case. We have noted its deletion, in an amended judgment, of any requirement of immediate payment in full and the waiver of both fine and interest. The determination of amounts payable, the times of payment, and the duration of the payment period are described as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any amount that the defendant is unable to pay now shall be paid in monthly installments, to be initially determined in amount by the supervising officer. Said payments are to be made during the period of his/her supervised release/probation subject always to review by the sentencing judge on request, by either the defendant or the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical time for evaluating appellant's ability to pay is, then, when the supervising officer prepares a schedule at the beginning of the period of supervised release. <i>See United States v. Stoecker,</i> 215 F.3d 788, 792 (7th Cir.2000). The schedule could allow nominal payments if economic circumstances justified them, &#167; 3664(f)(3)(B), but more substantial or even full payment could be required if, for example, appellant were to receive an inheritance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the burdensome nature of such a large amount of restitution, appellant's premises are inflated. In his main brief he presents his predicament as that of one who \"will enter adulthood with a debt unpayable,\" which for his whole life will \"doom all hope of rehabilitation.\" In his reply brief he expands on the theme to assume that even a yearly payment of $14,000, over half the median income of a person in appellant's shoes, would never pay off the debt &#8212; something he would \"carry to [his] grave.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were this predicament a reality, a court might well say that such a burden ruled out any vestige of rehabilitation. But this is far from the reality faced by the appellant. As the government acknowledged at oral argument, and as indicated by the restitution order, the duration of appellant's payment period is the 27 months of supervised release following detention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the arguably minimal impact of the order (stemming from its limited duration) in combination with the required evaluation of appellant's financial circumstances at the beginning of supervised release, we do not find that the imposition of discretionary restitution \"doom[s] all hope\" of rehabilitation. We therefore find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Detention</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thrust of appellant's argument is that the purpose of the FJDA is rehabilitation and that this purpose trumps all others. When confronted by the government's \"alarmist\" argument that under appellant's view a court could never impose detention on a juvenile, appellant responds that detention must be reserved for only those for whom \"rehabilitation is not an option.\" But in such a case the court would transfer the juvenile case for trial as an adult. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3502.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absolutist view, while remaining the goal of choice for many, does not reflect the extent to which rehabilitation, with the growth of youth violence, has increasingly shared the stage with goals of the criminal process. Stacey Sabo, Note, \"Rights of Passage: An Analysis of Waiver of Juvenile Court Jurisdiction,\" 64 Fordham L.Rev. 2425, 2434-435 (1996); Barry C. Feld, \"The Transformation of the Juvenile Court,\" 75 Minn. L.Rev. 691, 692 (1991). In <i>United States v. R.L.C,</i> 503 U.S. 291, 112 S.Ct. 1329, 117 L.Ed.2d 559, (1992), Justice Souter, writing for the Court in a case involving both the FJDA and the Sentencing Reform Act, stated, \"We do not think a broader congressional purpose points clearly in either party's direction.\" He would go no farther than to say that rehabilitation was not rejected. <i>Id.</i> at 298 n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 1329 (\"While it is true that some rehabilitative tools were removed from the juvenile penalty scheme in 1984, the Juvenile Delinquency Act does not completely reject rehabilitative objectives.\") (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent, therefore, an absolute bar to detention, we are left to determine if the record permitted the district court's decision. Appellant makes an impassioned argument that the only evidence before the court was that the offense took place during the brief period when he was under the sway of an adult, that he took responsibility for his actions, had no prior convictions, was markedly immature, was \"already in the process of rehabilitation in a secured, locked facility,\" and that there was no evidence that federal detention could provide any rehabilitation program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a view of the evidence highly favorable to appellant. But the evidence before the court permitted another view. Taking responsibility for one's actions is a multi-layered concept, beginning with words and extending to conduct. The Utah therapist, after a five-month course of treatment, concluded that appellant was \"without remorse.\" Although it was true that appellant had no prior convictions, he had five recent burglaries pending in the state court. And while appellant may well have been under the sway of his adult companion, there was the real possibility that his diagnosed craving for approval might lead him along similar paths in the future. Finally, the problematic reports covering the substantial period of time that preceded his brief stay at the Texas facility might have weighed more heavily with the court than the Texas reports of good behavior and only a \"fair\" prognosis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It remains for us to note the consideration given by the district court to the relationship between rehabilitation and detention. Appellant argues that the district court gave no evident consideration to appellant's rehabilitation possibilities, in contravention of the objectives of the FJDA. At the conclusion of the disposition hearing, the court addressed appellant, giving credit for at least starting \"on the road to assuming responsibility,\" and acknowledging the difficulties he had encountered, the fact that he was making progress, and the case his attorney had made for probation. In the end, however, the court felt that real acceptance of responsibility entailed some detention, and ordered a term of 30 months, approximately one half the time urged by the government. This period, we note, fell within the 18- to 36-month period of treatment recommended by Dr. Carbone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot conclude on this record that there was a failure to consider any important factor, an erratic weighing, or an impermissible view of the law. At oral argument, appellant cited <i>United States v. Juvenile,</i> 347 F.3d at 778, as being impressive precedent for his case. Like many federal juvenile cases, that case involved a Native American in a tribal setting. A 14-year old juvenile had been beset for over half his life by sexual abuse on a grand scale and finally was himself prosecuted for sexual abuse. He signed a plea agreement, and, notwithstanding a government recommendation that he be in custody only until his eighteenth birthday, was sentenced by the court to custody until he reached twenty-one &#8212; a detention of almost seven years. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a good case for appellant in its valiant assertion that rehabilitation is still alive. But the facts are distinguishable in a significant respect. As a preliminary matter, we observe that <i>Juvenile</i> is not authority against all detention for juveniles found to be delinquent. More importantly, in <i>Juvenile,</i> the court, rejecting the government's more moderate recommendation, ordered a maximum detention to age 21, a detention of a 14-year old of almost seven years. By contrast, appellant's two-and-one-half year detention will end before his eighteenth birthday.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, in light of the evidence before the court on appellant's progress, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion on the present record in concluding that a 30-month term of detention is consistent with the rehabilitative objection of the FJDA. We leave it to the district court to consider its judgment in light of information to be obtained concerning the location and nature of the detention facility to which Patrick was assigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Proper Facility.</i> A juvenile who is detained under the FJDA is committed by the district court to the custody of the Attorney General for placement in an appropriate facility. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5039. Pursuant to the statute, the facility must provide the juvenile not only the necessities of life, but \"counseling, education, training, and medical care including necessary psychiatric, psychological, or other care and treatment.\" <i>Id.</i> Additionally, \"[w]henever possible, the Attorney General shall commit a juvenile to a foster home or community-based facility located in or near his home community.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, appellant's counsel raised the issue of appropriateness of the facility of detention. He speculated that Patrick might be sent to California or another distant place where he would be exposed to hardened criminals. Counsel noted that, \"the reality is that the Bureau of Prisons does not have a juvenile facility that will address Patrick's needs.\" This was in the context of appellant's effort to stress the goal of rehabilitation, and his requested disposition of probation coupled with the continued treatment he was receiving in the Texas program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's ability to focus on the details of the detention was limited, however, because it was undetermined where he would serve his detention. At the conclusion of the proceeding, Patrick's attorney (in response to a question about self-reporting) answered, \"I'm at a loss because I'm not sure where he will be designated. Supposedly it will be in his own state or community program.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record before the district court is bereft of any information concerning the facility chosen for appellant's detention &#8212; its location, policies, and programs available to juveniles in appellant's situation. On appeal, we have been provided only with the brief statements of counsel. Appellant states in his reply brief that the regional office of the Bureau of Prisons, having neither a facility in the northeast serving only juveniles nor any contract with the State of Maine, has placed appellant in a state facility in Pennsylvania. At oral argument, the government's attorney confirmed that Patrick is in a Pennsylvania facility and added, \"that's the nearest juvenile facility to Maine.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the nature of the detention facility, appellant asserts only that a juvenile's communications with family are severely limited and that there is little or no evidence in the record that appropriate rehabilitative treatment is available. At oral argument, the government's attorney responded to a question concerning the availability of psychiatric treatment at the Pennsylvania facility by stating simply that he could not \"imagine that the Bureau of Prisons would be staffing a juvenile facility without some professionals at that level.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are uncomfortable with this state of the record, particularly in a case of first impression in this circuit in which federal jurisdiction is asserted under the FJDA. Our task is to try to strike a balance between the responsibilities of a court arriving at the disposition of a juvenile matter and the exclusive authority of the Attorney General to determine the facility of detention in any case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our focus, therefore, is solely on assuring an informed sentencing decision by the court. Sentencing in a juvenile matter is in some important respects different from the more restrictive situation in adult sentencing. Section 1B1.12 of the sentencing guidelines states explicitly that \"[the] guidelines do not apply to a defendant sentenced under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act.\" A district judge has wide discretion in determining whether any or how much detention (not to exceed a maximum applicable to a \"similarly situated adult defendant\") should be imposed on a juvenile. A rational exercise of that decision requires at the minimum a realistic understanding of the location and nature of probable detention facilities available to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court should assemble from the parties information as to the likely facility and programs to which the juvenile would be sent if detention is imposed. This would not mean that the Attorney General's hands would be tied then or in the future, but it would help ensure that the court has adequate information to fulfill Congress's mandate that the FJDA preserve a balance between rehabilitation and protection goals. Such information might reveal a likely choice of facility allowing ease of family access and adequate treatment for diagnosed disorders. This would seem more in keeping with the rehabilitative goal than one with little likelihood of family access and treatment. In such event, a clearly imperfect fit might be mitigated by a shorter commitment to detention. <i>Cf.

Mongue, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before HOWARD, Circuit Judge, COFFIN and CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an appeal by a juvenile, Patrick V. (Patrick), from a judgment of delinquency in a proceeding under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (FJDA), 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5031-5042, for commission of arson causing extensive property damage in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(i) and 2. The district court ordered Patrick detained for a period of 30 months, followed by supervised release for 27 months, plus joint liability with another individual for restitution in the amount of $728,141.61. Patrick claims that the rehabilitative purpose of the FJDA requires treatment rather than detention, and weighs against the imposition of restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenge to both the detention and the restitution aspects of the judgment reflect the uneasy tension between the rehabilitation focus of the FJDA and the sterner approach of the more recent Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A. Federal intervention in juvenile proceedings is relatively rare, at least in this circuit, and we find ourselves in a field as yet unploughed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering detention and restitution on the record before it. We do, however, feel that the record is insufficient to permit the court, in arriving at its own final disposition, to factor in information as to the location and rehabilitative capabilities of the detention facility chosen by the government pursuant to the requirements of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5039. We believe such consideration should be part of the juvenile sentencing process and therefore retain jurisdiction and remand to the district court for this limited purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Misconduct.</i> Prior to the summer of 2002, Patrick had no history of delinquent activity or substance abuse. His emotional well-being, however, was affected by earlier traumatic events that rendered him potentially more susceptible to the influence of a 19-year old \"adult\" friend, Christopher Conley. At the disposition proceedings, both of Patrick's parents testified that their divorce in 1992, when Patrick was five, was acrimonious, and that Patrick's relationship with his parents likely suffered as a result. A second traumatic interlude occurred when Patrick, when ten years of age, was sexually abused by a camp counselor. After Patrick's mother confronted the counselor, the counselor committed suicide. Patrick was apparently in therapy as a result of this latter experience, but only intermittently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The friendship between Patrick and Conley spurred the abrupt change in Patrick's behavior. Conley, recently released from a drug rehabilitation program in Pennsylvania, introduced Patrick to drugs and alcohol. Although Patrick had previously been an honor-roll student, his grades began to slip during the spring of 2002, his ninth grade year. Prior to the arson, Conley and Patrick committed a series of burglaries. The first burglary was a vindictive payback; the rest allegedly were thrill-seeking escapades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the night of the arson, July 7, 2002, Conley and Patrick illicitly entered one of the buildings of Southern Maine Marine Services (SMMS), intending to steal a marine radio to enable them to monitor police communications. Once inside, they noticed surveillance cameras (which, unbeknownst to either, were inoperable). Conley and Patrick attempted to locate the surveillance videotape, but when this proved unsuccessful they decided to burn down the building and destroy any evidence of their crime. Searching the SMMS premises, they found explosive items such as flares and electronic equipment; they spread gasoline around the area and near an oil tank, and placed propane tanks near a metal frame repair building and at the corner of a wooden office building. After setting fire to the gasoline by lighting a marine flare, the two fled the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fire, which took over six hours to control, completely destroyed the building used for repairs and damaged the office building. The property damage was extensive, including the loss of two boats, three boat trailers, boat motors, tools, technical manuals and other marine equipment. The losses, amounting to over $725,000, were suffered by 26 individuals and insurance companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A month later, a box traced to appellant and Conley was recovered from a vacant building and led to their apprehension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Initiation of Proceedings.</i> An information charged Patrick with juvenile delinquency, alleging that he aided, abetted, and committed arson of a building used in interstate or foreign commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(i) and 2. Under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5031-5042, authority to prosecute requires certification that a precondition to federal jurisdiction exists, in this case the commission of a crime of violence and a substantial federal interest. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5032. The certificate in this case identified the basis of the federal interest as the crime of arson, damage to structures used in interstate commerce (boats owned by citizens of several states) and some federally owned property belonging to the Secret Service. At arraignment on July 3, 2003, appellant admitted the truth of the version of events presented by the government and, after careful inquiry by the court as to his understanding of his rights, signed a plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Pre-Offense Conduct.</i> Prior to the disposition hearing, additional information was given to the court in a Predisposition Report (bearing the caption \"Presentence Investigation Report\"). It included a summary of pre-offense conduct, which consisted of five burglary and theft charges pending in state juvenile court. Between June 5 and July 4, 2002, Patrick and Conley allegedly broke into two homes, stealing computers and other such equipment valued at over $2,000, and into three places of business, stealing computers, equipment, and cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Medical Records.</i> A second type of information before the court was in the form of medical and treatment records. A psychological evaluation by Dr. Greg Carbone, requested by appellant, reported that Patrick had from average to superior intelligence, but also was afflicted with \"marked personality and developmental immaturity,\" post-traumatic stress, depressive disorder, and impulse control disorder. Dr. Carbone recommended an 18 to 36 month course of treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A post-apprehension stay at a treatment center in Utah resulted in a diagnosis of mood disorder, parent-child relational problems related to his parents' acrimonious divorce, polysubstance abuse, and narcissistic traits. After five months, he was involuntarily discharged for failure to comply with rules, interference with the facility's computers, sexual misconduct, and assisting another resident in obtaining drugs for a suicide attempt. His primary therapist noted a \"superficially pleasant and charismatic\" personality but also concluded that he was \"sneaky, dishonest, and without remorse.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Patrick was sent to a facility in Texas where he spent three weeks in a restricted setting. The staff reported that he met its expectations, \"performed very well,\" and had no instances of inappropriate behavior. A clinical therapist reported that his \"prognosis [was] fair given his prior treatment failure.\" The therapist recommended that Patrick be \"in a secured residential facility for at least six to nine months\" and then be admitted \"to a less restrictive program.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Appellant's Financial Status.</i> The Predisposition Report stated that appellant had completed 11th grade and had no employment history or income source.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> But it recommended \"a significant order of restitution\" and also noted that if the court chose to invoke 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3556, full restitution was made mandatory by the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A, since a \"crime of violence\" had been committed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Disposition Hearing Order.</i> On August 4, 2003, the court held the disposition hearing. Two victims of the fire made statements. The owner of SMMS described his psychological and economic losses, concluding with the probable loss of the business he had built over the years. An employee told how his life and that of his wife had been dramatically altered for the worse with the loss of his job at SMMS. Appellant was present and expressed his deep sorrow and regret to both victims. Appellant's mother and father also spoke, acknowledging the role their bitter divorce had played and stressing their son's need for professional treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Government counsel urged the maximum term of detention that the law permitted for a juvenile in appellant's shoes, 57 months. Appellant's counsel, predicting that appellant would be sent either to California or to a southern state where he would be exposed to hardened criminals, urged that Patrick be given three years of probation, and required to attend a therapeutic educational program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, at the end of the hearing, deliberated and stated its views. It noted that appellant's 19-year-old co-arsonist Conley had been sentenced to a federal penitentiary for approximately five years. It stated that it took account of Patrick's age and difficulties encountered, including the contributory role of his parents, and expressed the hope that appellant \"will move on and reclaim your life.\" It also recognized that apologies to the two victims showed that appellant was \"at least on the road to assuming responsibility.\" But it concluded that \"accepting responsibility for what you did requires some detention in addition to probation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ordered appellant detained for 30 months, with subsequent supervised release for 27 months. It further imposed, as it felt required to do by law, an obligation to pay full restitution, jointly with his co-arsonist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Subsequent proceedings.</i> On October 10, 2003, the court amended the judgment to correct a \"clerical mistake.\" Instead of ordering payment of restitution \"[i]n full immediately,\" it stated simply that restitution would begin following release from detention, according to a schedule devised by the supervising officer, \"subject always to review\" by the court. And instead of requiring interest on the restitution amount, interest was specifically waived because of Patrick's inability to pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 13, appellant moved for a statement of conclusions of law as to restitution, arguing against its imposition. The court wrote an endorsement on the motion, denying it and saying, \"[r]estitution is appropriate in this case and would be ordered even if it were discretionary.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties have given us their first preferences for a standard of review. Appellant has made a brief plea for <i>de novo</i> review. The government boldly suggests that review should not be available at all. We reject both invitations in favor of abuse of discretion. We are persuaded that the task of reconciling the various considerations involved in the disposition of a juvenile adjudged delinquent following commission of a very serious and dangerous crime of violence is one that demands a wide range of discretion by the sentencing court. <i>See United States v. Juvenile,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783985\"><a href=\"/opinion/783985/united-states-v-juvenile/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 784 (9th Cir.2003)(holding that standard of review for a juvenile delinquency sentence is abuse of discretion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Restitution</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that because appellant ostensibly agreed to restitution in the disposition below, any claim on appeal as to the inappropriateness of restitution was forfeited. The government points to appellant's counsel's focus on the calculation of restitution and his argument that it should be based on fair market value rather than replacement costs. When the court inquired whether there were objections other than to the amount of restitution, it received an admittedly vague answer from appellant's counsel: \"In my objections to the presentence report it was more in the nature of asking for additions; there is a lot more than is reflected.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, however, overlooks the fact that appellant specifically objected to the portion of the predisposition report concerning mandatory restitution. Moreover, when the August 6, 2003, judgment issued without any such specific ruling on his objection, appellant immediately filed a post-judgment motion for Conclusions of Law with Respect to the Imposition of Restitution. The court succinctly addressed the issue and denied the motion with an endorsement reading \"Restitution is appropriate in this case and would be ordered even if it were discretionary.\" While appellant's lack of emphasis on the issue at the disposition hearing does give pause, it apparently stemmed from a misunderstanding that the court had already decided that restitution was mandatory. The additional fact that the court was presented with the issue in the post-judgment motion and ruled on the merits convinces us that this is a case where we, too, should address the argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Cf. Nat'l Assoc. of Soc. Workers v. Harwood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707518\"><a href=\"/opinion/707518/national-association-of-social-workers-v-john-b-harwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 628 (1st Cir.1995)(deciding that appellate court could hear an issue not raised below in part because omission was inadvertent, not deliberate). We also see no prejudice to the government. <i>See id.</i> at 627.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore turn to the substance of appellant's argument. First, appellant asserts that restitution under the FJDA is discretionary, even if the underlying offense is a crime of violence. Second, appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by ordering restitution in this case because it failed to properly consider Patrick's financial resources as well as the detrimental effect such a large debt will have on Patrick's prospects for rehabilitation. We first consider the statutory scheme, and then address its application to Patrick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, in considering what was to become the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, deeply concerned over the impact of violent crime upon victims, took testimony from the federal judiciary concerning the impact of the proposed legislation on the criminal justice system. Despite testimony from the Criminal Law Committee of the Judicial Conference that mandatory victim restitution would not lead to \"any appreciable increase in compensation to victims of crime,\" the Committee was of the view that even \"nominal restitution payments\" serve \"the potential penalogical [sic] benefits of requiring the offender to be accountable....\" S. Rep. 104-179, at 18 (1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 924, 931.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal atmosphere of the federal act relating to juveniles is marked by a duality of objectives &#8212; that of rehabilitation and that of protecting society. <i>See infra</i> at 10-11. This is specifically true of the impact of the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act on juveniles who have committed serious crimes inflicting losses on victims. But, despite the nominal requirement of full restitution, the reach of the Act in the case of juveniles is modest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is first of all necessary to identify the series of steps that lead to a juvenile restitution order. Misunderstanding of the discretionary nature of restitution, even when a crime of violence has been committed, is revealed by the brief holding in <i>United States v. Juvenile G.Z.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754598\"><a href=\"/opinion/754598/united-states-v-juvenile-gz/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span>, 1149 (8th Cir.1998), that when a juvenile pleads guilty to a crime of violence, \"in these circumstances, restitution is mandatory, not discretionary.\" In fact, however, there are two stages. There is a threshold choice, followed by a mandatory course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the sequence of steps. Under the relevant juvenile proceeding section, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5037, the district court \"may\" order restitution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3556.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Once the court chooses this route, &#167; 3556 leaves no further choice, stating that the court \"shall order restitution in accordance with section 3663A.\" Under &#167; 3663A, a court must order a defendant to make restitution to the victim, \"[n]otwithstanding any other provisions of law,\" if the offense falls within the definition of a \"crime of violence\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A(c)(1)(A)(i). Section 16 describes such a crime as involving the \"use of physical force against the ... property of another\" or \"any other ... felony ... that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the ... property of another may be used.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16(1), (2). Arson is such a crime. And, under &#167; 3664(f)(1)(A), restitution must be ordered in the full amount without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This, then, is the applicable law. But its impact on the appellant is not as draconian as it might appear without taking careful note of the court's order in this case. We have noted its deletion, in an amended judgment, of any requirement of immediate payment in full and the waiver of both fine and interest. The determination of amounts payable, the times of payment, and the duration of the payment period are described as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any amount that the defendant is unable to pay now shall be paid in monthly installments, to be initially determined in amount by the supervising officer. Said payments are to be made during the period of his/her supervised release/probation subject always to review by the sentencing judge on request, by either the defendant or the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical time for evaluating appellant's ability to pay is, then, when the supervising officer prepares a schedule at the beginning of the period of supervised release. <i>See United States v. Stoecker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769089\"><a href=\"/opinion/769089/united-states-v-william-j-stoecker/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, 792 (7th Cir.2000). The schedule could allow nominal payments if economic circumstances justified them, &#167; 3664(f)(3)(B), but more substantial or even full payment could be required if, for example, appellant were to receive an inheritance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the burdensome nature of such a large amount of restitution, appellant's premises are inflated. In his main brief he presents his predicament as that of one who \"will enter adulthood with a debt unpayable,\" which for his whole life will \"doom all hope of rehabilitation.\" In his reply brief he expands on the theme to assume that even a yearly payment of $14,000, over half the median income of a person in appellant's shoes, would never pay off the debt &#8212; something he would \"carry to [his] grave.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were this predicament a reality, a court might well say that such a burden ruled out any vestige of rehabilitation. But this is far from the reality faced by the appellant. As the government acknowledged at oral argument, and as indicated by the restitution order, the duration of appellant's payment period is the 27 months of supervised release following detention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the arguably minimal impact of the order (stemming from its limited duration) in combination with the required evaluation of appellant's financial circumstances at the beginning of supervised release, we do not find that the imposition of discretionary restitution \"doom[s] all hope\" of rehabilitation. We therefore find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Detention</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thrust of appellant's argument is that the purpose of the FJDA is rehabilitation and that this purpose trumps all others. When confronted by the government's \"alarmist\" argument that under appellant's view a court could never impose detention on a juvenile, appellant responds that detention must be reserved for only those for whom \"rehabilitation is not an option.\" But in such a case the court would transfer the juvenile case for trial as an adult. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3502.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absolutist view, while remaining the goal of choice for many, does not reflect the extent to which rehabilitation, with the growth of youth violence, has increasingly shared the stage with goals of the criminal process.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span>, (1992), Justice Souter, writing for the Court in a case involving both the FJDA and the Sentencing Reform Act, stated, \"We do not think a broader congressional purpose points clearly in either party's direction.\" He would go no farther than to say that rehabilitation was not rejected. <i>Id.</i> at 298 n. 2, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112709\"><a href=\"/opinion/112709/united-states-v-rlc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1329</span></a></span> (\"While it is true that some rehabilitative tools were removed from the juvenile penalty scheme in 1984, the Juvenile Delinquency Act does not completely reject rehabilitative objectives.\") (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent, therefore, an absolute bar to detention, we are left to determine if the record permitted the district court's decision. Appellant makes an impassioned argument that the only evidence before the court was that the offense took place during the brief period when he was under the sway of an adult, that he took responsibility for his actions, had no prior convictions, was markedly immature, was \"already in the process of rehabilitation in a secured, locked facility,\" and that there was no evidence that federal detention could provide any rehabilitation program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a view of the evidence highly favorable to appellant. But the evidence before the court permitted another view. Taking responsibility for one's actions is a multi-layered concept, beginning with words and extending to conduct. The Utah therapist, after a five-month course of treatment, concluded that appellant was \"without remorse.\" Although it was true that appellant had no prior convictions, he had five recent burglaries pending in the state court. And while appellant may well have been under the sway of his adult companion, there was the real possibility that his diagnosed craving for approval might lead him along similar paths in the future. Finally, the problematic reports covering the substantial period of time that preceded his brief stay at the Texas facility might have weighed more heavily with the court than the Texas reports of good behavior and only a \"fair\" prognosis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It remains for us to note the consideration given by the district court to the relationship between rehabilitation and detention. Appellant argues that the district court gave no evident consideration to appellant's rehabilitation possibilities, in contravention of the objectives of the FJDA. At the conclusion of the disposition hearing, the court addressed appellant, giving credit for at least starting \"on the road to assuming responsibility,\" and acknowledging the difficulties he had encountered, the fact that he was making progress, and the case his attorney had made for probation. In the end, however, the court felt that real acceptance of responsibility entailed some detention, and ordered a term of 30 months, approximately one half the time urged by the government. This period, we note, fell within the 18- to 36-month period of treatment recommended by Dr. Carbone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot conclude on this record that there was a failure to consider any important factor, an erratic weighing, or an impermissible view of the law. At oral argument, appellant cited <i>United States v. Juvenile,</i> 347 F.3d at 778, as being impressive precedent for his case. Like many federal juvenile cases, that case involved a Native American in a tribal setting. A 14-year old juvenile had been beset for over half his life by sexual abuse on a grand scale and finally was himself prosecuted for sexual abuse. He signed a plea agreement, and, notwithstanding a government recommendation that he be in custody only until his eighteenth birthday, was sentenced by the court to custody until he reached twenty-one &#8212; a detention of almost seven years. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a good case for appellant in its valiant assertion that rehabilitation is still alive. But the facts are distinguishable in a significant respect. As a preliminary matter, we observe that <i>Juvenile</i> is not authority against all detention for juveniles found to be delinquent. More importantly, in <i>Juvenile,</i> the court, rejecting the government's more moderate recommendation, ordered a maximum detention to age 21, a detention of a 14-year old of almost seven years. By contrast, appellant's two-and-one-half year detention will end before his eighteenth birthday.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, in light of the evidence before the court on appellant's progress, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion on the present record in concluding that a 30-month term of detention is consistent with the rehabilitative objection of the FJDA. We leave it to the district court to consider its judgment in light of information to be obtained concerning the location and nature of the detention facility to which Patrick was assigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Proper Facility.</i> A juvenile who is detained under the FJDA is committed by the district court to the custody of the Attorney General for placement in an appropriate facility. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5039. Pursuant to the statute, the facility must provide the juvenile not only the necessities of life, but \"counseling, education, training, and medical care including necessary psychiatric, psychological, or other care and treatment.\" <i>Id.</i> Additionally, \"[w]henever possible, the Attorney General shall commit a juvenile to a foster home or community-based facility located in or near his home community.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, appellant's counsel raised the issue of appropriateness of the facility of detention. He speculated that Patrick might be sent to California or another distant place where he would be exposed to hardened criminals. Counsel noted that, \"the reality is that the Bureau of Prisons does not have a juvenile facility that will address Patrick's needs.\" This was in the context of appellant's effort to stress the goal of rehabilitation, and his requested disposition of probation coupled with the continued treatment he was receiving in the Texas program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's ability to focus on the details of the detention was limited, however, because it was undetermined where he would serve his detention. At the conclusion of the proceeding, Patrick's attorney (in response to a question about self-reporting) answered, \"I'm at a loss because I'm not sure where he will be designated. Supposedly it will be in his own state or community program.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record before the district court is bereft of any information concerning the facility chosen for appellant's detention &#8212; its location, policies, and programs available to juveniles in appellant's situation. On appeal, we have been provided only with the brief statements of counsel. Appellant states in his reply brief that the regional office of the Bureau of Prisons, having neither a facility in the northeast serving only juveniles nor any contract with the State of Maine, has placed appellant in a state facility in Pennsylvania. At oral argument, the government's attorney confirmed that Patrick is in a Pennsylvania facility and added, \"that's the nearest juvenile facility to Maine.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the nature of the detention facility, appellant asserts only that a juvenile's communications with family are severely limited and that there is little or no evidence in the record that appropriate rehabilitative treatment is available. At oral argument, the government's attorney responded to a question concerning the availability of psychiatric treatment at the Pennsylvania facility by stating simply that he could not \"imagine that the Bureau of Prisons would be staffing a juvenile facility without some professionals at that level.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are uncomfortable with this state of the record, particularly in a case of first impression in this circuit in which federal jurisdiction is asserted under the FJDA. Our task is to try to strike a balance between the responsibilities of a court arriving at the disposition of a juvenile matter and the exclusive authority of the Attorney General to determine the facility of detention in any case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our focus, therefore, is solely on assuring an informed sentencing decision by the court. Sentencing in a juvenile matter is in some important respects different from the more restrictive situation in adult sentencing. Section 1B1.12 of the sentencing guidelines states explicitly that \"[the] guidelines do not apply to a defendant sentenced under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act.\" A district judge has wide discretion in determining whether any or how much detention (not to exceed a maximum applicable to a \"similarly situated adult defendant\") should be imposed on a juvenile. A rational exercise of that decision requires at the minimum a realistic understanding of the location and nature of probable detention facilities available to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court should assemble from the parties information as to the likely facility and programs to which the juvenile would be sent if detention is imposed. This would not mean that the Attorney General's hands would be tied then or in the future, but it would help ensure that the court has adequate information to fulfill Congress's mandate that the FJDA preserve a balance between rehabilitation and protection goals. Such information might reveal a likely choice of facility allowing ease of family access and adequate treatment for diagnosed disorders. This would seem more in keeping with the rehabilitative goal than one with little likelihood of family access and treatment. In such event, a clearly imperfect fit might be mitigated by a shorter commitment to detention. <i>Cf. Juvenile,</i> 347 F.3d at 789, 792 (remanding to the district court for further findings of fact regarding placement of juvenile in a detention facility far from family).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without some sort of pre-confinement review of a facility's ability to provide appropriate rehabilitation, a juvenile &#8212; whose term of detention is likely to be limited by the imminence of adulthood &#8212; may be deprived of much of the protection afforded him by the FJDA; after-the-fact review of a facility's resources could result in the juvenile spending a substantial portion of his detention in an inappropriate setting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore remand this case to the district court to complete the record as to the location of the facility of detention, its policies, programs, and resources.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The court shall have broad discretion as to the nature of the proceeding. An evidentiary hearing may be held, but the court may choose to obtain the needed information in some other fashion and may request such additional briefing as it deems necessary. The focus of any proceeding is not the current care and custody of the appellant, but on the appropriateness of the detention facility as of the time of the court's disposition hearing. Upon receipt of further information, the district court may choose to affirm or modify the original disposition. We shall retain jurisdiction pending receipt of a report from the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the predisposition report states that Patrick completed the 11th grade, appellant's brief indicates that Patrick completed the 9th grade, which is more likely</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Furthermore, because this legal question is likely to arise in other cases &#8212; all the more likely because of the paucity of case law regarding federal juvenile dispositions in general and restitution in particular &#8212; declining to hear the issue will neither promote judicial economy nor aid in the administration of the juvenile justice system<i>See United States v.

Both the current and previous language of &#167; 5037 state that the court \"may\" order restitution</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> A court's power to pass upon the adequacy of the care actually given by a facility would generally have to await a proceeding challenging custody in light of specific conditions of detention alleged by the juvenile to be deficient</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In this instance, the district court will focus on the actual facility where Patrick is placed. In other juvenile dispositions, however, we recognize that the precise placement is not necessarily ascertainable in advance, and thus the court's inquiry may focus on the realm of probable facilities. This is further in keeping with our recognition that placement is ultimately the responsibility of the Attorney General</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
