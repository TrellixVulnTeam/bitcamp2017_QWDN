Farr, with whom Charles E. Gilbert, III and Gilbert\n& Greif, P.A. were on brief, for appellant.\n     Cassandra S. Shaffer, with whom Peter T. Marchesi and\nWheeler & Arey, P.A. were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                         April 14, 2006\n\f            Per Curiam.      This case arises from an incident in which\n\ndefendant Joshua Tibbetts, a deputy sheriff with the Penobscot\n\nCounty Sheriff's Department, issued plaintiff Barry Higgins a no-\n\ntrespass warning and ordered him to leave the T & N Trailer Park in\n\nCarmel,   Maine.       The    district    court    granted     the    defendants\n\n(Tibbetts,    Tibbetts'      supervisor    Sheriff     Glenn   Ross,    and   the\n\nDepartment   itself)    summary    judgment       on   Higgins'      claims   that\n\ndefendants deprived him of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights and certain other rights secured him under Maine common law.\n\nThe court also granted defendants judgment on the pleadings on\n\nHiggins' claim under Maine's unlawful eviction statute, 14 M.R.S.A.\n\n§ 6014.   Higgins brings this appeal to challenge these rulings.\n\n            The incident giving rise to this case occurred on May 16,\n\n2002.   The undisputed facts and the disputed facts taken in a light\n\nfavorable     to   Higgins,       see,     e.g.,       APG,    Inc.     v.    MCI\n\nTelecommunications Corp., 436 F.3d 294, 297 (1st Cir. 2006), are\n\nthat Higgins awoke that morning in an apartment over a garage built\n\non a lot within the trailer park.          While he was drinking coffee in\n\nhis robe, Higgins heard someone closing a door below, in the\n\ngarage.     Higgins opened the door to the apartment and saw his\n\nsister Irene standing outside near the base of a ladder that he had\n\nused to access the apartment.       (Apparently, there previously was a\n\ndeck with steps leading up to the apartment, but the deck and steps\n\nhad been removed).     Higgins asked Irene what she was doing in his\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fgarage.   Irene retorted that Higgins had no right to be there and\n\nthat she was going to call the sheriff.        But before she could do\n\nso,   Higgins   called    the   sheriff's   department   and   asked   for\n\nassistance.\n\n           There had been a long-running dispute between Higgins and\n\nhis family over Higgins' rights vis-à-vis the building and certain\n\nof its contents.         Those members of Higgins' family who have\n\nsubmitted evidence in this case deny that Higgins had any right to\n\nbe in the building on the day of the incident. Higgins responds\n\nthat, at the very least, he had a tenancy interest in the building.\n\nHe alleges that he and his father, Leo, formed a partnership and\n\npurchased the trailer park in 1972, agreeing at the time that all\n\nmembers of the Higgins family would have a lifetime right to reside\n\nthere.    Higgins says that he paid for and built the apartment and\n\ngarage, completing construction in 1981, and that he \"resided\" in\n\nthe building from 1981 to the day of the incident.        Higgins admits\n\nto having spent significant periods of time out of state beginning\n\nin the late 1990s, and to having signed his partnership interest\n\nover to his father during his divorce proceedings in 1989, with the\n\nas-yet unrealized expectation that his father would deed the\n\ninterest back to him after the proceedings concluded.             But he\n\nmaintains that his \"long-term possession and occupancy of the\n\nbuilding, at a minimum, give rise to a tenancy interest, even in\n\nthe absence of agreement with his father as to its terms.\"\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           Deputy Tibbetts was dispatched to the trailer park in\n\nresponse to Higgins' call.        Upon arriving, Tibbetts encountered\n\nwhat Higgins described in his deposition as a \"screaming contest\"\n\ninvolving, at the very least, himself and his sisters Irene and\n\nCynthia, as well as Cynthia's husband David Prescott.                Higgins\n\ninformed Tibbetts that he and his father were engaged in an ongoing\n\ndisagreement over ownership of the property and his right to reside\n\nthere.    Leo showed up a short time later with a copy of the deed,\n\nwhich he showed to Tibbetts, telling him that he previously had\n\nnotified Higgins to stay off the property.           Leo asked Tibbetts to\n\nbar Higgins from the property.      Higgins informed Tibbetts that the\n\npolice had more than once been summoned to mediate the issue but\n\nalways had declined to involve themselves, telling Higgins and Leo\n\nthat it was a \"civil dispute and that [they] would not get\n\ninvolved.\"\n\n           In due course, Tibbetts issued Higgins the no-trespass\n\norder that is the subject of this lawsuit and gave him several\n\nminutes to collect some personal belongings from the apartment.\n\nSeveral facts, in addition to Leo’s apparent ownership of the\n\nbuilding, led Tibbetts to believe that Higgins was a trespasser and\n\nwas not lawfully entitled to occupy the apartment:                 the truck\n\nHiggins had parked outside the building had Connecticut license\n\nplates;   there   were   no   stairs,   only   a   ladder,   to   access   the\n\nbuilding’s apartment; and Tibbetts had driven past the building on\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f“many, many” prior occasions and it always had appeared vacant -–\n\ni.e., there never were any lights on, there never were any vehicles\n\nparked outside, and there was “lots of junk in the dooryard that\n\nwas always in the same place.”        (The word \"dooryard,\" as used\n\ncolloquially in northern New England and eastern Canada, typically\n\nrefers to the area outside the most commonly used entrance to a\n\nresidence, and often includes the driveway. See Walt Whitman, When\n\nLilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd (1865-66)).       Tibbetts told\n\nHiggins that he would be arrested if he did not leave or if he\n\nreturned to the property.   Higgins says that he asked Tibbetts to\n\nlook in the apartment and to take note of the personal property\n\nthat he would be leaving behind, but Tibbetts refused.      Higgins\n\nsays that, after he complied with Tibbetts' order and departed, a\n\ngreat deal of his personal property disappeared from the building.\n\n          Eventually, Higgins filed this action. He asserted three\n\nfederal civil rights claims:   that his \"eviction\" constituted (1)\n\na \"meaningful interference with . . . [his] possessory interests\"\n\nin his residence, and thus an unlawful seizure in violation of the\n\nFourth Amendment, see Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56, 61 (1992)\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); (2) an abridgment\n\nof his right to procedural due process protections before the\n\nseizure, see Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 87 (1972); and (3)   a\n\nviolation of his right to have had Tibbetts properly trained and\n\nsupervised by the other defendants, see, e.g., City of Oklahoma\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fCity v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 813-24 (1985).                 He also asserted\n\nstate law claims for conversion of his personal property and the\n\ninfliction of emotional distress. Finally, as noted at the outset,\n\nHiggins pressed a claim under Maine’s unlawful eviction statute, 14\n\nM.R.S.A. § 6014.\n\n            Following discovery, the defendants moved for summary\n\njudgment on all claims except the claim for wrongful eviction, on\n\nwhich they moved for judgment on the pleadings.                The matter was\n\nreferred to a magistrate judge, who issued a thorough and carefully\n\nreasoned    report      recommending     that   the   defendants’    motions   be\n\ngranted.    The magistrate judge expressed considerable doubt that a\n\nviable constitutional claim was stated under either the Fourth or\n\nFourteenth Amendments, but concluded that, in any event, the\n\ndefendants should be entitled to qualified immunity from the claims\n\nbecause    they   had    not   violated    Higgins’    “clearly     established”\n\nrights.     See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982);\n\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987).               The magistrate\n\njudge further concluded that the defendants should be statutorily\n\nimmune from liability on Higgins’ conversion and infliction of\n\nemotional distress claims, Tibbetts because he was exercising a\n\ndiscretionary function when he issued the no-trespass order and did\n\nnot act in bad faith, see 14 M.R.S.A. § 8111(1)(c) & (E), and the\n\nremaining    defendants        because    of    absolute   governmental-entity\n\nimmunity, see 14 M.R.S.A. § 8103(1). Finally, the magistrate judge\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\frejected Higgins’ claim for unlawful eviction because, inter alia,\n\nthe statute only authorizes a cause of action against a “landlord,”\n\nand not against his agent.          The district court accepted the\n\nmagistrate   judge’s   recommended       rulings   insofar    as     they   were\n\npremised on the reasoning just summarized, and Higgins brought this\n\nappeal to challenge these rulings.\n\n           The lower court opinions more than adequately explain why\n\nthe defendants are entitled to summary judgment in this case, so we\n\nare content to affirm largely on the basis of those opinions.               See,\n\ne.g., Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Devel. Corp., 368 F.3d 1, 2 (1st\n\nCir.   2004).     We   add   only    a    few   remarks      about    Higgins'\n\nconstitutional claims against Tibbetts.            Higgins premises these\n\nclaims on the threshold assertion that the untrained Tibbetts\n\nsubjected him to an unlawful eviction.          We do not doubt that, in\n\ncertain circumstances, a police officer’s participation in an\n\nunlawful eviction can implicate a tenant’s Fourth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights and give rise to liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nCf. Soldal, 506 U.S. at 61; Fuentes, 407 U.S. at 87.                  At least\n\narguably, then, Higgins has adduced enough evidence to meet the\n\nfirst two parts of this circuit's tripartite qualified-immunity\n\ninquiry.   See, e.g., Wilson v. City of Boston, 421 F.3d 45, 52 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (summarizing the first two questions the court should\n\nask as:    \"(1) whether the claimant has alleged the deprivation of\n\nan actual constitutional right; [and] (2) whether the right was\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fclearly established at the time of the alleged action or inaction\n\n. . .\"); Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare, 392 F.3d 55, 60-61 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (similar).\n\n            In our view, the viability of Higgins' constitutional\n\nclaims against Tibbetts depends on whether, to the extent that what\n\nhappened properly can be found to have been an “eviction” at all,\n\nTibbetts could be found to have known that it was an unlawful\n\neviction.    Such a finding is necessary if Higgins is to clear the\n\nfinal hurdle presented by the qualified-immunity defense Higgins\n\nhas interposed.    See Wilson, 421 F.3d at 52 (observing that, at the\n\nthird prong of this circuit's qualified-immunity inquiry, the\n\nplaintiff must establish that “an objectively reasonable official\n\nwould have believed that the action taken violated [the previously\n\nidentified] clearly established right”); see also Riverdale Mills,\n\n392 F.3d at 61 (“It is not always evident at the time an official\n\ntakes an action that a clearly established right is involved.             For\n\nexample,    the   factual   situation    might     be   ambiguous    or   the\n\napplication of the legal standard to the precise facts at issue\n\nmight be difficult; in either case the officer’s action may be\n\nobjectively    reasonable   and   she   may   be   entitled   to    qualified\n\nimmunity.”).\n\n            One could not reasonably find in Higgins’ favor on this\n\nissue.     As set forth above, Tibbetts encountered a volatile and\n\npotentially dangerous situation -- described by Higgins himself as\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fa “screaming contest” -- when he arrived at the trailer park.        The\n\nsubject of the dispute was a man who, so far as Tibbetts could\n\ntell, was driving a truck with out-of-state license plates, and who\n\nclaimed a right to occupy a building with which Tibbetts was\n\nfamiliar and which Tibbetts reasonably thought, based on his prior\n\nknowledge of the building and the circumstantial evidence at the\n\nscene, to have been long unoccupied.     The man provided no written\n\nlease or other documentation to support his claimed occupancy\n\nright, but only made a conclusory verbal claim of entitlement.\n\nOpposing this man were several members of his own family, all of\n\nwhom disputed his claimed entitlement and informed Tibbetts that he\n\npreviously had been told to stay away, and one of whom -- the man's\n\nfather -- produced a deed which substantiated the father's claim of\n\nownership of the property.\n\n          \"Qualified   immunity   protects    'all   but   the   plainly\n\nincompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.'\"       Wilson, 421\n\nF.3d at 58 (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986)).\n\nIn these circumstances, Tibbetts' decision to disbelieve Higgins\n\nand to defuse the situation by asking him to leave under threat of\n\ncitation for trespass was neither plainly incompetent nor involved\n\na deliberate violation of the law.      Given the paucity of evidence\n\nthat Higgins was entitled to occupy the property and the abundance\n\nof evidence pointing the other way, Higgins' argument essentially\n\ninvites us to hold, as a matter of constitutional law, that a\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fpolice officer, summoned to mediate a volatile dispute involving an\n\nalleged trespasser, is obliged to leave the situation unresolved\n\nsimply because the trespasser represents himself to be entitled to\n\nbe there.    To state the proposition is to expose its foolishness.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                   Concurring opinion follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.              The\n\nopinion of the court applies the three-part qualified immunity\n\nanalysis called for in our recent cases and concludes that Tibbetts\n\nis entitled to qualified immunity at prong three.                    See, e.g.,\n\nWilson v. City of Boston, 421 F.3d 45, 52-59 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nRiverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare, 392 F.3d 55, 60-66 (1st Cir.\n\n2004); Suboh v. District Atty's Office, 298 F.3d 81, 90-96 (1st\n\nCir. 2002); Abreu-Guzman v. Ford, 241 F.3d 69, 73-74 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    I write separately because I believe that Tibbetts should\n\nhave prevailed on the initial inquiry -- whether he violated\n\nHiggins' constitutional rights -- and more generally to urge\n\nconsideration of a return to the \"two-step process,\" Brosseau v.\n\nHaugen,    543   U.S.   194,   195   (2004),    traditionally   employed     in\n\nqualified immunity cases.       I do so because our three-step process\n\ninvites   erroneous     holdings     and,    possibly,   erroneous    outcomes,\n\nespecially in Fourth Amendment cases.\n\n            For most of the last decade, this court has usually asked\n\nthree questions when evaluating whether a government actor is\n\nentitled to qualified immunity:         (1) Does the official conduct in\n\nquestion, as alleged, constitute the violation of an actual federal\n\nright?    (2) If so, was the right so clearly established at the time\n\nof the alleged violation that a reasonable official would have been\n\non notice that the conduct was unconstitutional?            (3) If so, would\n\na reasonable official have understood that the conduct violated the\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fclearly established right at issue?    E.g., Wilson, 421 F.3d at 52;\n\nbut see Riverdale Mills, 393 F.3d at 61 n.5 (acknowledging that we\n\nsometimes still follow a two-step process).    A negative answer to\n\nquestion one means that there has been no violation of a federal\n\nright; a negative answer to question two or three gives rise to\n\nqualified immunity insofar as plaintiff is seeking money damages\n\nfrom the defendant.\n\n           The second and third questions we ask derive from an\n\nelaboration of the two-step process described in the Supreme\n\nCourt's qualified-immunity cases. The two-step test directs courts\n\nevaluating assertions of qualified immunity to ask:     (1)   Do the\n\nspecific case facts alleged describe a violation of a federal\n\nright?    (2)   If so, should the defendant, who is charged with\n\nknowledge of clearly established law, have known that the conduct\n\nin question violated that right?      See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S.\n\n194, 201-02 (2001); see also Riverdale Mills, 392 F.3d at 60-61\n\n(observing that the second and third questions this circuit usually\n\nasks involve an expansion of the inquiry prescribed by the Supreme\n\nCourt).\n\n           Our elaboration seems to have been prompted, at least in\n\npart, by a desire to emphasize that official defendants should not\n\nbe held liable in situations where they have made reasonable\n\nmistakes about the facts of the situation they confront, as well as\n\nreasonable mistakes as to whether, in light of clearly established\n\n\n                               -12-\n\flaw, their conduct infringed a federal right.                See, e.g., Wilson,\n\n421 F.3d at 57-58; Riverdale Mills, 392 F.3d at 61; Suboh, 298 F.3d\n\nat 96.        The issue of mistaken factual (as opposed to legal)\n\njudgments frequently arises in civil rights actions alleging Fourth\n\nAmendment violations, where the constitutionality of an official's\n\nconduct turns not on post hoc judgments about whether the search or\n\nseizure was justified or properly calibrated, but on whether it was\n\nreasonable      under   the    tense,   uncertain,     and       rapidly   evolving\n\ncircumstances that the official confronted.                See Saucier, 533 U.S.\n\nat 204-05 (discussing Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989)).                   But\n\nthis is not exclusively a Fourth Amendment problem; the issue of\n\nmistaken factual judgments arises in other constitutional settings\n\nas well.      See, e.g., Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dept., 315 F.3d\n\n65, 69-70 (1st Cir. 2002) (applying a fact-based balancing test to\n\ndetermine the viability of claimed First Amendment violation in the\n\ncase of a government whistleblower disciplined for \"disruptive\n\nspeech\"); Suboh, 298 F.3d at 90-92 (applying a fact-based balancing\n\ntest to determine the viability of alleged infringements of the\n\nright    to    \"familial      integrity,\"      protected    by    the   Fourteenth\n\nAmendment's Due Process Clause, in a child-custody dispute).\n\n              Of course, officials should not be made to pay damages\n\nfor reasonable but mistaken factual judgments made in circumstances\n\nsuch as these.      But the reason they should not be held liable is\n\nthat an official who acts reasonably vis-à-vis the plaintiff has\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fnot violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights -- even if the\n\ninvasion in question proves unwarranted with the benefit of 20/20\n\nhindsight. See Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177, 183-89 (1990)\n\n(emphasizing that the Fourth Amendment does not protect against\n\nsearches and seizures that prove to have been unwarranted, but only\n\nagainst searches and seizures that were unreasonable).                    In such a\n\nsituation,      the   qualified-immunity        defense    should   not    even   be\n\naddressed because its necessary antecedent -- the presence of a\n\nviable claim for the invasion of a federal right -- is lacking.\n\nOur    recent    qualified-immunity        cases    obscure     this      point   by\n\nsuggesting that reasonable factual errors, like reasonable legal\n\nerrors, are grist for the qualified-immunity mill, and are not to\n\nbe analyzed as part of the threshold federal-right issue.\n\n            Our recent opinion in Wilson is instructive, consistent\n\nas it is with our other recent precedent.                 In that case, a woman\n\nwho was mistakenly arrested pursuant to a sting operation designed\n\nto capture a large number of persons with outstanding arrest\n\nwarrants sued the arresting officer for money damages, claiming\n\nthat he violated her Fourth Amendment rights.               See 421 F.3d at 47.\n\nIn    conducting      our   three-part    qualified   immunity      analysis,     we\n\ndetermined that, under the facts alleged, the arresting officers\n\nindeed had violated the plaintiff's right to be free from an\n\nerroneous arrest, and that it should have been clear to the\n\narresting officer, under prevailing clearly established law, that\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fhis conduct was unlawful.          See id. at 54-57.      In other words, we\n\nanswered    our    first     two   qualified-immunity     questions   in   the\n\naffirmative.      See id.    Nonetheless, we concluded that the officer\n\nwas entitled to qualified immunity.          See id. at 57-59.   We reasoned\n\nthat the officer reasonably, although mistakenly, believed that\n\nthere was an outstanding warrant for the plaintiff's arrest, and\n\nthat he acted reasonably in promptly ordering the plaintiff's\n\nrelease upon learning of the error.           See id.\n\n            The defendant in Wilson was not simply entitled to avoid\n\ndamages liability because of the qualified-immunity doctrine; he\n\nwas entitled to a merits dismissal of the plaintiff's Fourth\n\nAmendment claim because his conduct was reasonable under the\n\ncircumstances. See Rodriguez, 497 U.S. at 183-89. In other words,\n\nhe   did   not    violate   the    plaintiff's   Fourth   Amendment   rights.\n\nSee id.    The factual analysis performed at step three should have\n\nbeen performed at step one, and should have yielded the conclusion\n\nthat   there     was   no   constitutional   violation.      Regrettable    as\n\nincidents of mistaken arrest such as this may be, American citizens\n\nsimply do not have a free-standing Fourth Amendment right not to be\n\narrested erroneously. Cf. id. at 184 (\"If a magistrate, based upon\n\nseemingly reliable but factually inaccurate information, issues a\n\nwarrant for the search of a house in which the sought-after felon\n\nis not present, has never been present, and was never likely to\n\nhave been present, the owner of that house suffers one of the\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\finconveniences we all expose ourselves to as the cost of living in\n\na safe society; he does not suffer a violation of the Fourth\n\nAmendment.\"). The right protects only against unreasonable arrests\n\n-- i.e., unreasonable mistakes about the perceived facts giving\n\nrise to the arrest.\n\n           I would not write separately if my concern were merely\n\ntheoretical.   Although the results in Wilson and this case remain\n\nthe same whether we hold that there has been no invasion of a right\n\nor that there has been a reasonable mistake of fact made in\n\nconnection with the invasion of the right, that is so only because\n\nthe plaintiff in each case sought only monetary damages, and not\n\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief (against which the qualified-\n\nimmunity doctrine is not a shield, see Torres Rivera v. Calderon\n\nSerra, 412 F.3d 205, 212 (1st Cir. 2005)).      We should not hold or\n\nimply, as we are invited to do in our tripartite elaboration of the\n\nqualified-immunity analysis, that a government official violates\n\nthe Constitution when she makes a reasonable but mistaken factual\n\njudgment   that   a   particular   situation   calls    for   a   forceful\n\nintervention by her office.        The traditional two-step qualified\n\nimmunity analysis, still employed by the Supreme Court, does not\n\npermit this error, for it channels consideration of issues of\n\nreasonable mistakes of fact into the initial inquiry:              whether\n\nthere has been an invasion of a federal right.         See Brosseau, 543\n\nU.S. at 195.\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f          We should return to the two-step inquiry employed by the\n\nSupreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n                              -17-\n\f",

The district court granted the defendants (Tibbetts, Tibbetts' supervisor Sheriff Glenn Ross, and the Department itself) summary judgment on Higgins' claims that defendants deprived him of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and certain other rights secured him under Maine common law. The court also granted defendants judgment on the pleadings on Higgins' claim under Maine's unlawful eviction statute, 14 M.R.S.A. &#167; 6014. Higgins brings this appeal to challenge these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incident giving rise to this case occurred on May 16, 2002. The undisputed facts and the disputed facts taken in a light favorable to Higgins, <i>see, e.g., APG, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications Corp.,</i> 436 F.3d 294, 297 (1st Cir.2006), are that Higgins awoke that morning in an apartment over a garage built on a lot within the trailer park. While he was drinking coffee in his robe, Higgins heard someone closing a door below, in the garage. Higgins opened the door to the apartment and saw his sister Irene standing outside near the base of a ladder that he had used to access the apartment. (Apparently, there previously was a deck with steps leading up to the apartment, but the deck and steps had been removed). Higgins asked Irene what she was doing in his garage. Irene retorted that Higgins had no right to be there and that she was going to call the sheriff. But before she could do so, Higgins called the sheriff's department and asked for assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There had been a long-running dispute between Higgins and his family over Higgins' rights vis-&#224;-vis the building and certain of its contents. Those members of Higgins' family who have submitted evidence in this case deny that Higgins had any right to be in the building on the day of the incident. Higgins responds that, at the very least, he had a tenancy interest in the building. He alleges that he and his father, Leo, formed a partnership and purchased the trailer park in 1972, agreeing at the time that all members of the Higgins family would have a lifetime right to reside there. Higgins says that he paid for and built the apartment and garage, completing construction in 1981, and that he \"resided\" in the building from 1981 to the day of the incident. Higgins admits to having spent significant periods of time out of state beginning in the late 1990s, and to having signed his partnership interest over to his father during his divorce proceedings in 1989, with the as-yet unrealized expectation that his father would deed the interest back to him after the proceedings concluded. But he maintains that his \"long-term possession and occupancy of the building, at a minimum, give rise to a tenancy interest, even in the absence of agreement with his father as to its terms.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deputy Tibbetts was dispatched to the trailer park in response to Higgins' call. Upon arriving, Tibbetts encountered what Higgins described in his deposition as a \"screaming contest\" involving, at the very least, himself and his sisters Irene and Cynthia, as well as Cynthia's husband David Prescott. Higgins informed Tibbetts that he and his father were engaged in an ongoing disagreement over ownership of the property and his right to reside there. Leo showed up a short time later with a copy of the deed, which he showed to Tibbetts, telling him that he previously had notified Higgins to stay off the property. Leo asked Tibbetts to bar Higgins from the property. Higgins informed Tibbetts that the police had more than once been summoned to mediate the issue but always had declined to involve themselves, telling Higgins and Leo that it was a \"civil dispute and that [they] would not get involved.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Tibbetts issued Higgins the no-trespass order that is the subject of this lawsuit and gave him several minutes to collect some personal belongings from the apartment. Several facts, in addition to Leo's apparent ownership of the building, led Tibbetts to believe that Higgins was a trespasser and was not lawfully entitled to occupy the apartment: the truck Higgins had parked outside the building had Connecticut license plates; there were no stairs, only a ladder, to access the building's apartment; and Tibbetts had driven past the building on \"many, many\" prior occasions and it always had appeared vacant &#8212; i.e., there never were any lights on, there never were any vehicles parked outside, and there was \"lots of junk in the dooryard that was always in the same place.\" (The word \"dooryard,\" as used colloquially in northern New England and eastern Canada, typically refers to the area outside the most commonly used entrance to a residence, and often includes the driveway. <i>See</i> Walt Whitman, <i>When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd</i> (1865-66)). Tibbetts told Higgins that he would be arrested if he did not leave or if he returned to the property. Higgins says that he asked Tibbetts to look in the apartment and to take note of the personal property that he would be leaving behind, but Tibbetts refused. Higgins says that, after he complied with Tibbetts' order and departed, a great deal of his personal property disappeared from the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Higgins filed this action. He asserted three federal civil rights claims: that his \"eviction\" constituted (1) a \"meaningful interference with ... [his] possessory interests\" in his residence, and thus an unlawful seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment, <i>see Soldal v. Cook County,</i> 506 U.S. 56, 61, 113 S.Ct. 538, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); (2) an abridgment of his right to procedural due process protections before the seizure, <i>see Fuentes v. Shevin,</i> 407 U.S. 67, 87, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972); and (3) a violation of his right to have had Tibbetts properly trained and supervised by the other defendants, <i>see, e.g., City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle,</i> 471 U.S. 808, 813-24, 105 S.Ct. 2427, 85 L.Ed.2d 791 (1985). He also asserted state law claims for conversion of his personal property and the infliction of emotional distress. Finally, as noted at the outset, Higgins pressed a claim under Maine's unlawful eviction statute, 14 M.R.S.A. &#167; 6014.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims except the claim for wrongful eviction, on which they moved for judgment on the pleadings. The matter was referred to a magistrate judge, who issued a thorough and carefully reasoned report recommending that the defendants' motions be granted. The magistrate judge expressed considerable doubt that a viable constitutional claim was stated under either the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendments, but concluded that, in any event, the defendants should be entitled to qualified immunity from the claims because they had not violated Higgins' \"clearly established\" rights. <i>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); <i>Anderson v. Creighton,</i> 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). The magistrate judge further concluded that the defendants should be statutorily immune from liability on Higgins' conversion and infliction of emotional distress claims, Tibbetts because he was exercising a discretionary function when he issued the no-trespass order and did not act in bad faith, <i>see</i> 14 M.R.S.A. &#167; 8111(1)(c) &amp; (E), and the remaining defendants because of absolute governmental-entity immunity, <i>see</i> 14 M.R.S.A. &#167; 8103(1). Finally, the magistrate judge rejected Higgins' claim for unlawful eviction because, <i>inter alia,</i> the statute only authorizes a cause of action against a \"landlord,\" and not against his agent. The district court accepted the magistrate judge's recommended rulings insofar as they were premised on the reasoning just summarized, and Higgins brought this appeal to challenge these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court opinions more than adequately explain why the defendants are entitled to summary judgment in this case, so we are content to affirm largely on the basis of those opinions. <i>See, e.g., Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Devel. Inc.,</i> 368 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2004). We add only a few remarks about Higgins' constitutional claims against Tibbetts. Higgins premises these claims on the threshold assertion that the untrained Tibbetts subjected him to an unlawful eviction. We do not doubt that, in certain circumstances, a police officer's participation in an unlawful eviction can implicate a tenant's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and give rise to liability under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. <i>Cf. Soldal,</i> 506 U.S. at 61, 113 S.Ct. 538; <i>Fuentes,</i> 407 U.S. at 87, 92 S.Ct. 1983. At least arguably, then, Higgins has adduced enough evidence to meet the first two parts of this circuit's tripartite qualified-immunity inquiry. <i>See, e.g., Wilson v. City of Boston,</i> 421 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.2005) (summarizing the first two questions the court should ask as: \"(1) whether the claimant has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right; [and] (2) whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged action or inaction...\"); <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> 392 F.3d 55, 60-61 (1st Cir.2004) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the viability of Higgins' constitutional claims against Tibbetts depends on whether, to the extent that what happened properly can be found to have been an \"eviction\" at all, Tibbetts could be found to have known that it was an unlawful eviction. Such a finding is necessary if Higgins is to clear the final hurdle presented by the qualified-immunity defense Higgins has interposed. <i>See Wilson,</i> 421 F.3d at 52 (observing that, at the third prong of this circuit's qualified-immunity inquiry, the plaintiff must establish that \"an objectively reasonable official would have believed that the action taken violated [the previously identified] clearly established right\"); <i>see also Riverdale Mills,</i> 392 F.3d at 61 (\"It is not always evident at the time an official takes an action that a clearly established right is involved. For example, the factual situation might be ambiguous or the application of the legal standard to the precise facts at issue might be difficult; in either case the officer's action may be objectively reasonable and she may be entitled to qualified immunity.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One could not reasonably find in Higgins' favor on this issue. As set forth above, Tibbetts encountered a volatile and potentially dangerous situation &#8212; described by Higgins himself as a \"screaming contest\" &#8212; when he arrived at the trailer park. The subject of the dispute was a man who, so far as Tibbetts could tell, was driving a truck with out-of-state license plates, and who claimed a right to occupy a building with which Tibbetts was familiar and which Tibbetts reasonably thought, based on his prior knowledge of the building and the circumstantial evidence at the scene, to have been long unoccupied. The man provided no written lease or other documentation to support his claimed occupancy right, but only made a conclusory verbal claim of entitlement. Opposing this man were several members of his own family, all of whom disputed his claimed entitlement and informed Tibbetts that he previously had been told to stay away, and one of whom &#8212; the man's father &#8212; produced a deed which substantiated the father's claim of ownership of the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Qualified immunity protects `all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.'\" <i>Wilson,</i> 421 F.3d at 58 (quoting <i>Malley v. Briggs,</i> 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986)). In these circumstances, Tibbetts' decision to disbelieve Higgins and to defuse the situation by asking him to leave under threat of citation for trespass was neither plainly incompetent nor involved a deliberate violation of the law. Given the paucity of evidence that Higgins was entitled to occupy the property and the abundance of evidence pointing the other way, Higgins' argument essentially invites us to hold, as a matter of constitutional law, that a police officer, summoned to mediate a volatile dispute involving an alleged trespasser, is obliged to leave the situation unresolved simply because the trespasser represents himself to be entitled to be there. To state the proposition is to expose its foolishness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HOWARD, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The opinion of the court applies the three-part qualified immunity analysis called for in our recent cases and concludes that Tibbetts is entitled to qualified immunity at prong three. <i>See, e.g., Wilson v. City of Boston,</i> 421 F.3d 45, 52-59 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> 392 F.3d 55, 60-66 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Suboh v. District Atty's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 90-96 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Abreu-Guzman v. Ford,</i> 241 F.3d 69, 73-74 (1st Cir.2001). I write separately because I believe that Tibbetts should have prevailed on the initial inquiry &#8212; whether he violated Higgins' constitutional rights &#8212; and more generally to urge consideration of a return to the \"two-step process,\" <i>Brosseau v. Haugen,</i> 543 U.S. 194, 195, 125 S.Ct. 596, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004), traditionally employed in qualified immunity cases. I do so because our three-step process invites erroneous holdings and, possibly, erroneous outcomes, especially in Fourth Amendment cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For most of the last decade, this court has usually asked three questions when evaluating whether a government actor is entitled to qualified immunity: (1) Does the official conduct in question, as alleged, constitute the violation of an actual federal right? (2) If so, was the right so clearly established at the time of the alleged violation that a reasonable official would have been on notice that the conduct was unconstitutional? (3) If so, would a reasonable official have understood that the conduct violated the clearly established right at issue? <i>E.g., Wilson,</i> 421 F.3d at 52; <i>but see Riverdale Mills,</i> 392 F.3d at 61 n. 5 (acknowledging that we sometimes still follow a two-step process). A negative answer to question one means that there has been no violation of a federal right; a negative answer to question two or three gives rise to qualified immunity insofar as plaintiff is seeking money damages from the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and third questions we ask derive from an elaboration of the two-step process described in the Supreme Court's qualified-immunity cases. The two-step test directs courts evaluating assertions of qualified immunity to ask: (1) Do the specific case facts alleged describe a violation of a federal right? (2) If so, should the defendant, who is charged with knowledge of clearly established law, have known that the conduct in question violated that right? <i>See Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201-02, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001); <i>see also Riverdale Mills,</i> 392 F.3d at 60-61 (observing that the second and third questions this circuit usually asks involve an expansion of the inquiry prescribed by the Supreme Court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our elaboration seems to have been prompted, at least in part, by a desire to emphasize that official defendants should not be held liable in situations where they have made reasonable mistakes about the <i>facts</i> of the situation they confront, as well as reasonable mistakes as to whether, in light of clearly established <i>law,</i> their conduct infringed a federal right. <i>See, e.g., Wilson,</i> 421 F.3d at 57-58; <i>Riverdale Mills,</i> 392 F.3d at 61; <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 96. The issue of mistaken <i>factual</i> (as opposed to legal) judgments frequently arises in civil rights actions alleging Fourth Amendment violations, where the constitutionality of an official's conduct turns not on post hoc judgments about whether the search or seizure was justified or properly calibrated, but on whether it was <i>reasonable</i> under the tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving circumstances that the official confronted. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 204-05, 121 S.Ct. 2151 (discussing <i>Graham v. Connor,</i> 490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)). But this is not exclusively a Fourth Amendment problem; the issue of mistaken factual judgments arises in other constitutional settings as well. <i>See, e.g., Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dept.,</i> 315 F.3d 65, 69-70 (1st Cir.2002) (applying a fact-based balancing test to determine the viability of claimed First Amendment violation in the case of a government whistleblower disciplined for \"disruptive speech\"); <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 90-92 (applying a fact-based balancing test to determine the viability of alleged infringements of the right to \"familial integrity,\" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, in a child-custody dispute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, officials should not be made to pay damages for reasonable but mistaken factual judgments made in circumstances such as these. But the reason they should not be held liable is that an official who acts reasonably vis-&#224;-vis the plaintiff has not violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights &#8212; even if the invasion in question proves unwarranted with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. <i>See Illinois v. Rodriguez,</i> 497 U.S. 177, 183-89, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990) (emphasizing that the Fourth Amendment does not protect against searches and seizures that prove to have been unwarranted, but only against searches and seizures that were <i>unreasonable</i>). In such a situation, the qualified-immunity defense should not even be addressed because its necessary antecedent &#8212; the presence of a viable claim for the invasion of a federal right &#8212; is lacking. Our recent qualified-immunity cases obscure this point by suggesting that reasonable factual errors, like reasonable legal errors, are grist for the qualified-immunity mill, and are not to be analyzed as part of the threshold federal-right issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our recent opinion in <i>Wilson</i> is instructive, consistent as it is with our other recent precedent. In that case, a woman who was mistakenly arrested pursuant to a sting operation designed to capture a large number of persons with outstanding arrest warrants sued the arresting officer for money damages, claiming that he violated her Fourth Amendment rights. <i>See</i> 421 F.3d at 47. In conducting our three-part qualified immunity analysis, we determined that, under the facts alleged, the arresting officers indeed had violated the plaintiff's right to be free from an erroneous arrest, and that it should have been clear to the arresting officer, under prevailing clearly established law, that his conduct was unlawful. <i>See id.</i> at 54-57. In other words, we answered our first two qualified-immunity questions in the affirmative. <i>See id.</i> Nonetheless, we concluded that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity. <i>See id.</i> at 57-59. We reasoned that the officer reasonably, although mistakenly, believed that there was an outstanding warrant for the plaintiff's arrest, and that he acted reasonably in promptly ordering the plaintiff's release upon learning of the error. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant in <i>Wilson</i> was not simply entitled to avoid damages liability because of the qualified-immunity doctrine; he was entitled to a merits dismissal of the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claim because his conduct was reasonable under the circumstances. <i>See Rodriguez,</i> 497 U.S. at 183-89, 110 S.Ct. 2793. In other words, he did not violate the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights. <i>See id.</i> The factual analysis performed at step three should have been performed at step one, and should have yielded the conclusion that there was no constitutional violation. Regrettable as incidents of mistaken arrest such as this may be, American citizens simply do not have a free-standing Fourth Amendment right not to be arrested erroneously. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 184, 110 S.Ct. 2793 (\"If a magistrate, based upon seemingly reliable but factually inaccurate information, issues a warrant for the search of a house in which the sought-after felon is not present, has never been present, and was never likely to have been present, the owner of that house suffers one of the inconveniences we all expose ourselves to as the cost of living in a safe society; he does not suffer a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\"). The right protects only against <i>unreasonable</i> arrests &#8212; i.e., unreasonable mistakes about the perceived facts giving rise to the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would not write separately if my concern were merely theoretical. Although the results in <i>Wilson</i> and this case remain the same whether we hold that there has been no invasion of a right or that there has been a reasonable mistake of fact made in connection with the invasion of the right, that is so only because the plaintiff in each case sought only monetary damages, and not declaratory or injunctive relief (against which the qualified-immunity doctrine is not a shield, <i>see Torres Rivera v. Calderon Serra,</i> 412 F.3d 205, 212 (1st Cir.2005)). We should not hold or imply, as we are invited to do in our tripartite elaboration of the qualified-immunity analysis, that a government official violates the Constitution when she makes a reasonable but mistaken factual judgment that a particular situation calls for a forceful intervention by her office. The traditional two-step qualified immunity analysis, still employed by the Supreme Court, does not permit this error, for it channels consideration of issues of reasonable mistakes of fact into the initial inquiry: whether there has been an invasion of a federal right. <i>See Brosseau,</i> 543 U.S. at 195, 125 S.Ct. 596.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We should return to the two-step inquiry employed by the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The district court granted the defendants (Tibbetts, Tibbetts' supervisor Sheriff Glenn Ross, and the Department itself) summary judgment on Higgins' claims that defendants deprived him of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and certain other rights secured him under Maine common law. The court also granted defendants judgment on the pleadings on Higgins' claim under Maine's unlawful eviction statute, 14 M.R.S.A. &#167; 6014. Higgins brings this appeal to challenge these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incident giving rise to this case occurred on May 16, 2002. The undisputed facts and the disputed facts taken in a light favorable to Higgins, <i>see, e.g., APG, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202050\"><a href=\"/opinion/202050/apg-inc-v-mci/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 297 (1st Cir.2006), are that Higgins awoke that morning in an apartment over a garage built on a lot within the trailer park. While he was drinking coffee in his robe, Higgins heard someone closing a door below, in the garage. Higgins opened the door to the apartment and saw his sister Irene standing outside near the base of a ladder that he had used to access the apartment. (Apparently, there previously was a deck with steps leading up to the apartment, but the deck and steps had been removed). Higgins asked Irene what she was doing in his garage. Irene retorted that Higgins had no right to be there and that she was going to call the sheriff. But before she could do so, Higgins called the sheriff's department and asked for assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There had been a long-running dispute between Higgins and his family over Higgins' rights vis-&#224;-vis the building and certain of its contents. Those members of Higgins' family who have submitted evidence in this case deny that Higgins had any right to be in the building on the day of the incident. Higgins responds that, at the very least, he had a tenancy interest in the building. He alleges that he and his father, Leo, formed a partnership and purchased the trailer park in 1972, agreeing at the time that all members of the Higgins family would have a lifetime right to reside there. Higgins says that he paid for and built the apartment and garage, completing construction in 1981, and that he \"resided\" in the building from 1981 to the day of the incident. Higgins admits to having spent significant periods of time out of state beginning in the late 1990s, and to having signed his partnership interest over to his father during his divorce proceedings in 1989, with the as-yet unrealized expectation that his father would deed the interest back to him after the proceedings concluded. But he maintains that his \"long-term possession and occupancy of the building, at a minimum, give rise to a tenancy interest, even in the absence of agreement with his father as to its terms.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deputy Tibbetts was dispatched to the trailer park in response to Higgins' call. Upon arriving, Tibbetts encountered what Higgins described in his deposition as a \"screaming contest\" involving, at the very least, himself and his sisters Irene and Cynthia, as well as Cynthia's husband David Prescott. Higgins informed Tibbetts that he and his father were engaged in an ongoing disagreement over ownership of the property and his right to reside there. Leo showed up a short time later with a copy of the deed, which he showed to Tibbetts, telling him that he previously had notified Higgins to stay off the property. Leo asked Tibbetts to bar Higgins from the property. Higgins informed Tibbetts that the police had more than once been summoned to mediate the issue but always had declined to involve themselves, telling Higgins and Leo that it was a \"civil dispute and that [they] would not get involved.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Tibbetts issued Higgins the no-trespass order that is the subject of this lawsuit and gave him several minutes to collect some personal belongings from the apartment. Several facts, in addition to Leo's apparent ownership of the building, led Tibbetts to believe that Higgins was a trespasser and was not lawfully entitled to occupy the apartment: the truck Higgins had parked outside the building had Connecticut license plates; there were no stairs, only a ladder, to access the building's apartment; and Tibbetts had driven past the building on \"many, many\" prior occasions and it always had appeared vacant &#8212; i.e., there never were any lights on, there never were any vehicles parked outside, and there was \"lots of junk in the dooryard that was always in the same place.\" (The word \"dooryard,\" as used colloquially in northern New England and eastern Canada, typically refers to the area outside the most commonly used entrance to a residence, and often includes the driveway. <i>See</i> Walt Whitman, <i>When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd</i> (1865-66)). Tibbetts told Higgins that he would be arrested if he did not leave or if he returned to the property. Higgins says that he asked Tibbetts to look in the apartment and to take note of the personal property that he would be leaving behind, but Tibbetts refused. Higgins says that, after he complied with Tibbetts' order and departed, a great deal of his personal property disappeared from the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Higgins filed this action. He asserted three federal civil rights claims: that his \"eviction\" constituted (1) a \"meaningful interference with ... [his] possessory interests\" in his residence, and thus an unlawful seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment, <i>see Soldal v. Cook County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112795\"><a href=\"/opinion/112795/soldal-v-cook-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112795\"><a href=\"/opinion/112795/soldal-v-cook-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span> (1972); and (3) a violation of his right to have had Tibbetts properly trained and supervised by the other defendants, <i>see, e.g., City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111441\"><a href=\"/opinion/111441/oklahoma-city-v-tuttle/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span>, 813-24, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111441\"><a href=\"/opinion/111441/oklahoma-city-v-tuttle/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span> (1985). He also asserted state law claims for conversion of his personal property and the infliction of emotional distress. Finally, as noted at the outset, Higgins pressed a claim under Maine's unlawful eviction statute, 14 M.R.S.A. &#167; 6014.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims except the claim for wrongful eviction, on which they moved for judgment on the pleadings. The matter was referred to a magistrate judge, who issued a thorough and carefully reasoned report recommending that the defendants' motions be granted. The magistrate judge expressed considerable doubt that a viable constitutional claim was stated under either the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendments, but concluded that, in any event, the defendants should be entitled to qualified immunity from the claims because they had not violated Higgins' \"clearly established\" rights. <i>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 818, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span> (1987). The magistrate judge further concluded that the defendants should be statutorily immune from liability on Higgins' conversion and infliction of emotional distress claims, Tibbetts because he was exercising a discretionary function when he issued the no-trespass order and did not act in bad faith, <i>see</i> 14 M.R.S.A. &#167; 8111(1)(c) &amp; (E), and the remaining defendants because of absolute governmental-entity immunity, <i>see</i> 14 M.R.S.A. &#167; 8103(1). Finally, the magistrate judge rejected Higgins' claim for unlawful eviction because, <i>inter alia,</i> the statute only authorizes a cause of action against a \"landlord,\" and not against his agent. The district court accepted the magistrate judge's recommended rulings insofar as they were premised on the reasoning just summarized, and Higgins brought this appeal to challenge these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court opinions more than adequately explain why the defendants are entitled to summary judgment in this case, so we are content to affirm largely on the basis of those opinions. <i>See, e.g., Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Devel. Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201001\"><a href=\"/opinion/201001/vargas-ruiz-v-golden-arch/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.2004). We add only a few remarks about Higgins' constitutional claims against Tibbetts. Higgins premises these claims on the threshold assertion that the untrained Tibbetts subjected him to an unlawful eviction. We do not doubt that, in certain circumstances, a police officer's participation in an unlawful eviction can implicate a tenant's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and give rise to liability under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. <i>Cf. Soldal,</i> 506 U.S. at 61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112795\"><a href=\"/opinion/112795/soldal-v-cook-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1983</span></a></span>. At least arguably, then, Higgins has adduced enough evidence to meet the first two parts of this circuit's tripartite qualified-immunity inquiry. <i>See, e.g., Wilson v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201791\"><a href=\"/opinion/201791/wilson-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2005) (summarizing the first two questions the court should ask as: \"(1) whether the claimant has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right; [and] (2) whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged action or inaction...\"); <i>Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201386\"><a href=\"/opinion/201386/riverdale-mills-corp-v-pimpare/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 60-61 (1st Cir.2004) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the viability of Higgins' constitutional claims against Tibbetts depends on whether, to the extent that what happened properly can be found to have been an \"eviction\" at all, Tibbetts could be found to have known that it was an unlawful eviction. Such a finding is necessary if Higgins is to clear the final hurdle presented by the qualified-immunity defense Higgins has interposed. <i>See Wilson,</i> 421 F.3d at 52 (observing that, at the third prong of this circuit's qualified-immunity inquiry, the plaintiff must establish that \"an objectively reasonable official would have believed that the action taken violated [the previously identified] clearly established right\"); <i>see also Riverdale Mills,</i> 392 F.3d at 61 (\"It is not always evident at the time an official takes an action that a clearly established right is involved. For example, the factual situation might be ambiguous or the application of the legal standard to the precise facts at issue might be difficult; in either case the officer's action may be objectively reasonable and she may be entitled to qualified immunity.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One could not reasonably find in Higgins' favor on this issue. As set forth above, Tibbetts encountered a volatile and potentially dangerous situation &#8212; described by Higgins himself as a \"screaming contest\" &#8212; when he arrived at the trailer park. The subject of the dispute was a man who, so far as Tibbetts could tell, was driving a truck with out-of-state license plates, and who claimed a right to occupy a building with which Tibbetts was familiar and which Tibbetts reasonably thought, based on his prior knowledge of the building and the circumstantial evidence at the scene, to have been long unoccupied. The man provided no written lease or other documentation to support his claimed occupancy right, but only made a conclusory verbal claim of entitlement. Opposing this man were several members of his own family, all of whom disputed his claimed entitlement and informed Tibbetts that he previously had been told to stay away, and one of whom &#8212; the man's father &#8212; produced a deed which substantiated the father's claim of ownership of the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Qualified immunity protects `all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.'\" <i>Wilson,</i> 421 F.3d at 58 (quoting <i>Malley v. Briggs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 341, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span> (1986)). In these circumstances, Tibbetts' decision to disbelieve Higgins and to defuse the situation by asking him to leave under threat of citation for trespass was neither plainly incompetent nor involved a deliberate violation of the law. Given the paucity of evidence that Higgins was entitled to occupy the property and the abundance of evidence pointing the other way, Higgins' argument essentially invites us to hold, as a matter of constitutional law, that a police officer, summoned to mediate a volatile dispute involving an alleged trespasser, is obliged to leave the situation unresolved simply because the trespasser represents himself to be entitled to be there. To state the proposition is to expose its foolishness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HOWARD, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The opinion of the court applies the three-part qualified immunity analysis called for in our recent cases and concludes that Tibbetts is entitled to qualified immunity at prong three. <i>See, e.g., Wilson v.

(2) If so, was the right so clearly established at the time of the alleged violation that a reasonable official would have been on notice that the conduct was unconstitutional? (3) If so, would a reasonable official have understood that the conduct violated the clearly established right at issue? <i>E.g., Wilson,</i> 421 F.3d at 52; <i>but see Riverdale Mills,</i> 392 F.3d at 61 n. 5 (acknowledging that we sometimes still follow a two-step process). A negative answer to question one means that there has been no violation of a federal right; a negative answer to question two or three gives rise to qualified immunity insofar as plaintiff is seeking money damages from the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and third questions we ask derive from an elaboration of the two-step process described in the Supreme Court's qualified-immunity cases. The two-step test directs courts evaluating assertions of qualified immunity to ask: (1) Do the specific case facts alleged describe a violation of a federal right? (2) If so, should the defendant, who is charged with knowledge of clearly established law, have known that the conduct in question violated that right? <i>See Saucier v. Katz,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span>, 201-02, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The issue of mistaken <i>factual</i> (as opposed to legal) judgments frequently arises in civil rights actions alleging Fourth Amendment violations, where the constitutionality of an official's conduct turns not on post hoc judgments about whether the search or seizure was justified or properly calibrated, but on whether it was <i>reasonable</i> under the tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving circumstances that the official confronted. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 204-05, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></span> (discussing <i>Graham v. Connor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span> (1989)). But this is not exclusively a Fourth Amendment problem; the issue of mistaken factual judgments arises in other constitutional settings as well. <i>See, e.g., Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dept.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200266\"><a href=\"/opinion/200266/dirrane-v-brookline-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 69-70 (1st Cir.2002) (applying a fact-based balancing test to determine the viability of claimed First Amendment violation in the case of a government whistleblower disciplined for \"disruptive speech\"); <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 90-92 (applying a fact-based balancing test to determine the viability of alleged infringements of the right to \"familial integrity,\" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, in a child-custody dispute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, officials should not be made to pay damages for reasonable but mistaken factual judgments made in circumstances such as these. But the reason they should not be held liable is that an official who acts reasonably vis-&#224;-vis the plaintiff has not violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights &#8212; even if the invasion in question proves unwarranted with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. <i>See Illinois v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112475\"><a href=\"/opinion/112475/illinois-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span>, 183-89, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112475\"><a href=\"/opinion/112475/illinois-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span> (1990) (emphasizing that the Fourth Amendment does not protect against searches and seizures that prove to have been unwarranted, but only against searches and seizures that were <i>unreasonable</i>). In such a situation, the qualified-immunity defense should not even be addressed because its necessary antecedent &#8212; the presence of a viable claim for the invasion of a federal right &#8212; is lacking. Our recent qualified-immunity cases obscure this point by suggesting that reasonable factual errors, like reasonable legal errors, are grist for the qualified-immunity mill, and are not to be analyzed as part of the threshold federal-right issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our recent opinion in <i>Wilson</i> is instructive, consistent as it is with our other recent precedent. In that case, a woman who was mistakenly arrested pursuant to a sting operation designed to capture a large number of persons with outstanding arrest warrants sued the arresting officer for money damages, claiming that he violated her Fourth Amendment rights. <i>See</i> 421 F.3d at 47. In conducting our three-part qualified immunity analysis, we determined that, under the facts alleged, the arresting officers indeed had violated the plaintiff's right to be free from an erroneous arrest, and that it should have been clear to the arresting officer, under prevailing clearly established law, that his conduct was unlawful. <i>See id.</i> at 54-57. In other words, we answered our first two qualified-immunity questions in the affirmative. <i>See id.</i> Nonetheless, we concluded that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity. <i>See id.</i> at 57-59. We reasoned that the officer reasonably, although mistakenly, believed that there was an outstanding warrant for the plaintiff's arrest, and that he acted reasonably in promptly ordering the plaintiff's release upon learning of the error. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant in <i>Wilson</i> was not simply entitled to avoid damages liability because of the qualified-immunity doctrine; he was entitled to a merits dismissal of the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claim because his conduct was reasonable under the circumstances. <i>See Rodriguez,</i> 497 U.S. at 183-89, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112475\"><a href=\"/opinion/112475/illinois-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2793</span></a></span>. In other words, he did not violate the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights. <i>See id.</i> The factual analysis performed at step three should have been performed at step one, and should have yielded the conclusion that there was no constitutional violation. Regrettable as incidents of mistaken arrest such as this may be, American citizens simply do not have a free-standing Fourth Amendment right not to be arrested erroneously. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 184, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112475\"><a href=\"/opinion/112475/illinois-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2793</span></a></span> (\"If a magistrate, based upon seemingly reliable but factually inaccurate information, issues a warrant for the search of a house in which the sought-after felon is not present, has never been present, and was never likely to have been present, the owner of that house suffers one of the inconveniences we all expose ourselves to as the cost of living in a safe society; he does not suffer a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\"). The right protects only against <i>unreasonable</i> arrests &#8212; i.e., unreasonable mistakes about the perceived facts giving rise to the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would not write separately if my concern were merely theoretical. Although the results in <i>Wilson</i> and this case remain the same whether we hold that there has been no invasion of a right or that there has been a reasonable mistake of fact made in connection with the invasion of the right, that is so only because the plaintiff in each case sought only monetary damages, and not declaratory or injunctive relief (against which the qualified-immunity doctrine is not a shield, <i>see Torres Rivera v. Calderon Serra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201642\"><a href=\"/opinion/201642/torres-rivera-v-calderon-serra/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 212 (1st Cir.2005)). We should not hold or imply, as we are invited to do in our tripartite elaboration of the qualified-immunity analysis, that a government official violates the Constitution when she makes a reasonable but mistaken factual judgment that a particular situation calls for a forceful intervention by her office. The traditional two-step qualified immunity analysis, still employed by the Supreme Court, does not permit this error, for it channels consideration of issues of reasonable mistakes of fact into the initial inquiry: whether there has been an invasion of a federal right. <i>See Brosseau,</i> 543 U.S. at 195, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137736\"><a href=\"/opinion/137736/brosseau-v-haugen/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We should return to the two-step inquiry employed by the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
