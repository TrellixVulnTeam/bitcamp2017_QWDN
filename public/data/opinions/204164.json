Grimes, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, were on brief for respondent.\n\n\n                             February 3, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f           SOUTER,    Associate         Justice.     Wilmer     Perez-Valenzuela\n\nentered the United States illegally and has been ordered removed to\n\nhis country of citizenship, Guatemala.             He petitions for review of\n\nan order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the\n\nimmigration judge’s decision to deny his request for withholding of\n\nremoval and denying his motion before the BIA to remand to the\n\nimmigration judge for presentation of further evidence.                    We deny\n\nthe petition for review.\n\n           The immigration judge found Perez-Valenzuela’s testimony\n\ncredible, to the effect that he came to the United States to escape\n\nthe anarchic conditions in Guatemala, which tolerated gangs of\n\nthugs   threatening       death    to    extort    protection     payments     from\n\nindividuals known to have money or means of getting it.                    From a\n\ntime before he entered this country, a number of Perez-Valenzuela’s\n\nrelatives have been known to be working in the United States, with\n\nthe   result   that   his    own   Guatemalan      family   members     have   been\n\nthreatened this way.\n\n           The    judge     denied      Perez-Valenzuela’s      application     for\n\nasylum as a matter of law, finding its untimeliness unexcused by\n\neither changed or extraordinary circumstances, and also denied his\n\napplication    for    withholding        of    removal.     The   BIA   affirmed,\n\nspecifically     agreeing    with       the   immigration   judge   that     Perez-\n\nValenzuela had failed to show that he was targeted on account of a\n\nprotected ground for withholding of removal.                    The BIA further\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fdenied Perez-Valenzuela’s motion to remand for further proceedings\n\nbefore the judge.          Perez-Valenzuela had offered evidence that,\n\nafter the judge’s decision, a cousin of his in Guatemala was\n\nkidnaped and held for “ransom of $7,000,” an event he reasonably\n\ntakes   as     evidence    that    he   will    himself   be   preyed     upon    if\n\nrepatriated.      The BIA reasoned that this evidence did not address\n\na recognized ground of eligibility for the underlying relief\n\nsought.\n\n             Perez-Valenzuela petitions for review of both aspects of\n\nthe BIA’s order.          He argues that the facts established by his\n\ntestimony are sufficient to demonstrate eligibility for withholding\n\nof removal on the ground of probable persecution based both on\n\npolitical opinion, which he describes as opposition to gangs and\n\ntheir practices, and on membership in a particular social group,\n\nwhich he identifies as “Guatemalan m[e]n . . . perceived by gang\n\nmembers   to    have    disposable      money   available.”        See    8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).                  Perez-Valenzuela further\n\nargues that his new evidence, if received, would also show “changed\n\ncircumstances” justifying consideration of an otherwise untimely\n\nrequest for asylum.        8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D).\n\n             Precedent in this circuit entails a short answer on all\n\nissues.        Oppression     based     on   greed    amounting    to    “economic\n\nterrorism” is “not the functional equivalent of a statutorily\n\nprotected      ground     [for    withholding    of    removal],    and       hostile\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\ftreatment based on economic considerations is not persecution.”\n\nLópez-Castro v. Holder, 577 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2009); see also\n\nLopez de Hincapie v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 219-20 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(upholding the BIA’s determination that threats of extortion were\n\nnot made on account of a statutorily protected ground for asylum).\n\nThe petitioner himself has described the gangs in question as\n\ndriven by money, a characterization that confirms the pertinence of\n\nLópez-Castro and also makes clear that he has no independent claim\n\nof probable persecution on political grounds, an alternative basis\n\nfor withholding of removal.\n\n          Given this rule, enforced by the BIA and accepted as good\n\nlaw in this circuit, Perez-Valenzuela’s argument that the BIA is\n\nimproperly   requiring   that    a    qualifying   persecuted   group   be\n\n“visible” within society goes to a detail that could not affect\n\nresolution of this case.        Neither is there any need to decide\n\nwhether Perez-Valenzuela’s challenge to the BIA’s denial of his\n\nmotion to remand presents a question of law within the court’s\n\nlimited jurisdiction over pretermitted asylum claims. See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1158(a)(3), 1252(a)(2)(D).        The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
