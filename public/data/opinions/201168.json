Clements, with whom Clements & Clements, LLP was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Susan A. Cahoon, with whom Virginia S. Taylor, Michael W.\nRafter, Kilpatrick Stockton, LLP, Steven M. Gordon, Arpiar G.\nSaunders, Jr., and Shaheen & Gordon, P.A. were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n                              August 2, 2004\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam.     Caught-on-Bleu, Inc., manufacturer of a\n\nmicrobrew named Billy Budd Classic American Ale that was briefly\n\ndistributed in New Hampshire during the fall of 1999, appeals\n\nsummary judgments awarded to Anheuser-Busch, Inc., on Anheuser-\n\nBusch's claims for trademark infringement and unfair competition\n\nunder the Lanham Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051-1127, and\n\non Caught-on-Blue's counterclaims under New Hampshire law for\n\ntortious   interference    with    contractual      rights     and   unfair\n\ncompetition. The rationale underlying the challenged judgments was\n\nexplained in two meticulously reasoned opinions that, together,\n\nspanned nearly seventy pages.     See Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Caught-\n\non-Bleu, Inc., 288 F. Supp. 2d 105 (D.N.H. 2003) (order on motion\n\nfor summary judgment on Lanham Act claims); Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v.\n\nCaught-on-Bleu, Inc., 2003 WL 21715330 (D.N.H. July 22, 2003)\n\n(order on motion for summary judgment on counterclaims under New\n\nHampshire law).\n\n           Caught-on-Bleu's appellate briefs fail to address the\n\nmost important aspects of the district court's analysis.                  In\n\nchallenging the court's denial of its de facto (and defective) Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(f) motion, Caught-on-Bleu makes no developed argument\n\nthat one ground for the court's ruling -- that Caught-on-Bleu\n\nfailed to conduct its discovery diligently, see 2003 WL 21715330 at\n\n**2-3 --   constituted    an   abuse   of   discretion.      Similarly,   in\n\nchallenging the court's award of summary judgment on its tortious\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\finterference and unfair competition claims, Caught-on-Bleu does not\n\nexplain how the court erred in concluding that there was no genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to whether Anheuser-Busch knew of the\n\nexistence of Caught-on-Blue at the relevant point in time, id. at\n\n**3-4 (rejecting tortious interference claim because claim, as\n\npleaded, required such knowledge and explaining why the record\n\nfailed to establish such knowledge), or as to whether Caught-on-\n\nBleu     pursued         distribution    agreements     with     Anheuser-Busch\n\ndistributors, id. at **6-7 (rejecting unfair competition claim\n\nbecause claim, as pleaded, required proof that Caught-on-Bleu\n\nsought      to    distribute    Billy    Budd   Ale   through    Anheuser-Busch\n\ndistributors and explaining why the record failed to establish such\n\nevidence).        Finally, in challenging the court's award of summary\n\njudgment on Anheuser-Busch's Lanham Act claims, Caught-on-Blue does\n\nnot explain how the court erred in finding unpersuasive Caught-on-\n\nBleu's expert's objections to the crucial survey evidence Anheuser-\n\nBusch submitted to show actual consumer confusion in support of its\n\nLanham Act claim, see 288 F. Supp. 2d at 122-23, or in deeming its\n\nmark similar in appearance to Anheuser-Busch's marks, see id. at\n\n115-16.      It is not enough simply to repeat that the court did not\n\ngive it the benefit of the doubt as it is required to do under Fed.\n\nR.   Civ.    P.    56.     Elaboration    and   specificity     is   needed   when\n\nchallenging a court's carefully explained final judgments.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f          Under   the   circumstances,    we    think   that   the     most\n\nappropriate course of action is to affirm the judgments in question\n\nfor substantially the reasons set forth in the district court's\n\nopinions. See, e.g., Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Development, Inc.,\n\n368 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"[W]hen a trial court accurately\n\nsizes up a case, applies the law faultlessly to the discerned\n\nfacts, decides the matter and articulates a convincing rationale\n\nfor the decision, there is no need for a reviewing court to wax\n\nlongiloquent.\")   (collecting   cases).    We    do   not   discount    the\n\npossibility that aspects of the district court's reasoning might\n\nfairly be regarded as debatable; however, Caught-on-Blue has not\n\npresented us with developed arguments on the points in question,\n\nand we are not inclined to take them up on our own.            See United\n\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).          In any event,\n\nwe have reviewed the record with care and are satisfied that, in\n\nthe end, the judgments entered were correct.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
