In 1995, in order to address the\n\nproblem of the large number of drivers in the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico without vehicle liability insurance, the commonwealth\n\nenacted the Compulsory Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Act, Law\n\n253 (\"Law 253\"), codified at 26 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 8051 et seq.\n\n          This federal antitrust suit challenged certain conduct of\n\nprivate insurers and the new state-created entity under Law 253,\n\nthe Joint Underwriting Association (\"JUA\"), in the compulsory\n\ninsurance program.    The suit was dismissed at the pleadings stage\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).          The plaintiffs, who purport to\n\nrepresent a class of harmed consumers, appeal.\n\n          In   sum,   the   plaintiffs    allege   that   the   defendants,\n\nprivate insurers and the JUA, have agreed to and created a monopoly\n\nin the JUA as to all forms of low-cost compulsory insurance and\n\nhave boycotted and coerced at least one broker in order to maintain\n\nthat monopoly.   The private insurers and the JUA argue that this\n\nmonopoly is a result required by the state law.           That is untrue.\n\nThe Puerto Rico statute contemplates (at least as to non-high-risk\n\npolicies) competition, but then, oddly, creates incentives for\n\ndefendants to create just such a monopoly as alleged.            The claims\n\nbefore us are a different matter: a federal antitrust suit raises\n\ndifferent issues than issues of compliance with local statutes. As\n\nto one claim only, we reverse the dismissal and remand; we affirm\n\nthe dismissal of all other claims.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f                                       I.\n\n           We describe the statutory scheme.             Before the enactment\n\nof Law 253, uninsured drivers caused over $110 million in damages\n\nto other vehicles each year in Puerto Rico, and it was estimated\n\nthat only 25 percent to 30 percent of the vehicles in Puerto Rico\n\nwere covered under some type of liability insurance.\n\n           Law   253   created    a    compulsory    automobile     liability\n\ninsurance system, which, beginning in 1998, provides each insured\n\nvehicle owner with $3000 of coverage for damages caused to third\n\nparties per accident in exchange for a uniform premium, initially\n\nset at $99 for each private passenger vehicle and $148 for each\n\ncommercial vehicle.     26 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 8052(j), 8056(a).               All\n\n\"private insurers,\" defined as insurers with more than 1 percent of\n\nthe commonwealth's total volume of vehicle liability premiums, id.\n\n§ 8052(b), are required to offer the compulsory liability insurance\n\nin two ways: both as private insurers to a defined class of drivers\n\nand as members of the JUA, to which they must belong.                    Id. §§\n\n8053(d), 8054(a), 8055(a).        Law 253 allows private insurers to\n\nreject certain applicants for the compulsory insurance pursuant to\n\nregulations promulgated by the Insurance Commissioner.                    Id. §\n\n8054(b).   The criteria for rejection are defined by the Insurance\n\nCommissioner's   Puerto   Rican       Insurance   Rule    LXX   (\"Rule    LXX\"),\n\npromulgated in Regulation No. 6254 in December of 2000.                  Most of\n\nthe criteria in Rule LXX for permissible rejections identify\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fapplicants who are bad drivers or otherwise of high risk.1              See\n\nRule LXX, Art. 8.\n\n           The JUA itself provides compulsory liability insurance to\n\nall   drivers,2   including   those    high-risk   drivers   whom   private\n\ninsurers are not required to insure.        26 P.R. Laws Ann. § 8055(b).\n\nVehicle owners may opt out of the compulsory liability insurance\n\nscheme    by   purchasing     traditional   liability    insurance     with\n\ncomparable or better coverage.          See id. § 8061; Rule LXX, Art.\n\n\n      1\n      Rule LXX allows private insurers to reject applicants when\n(1) the motor vehicle is used as a public vehicle; (2) the motor\nvehicle is a racing vehicle or super rapid; (3) the owner or main\ndriver of the motor vehicle has accumulated five or more points for\nviolations of the Vehicle and Traffic Act of Puerto Rico, during\nthe three years prior to the date of the application for the\ncompulsory liability insurance; (4) the owner or main driver of the\nmotor vehicle has been convicted of driving a motor vehicle under\nthe influence of alcohol or drugs, or of participating in any type\nof drag racing or races on public roads; (5) the license of the\nowner or main driver of the vehicle has been revoked or suspended\nduring the year prior to the effective date when the compulsory\nliability insurance is requested; (6) the motor vehicle is not\ninsurable according to the private insurer's written criteria for\nunderwriting traditional insurance policies; (7) the owner of the\nvehicle has not requested the insurance; and (8) the application\nform as adopted by the Insurance Commissioner was not properly\nfilled out. Rule LXX, Art. 8.\n      2\n      A vehicle owner must pay the premium for the compulsory\nliability insurance to the Secretary of the Treasury at the time he\nacquires or renews the vehicle's license. 26 P.R. Laws Ann. §§\n8051, 8053(a). The Secretary then turns over the total amount of\nthe premiums so received to the JUA, which is then responsible for\ndistributing the premiums among its members and itself, as the case\nmay be. Id. § 8055(c); Rule LXX, Art. 19. In fact, under Rule\nLXX, every vehicle for which the requisite compulsory liability\ninsurance premium has been paid is considered to be insured by the\nJUA unless the owner of the vehicle opts out by selecting a private\ninsurer or purchasing a traditional insurance policy. Rule LXX,\nArt. 12(a).\n\n                                      -5-\n\f12(a).     Law 253 appears to require the private insurers also to\n\noffer the policy despite the availability of coverage from the JUA,\n\nsee 26 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 8054(a), 8055(b), and allows private\n\ninsurers to apply for approval to sell the compulsory insurance at\n\nless than the rate set by the commonwealth.                 See id. § 8056(c)\n\n(\"Any    private   insurer   may    submit     for    the   approval   of    the\n\n[Insurance] Commissioner a variation of a uniform percentage to\n\nreduce the uniform compulsory liability insurance premium . . .\n\n.\").     Some legislative history suggests that Law 253 was meant to\n\nencourage competition \"between insurance companies wanting to have\n\na greater number of insured, who will have to extend offers in\n\norder to     attract   them.\"      Certified    translation     of   the    Daily\n\nSessions Record, Senate of Puerto Rico, Monday, October 9, 1995.\n\nAs a result, the statutory scheme contemplates competition in\n\ncompulsory insurance, at least for non-high-risk drivers, between\n\nprivate insurers themselves and between them and the JUA.              It also\n\ncontemplates, but does not mandate, the possibility of a monopoly\n\nin the JUA as to compulsory insurance for high-risk drivers.\n\n             All members of the JUA share in its profits and losses.\n\n26 P.R. Laws Ann. § 8055(e).        To compensate for the fact that the\n\nJUA must insure drivers considered too risky by private insurers,\n\nall the JUA's profits, including those distributed to private\n\ninsurers, are exempt from income taxes.              Id. § 8055(j).    Through\n\nthe JUA, the risk of insuring these high-risk drivers is thus\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fspread among all the private insurers.               The profits distributed to\n\nthe JUA members (the private insurers) also encompass the profits\n\nfrom the sale of non-high-risk policies insured by the JUA.\n\n              Though created by law, the JUA is \"private in nature, for\n\nprofit, and . . . subject to the provisions of the [Insurance] Code\n\napplicable to insurers.\"           Rule LXX, Art. 2(c).          The JUA is under\n\nsome direction by the commonwealth.             The Insurance Commissioner is\n\ndirected to establish the manner of distribution of the total\n\namount of premiums received by the JUA, 26 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n\n8055(c); Rule LXX, Art. 20(e)(3), and the structure and operation\n\nof the JUA, and its direction by a board of directors, so that the\n\nJUA may       accomplish   its    goals    in   a   \"cost-effective,     fair      and\n\nnondiscriminatory\" manner.          26 P.R. Laws Ann. § 8055(f).            The plan\n\nof   operations     may    be   amended    only     with   the   approval    of    the\n\nInsurance Commissioner.           Rule LXX, Art. 20(c)(1)(xv).\n\n              On the other hand, the Insurance Commissioner is not made\n\na    member    of   the   board    of   directors     of   the   JUA,   id.,      Art.\n\n20(c)(1)(iii), and does not appear to have active supervision over\n\nthe day-to-day affairs of the JUA.              Four of the five directors on\n\nthe JUA's board of directors are elected by the members of the JUA,\n\nwhile the fifth director is the officer in charge of the JUA.                      Id.\n\nNone of these directors are defined as a state official.                    The JUA\n\nis not an agency of the commonwealth.                It has \"general corporate\n\npowers,\" such as the power to sue and be sued, to enter into\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fcontracts, to hold and use property, etc.               See Rule LXX, Art.\n\n20(a); 26 P.R. Laws Ann. § 2905.\n\n             For both private insurers and the JUA, the commonwealth,\n\nthrough    the     Insurance   Commissioner,    sets    the   terms   of    the\n\ncompulsory policy itself, the premium rate, and the amount of\n\ncoverage.     The Puerto Rico Mandatory Liability Insurance Uniform\n\nPolicy, the policy defining the terms of the compulsory liability\n\ninsurance, is set forth in the Insurance Commissioner's rules.\n\nRule LXX, Art. 22.        This policy is \"the sole contract between [the\n\ninsured]    and    [the   JUA].\"    The    policy    does   not   contain   any\n\nspecification for the type of repair parts that may be used or\n\nprovisions governing repair practices.\n\n             The   Insurance    Commissioner   has     established,    through\n\nregulation, a uniform initial liability determination system to\n\nfacilitate the investigation, adjustment, and resolution of claims\n\narising under the compulsory liability insurance scheme.              See P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. § 8057; Puerto Rico Insurance Rule LXXI (\"Rule LXXI\").\n\nRule LXXI sets out portions of the claims making process, including\n\nthe use of diagrams, which are made part of the regulation, to\n\nallocate fault for accidents.        Rule LXXI, Arts. 2, 6, 7.        However,\n\nthere is nothing in Rule LXXI concerning the insurers' auto repair\n\narrangements or practices; nor does the Rule govern all claims\n\npractices.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f            A    few   points   bear   emphasis.    First,   the   statute,\n\napparently unusually,3 contemplates competition with respect to at\n\nleast the non-high-risk drivers between the private insurers and\n\nalso between the private insurers and the JUA. Second, the statute\n\nprovides a means for insurers who are in competition to seek to\n\nsell the compulsory insurance at a lower price than the \"uniform\n\npremium.\"       26 P.R. Laws Ann. § 8056(c).       Third, the supervision\n\nover the JUA does not cover at least some of the complained-of\n\nactivities.      For example, the Insurance Commissioner, by statute,\n\nhas considerable supervision over the operating plan and the method\n\nof premium distribution, id. §§ 8055, 8056; by contrast, there\n\nappears to be little supervision of the JUA's specific business\n\ndecisions (such as how it minimizes its costs in repairs and claims\n\nadjustment).\n\n                                       II.\n\n            The plaintiff motor vehicle owners, as consumers of the\n\ncompulsory insurance, brought a putative class action against\n\n\n\n     3\n      Our own survey found no other comparable compulsory insurance\nscheme which contemplates competition of like kind. Cf., e.g.,\nAla. Code § 32-7-35 (granting Commissioner of Insurance authority\nto set up assigned risk plans to apportion drivers who are unable\nto obtain insurance through the regular market \"equitably\" among\nall insurers); Alaska Stat. § 28.20.580 (same); Fla. Stat. Ann. §\n627.351(1) (same); Ga. Code Ann § 40-9-100 (same); see also Ga.\nComp. R. & Regs. r. 120-2-14-.09 (insureds in assigned risk plan\nare assigned to insurers); Weaver v. Champion Ins. Co., 567 So.2d\n380, 382 (Ala. Civ. App. 1990) (assignment of insureds to insurers\nin assigned risk plan is semi-random).\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\feleven private insurers and the JUA, alleging that the defendants\n\nviolated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., the Clayton Act,\n\n15 U.S.C. § 12 et seq., and also Puerto Rico antitrust laws.4                The\n\nplaintiffs allege that the private companies, qua companies, have\n\nagreed not to sell the compulsory insurance; this, in turn, forces\n\ncustomers to buy from the JUA and puts the JUA in a monopoly\n\nposition.       The plaintiffs allege that the insurance companies\n\nchoose not to compete with the JUA at least in part because of the\n\ntax benefits that non-competition creates.            The JUA is tax-exempt;\n\nits monopoly over the compulsory liability insurance policies\n\nallows all the profits from the premiums, including those from non-\n\nhigh-risk     drivers,   to   accrue    tax   free   to   the   JUA   for   later\n\ndistribution to the member insurance companies.                   Further, by\n\ndealing only through the JUA, the private insurers lower their own\n\ncosts and inflate their profit by not providing paper copies of\n\npolicies to insureds and by not utilizing the services of brokers.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that Puerto Rico law requires both that\n\npolicies be provided and that brokers be used.              26 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§§ 329, 1123.      The plaintiffs admit that policies are available\n\nboth online and at licensing offices.            But they argue that these\n\nomissions in services reduce the services provided to the insureds.\n\nThe omissions also, it may be inferred, harm consumers in another\n\nway.       The plaintiffs allege that the defendants save $4.00 per\n\n       4\n      The text of the relevant allegations are reproduced in the\nAppendix.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fpolicy from not having to issue a paper copy of the policy and\n\nabout 8 percent of the premium per policy for not having to pay a\n\nbroker's commission.         These savings are not passed on to the\n\nconsumers as they would likely be if the companies in fact competed\n\nwith each other and with the JUA.               Indeed, Law 253 contemplated\n\nexactly such a benefit from competition to consumers when it\n\nprovided that private companies could apply to sell such policies\n\nat lower rates.      See 26 P.R. Laws Ann. § 8056(c).            But for the acts\n\nof the defendants in creating a monopoly, the plaintiffs allege\n\nthat the premiums for compulsory liability insurance could have\n\nbeen fixed to be \"at least 12% less than the one established.\"                      The\n\nplaintiffs do not challenge the rate set by the legislature.\n\n            In    addition    to   these   horizontal       agreements        not    to\n\ncompete, the plaintiffs also allege that the private insurers\n\nacting   in      concert   coerced   brokers      to    refrain       from    selling\n\ncompulsory insurance through private companies.                   The plaintiffs\n\nallege that one broker, Casellas and Co. (\"Casellas\"), attempted to\n\npresent around 40,000 applications for compulsory insurance to the\n\ndefendant     insurance      companies     in     the   year     2000,       and    the\n\napplications were all rejected.            The monopoly was evidently not\n\ncomplete    since    the   plaintiffs      also    allege      that    one    of    the\n\ndefendants, Seguros Triple SSS, Inc., did issue 128 compulsory\n\ninsurance policies in 2000 (and paid the broker, Casellas, a\n\ncommission of only 3 percent instead of 8 percent). The plaintiffs\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fallege that the defendants (1) threatened clients of Casellas that\n\nthey should not do business with Casellas if Casellas continued to\n\nattempt to sell compulsory insurance through the private companies\n\nand   (2)   told    other   members      in    the    insurance       community    that\n\nCasellas's attempts to sell compulsory insurance through private\n\ninsurers were       illegal      and   that    people    who    did    business    with\n\nCasellas would go to jail.\n\n            The plaintiffs also allege that since the JUA has a\n\nmonopoly in the compulsory insurance market, the JUA is able to use\n\nburdensome claims procedures and to require the use of the cheapest\n\ncar parts,     or   \"junker      parts,\"      for    repairs,    thus    harming    the\n\nconsumers.     The plaintiffs argue that if the JUA did not have such\n\na monopoly, there would be competition which would produce better\n\noptions as to the quality of repair parts.\n\n            Attempting to come within the boycott/coercion exception\n\nto the insurance business exemption from federal antitrust laws\n\ncontained in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the plaintiffs' complaint\n\nalleges that the acts of the defendants -- (1) agreements among the\n\nprivate insurers and between them and the JUA not to compete with\n\nthe JUA and (2) the threats of harm to Casellas -- constitute a\n\nboycott and coercion and have caused injuries to consumers.\n\n             Taking all inferences in the plaintiffs' favor, the\n\ncomplaint may be read to establish four categories of injuries, at\n\nleast   with   respect      to   non-high-risk        compulsory       insurance,    to\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fconsumers being forced to buy through the JUA's monopoly: (1)\n\nconsumers do not receive copies of written insurance policies; (2)\n\nconsumers do not receive the assistance of brokers; (3) these are\n\ncosts the private insurers would otherwise incur if the private\n\ninsurers offered comparable compulsory coverage as the JUA; private\n\ncompanies thus save on those costs and could then apply to offer\n\nthe compulsory policy at an approved rate which is less than the\n\nrate set by regulators for the JUA; (4) in any event, the JUA's\n\nmonopoly means it can, as it does, (a) require that repairs be made\n\nonly with \"junker\" parts which are inferior to parts which might\n\notherwise be made available in a competitive system, (b) require\n\nconsumers to go through an unfair process of adjustment of claims\n\nbased    on   unreasonable   depreciation   percentages,   (c)   require\n\nconsumers to submit to an unfair system of determining fault with\n\ndiagrams.\n\n              The district court, on report and recommendation from a\n\nmagistrate judge, dismissed the complaint upon Fed R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6) motions from the defendants.5        The district court held\n\nthat there was a lack of antitrust injury and that the action was\n\nprecluded by the filed rate doctrine.          The plaintiffs timely\n\n     5\n      The district court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss\nand entered judgment dismissing \"this case\" with prejudice. In\nlight of the magistrate judge's recommendation, which the district\ncourt adopted in full, that the district court decline to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the Puerto Rico law claims, we\nunderstand the district court to have meant that only the federal\nantitrust law claims are dismissed with prejudice and the\ncommonwealth law claims are dismissed without prejudice.\n\n                                  -13-\n\fappealed.      The defendants present six alternate grounds on appeal\n\nfor affirming the dismissal: (1) there was no antitrust injury so\n\nthe plaintiffs lack standing to sue under the antitrust laws, (2)\n\nthe state action immunity doctrine, (3) the filed rate doctrine,\n\n(4)    the    doctrine    of    primary      jurisdiction,    which    purportedly\n\nrequires referral to the             Puerto Rico Insurance Commissioner, (5)\n\nthe McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption of the business of insurance\n\nfrom federal antitrust liability, and (6) the lack of involvement\n\nof substantial interstate commerce.\n\n                                          III.\n\n              Orders granting motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nare subject to de novo review.               Rodi v. S. New Eng. Sch. Of Law,\n\n389 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2004).                  A reviewing court accepts all\n\nwell-pleaded allegations of the plaintiffs as true and affords all\n\ninferences in the plaintiffs' favor.                Rosenberg v. City of Everett\n\n328 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).                    \"The issue is whether the\n\ncomplaint states a claim under the Sherman Act, assuming the\n\nfactual allegations to be true and indulging to a reasonable degree\n\na    plaintiff   who     has   not     yet   had    an   opportunity   to   conduct\n\ndiscovery.\"      DM Research, Inc. v. Coll. of Am. Pathologists, 170\n\nF.3d 53, 55 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n              Given the Congressional policy of deference to state law\n\nembodied in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, Group Life & Health Ins. Co.\n\nv.    Royal   Drug   Co.,      440    U.S.   205,    220   (1979),    we   think   it\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fappropriate to begin with that statutory defense, and then turn to\n\nthe other defenses.\n\n           Under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we consider whether the\n\ntwo main allegations -- (1) horizontal agreements by the private\n\ninsurers not to compete and not to use broker services; and (2) the\n\nJUA's practice of not permitting repairs using original equipment\n\nmanufacturers'    (\"OEM\")   parts   --     are   within     the   \"business   of\n\ninsurance,\" before we turn to the boycott/coercion exception.                 We\n\nconclude   that   both    allegations    fall      within   the   business    of\n\ninsurance.\n\n           We then turn to the boycott/coercion exception to the\n\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act's business of insurance exemption. We reject\n\nplaintiffs' argument that the horizontal non-competition agreement,\n\neven if it has created a monopoly in the JUA, is a boycott.                    We\n\nreject the defendants' argument that coercion against a brokerage\n\nfirm, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, does not state a claim of\n\nboycott.   We also reject the defendants' argument that the boycott\n\nactivities are nonetheless protected by the state immunity doctrine\n\nunder Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943).\n\n           Because the plaintiffs are consumers and thus usually the\n\npreferred plaintiffs in antitrust claims of this sort, we reject\n\nthe argument that, as to the boycott, the pleadings can determine\n\nthat the     plaintiffs   lack   standing    and    have    not   suffered    any\n\nantitrust injury.    We find that the plaintiffs' boycott claim does\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fnot implicate the filed rate doctrine or the primary jurisdiction\n\ndefenses.     We also reject the defendants' contention that, as to\n\nthe   boycott,    the   substantial    impact   on   interstate   commerce\n\nrequirement of the antitrust laws has not been met.\n\n\n\nThe McCarran-Ferguson Act\n\n            Under section 1 of the Sherman Act, \"[e]very contract,\n\ncombination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in\n\nrestraint of trade or commerce among the several States . . . is .\n\n. . illegal.\"     15 U.S.C. § 1.      \"The usual section 2 [Sherman Act]\n\nclaim requires monopoly or near monopoly power in some market, and\n\na wrongful exclusionary act designed to enhance such power in that\n\nmarket or to achieve an improper advantage in another market.\"\n\nTown of Norwood v. New Eng. Power Co., 202 F.3d 408, 420-21 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n            The   insurance   industry,     however,   receives   special\n\ntreatment under the antitrust laws by virtue of the 1945 McCarran-\n\nFerguson Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1011 et seq.:\n\n            No Act of Congress shall be construed to\n            invalidate, impair, or supersede any law\n            enacted by any State for the purpose of\n            regulating the business of insurance, or which\n            imposes a fee or tax upon such business,\n            unless such Act specifically relates to the\n            business of insurance: Provided, That . . .\n            [the antitrust laws and the FTC Act] shall be\n            applicable to the business of insurance to the\n            extent that such business is not regulated by\n            State law.\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f15 U.S.C. § 1012(b) (emphasis in original).     Thus the McCarran-\n\nFerguson Act exempts the \"business of insurance\" from review under\n\nthe federal antitrust laws to the extent that it is \"regulated by\n\nState law.\"6   Puerto Rico is considered to be a state for purposes\n\nof sections 1 through 3 of the Sherman Act, as amended and codified\n\nat 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-3.   See R.W. Int'l Corp. v. Welch Food, Inc., 13\n\nF.3d 478, 489 (1st Cir. 1994); Cordova & Simonpietri Ins. Agency\n\nInc. v. Chase Manhattan Bank N.A., 649 F.2d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n          The McCarran-Ferguson Act also goes on to carve out, in\n\na separate section, an exception to the \"business of insurance\"\n\nexemption from antitrust liability: \"Nothing contained in this\n\nchapter shall render the said Sherman Act inapplicable to any\n\nagreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, or act of boycott,\n\ncoercion, or intimidation.\"   15 U.S.C. § 1013(b).\n\n          This appeal is largely about the interplay between §\n\n1012(b), the basic McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption from federal\n\nantitrust liability, and § 1013(b), the \"boycott, coercion, or\n\nintimidation\" exception to the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption.\n\nThis court has summarized the interplay as follows, \"The McCarran-\n\nFerguson Act . . . exempts from the antitrust laws all conduct that\n\n\n     6\n      In fact, the term \"business of insurance\" is used twice in\n15 U.S.C. § 1012(b). The first clause \"commits laws 'enacted . .\n. for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance' to the\nStates, while the second clause exempts only 'the business of\ninsurance' itself from the antitrust laws.\" U.S. Dep't of Treasury\nv. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491, 504 (1993).   The scope of the first clause\nis not as \"narrowly circumscribed\" as the second. See id.\n\n                                -17-\n\fis (1) part of the 'business of insurance'; (2) 'regulated by State\n\nlaw';    and   (3)   not   in   the   form   of   'boycott,   coercion,   or\n\nintimidation.'\"      Ocean State Physicians Health Plan, Inc. v. Blue\n\nCross & Blue Shield of R.I., 883 F.2d 1101, 1107 (1st Cir. 1989).7\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      We quickly dispose of two possible objections to application\nof the McCarran-Ferguson exemption here. The literal language of\nthe McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption contained in the first sentence\nin § 1012(b) precludes application of federal statutes which\n\"invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for\nthe purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\" 15 U.S.C. §\n1012(b). An argument could easily be made by the plaintiffs that\ntheir claims are entirely consistent with and not in conflict with\nstate law and so the first proviso is not met and there is no\nMcCarran-Ferguson exemption. Any such argument is foreclosed by\njudicial construction of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The McCarran-\nFerguson Act has generally been construed to cover arguments that\nthe defendants failed to comply with state law, so long as the\nstate law concerns the regulation of the business of insurance. As\nthe treatise by Areeda and Hovenkamp puts it, \"if the state's\ninsurance industry is 'regulated by state law,' then the antitrust\nlaws simply do not apply, notwithstanding that the application of\nantitrust law in the particular case in no way 'invalidate[s],\nimpair[s], or supersede[s]' state law and may even be consistent\nwith it.\" I Areeda and Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, ¶ 219c, at 339\n(2d ed. 2000) (alterations in original). Further, \"[a]lthough state\ninsurance regulation is not invalidated or impaired [by application\nof the Sherman Act], the mere presence of the regulation is\nsufficient to oust the federal antitrust claim.\" Id. at 340.\n     We dispose of another contention. The final sentence of §\n1012(b) provides that federal antitrust law shall nonetheless be\napplicable \"to the extent such business is not regulated by State\nlaw.\" That clause is not helpful to plaintiff on their primary\nclaim of injury -- that the private insurers have agreed not to\noffer private compulsory insurance -- because the state law\nprecisely covers that topic. Indeed, it requires the provision of\nthe compulsory insurance.\n\n                                      -18-\n\fA. The \"Business of Insurance\"\n\n          A key argument by the plaintiffs is that the challenged\n\nacts are not within the \"business of insurance.\"           The McCarran-\n\nFerguson Act exemption encompasses only those state laws which are\n\nenacted \"for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,\n\nor which impose[] a fee or tax upon such business\" and exempts only\n\nthe regulated \"business of insurance\" from the antitrust laws. 15\n\nU.S.C. § 1012(b).\n\n          The Court in Union Labor Life Insurance Co. v. Pireno,\n\n458 U.S. 119, 129 (1982), articulated three criteria to test\n\nwhether a particular practice is the business of insurance exempted\n\nfrom the antitrust laws under the McCarran-Ferguson Act: (1)\n\n\"whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading\n\na policyholder's risk\"; (2) \"whether the practice is an integral\n\npart of   the   policy   relationship   between   the   insurer   and   the\n\ninsured\"; and (3) \"whether the practice is limited to entities\n\nwithin the insurance industry.\"     Id.\n\n\n\n     1. Business of Insurance -- Agreements Not To Sell and Not To\n        Use Brokers\n\n          Under Royal Drug, the McCarran-Ferguson Act protects\n\nwholly intra-industry horizontal arrangements, even as to price, as\n\npart of the business of insurance.        440 U.S. at 221, 224 n.32.\n\n\"[E]ven if the alleged horizontal agreement between the defendant\n\ninsurers [in writing estimates at the same rate] did exist, it\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fwould be immune from antitrust scrutiny under the McCarran-Ferguson\n\nAct.\" Quality Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 660 F.2d 1195,\n\n1201 (7th Cir. 1981).\n\n            The requirements under the \"business of insurance\" clause\n\nare tested not by the mere identity of the defendant as an\n\ninsurance company but rather by whether the activity constitutes\n\nthe business of insurance.        Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California,\n\n509 U.S. 764, 781-82 (1993).           The shorthand version is that the\n\nexemption is for the \"'business of insurance,' not the 'business of\n\ninsurers.'\"      Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 211.\n\n            Horizontal agreements among insurers to fix the price and\n\nto issue policies only through the residual market are within the\n\nbusiness of insurance.        See Slagle v. ITT Hartford, 102 F.3d 494,\n\n497-98 (11th Cir. 1996) (Insurers' collective arrangement to issue\n\nwindstorm   insurance    in    parts     of   Florida   only   through   joint\n\nunderwriting association is within the \"business of insurance.\");\n\nUniforce Temp. Pers., Inc. v. Nat'l Council on Comp. Ins., Inc., 87\n\nF.3d 1296, 1299-1300 (11th Cir. 1996) (Insurers' collective rate-\n\nmaking activities to make workers' compensation insurance available\n\nto   temporary    employee    provider    only   in   the   assigned   risk   or\n\nresidual market is within the \"business of insurance.\").\n\n            It is also clear that the \"business of insurance\" covers\n\nthe allegations concerning the effect on pricing that would occur\n\nif insurers did not use brokers and agents and kept any saved\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fexpenses.    While Royal Drug left open the question of whether the\n\n\"business       of    insurance\"    includes      the   fixing   of   brokers'\n\ncommissions, it read the legislative history of the McCarran-\n\nFerguson Act to suggest that \"'the business of insurance' may have\n\nbeen intended to include dealings within the insurance industry\n\nbetween insurers and agents.\"            440 U.S. at 224 n.32.           Circuit\n\ncourts have explicitly held that the decision to use or not use\n\nagents to market and solicit for policies, the very behavior which\n\nthe plaintiffs attack here, is within the \"business of insurance.\"\n\nSee, e.g., Owens v. Aetna Life & Cas. Co., 654 F.2d 218, 225-26 (3d\n\nCir.    1981)     (holding   that    \"business     of   insurance\"    includes\n\n\"authorizing agents to solicit individual or group policies\").\n\n            Thus, the gravamen of plaintiffs' complaint -- that the\n\ninsurers, among themselves and with the JUA, agreed not to provide\n\ncompulsory insurance as private insurers and not to use brokers to\n\nsell policies -- deals with the business of insurance and is within\n\nthe scope of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n\n\n\n       2. Business of Insurance -- The JUA's Prohibition on the Use\n          of OEM parts.\n\n            The      plaintiffs'    allegations    about   the   JUA's    repair\n\npractices are as follows:\n\n            55.C.(a) The monopoly has allowed the [JUA] to\n            freely dictate the practices relating to the\n            adjustment of claims allowing said [JUA] to\n            establish     unreasonable      depreciation\n            percentages for the replacement of new parts\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f           to be replaced; repairing vehicles with old\n           parts obtained from \"[j]unkers\"; creating a\n           complicated and unfair system of diagrams for\n           the determination of fault to the detriment of\n           the affected member[s] of the class.      This\n           monopoly and absence of competition has\n           resulted in the diminution of the quality of\n           service as the insureds have became [sic]\n           captives of the [JUA] without any possibility\n           of escaping.\n\nAlthough   the   terms   of   the   standard   insurance   policy   of   the\n\ncompulsory insurance program do not specify practices on repair\n\nparts, we understand the allegations to mean that the JUA subjects\n\nconsumers to certain depreciation practices and to a non-OEM parts\n\nrequirement.     It is not clear how this is carried out: conceivably\n\nthe requirements are imposed directly on the policyholders or\n\nperhaps the JUA refers consumers to garages which adhere to these\n\npractices.     The precise mechanism makes no difference.\n\n           This claim is essentially a contract dispute between the\n\npolicyholder and the JUA; the claim is about the \"business of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\finsurance.\"8   See Gilchrist v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 390\n\nF.3d 1327, 1332-34 (11th Cir. 2004).\n\n           More   significantly,    no    serious   antitrust   claim   is\n\npresented. The plaintiffs argue that the JUA is using its monopoly\n\nto increase its profits through using cheap parts without charging\n\ncheaper prices. But a monopolist is entitled to exploit a monopoly\n\nin order to maximize its profits.         See III Areeda and Hovenkamp,\n\nAntitrust Law, ¶ 720a (2d ed. 2000).             \"Monopoly pricing and\n\nmonopoly profits are neither 'exclusionary' acts nor 'abuses' of\n\nmonopoly power under §2 [of the Sherman Act].\"           Id. at 254.     A\n\nmonopolist \"is free to exploit whatever market power it may possess\n\nwhen that exploitation takes the form of charging uncompetitive\n\nprices.\"   Kartell v. Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 749 F.2d 922, 927\n\n(1st Cir. 1984) (holding it was lawful for health insurer to\n\n\n     8\n      We distinguish between this case and the different situation\nwhen an excluded third party provider, say an automobile repair\nshop, challenged an agreement between the JUA and auto shops. No\nsuch claim is made here. See Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 232-33. Even\nwhile horizontal agreements fixing maximum prices have been held to\nbe within the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption, vertical agreements\nbetween the car insurers and the repair shops on maximum prices are\nnot. See Proctor v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 675 F.2d 308,\n312, 336-37 (D.C. Cir. 1982); Quality Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate\nIns. Co., 660 F.2d 1195, 1201-02 (7th Cir. 1981); see also\nBrillhart v. Mut. Med. Ins., Inc., 768 F.2d 196, 199-200 & n.3 (7th\nCir. 1985) (finding health insurer-physician agreements to be\nvertical agreements for the purchase of services and not the\nbusiness of insurance); Liberty Glass Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 607\nF.2d 135, 136-38 (5th Cir. 1979) (finding arrangements between auto\ninsurers and certain car glass installers for the insurers to\ncontract only with those glass installers to install glass for the\ninsurers' policyholders did not fall within the \"business of\ninsurance.\").\n\n                                   -23-\n\frequire participating physicians to refrain from billing insurer's\n\nsubscribers extra charges even assuming that health insurer had\n\nmarket power in the buying market); see also Berkey Photo, Inc. v.\n\nEastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 297 (2d Cir. 1979) (\"[M]ore than\n\nmonopoly   power    is   necessary   to   make   the   charging   of   a\n\nnoncompetitive price unlawful.\").\n\n\n\nB. The Boycott Exception: Agreement Not To Sell and Coercion of\n   Casellas\n\n           We turn to the exception to the McCarran-Ferguson Act\n\nexemption for \"boycott, coercion, or intimidation\" contained in 15\n\nU.S.C. § 1013(b).\n\n           Recall that the plaintiffs allege two different types of\n\nconcerted actions.       The first (and main claim) is a concerted\n\naction by private insurers horizontally to agree not to provide\n\ncompulsory low-risk insurance to consumers, but to force consumers\n\nto buy through the JUA.      The second is a claim that the private\n\ninsurers coerced and intimidated an insurance broker, Casellas, in\n\nseveral ways, such as threatening clients of Casellas not to do\n\nbusiness with the broker if the broker continued to attempt to sell\n\ncompulsory insurance, and telling other members in the insurance\n\ncommunity that Casellas's attempts to sell compulsory insurance\n\nthrough private companies were illegal. The plaintiffs allege that\n\nthe private insurers did so in order to retaliate against the\n\nbroker for attempting to place customers' orders for compulsory\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\finsurance with the private insurers (and not the JUA) and, it may\n\nbe inferred (taking all inferences in the plaintiffs' favor), to\n\npunish Casellas for successfully inducing one insurance company,\n\nSeguros Triple SSS, Inc., to accept 128 policies from consumers\n\n(thus breaking ranks with the other insurers who had agreed to stay\n\nout of the market).       The complaint does not allege retaliation\n\ndirectly against Seguros Triple SSS, Inc., the insurer who broke\n\nranks, but only against the broker who induced it to do so.\n\n\n\n        1. Boycott: Private Insurers' Agreement Not To Sell\n\n            Assuming there was an agreement not to sell, as alleged,\n\nthese allegations do not show a boycott.            It has been repeatedly\n\nheld that insurers' refusal to sell insurance other than at rates\n\nfixed    through    intra-industry    rate-making    associations    do   not\n\nconstitute    a    boycott.   See,    e.g.,   Slagle,   102   F.3d   at   499\n\n(Insurers' collective refusal to issue windstorm insurance on open\n\nmarket in parts of Florida except through joint underwriting\n\nassociation is not a boycott.); Uniforce Temp. Pers., Inc., 87 F.3d\n\nat 1300 (Insurers' collective refusal to sell workers' compensation\n\ninsurance to temporary employee provider except in the assigned\n\nrisk or residual market is not a boycott.).          It may be a violation\n\nof state law for private insurers to reject applications from\n\nqualified applicants for the compulsory insurance when Law 253 says\n\nthat they must provide such coverage.         26 P.R. Laws Ann. § 8054(a).\n\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fBut it was not a boycott for the insurers collectively to agree\n\nthat they would not offer compulsory vehicle insurance except\n\nthrough the JUA.\n\n           Rather, such an agreement, if there was one, created a\n\npermissible cartel.     See Hartford, 509 U.S. at 802 (The members of\n\na cartel \"are not engaging in a boycott, because: They are not\n\ncoercing anyone, at least in the usual sense of that word; they are\n\nmerely (though concertedly) saying 'we will deal with you only on\n\nthe following trade terms.'\" (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted)); I Areeda and Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 220a, at 351-52.            As a\n\nresult,   their    activities    also    do   not   constitute   coercion   or\n\nintimidation.      See Hartford, 509 U.S. at 808 n.6 (\"Once it is\n\ndetermined that the actions of the []insurers did not constitute a\n\n'boycott,' . . . it follows that their actions do not constitute\n\n'coercion' or 'intimidation' within the meaning of the statute.\n\nThat is because . . . such concerted agreements do not coerce\n\nanyone, at least in the usual sense of that word . . . .\" (internal\n\nquotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted)).\n\n           The boycott exception must mean something other than the\n\nusual horizontal agreement, when it is part of the business of\n\ninsurance of the state, to fix rates and terms of coverage.            See I\n\nAreeda and Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 220b, at 347. The McCarran-Ferguson\n\nAct's   \"primary    concern     that    cooperative   ratemaking   would    be\n\nprotected from the antitrust laws\" and protection of \"cooperative\n\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\frate regulation\" within the industry further argue against finding\n\na \"boycott\" in these allegations.                 Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 223-24.\n\n               In    Hartford         Fire    Insurance    Co.,   the    Supreme    Court\n\nemphasized that it is crucial \"to distinguish between a conditional\n\nboycott and a concerted agreement to seek particular terms in\n\nparticular transactions.\"                    509 U.S. at 801-02.         A conditional\n\nboycott seeks to coerce the target of the boycott into acceding to\n\ncertain demands by means of refusal to deal with the target in\n\ncollateral, unrelated transactions.                    See id. at 801-03.9         \"It is\n\nthis       expansion       of   the    refusal    to   deal   beyond     the    targeted\n\ntransaction         that    gives      great    coercive    force   to    a   commercial\n\nboycott: unrelated transactions are used as leverage to achieve the\n\nterms desired.\"            Id. at 802-03.        The Hartford Court found that it\n\nwas not a boycott for reinsurers to collectively refuse to reinsure\n\ncertain types of commercial general liability (CGL) insurance\n\npolicies because those policies contain undesirable terms: that is\n\nbecause the refusal is limited to the CGL reinsurance transaction\n\nitself.       Id. at 806.        So too here.10\n\n       9\n      This is more consistent with standard usage of the term\n\"boycott.\" See Black's Law Dictionary 198 (8th ed. 2004) (defining\n\"boycott\" as \"[a] refusal to deal in one transaction in an effort\nto obtain terms desired in a second transaction\").\n       10\n      One further twist about pressure on rivals unwilling to join\nshould be addressed.    \"The McCarran Act allows rivals to come\ntogether and eliminate competition among themselves but not to\ncompel unwilling rivals to join their cartel.\"       I Areeda and\nHovenkamp, supra, § 220a, at 352. When cartel members attempt to\ncoerce recalcitrant members through devices involving pressure on\nthird parties and their relationships, concerns about boycott are\n\n                                               -27-\n\f       2. Boycott: Coercion Targeted At Casellas\n\n            The allegations about coercion and threats targeted at\n\nthe broker, Casellas, and the broker's clients, fit more squarely\n\nwithin the boycott exception.         See Hartford, 509 U.S. at 810-11\n\n(holding that allegation that defendant insurers and reinsurers\n\ntold    \"groups   of   insurance   brokers   and   agents   .   .   .   that   a\n\nreinsurance boycott, and thus loss of income to the agents and\n\nbrokers who would be unable to find available markets for their\n\ncustomers, would ensue\" if the terms desired by defendants in\n\ncommercial general liability insurance were not approved, was a\n\nboycott under the McCarran-Ferguson Act).            Such allegations of\n\ncoercion on Casellas are within the boycott exception to the\n\nMcCarran-Ferguson act's insurance exemption.11\n\n\n\n\nheightened. See In re Workers' Comp. Ins. Antitrust Litig., 867\nF.2d 1552, 1560, 1567 (8th Cir. 1989). However, plaintiffs do not\nmake any allegations that there were acts of retaliation against\nSeguros Triple SSS, Inc., the insurance company who broke ranks and\nsold the private compulsory insurance to Casellas's customers. Nor\ndo they allege other enforcement activity against recalcitrant\nmembers of the cartel.\n       11\n      The defendants include a letter in the record from the Office\nof the Insurance Commissioner, indicating that an investigation of\nCasellas's allegations revealed no evidence of wrongdoing by the\ndefendants. For purposes of the Rule 12(b)(6) analysis, we assume\nthe plaintiffs' allegations are true and do not take this letter\ninto account.\n\n                                    -28-\n\f                                      IV.\n\nState Action Immunity\n\n            The defendants argue that they are nonetheless entitled\n\nto dismissal of all claims on state action immunity grounds.                 We\n\ndisagree.\n\n            To obtain    state action immunity under Parker v. Brown,\n\n317 U.S. 341 (1943), the state must manifest intent to intervene in\n\nthe market, displacing antitrust laws and must engage in active\n\nsupervision of the challenged conduct.               I Areeda and Hovenkamp,\n\nsupra, ¶ 221c, at 362.        Stated another way: first, \"the challenged\n\nrestraint    [on     trade]    must   be     one    clearly    articulated   and\n\naffirmatively expressed as state policy\"; and second, \"the policy\n\nmust be actively supervised by the State itself.\"                   Cal. Retail\n\nLiquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.                  445 U.S. 97, 105\n\n(1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).                The requirements for\n\nParker   immunity      are    significantly        more   stringent   than   the\n\nrequirements for state regulation of the business of insurance\n\nunder the McCarran-Ferguson Act.           I Areeda and Hovenkamp, supra, ¶\n\n219c, at 342.      Mere availability of state insurance regulation is\n\ninsufficient    to    confer    Parker     immunity.       A   state's   general\n\nauthority over or passive acceptance of a regulated firm's position\n\ndoes not confer Parker immunity.           Id.\n\n            There is a more important point.              Since the surviving\n\nboycott claim now does not call into question the acts of the\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\fcommonwealth or the Insurance Commissioner, and the JUA is not a\n\nstate agency, Parker immunity is not applicable. Cantor v. Detroit\n\nEdison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 591-92 (1976).                Further, none of the\n\nboycott conduct complained of was mandated or even authorized by\n\nthe state.    Id. at 594-95.\n\n                                        V.\n\n            Although we may affirm the district court's dismissal on\n\nany grounds supported by the record, Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp.,\n\n284 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir. 2002), none of the defendants' remaining\n\ngrounds for dismissal of the boycott claim are persuasive.\n\n\n\nA.   Antitrust Standing\n\n            There    are    six   nonexclusive    factors      to   consider   in\n\ndetermining whether a plaintiff has antitrust standing: \"(1) the\n\ncausal connection between the alleged antitrust violation and harm\n\nto the plaintiff; (2) an improper motive; (3) the nature of the\n\nplaintiff's alleged injury and whether the injury was of a type\n\nthat Congress sought to redress with the antitrust laws ('antitrust\n\ninjury');    (4)    the    directness    with   which    the   alleged   market\n\nrestraint caused the asserted injury; (5) the speculative nature of\n\nthe damages; and (6) the risk of duplicative recovery or complex\n\napportionment of damages.\"         Sullivan v. Tagliabue, 25 F.3d 43, 46\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (citing Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.\n\nv. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 537-45 (1983)).\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f          In many ways the standing question is the most difficult\n\nissue in the case.    Whether the alleged boycott of Casellas has in\n\nfact caused any injury to the plaintiffs is hard to know.\n\n          We   deal   only   with    the   lack   of   standing   arguments\n\narticulated by the defendants.        The defendants concede improper\n\nmotives were alleged, but argue that this alone is insufficient to\n\ngive standing.   They argue any damages were speculative and that\n\nthe damages sought will require complex apportionment.             Finally,\n\nthey argue that this case would involve duplicative recovery\n\nbecause there are two pending state actions about the system.           But\n\nit is far from clear what is at issue in these actions.                This\n\nargument is also inconsistent with their argument that any damages\n\nwould be too speculative or difficult to apportion.\n\n          We cannot say, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, that the\n\nplaintiffs have no antitrust standing.        See Morales-Villalobos v.\n\nGarcia-Llorens, 316 F.3d 51, 55-56 (1st Cir. 2003).          As to several\n\nof the criteria, we note that the plaintiffs here are consumers and\n\nas such are presumptively favored as appropriate plaintiffs to\n\nassert antitrust injury.     SAS of P.R., Inc. v. P.R. Tel. Co., 48\n\nF.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          As to the surviving boycott allegation, typically the\n\nplaintiffs in such cases, unlike here, are themselves the targets\n\nof the boycotts, but status as the target is by no means necessary.\n\nSee, e.g., Hartford, 509 U.S. at 770 (The plaintiffs, nineteen\n\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\fstates and private parties, sued CGL insurers and reinsurers whose\n\nalleged boycott was against recalcitrant insurers.); In re Workers'\n\nComp. Ins. Antitrust Litig., 867 F.2d at 1554 (The plaintiffs,\n\nprivate     employers,    sued   workers'    compensation      insurers   and\n\ninsurers' collective rating association for using a cooperative\n\nagreement not to charge less than the maximum lawful rate; the\n\nagreement    was   a   boycott   because    it   may   be   enforced   against\n\nrecalcitrant rating association members by expelling them so that\n\nthey can no longer sell workers' compensation insurance.); see also\n\nBlue Shield of Va. v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 478 (1982) (rejecting\n\nargument that patients of psychologists have no antitrust injury\n\nand no standing to sue under the antitrust laws where the alleged\n\nconspiracy between health insurer and organization of psychiatrists\n\nwas aimed to keep psychologists out of the market).\n\n            At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, we cannot conclude that the\n\nalleged antitrust activities could not be proven to be a but-for\n\ncause of the harm the consumers allegedly suffered.               See SAS of\n\nP.R., Inc., 48 F.3d at 46 (affirming dismissal of case because,\n\neven assuming harm-causing antitrust violation, the plaintiff was\n\nnot the appropriate plaintiff).        Such causation issues are often\n\ndecided at summary judgment, not on the pleadings, precisely\n\nbecause they depend on some factual development.                  See, e.g.,\n\nMorales-Villalobos, 316 F.3d at 55-56; RSA Media, Inc. v. AK Media\n\nGroup, Inc., 260 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 2001) (finding against\n\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\fplaintiff on causation issue at summary judgment); Sullivan, 25\n\nF.3d at 51 (same).     Dismissal at the pleadings stage is more often\n\nassociated with disfavored plaintiffs, not consumers, such as\n\ndistributors   or    suppliers   injured   by   anti-competitive      threats\n\ndirected towards others. See Serpa Corp. v. McWane, Inc., 199 F.3d\n\n6, 13 (1st Cir. 1999); SAS of P.R., Inc., 48 F.3d at 44.\n\n\n\nB.   Filed Rate Doctrine\n\n           The defendants argue that the plaintiffs' claims are\n\nbarred by the filed rate doctrine because the claims are really an\n\nattack on the reasonableness of the \"uniform premium\" set by Law\n\n253 and overseen by the Insurance Commissioner.             See 26 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. § 8056.        The plaintiffs are emphatic that they are not\n\nattacking the rate which the Puerto Rico legislature has set for\n\ncompulsory insurance, and there is no claim in the complaint that\n\nthe JUA's rate is unreasonable.\n\n           The filed rate doctrine has its origins as a judicially\n\ncreated bar to antitrust damages claims in the context of the\n\nInterstate   Commerce   Commission's      regulation   of    common   carrier\n\nrates.   Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476\n\nU.S. 409 (1986); Keogh v. Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co., 260 U.S. 156\n\n(1922). The doctrine \"is actually a set of rules that have evolved\n\nover time but revolve around the notion that [where regulated\n\nentities are required to file rates with the regulatory agency],\n\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\futility filings with the regulatory agency prevail over unfiled\n\ncontracts or other claims seeking different rates or terms than\n\nthose reflected in the filings with the agency.\"     Town of Norwood\n\nv. F.E.R.C., 217 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 2000).   All that is left of\n\nthe plaintiffs' federal antitrust action are the claims of boycott\n\nof Casellas.   We think that boycott has little to do with the filed\n\nrate doctrine, a famously complex and sometimes criticized set of\n\nrules.   See Town of Norwood v. New Eng. Power Co., 202 F.3d 408,\n\n420 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[T]he law on the filed rate doctrine is\n\nextremely creaky.\"). There is no direct relationship at all and it\n\nis simply not the case that any action which might arguably and\n\ncoincidentally implicate rates, much less those determined by a\n\nstate, rather than a federal agency, is governed by the doctrine.\n\nSee In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., 998 F.2d 1144,\n\n1159 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n\n\nC.   Primary Jurisdiction\n\n          Similarly, the primary jurisdiction doctrine has little\n\nto do with this case and it certainly does not go to the subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction of the federal court. P.R. Mar. Shipping Auth.\n\nv. Fed. Mar. Comm'n, 75 F.3d 63, 67 (1st Cir. 1996).      It is not\n\nappropriately used here as a defense in any event.\n\n          Generally, the doctrine's application depends on three\n\nfactors: \"(1) whether the agency determination lay at the heart of\n\n\n\n                                -34-\n\fthe task assigned the agency by [the legislature]; (2) whether\n\nagency expertise was required to unravel intricate, technical\n\nfacts; and (3) whether, though perhaps not determinative, the\n\nagency determination would materially aid the court.\"                        Mashpee\n\nTribe v. New Seabury Corp., 592 F.2d 575, 580-81 (1st Cir. 1979).\n\nNone of these conditions are met here.\n\n\n\nD.   Lack of Substantial Impact on Interstate Commerce\n\n           Defendants          finally    argue    that      the      jurisdictional\n\nrequirements of the Sherman Act are not satisfied here because the\n\nactivities described in the complaint do not substantially affect\n\ninterstate commerce. See McLain v. Real Estate Bd. of New Orleans,\n\nInc., 444 U.S. 232, 242 (1980).\n\n           This     argument     is   frivolous     in    its   own    terms.       The\n\nplaintiffs allege that the defendants, some of whom are global\n\ninsurers, have invested the extra profits from their monopoly\n\nscheme outside of Puerto Rico and made it more difficult for the\n\nplaintiffs to purchase, repair, and maintain cars obtained in\n\ninterstate commerce.           In light of the allegation that some \"1.5\n\nmillion   to    2    million\"      vehicle      owners    in    Puerto     Rico     are\n\npolicyholders       of   the    compulsory      insurance,      \"as    a   matter    of\n\npractical economics,\" the complaint, at least for Rule 12(b)(6)\n\npurposes, states a \"not insubstantial effect on the interstate\n\ncommerce\" sufficient for the Sherman Act.                 Cordova & Simonpietri\n\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\fIns. Agency Inc. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 649 F.2d 36, 45\n\n(1st Cir. 1981) (quoting McLain, 444 U.S. at 246).\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n          It was the defendants who chose to test the plaintiffs'\n\ncase on the pleadings, and we hold no more than that, as to the\n\nCasellas boycott federal antitrust claims, the case survives.\n\n          We reverse the judgment of dismissal with respect to that\n\none claim and remand the case for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.   No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                               -36-\n\f                                Appendix\n\n\n\nThe   plaintiffs'   complaint    contains   the   following    relevant\n\nallegations:\n\n          12. The defendant insurance companies acting\n          jointly, in concert and in agreement with each\n          other and with [the directors of the JUA],\n          agreed to implement a boycott against all\n          motor vehicle owners whereby none of the ten\n          [sic] private insurance companies would issue\n          to the owners of motor vehicles covered by Law\n          253, supra, the compulsory insurance policy .\n          . . and would cause and achieve that all said\n          motor vehicle owners be insured with respect\n          to said compulsory insurance policies only by\n          the [JUA].\n\n          13.   The main and principal reason for such\n          concerted scheme and boycott was of course the\n          obtention [sic] of larger profits for all of\n          the defendants. As the [JUA] is exempted from\n          income and other taxes, if the [JUA] became\n          the sole insurer of all vehicles having only\n          compulsory insurance, all the premiums would\n          accrue tax free to the [JUA] to be later\n          distributed   among     the   defendant's    [sic]\n          participating insurance companies members of\n          the [JUA].      The monopoly obtained by a\n          successful boycott would lower their costs as\n          no written insurance policies would be issued\n          with a savings of around $4.00.        They would\n          also   economize    in    the   payment   of   the\n          commission to the brokers and agents with\n          another savings of 8% of the insurance premium\n          as they would cover the insured directly\n          without the intervention of an agent or broker\n          as required by law when coverage is issued by\n          a private insurer. Other economies would be\n          obtained   by    the   monopolization     in   the\n          adjustment    of     the    claims    and    other\n          administrative expenses.       As herein further\n          alleged, they have been successful and have\n          been able to accumulate extraordinary profits.\n\n\n\n                                  -37-\n\f19.   By April 1999, a \"super syndicate\" was\ncreated and the [JUA] was issuing compulsory\ninsurance on virtually the whole universe of\nvehicle owners operating in Puerto Rico not\nhaving traditional insurance. . . .\n\n21.   Not only did they concertedly remain\ninactive in promoting the offering of the\ncompulsory insurance but also went further in\ntheir concerted boycott and each of them\nsystematically rejected all applications by\nbrokers and agents to the ten [sic] defendant\ninsurance companies.\n\n26.    On August 31[st], 2000 it was co-\ndefendant Seguros Triple S, [sic] Inc. who\nrejected the applications for compulsory\ninsurance submitted by Casellas and Co. [a\nbroker]   This company later agreed to issue\n128 policies but limiting the commission to\nCasellas to only 3% instead of 8% as\nestablished in the premium distribution.\n\n32.   By October 16th, 2000 Casellas and Co.\nhad around 40,000 insurance applications\nincluding broker designation for compulsory\ninsurance that the defendants had consistently\nrefused to accept.\n\n38. [The defendants' agents] represented to\nbe private detectives investigating insurance\nfraud.

Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 8051 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This federal antitrust suit challenged certain conduct of private insurers and the new state-created entity under Law 253, the Joint Underwriting Association (\"JUA\"), in the compulsory insurance program. The suit was dismissed at the pleadings stage under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The plaintiffs, who purport to represent a class of harmed consumers, appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants, private insurers and the JUA, have agreed to and created a monopoly in the JUA as to all forms of low-cost compulsory insurance and have boycotted and coerced at least one broker in order to maintain that monopoly. The private insurers and the JUA argue that this monopoly is a result required by the state law. That is untrue. The Puerto Rico statute contemplates (at least as to non-high-risk policies) competition, but then, oddly, creates incentives for defendants to create just such a monopoly as alleged. The claims before us are a different matter: a federal antitrust suit raises different issues than issues of compliance with local statutes. As to one claim only, we reverse the dismissal and remand; we affirm the dismissal of all other claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe the statutory scheme. Before the enactment of Law 253, uninsured drivers caused over $110 million in damages to other vehicles each year in Puerto Rico, and it was estimated that only 25 percent to 30 percent of the vehicles in Puerto Rico were covered under some type of liability insurance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 253 created a compulsory automobile liability insurance system, which, beginning in 1998, provides each insured vehicle owner with $3000 of coverage for damages caused to third parties per accident in exchange for a uniform premium, initially set at $99 for each private passenger vehicle and $148 for each commercial vehicle. 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 8052(j), 8056(a). All \"private insurers,\" defined as insurers with more than 1 percent of the commonwealth's total volume of vehicle liability premiums, <i>id.</i> &#167; 8052(b), are required to offer the compulsory liability insurance in two ways: both as private insurers to a defined class of drivers and as members of the JUA, to which they must belong. <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 8053(d), 8054(a), 8055(a). Law 253 allows private insurers to reject certain applicants for the compulsory insurance pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Insurance Commissioner. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 8054(b). The criteria for rejection are defined by the Insurance Commissioner's Puerto Rican Insurance Rule LXX (\"Rule LXX\"), promulgated in Regulation No. 6254 in December of 2000. Most of the criteria in Rule LXX for permissible rejections identify applicants who are bad drivers or otherwise of high risk.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See</i> Rule LXX, Art. 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA itself provides compulsory liability insurance to all drivers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> including those high-risk drivers whom private insurers are not required to insure. 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8055(b). Vehicle owners may opt out of the compulsory liability insurance scheme by purchasing traditional liability insurance with comparable or better coverage. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 8061; Rule LXX, Art. 12(a). Law 253 appears to require the private insurers also to offer the policy despite the availability of coverage from the JUA, <i>see</i> 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 8054(a), 8055(b), and allows private insurers to apply for approval to sell the compulsory insurance at less than the rate set by the commonwealth. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 8056(c) (\"Any private insurer may submit for the approval of the [Insurance] Commissioner a variation of a uniform percentage to reduce the uniform compulsory liability insurance premium....\"). Some legislative history suggests that Law 253 was meant to encourage competition \"between insurance companies wanting to have a greater number of insured, who will have to extend offers in order to attract them.\" Certified translation of the Daily Sessions Record, Senate of Puerto Rico, Monday, October 9, 1995. As a result, the statutory scheme contemplates competition in compulsory insurance, at least for non-high-risk drivers, between private insurers themselves and between them and the JUA. It also contemplates, but does not mandate, the possibility of a monopoly in the JUA as to compulsory insurance for high-risk drivers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All members of the JUA share in its profits and losses. 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8055(e). To compensate for the fact that the JUA must insure drivers considered too risky by private insurers, all the JUA's profits, including those distributed to private insurers, are exempt from income taxes. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 8055(j). Through the JUA, the risk of insuring these high-risk drivers is thus spread among all the private insurers. The profits distributed to the JUA members (the private insurers) also encompass the profits from the sale of non-high-risk policies insured by the JUA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though created by law, the JUA is \"private in nature, for profit, and ... subject to the provisions of the [Insurance] Code applicable to insurers.\" Rule LXX, Art. 2(c). The JUA is under some direction by the commonwealth. The Insurance Commissioner is directed to establish the manner of distribution of the total amount of premiums received by the JUA, 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8055(c); Rule LXX, Art. 20(e)(3), and the structure and operation of the JUA, and its direction by a board of directors, so that the JUA may accomplish its goals in a \"cost-effective, fair and nondiscriminatory\" manner. 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8055(f). The plan of operations may be amended only with the approval of the Insurance Commissioner. Rule LXX, Art. 20(c)(1)(xv).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the Insurance Commissioner is not made a member of the board of directors of the JUA, <i>id.,</i> Art. 20(c)(1)(iii), and does not appear to have active supervision over the day-to-day affairs of the JUA. Four of the five directors on the JUA's board of directors are elected by the members of the JUA, while the fifth director is the officer in charge of the JUA. <i>Id.</i> None of these directors are defined as a state official. The JUA is not an agency of the commonwealth. It has \"general corporate powers,\" such as the power to sue and be sued, to enter into contracts, to hold and use property, etc. <i>See</i> Rule LXX, Art. 20(a); 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 2905.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For both private insurers and the JUA, the commonwealth, through the Insurance Commissioner, sets the terms of the compulsory policy itself, the premium rate, and the amount of coverage. The Puerto Rico Mandatory Liability Insurance Uniform Policy, the policy defining the terms of the compulsory liability insurance, is set forth in the Insurance Commissioner's rules. Rule LXX, Art. 22. This policy is \"the sole contract between [the insured] and [the JUA].\" The policy does not contain any specification for the type of repair parts that may be used or provisions governing repair practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Commissioner has established, through regulation, a uniform initial liability determination system to facilitate the investigation, adjustment, and resolution of claims arising under the compulsory liability insurance scheme. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8057; Puerto Rico Insurance Rule LXXI (\"Rule LXXI\"). Rule LXXI sets out portions of the claims making process, including the use of diagrams, which are made part of the regulation, to allocate fault for accidents. Rule LXXI, Arts. 2, 6, 7. However, there is nothing in Rule LXXI concerning the insurers' auto repair arrangements or practices; nor does the Rule govern all claims practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few points bear emphasis. First, the statute, apparently unusually,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> contemplates competition with respect to at least the non-high-risk drivers between the private insurers and also between the private insurers and the JUA. Second, the statute provides a means for insurers who are in competition to seek to sell the compulsory insurance at a lower price than the \"uniform premium.\" 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8056(c). Third, the supervision over the JUA does not cover at least some of the complained-of activities. For example, the Insurance Commissioner, by statute, has considerable supervision over the operating plan and the method of premium distribution, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 8055, 8056; by contrast, there appears to be little supervision of the JUA's specific business decisions (such as how it minimizes its costs in repairs and claims adjustment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff motor vehicle owners, as consumers of the compulsory insurance, brought a putative class action against eleven private insurers and the JUA, alleging that the defendants violated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1 <i>et seq.,</i> the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 12 <i>et seq.,</i> and also Puerto Rico antitrust laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The plaintiffs allege that the private companies, <i>qua</i> companies, have agreed not to sell the compulsory insurance; this, in turn, forces customers to buy from the JUA and puts the JUA in a monopoly position. The plaintiffs allege that the insurance companies choose not to compete with the JUA at least in part because of the tax benefits that non-competition creates. The JUA is tax-exempt; its monopoly over the compulsory liability insurance policies allows all the profits from the premiums, including those from non-high-risk drivers, to accrue tax free to the JUA for later distribution to the member insurance companies. Further, by dealing only through the JUA, the private insurers lower their own costs and inflate their profit by not providing paper copies of policies to insureds and by not utilizing the services of brokers. The plaintiffs allege that Puerto Rico law requires both that policies be provided and that brokers be used. 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 329, 1123. The plaintiffs admit that policies are available both online and at licensing offices. But they argue that these omissions in services reduce the services provided to the insureds. The omissions also, it may be inferred, harm consumers in another way. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants save $4.00 per policy from not having to issue a paper copy of the policy and about 8 percent of the premium per policy for not having to pay a broker's commission. These savings are not passed on to the consumers as they would likely be if the companies in fact competed with each other and with the JUA. Indeed, Law 253 contemplated exactly such a benefit from competition to consumers when it provided that private companies could apply to sell such policies at lower rates. <i>See</i> 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8056(c). But for the acts of the defendants in creating a monopoly, the plaintiffs allege that the premiums for compulsory liability insurance could have been fixed to be \"at least 12% less than the one established.\" The plaintiffs do not challenge the rate set by the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to these horizontal agreements not to compete, the plaintiffs also allege that the private insurers acting in concert coerced brokers to refrain from selling compulsory insurance through private companies. The plaintiffs allege that one broker, Casellas and Co. (\"Casellas\"), attempted to present around 40,000 applications for compulsory insurance to the defendant insurance companies in the year 2000, and the applications were all rejected. The monopoly was evidently not complete since the plaintiffs also allege that one of the defendants, Seguros Triple SSS, Inc., did issue 128 compulsory insurance policies in 2000 (and paid the broker, Casellas, a commission of only 3 percent instead of 8 percent). The plaintiffs allege that the defendants (1) threatened clients of Casellas that they should not do business with Casellas if Casellas continued to attempt to sell compulsory insurance through the private companies and (2) told other members in the insurance community that Casellas's attempts to sell compulsory insurance through private insurers were illegal and that people who did business with Casellas would go to jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also allege that since the JUA has a monopoly in the compulsory insurance market, the JUA is able to use burdensome claims procedures and to require the use of the cheapest car parts, or \"junker parts,\" for repairs, thus harming the consumers. The plaintiffs argue that if the JUA did not have such a monopoly, there would be competition which would produce better options as to the quality of repair parts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to come within the boycott/coercion exception to the insurance business exemption from federal antitrust laws contained in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that the acts of the defendants &#8212; (1) agreements among the private insurers and between them and the JUA not to compete with the JUA and (2) the threats of harm to Casellas &#8212; constitute a boycott and coercion and have caused injuries to consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking all inferences in the plaintiffs' favor, the complaint may be read to establish four categories of injuries, at least with respect to non-high-risk compulsory insurance, to consumers being forced to buy through the JUA's monopoly: (1) consumers do not receive copies of written insurance policies; (2) consumers do not receive the assistance of brokers; (3) these are costs the private insurers would otherwise incur if the private insurers offered comparable compulsory coverage as the JUA; private companies thus save on those costs and could then apply to offer the compulsory policy at an approved rate which is less than the rate set by regulators for the JUA; (4) in any event, the JUA's monopoly means it can, as it does, (a) require that repairs be made only with \"junker\" parts which are inferior to parts which might otherwise be made available in a competitive system, (b) require consumers to go through an unfair process of adjustment of claims based on unreasonable depreciation percentages, (c) require consumers to submit to an unfair system of determining fault with diagrams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, on report and recommendation from a magistrate judge, dismissed the complaint upon Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motions from the defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The district court held that there was a lack of antitrust injury and that the action was precluded by the filed rate doctrine. The plaintiffs timely appealed. The defendants present six alternate grounds on appeal for affirming the dismissal: (1) there was no antitrust injury so the plaintiffs lack standing to sue under the antitrust laws, (2) the state action immunity doctrine, (3) the filed rate doctrine, (4) the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which purportedly requires referral to the Puerto Rico Insurance Commissioner, (5) the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption of the business of insurance from federal antitrust liability, and (6) the lack of involvement of substantial interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orders granting motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) are subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>Rodi v. S. New Eng. Sch. of Law,</i> 389 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir.2004). A reviewing court accepts all well-pleaded allegations of the plaintiffs as true and affords all inferences in the plaintiffs' favor. <i>Rosenberg v.

We conclude that both allegations fall within the business of insurance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We then turn to the boycott/coercion exception to the McCarran-Ferguson Act's business of insurance exemption. We reject plaintiffs' argument that the horizontal non-competition agreement, even if it has created a monopoly in the JUA, is a boycott. We reject the defendants' argument that coercion against a brokerage firm, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, does not state a claim of boycott. We also reject the defendants' argument that the boycott activities are nonetheless protected by the state immunity doctrine under <i>Parker v. Brown,</i> 317 U.S. 341, 63 S.Ct. 307, 87 L.Ed. 315 (1943).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the plaintiffs are consumers and thus usually the preferred plaintiffs in antitrust claims of this sort, we reject the argument that, as to the boycott, the pleadings can determine that the plaintiffs lack standing and have not suffered any antitrust injury. We find that the plaintiffs' boycott claim does not implicate the filed rate doctrine or the primary jurisdiction defenses. We also reject the defendants' contention that, as to the boycott, the substantial impact on interstate commerce requirement of the antitrust laws has not been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>The McCarran-Ferguson Act</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 1 of the Sherman Act, \"[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States ... is ... illegal.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1. \"The usual section 2 [Sherman Act] claim requires monopoly or near monopoly power in some market, and a wrongful exclusionary act designed to enhance such power in that market or to achieve an improper advantage in another market.\" <i>Town of Norwood v.

The plaintiffs argue that the JUA is using its monopoly to increase its profits through using cheap parts without charging cheaper prices. But a monopolist is entitled to exploit a monopoly in order to maximize its profits. <i>See</i> III Areeda and Hovenkamp, <i>Antitrust Law,</i> &#182; 720a (2d ed.2000). \"Monopoly pricing and monopoly profits are neither `exclusionary' acts nor `abuses' of monopoly power under &#167; 2 [of the Sherman Act].\" <i>Id.</i> at 254.

The first (and main claim) is a concerted action by private insurers horizontally to agree not to provide compulsory low-risk insurance to consumers, but to force consumers to buy through the JUA. The second is a claim that the private insurers coerced and intimidated an insurance broker, Casellas, in several ways, such as threatening clients of Casellas not to do business with the broker if the broker continued to attempt to sell compulsory insurance, and telling other members in the insurance community that Casellas's attempts to sell compulsory insurance through private companies were illegal. The plaintiffs allege that the private insurers did so in order to retaliate against the broker for attempting to place customers' orders for compulsory insurance with the private insurers (and not the JUA) and, it may be inferred (taking all inferences in the plaintiffs' favor), to punish Casellas for successfully inducing one insurance company, Seguros Triple SSS, Inc., to accept 128 policies from consumers (thus breaking ranks with the other insurers who had agreed to stay out of the market). The complaint does not allege retaliation directly against Seguros Triple SSS, Inc., the insurer who broke ranks, but only against the broker who induced it to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Boycott: Private Insurers' Agreement Not To Sell</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming there was an agreement not to sell, as alleged, these allegations do not show a boycott. It has been repeatedly held that insurers' refusal to sell insurance other than at rates fixed through intra-industry rate-making associations do not constitute a boycott. <i>See, e.g., Slagle,</i> 102 F.3d at 499 (Insurers' collective refusal to issue windstorm insurance on open market in parts of Florida except through joint underwriting association is not a boycott.); <i>Uniforce Temp. Pers., Inc.,</i> 87 F.3d at 1300 (Insurers' collective refusal to sell workers' compensation insurance to temporary employee provider except in the assigned risk or residual market is not a boycott.). It may be a violation of state law for private insurers to reject applications from qualified applicants for the compulsory insurance when Law 253 says that they must provide such coverage. 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8054(a). But it was not a boycott for the insurers collectively to agree that they would not offer compulsory vehicle insurance except through the JUA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, such an agreement, if there was one, created a permissible cartel. <i>See Hartford,</i> 509 U.S. at 802, 113 S.Ct. 2891 (The members of a cartel \"are not engaging in a boycott, because: They are not coercing anyone, at least in the usual sense of that word; they are merely (though concertedly) saying `<i>we will deal with you only on the following trade terms.</i>'\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); I Areeda and Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> &#182; 220a, at 351-52. As a result, their activities also do not constitute coercion or intimidation. <i>See Hartford,</i> 509 U.S. at 808 n. 6, 113 S.Ct. 2891 (\"Once it is determined that the actions of the [ ]insurers did not constitute a `boycott,' ... it follows that their actions do not constitute `coercion' or `intimidation' within the meaning of the statute.

The McCarran-Ferguson Act's \"primary concern that cooperative ratemaking would be protected from the antitrust laws\" and protection of \"cooperative rate regulation\" within the industry further argue against finding a \"boycott\" in these allegations. <i>Royal Drug,</i> 440 U.S. at 223-24, 99 S.Ct. 1067.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Hartford Fire Insurance Co.,</i> the Supreme Court emphasized that it is crucial \"to distinguish between a conditional boycott and a concerted agreement to seek particular terms in particular transactions.\" 509 U.S. at 801-02, 113 S.Ct. 2891. A conditional boycott seeks to <i>coerce</i> the target of the boycott into acceding to certain demands by means of refusal to deal with the target in <i>collateral, unrelated transactions.

The <i>Hartford</i> Court found that it was not a boycott for reinsurers to collectively refuse to reinsure certain types of commercial general liability (CGL) insurance policies because those policies contain undesirable terms: that is because the refusal is limited to the CGL reinsurance transaction itself. <i>Id.</i> at 806, 113 S.Ct. 2891.

Brown,</i> 317 U.S. 341, 63 S.Ct. 307, 87 L.Ed. 315 (1943), the state must manifest intent to intervene in the market, displacing antitrust laws and must engage in active supervision of the challenged conduct. I Areeda and Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> &#182; 221c, at 362. Stated another way: first, \"the challenged restraint [on trade] must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy\"; and second, \"the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself.\" <i>Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.</i> 445 U.S. 97, 105, 100 S.Ct. 937, 63 L.Ed.2d 233 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). The requirements for <i>Parker</i> immunity are significantly more stringent than the requirements for state regulation of the business of insurance under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. I Areeda and Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> &#182; 219c, at 342. Mere availability of state insurance regulation is insufficient to confer <i>Parker</i> immunity. A state's general authority over or passive acceptance of a regulated firm's position does not confer <i>Parker</i> immunity. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a more important point. Since the surviving boycott claim now does not call into question the acts of the commonwealth or the Insurance Commissioner, and the JUA is not a state agency, <i>Parker</i> immunity is not applicable. <i>Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co.,</i> 428 U.S. 579, 591-92, 96 S.Ct. 3110, 49 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1976).

The defendants concede improper motives were alleged, but argue that this alone is insufficient to give standing. They argue any damages were speculative and that the damages sought will require complex apportionment. Finally, they argue that this case would involve duplicative recovery because there are two pending state actions about the system. But it is far from clear what is at issue in these actions. This argument is also inconsistent with their argument that any damages would be too speculative or difficult to apportion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot say, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, that the plaintiffs have no antitrust standing. <i>See Morales-Villalobos v. Garcia-Llorens,</i> 316 F.3d 51, 55-56 (1st Cir.2003). As to several of the criteria, we note that the plaintiffs here are consumers and as such are presumptively favored as appropriate plaintiffs to assert antitrust injury. <i>SAS of P.R., Inc. v. P.R.

McCready,</i> 457 U.S. 465, 478, 102 S.Ct. 2540, 73 L.Ed.2d 149 (1982) (rejecting argument that patients of psychologists have no antitrust injury and no standing to sue under the antitrust laws where the alleged conspiracy between health insurer and organization of psychiatrists was aimed to keep psychologists out of the market).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, we cannot conclude that the alleged antitrust activities could not be proven to be a but-for cause of the harm the consumers allegedly suffered. <i>See SAS of P.R., Inc.,</i> 48 F.3d at 46 (affirming dismissal of case because, even assuming harm-causing antitrust violation, the plaintiff was not the appropriate plaintiff). Such causation issues are often decided at summary judgment, not on the pleadings, precisely because they depend on some factual development. <i>See, e.g., Morales-Villalobos,</i> 316 F.3d at 55-56; <i>RSA Media, Inc. v. AK Media Group, Inc.,</i> 260 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir.2001) (finding against plaintiff on causation issue at summary judgment); <i>Sullivan,</i> 25 F.3d at 51 (same). Dismissal at the pleadings stage is more often associated with disfavored plaintiffs, not consumers, such as distributors or suppliers injured by anti-competitive threats directed towards others. <i>See Serpa Corp. v. McWane, Inc.,</i> 199 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir.1999); <i>SAS of P.R., Inc.,</i> 48 F.3d at 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Filed Rate Doctrine</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue that the plaintiffs' claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine because the claims are really an attack on the reasonableness of the \"uniform premium\" set by Law 253 and overseen by the Insurance Commissioner. <i>See</i> 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8056. The plaintiffs are emphatic that they are not attacking the rate which the Puerto Rico legislature has set for compulsory insurance, and there is no claim in the complaint that the JUA's rate is unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The filed rate doctrine has its origins as a judicially created bar to antitrust damages claims in the context of the Interstate Commerce Commission's regulation of common carrier rates. <i>Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc.,</i> 476 U.S. 409, 106 S.Ct. 1922, 90 L.Ed.2d 413 (1986); <i>Keogh v. Chicago &amp; N.W. Ry. Co.,</i> 260 U.S. 156, 43 S.Ct. 47, 67 L.Ed. 183 (1922). The doctrine \"is actually a set of rules that have evolved over time but revolve around the notion that [where regulated entities are required to file rates with the regulatory agency], utility filings with the regulatory agency prevail over unfiled contracts or other claims seeking different rates or terms than those reflected in the filings with the agency.\" <i>Town of Norwood v. F.E.R.C.,</i> 217 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir.2000). All that is left of the plaintiffs' federal antitrust action are the claims of boycott of Casellas. We think that boycott has little to do with the filed rate doctrine, a famously complex and sometimes criticized set of rules. <i>See Town of Norwood v. New England Power Co.,</i> 202 F.3d 408, 420 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[T]he law on the filed rate doctrine is extremely creaky.\"). There is no direct relationship at all and it is simply not the case that any action which might arguably and coincidentally implicate rates, much less those determined by a state, rather than a federal agency, is governed by the doctrine. <i>See In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig.,</i> 998 F.2d 1144, 1159 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Primary Jurisdiction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the primary jurisdiction doctrine has little to do with this case and it certainly does not go to the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal court. <i>P.R. Mar. Shipping Auth. v. Fed. Mar. Comm'n,</i> 75 F.3d 63, 67 (1st Cir.1996).

New Seabury Corp.,</i> 592 F.2d 575, 580-81 (1st Cir.1979).

The plaintiffs allege that the defendants, some of whom are global insurers, have invested the extra profits from their monopoly scheme outside of Puerto Rico and made it more difficult for the plaintiffs to purchase, repair, and maintain cars obtained in interstate commerce. In light of the allegation that some \"1.5 million to 2 million\" vehicle owners in Puerto Rico are policyholders of the compulsory insurance, \"as a matter of practical economics,\" the complaint, at least for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes, states a \"not insubstantial effect on the interstate commerce\" sufficient for the Sherman Act. <i>Cordova &amp; Simonpietri Ins.

The defendant insurance companies acting jointly, in concert and in agreement with each other and with [the directors of the JUA], agreed to implement a boycott against all motor vehicle owners whereby none of the ten [sic] private insurance companies would issue to the owners of motor vehicles covered by <i>Law 253, supra,</i> the compulsory insurance policy... and would cause and achieve that all said motor vehicle owners be insured with respect to said compulsory insurance policies only by the [JUA].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">13. The main and principal reason for such concerted scheme and boycott was of course the obtention [sic] of larger profits for all of the defendants. As the [JUA] is exempted from income and other taxes, if the [JUA] became the sole insurer of all vehicles having only compulsory insurance, all the premiums would accrue tax free to the [JUA] to be later distributed among the defendant's [sic] participating insurance companies members of the [JUA]. The monopoly obtained by a successful boycott would lower their costs as no written insurance policies would be issued with a savings of around $4.00. They would also economize in the payment of the commission to the brokers and agents with another savings of 8% of the insurance premium as they would cover the insured directly without the intervention of an agent or broker as required by law when coverage is issued by a private insurer. Other economies would be obtained by the monopolization in the adjustment of the claims and other administrative expenses. As herein further alleged, they have been successful and have been able to accumulate extraordinary profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">19. By April 1999, a \"super syndicate\" was created and the [JUA] was issuing compulsory insurance on virtually the whole universe of vehicle owners operating in Puerto Rico not having traditional insurance....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21. Not only did they concertedly remain inactive in promoting the offering of the compulsory insurance but also went further in their concerted boycott and each of them systematically rejected all applications by brokers and agents to the ten [sic] defendant insurance companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">26. On August 31[st], 2000 it was co-defendant Seguros Triple S, [sic] Inc. who rejected the applications for compulsory insurance submitted by Casellas and Co. [a broker] This company later agreed to issue 128 policies but limiting the commission to Casellas to only 3% instead of 8% as established in the premium distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">32. By October 16th, 2000 Casellas and Co. had around 40,000 insurance applications including broker designation for compulsory insurance that the defendants had consistently refused to accept.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">38. [The defendants' agents] represented to be private detectives investigating insurance fraud. They would take photos and make[ ] statements to the employees and owners of the inspection centers to the effect that Casellas and Co. was committing fraud; that he was forcing and coercing vehicle owners to sign applications; that he was doing illegal acts; that the persons who did business with Casellas could go to jail; that Casellas promises could not be trusted; and other similar disparaging comments casting aspersions against Casellas and Co. with the purpose of intimidating potential customers of compulsory insurance policies and dissuade them from doing to business with Casellas and Co.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">40. The plan and efforts of intimidation and coercion were also practiced by the defendants who threatened clients of Casellas and Co. not to do business with said broker if he would continue with his attempts to sell compulsory insurance and telling members of the insurance business community that what he was doing was illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">55.C.(a) The monopoly has allowed the [JUA] to freely dictate the practices relating to the adjustment of claims allowing said [JUA] to establish unreasonable depreciation percentages for the replacement of new parts to be replaced; repairing vehicles with old parts obtained from \"[j]unkers\"; creating a complicated and unfair system of diagrams for the determination of fault to the detriment of the affected member[s] of the class. This monopoly and absence of competition has resulted in the diminution of the quality of service as the insureds have became [sic] captives of the [JUA] without any possibility of escaping.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">63. [The plaintiffs] have been deprived of the right to receive written policies and the services and quality of service based on a system of competition. Had the law intended that no written policies were to be issued and no brokers or competing insurance companies would participate, the premiums could have been fixed lower (at least 12% less than the one established)....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Rule LXX allows private insurers to reject applicants when (1) the motor vehicle is used as a public vehicle; (2) the motor vehicle is a racing vehicle or super rapid; (3) the owner or main driver of the motor vehicle has accumulated five or more points for violations of the Vehicle and Traffic Act of Puerto Rico, during the three years prior to the date of the application for the compulsory liability insurance; (4) the owner or main driver of the motor vehicle has been convicted of driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or of participating in any type of drag racing or races on public roads; (5) the license of the owner or main driver of the vehicle has been revoked or suspended during the year prior to the effective date when the compulsory liability insurance is requested; (6) the motor vehicle is not insurable according to the private insurer's written criteria for underwriting traditional insurance policies; (7) the owner of the vehicle has not requested the insurance; and (8) the application form as adopted by the Insurance Commissioner was not properly filled out.

The first clause \"commits laws `enacted... for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance' to the States, while the second clause exempts only `the business of insurance' itself from the antitrust laws.\"<i>U.S. Dep't of Treasury v. Fabe,</i> 508 U.S. 491, 504, 113 S.Ct. 2202, 124 L.Ed.2d 449 (1993). The scope of the first clause is not as \"narrowly circumscribed\" as the second. <i>See id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We quickly dispose of two possible objections to application of the McCarran-Ferguson exemption here. The literal language of the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption contained in the first sentence in &#167; 1012(b) precludes application of federal statutes which \"invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1012(b). An argument could easily be made by the plaintiffs that their claims are entirely consistent with and not in conflict with state law and so the first proviso is not met and there is no McCarran-Ferguson exemption. Any such argument is foreclosed by judicial construction of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The McCarran-Ferguson Act has generally been construed to cover arguments that the defendants failed to comply with state law, so long as the state law concerns the regulation of the business of insurance. As the treatise by Areeda and Hovenkamp puts it, \"if the state's insurance industry is `regulated by state law,' then the antitrust laws simply do not apply, notwithstanding that the application of antitrust law in the particular case in no way `invalidate[s], impair[s], or supersede[s]' state law and may even be consistent with it.\" I Areeda and Hovenkamp,<i>Antitrust Law,</i> &#182; 219c, at 339 (2d ed.2000) (alterations in original). Further, \"[a]lthough state insurance regulation is not invalidated or impaired [by application of the Sherman Act], the mere presence of the regulation is sufficient to oust the federal antitrust claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 340.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We dispose of another contention. The final sentence of &#167; 1012(b) provides that federal antitrust law shall nonetheless be applicable \"to the extent such business is not regulated by State law.\" That clause is not helpful to plaintiff on their primary claim of injury &#8212; that the private insurers have agreed not to offer private compulsory insurance &#8212; because the state law precisely covers that topic. Indeed, it requires the provision of the compulsory insurance.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We distinguish between this case and the different situation when an excluded third party provider, say an automobile repair shop, challenged an agreement between the JUA and auto shops.

Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 8051 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This federal antitrust suit challenged certain conduct of private insurers and the new state-created entity under Law 253, the Joint Underwriting Association (\"JUA\"), in the compulsory insurance program. The suit was dismissed at the pleadings stage under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The plaintiffs, who purport to represent a class of harmed consumers, appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants, private insurers and the JUA, have agreed to and created a monopoly in the JUA as to all forms of low-cost compulsory insurance and have boycotted and coerced at least one broker in order to maintain that monopoly. The private insurers and the JUA argue that this monopoly is a result required by the state law. That is untrue. The Puerto Rico statute contemplates (at least as to non-high-risk policies) competition, but then, oddly, creates incentives for defendants to create just such a monopoly as alleged. The claims before us are a different matter: a federal antitrust suit raises different issues than issues of compliance with local statutes. As to one claim only, we reverse the dismissal and remand; we affirm the dismissal of all other claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe the statutory scheme. Before the enactment of Law 253, uninsured drivers caused over $110 million in damages to other vehicles each year in Puerto Rico, and it was estimated that only 25 percent to 30 percent of the vehicles in Puerto Rico were covered under some type of liability insurance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 253 created a compulsory automobile liability insurance system, which, beginning in 1998, provides each insured vehicle owner with $3000 of coverage for damages caused to third parties per accident in exchange for a uniform premium, initially set at $99 for each private passenger vehicle and $148 for each commercial vehicle. 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 8052(j), 8056(a). All \"private insurers,\" defined as insurers with more than 1 percent of the commonwealth's total volume of vehicle liability premiums, <i>id.</i> &#167; 8052(b), are required to offer the compulsory liability insurance in two ways: both as private insurers to a defined class of drivers and as members of the JUA, to which they must belong. <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 8053(d), 8054(a), 8055(a). Law 253 allows private insurers to reject certain applicants for the compulsory insurance pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Insurance Commissioner. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 8054(b). The criteria for rejection are defined by the Insurance Commissioner's Puerto Rican Insurance Rule LXX (\"Rule LXX\"), promulgated in Regulation No. 6254 in December of 2000. Most of the criteria in Rule LXX for permissible rejections identify applicants who are bad drivers or otherwise of high risk.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See</i> Rule LXX, Art. 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The JUA itself provides compulsory liability insurance to all drivers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> including those high-risk drivers whom private insurers are not required to insure. 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8055(b). Vehicle owners may opt out of the compulsory liability insurance scheme by purchasing traditional liability insurance with comparable or better coverage. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 8061; Rule LXX, Art. 12(a). Law 253 appears to require the private insurers also to offer the policy despite the availability of coverage from the JUA, <i>see</i> 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 8054(a), 8055(b), and allows private insurers to apply for approval to sell the compulsory insurance at less than the rate set by the commonwealth. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 8056(c) (\"Any private insurer may submit for the approval of the [Insurance] Commissioner a variation of a uniform percentage to reduce the uniform compulsory liability insurance premium....\"). Some legislative history suggests that Law 253 was meant to encourage competition \"between insurance companies wanting to have a greater number of insured, who will have to extend offers in order to attract them.\" Certified translation of the Daily Sessions Record, Senate of Puerto Rico, Monday, October 9, 1995. As a result, the statutory scheme contemplates competition in compulsory insurance, at least for non-high-risk drivers, between private insurers themselves and between them and the JUA.

To compensate for the fact that the JUA must insure drivers considered too risky by private insurers, all the JUA's profits, including those distributed to private insurers, are exempt from income taxes. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 8055(j). Through the JUA, the risk of insuring these high-risk drivers is thus spread among all the private insurers. The profits distributed to the JUA members (the private insurers) also encompass the profits from the sale of non-high-risk policies insured by the JUA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though created by law, the JUA is \"private in nature, for profit, and ... subject to the provisions of the [Insurance] Code applicable to insurers.\" Rule LXX, Art. 2(c).

Laws Ann. &#167; 8055(c); Rule LXX, Art. 20(e)(3), and the structure and operation of the JUA, and its direction by a board of directors, so that the JUA may accomplish its goals in a \"cost-effective, fair and nondiscriminatory\" manner. 26 P.R.

Four of the five directors on the JUA's board of directors are elected by the members of the JUA, while the fifth director is the officer in charge of the JUA. <i>Id.</i> None of these directors are defined as a state official. The JUA is not an agency of the commonwealth. It has \"general corporate powers,\" such as the power to sue and be sued, to enter into contracts, to hold and use property, etc. <i>See</i> Rule LXX, Art. 20(a); 26 P.R.

The Puerto Rico Mandatory Liability Insurance Uniform Policy, the policy defining the terms of the compulsory liability insurance, is set forth in the Insurance Commissioner's rules. Rule LXX, Art. 22. This policy is \"the sole contract between [the insured] and [the JUA].\" The policy does not contain any specification for the type of repair parts that may be used or provisions governing repair practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Commissioner has established, through regulation, a uniform initial liability determination system to facilitate the investigation, adjustment, and resolution of claims arising under the compulsory liability insurance scheme. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8057; Puerto Rico Insurance Rule LXXI (\"Rule LXXI\"). Rule LXXI sets out portions of the claims making process, including the use of diagrams, which are made part of the regulation, to allocate fault for accidents. Rule LXXI, Arts. 2, 6, 7. However, there is nothing in Rule LXXI concerning the insurers' auto repair arrangements or practices; nor does the Rule govern all claims practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few points bear emphasis. First, the statute, apparently unusually,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> contemplates competition with respect to at least the non-high-risk drivers between the private insurers and also between the private insurers and the JUA. Second, the statute provides a means for insurers who are in competition to seek to sell the compulsory insurance at a lower price than the \"uniform premium.\" 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8056(c). Third, the supervision over the JUA does not cover at least some of the complained-of activities. For example, the Insurance Commissioner, by statute, has considerable supervision over the operating plan and the method of premium distribution, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 8055, 8056; by contrast, there appears to be little supervision of the JUA's specific business decisions (such as how it minimizes its costs in repairs and claims adjustment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff motor vehicle owners, as consumers of the compulsory insurance, brought a putative class action against eleven private insurers and the JUA, alleging that the defendants violated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1 <i>et seq.,</i> the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 12 <i>et seq.,</i> and also Puerto Rico antitrust laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The plaintiffs allege that the private companies, <i>qua</i> companies, have agreed not to sell the compulsory insurance; this, in turn, forces customers to buy from the JUA and puts the JUA in a monopoly position. The plaintiffs allege that the insurance companies choose not to compete with the JUA at least in part because of the tax benefits that non-competition creates. The JUA is tax-exempt; its monopoly over the compulsory liability insurance policies allows all the profits from the premiums, including those from non-high-risk drivers, to accrue tax free to the JUA for later distribution to the member insurance companies. Further, by dealing only through the JUA, the private insurers lower their own costs and inflate their profit by not providing paper copies of policies to insureds and by not utilizing the services of brokers. The plaintiffs allege that Puerto Rico law requires both that policies be provided and that brokers be used. 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 329, 1123. The plaintiffs admit that policies are available both online and at licensing offices. But they argue that these omissions in services reduce the services provided to the insureds. The omissions also, it may be inferred, harm consumers in another way. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants save $4.00 per policy from not having to issue a paper copy of the policy and about 8 percent of the premium per policy for not having to pay a broker's commission. These savings are not passed on to the consumers as they would likely be if the companies in fact competed with each other and with the JUA. Indeed, Law 253 contemplated exactly such a benefit from competition to consumers when it provided that private companies could apply to sell such policies at lower rates. <i>See</i> 26 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 8056(c). But for the acts of the defendants in creating a monopoly, the plaintiffs allege that the premiums for compulsory liability insurance could have been fixed to be \"at least 12% less than the one established.\" The plaintiffs do not challenge the rate set by the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to these horizontal agreements not to compete, the plaintiffs also allege that the private insurers acting in concert coerced brokers to refrain from selling compulsory insurance through private companies. The plaintiffs allege that one broker, Casellas and Co. (\"Casellas\"), attempted to present around 40,000 applications for compulsory insurance to the defendant insurance companies in the year 2000, and the applications were all rejected. The monopoly was evidently not complete since the plaintiffs also allege that one of the defendants, Seguros Triple SSS, Inc., did issue 128 compulsory insurance policies in 2000 (and paid the broker, Casellas, a commission of only 3 percent instead of 8 percent). The plaintiffs allege that the defendants (1) threatened clients of Casellas that they should not do business with Casellas if Casellas continued to attempt to sell compulsory insurance through the private companies and (2) told other members in the insurance community that Casellas's attempts to sell compulsory insurance through private insurers were illegal and that people who did business with Casellas would go to jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also allege that since the JUA has a monopoly in the compulsory insurance market, the JUA is able to use burdensome claims procedures and to require the use of the cheapest car parts, or \"junker parts,\" for repairs, thus harming the consumers. The plaintiffs argue that if the JUA did not have such a monopoly, there would be competition which would produce better options as to the quality of repair parts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to come within the boycott/coercion exception to the insurance business exemption from federal antitrust laws contained in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that the acts of the defendants &#8212; (1) agreements among the private insurers and between them and the JUA not to compete with the JUA and (2) the threats of harm to Casellas &#8212; constitute a boycott and coercion and have caused injuries to consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking all inferences in the plaintiffs' favor, the complaint may be read to establish four categories of injuries, at least with respect to non-high-risk compulsory insurance, to consumers being forced to buy through the JUA's monopoly: (1) consumers do not receive copies of written insurance policies; (2) consumers do not receive the assistance of brokers; (3) these are costs the private insurers would otherwise incur if the private insurers offered comparable compulsory coverage as the JUA; private companies thus save on those costs and could then apply to offer the compulsory policy at an approved rate which is less than the rate set by regulators for the JUA; (4) in any event, the JUA's monopoly means it can, as it does, (a) require that repairs be made only with \"junker\" parts which are inferior to parts which might otherwise be made available in a competitive system, (b) require consumers to go through an unfair process of adjustment of claims based on unreasonable depreciation percentages, (c) require consumers to submit to an unfair system of determining fault with diagrams.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, on report and recommendation from a magistrate judge, dismissed the complaint upon Fed R.

The defendants present six alternate grounds on appeal for affirming the dismissal: (1) there was no antitrust injury so the plaintiffs lack standing to sue under the antitrust laws, (2) the state action immunity doctrine, (3) the filed rate doctrine, (4) the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which purportedly requires referral to the Puerto Rico Insurance Commissioner, (5) the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption of the business of insurance from federal antitrust liability, and (6) the lack of involvement of substantial interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orders granting motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) are subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>Rodi v.

The first (and main claim) is a concerted action by private insurers horizontally to agree not to provide compulsory low-risk insurance to consumers, but to force consumers to buy through the JUA. The second is a claim that the private insurers coerced and intimidated an insurance broker, Casellas, in several ways, such as threatening clients of Casellas not to do business with the broker if the broker continued to attempt to sell compulsory insurance, and telling other members in the insurance community that Casellas's attempts to sell compulsory insurance through private companies were illegal. The plaintiffs allege that the private insurers did so in order to retaliate against the broker for attempting to place customers' orders for compulsory insurance with the private insurers (and not the JUA) and, it may be inferred (taking all inferences in the plaintiffs' favor), to punish Casellas for successfully inducing one insurance company, Seguros Triple SSS, Inc., to accept 128 policies from consumers (thus breaking ranks with the other insurers who had agreed to stay out of the market). The complaint does not allege retaliation directly against Seguros Triple SSS, Inc., the insurer who broke ranks, but only against the broker who induced it to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Boycott: Private Insurers' Agreement Not To Sell</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming there was an agreement not to sell, as alleged, these allegations do not show a boycott.

The defendant insurance companies acting jointly, in concert and in agreement with each other and with [the directors of the JUA], agreed to implement a boycott against all motor vehicle owners whereby none of the ten [sic] private insurance companies would issue to the owners of motor vehicles covered by <i>Law 253, supra,</i> the compulsory insurance policy... and would cause and achieve that all said motor vehicle owners be insured with respect to said compulsory insurance policies only by the [JUA].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">13. The main and principal reason for such concerted scheme and boycott was of course the obtention [sic] of larger profits for all of the defendants. As the [JUA] is exempted from income and other taxes, if the [JUA] became the sole insurer of all vehicles having only compulsory insurance, all the premiums would accrue tax free to the [JUA] to be later distributed among the defendant's [sic] participating insurance companies members of the [JUA]. The monopoly obtained by a successful boycott would lower their costs as no written insurance policies would be issued with a savings of around $4.00. They would also economize in the payment of the commission to the brokers and agents with another savings of 8% of the insurance premium as they would cover the insured directly without the intervention of an agent or broker as required by law when coverage is issued by a private insurer. Other economies would be obtained by the monopolization in the adjustment of the claims and other administrative expenses. As herein further alleged, they have been successful and have been able to accumulate extraordinary profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">19. By April 1999, a \"super syndicate\" was created and the [JUA] was issuing compulsory insurance on virtually the whole universe of vehicle owners operating in Puerto Rico not having traditional insurance....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21. Not only did they concertedly remain inactive in promoting the offering of the compulsory insurance but also went further in their concerted boycott and each of them systematically rejected all applications by brokers and agents to the ten [sic] defendant insurance companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">26. On August 31[st], 2000 it was co-defendant Seguros Triple S, [sic] Inc. who rejected the applications for compulsory insurance submitted by Casellas and Co.

[The defendants' agents] represented to be private detectives investigating insurance fraud. They would take photos and make[ ] statements to the employees and owners of the inspection centers to the effect that Casellas and Co. was committing fraud; that he was forcing and coercing vehicle owners to sign applications; that he was doing illegal acts; that the persons who did business with Casellas could go to jail; that Casellas promises could not be trusted; and other similar disparaging comments casting aspersions against Casellas and Co. with the purpose of intimidating potential customers of compulsory insurance policies and dissuade them from doing to business with Casellas and Co.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">40. The plan and efforts of intimidation and coercion were also practiced by the defendants who threatened clients of Casellas and Co. not to do business with said broker if he would continue with his attempts to sell compulsory insurance and telling members of the insurance business community that what he was doing was illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">55.C.(a) The monopoly has allowed the [JUA] to freely dictate the practices relating to the adjustment of claims allowing said [JUA] to establish unreasonable depreciation percentages for the replacement of new parts to be replaced; repairing vehicles with old parts obtained from \"[j]unkers\"; creating a complicated and unfair system of diagrams for the determination of fault to the detriment of the affected member[s] of the class.

The literal language of the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption contained in the first sentence in &#167; 1012(b) precludes application of federal statutes which \"invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1012(b). An argument could easily be made by the plaintiffs that their claims are entirely consistent with and not in conflict with state law and so the first proviso is not met and there is no McCarran-Ferguson exemption. Any such argument is foreclosed by judicial construction of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The McCarran-Ferguson Act has generally been construed to cover arguments that the defendants failed to comply with state law, so long as the state law concerns the regulation of the business of insurance. As the treatise by Areeda and Hovenkamp puts it, \"if the state's insurance industry is `regulated by state law,' then the antitrust laws simply do not apply, notwithstanding that the application of antitrust law in the particular case in no way `invalidate[s], impair[s], or supersede[s]' state law and may even be consistent with it.\" I Areeda and Hovenkamp,<i>Antitrust Law,</i> &#182; 219c, at 339 (2d ed.2000) (alterations in original). Further, \"[a]lthough state insurance regulation is not invalidated or impaired [by application of the Sherman Act], the mere presence of the regulation is sufficient to oust the federal antitrust claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 340.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We dispose of another contention. The final sentence of &#167; 1012(b) provides that federal antitrust law shall nonetheless be applicable \"to the extent such business is not regulated by State law.\" That clause is not helpful to plaintiff on their primary claim of injury &#8212; that the private insurers have agreed not to offer private compulsory insurance &#8212; because the state law precisely covers that topic.
