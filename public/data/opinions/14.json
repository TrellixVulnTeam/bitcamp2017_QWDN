Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            SOUTER, Associate Justice.           A fuel barge owned and\n\noperated by defendants discharged a substantial amount of oil into\n\nthe   waters     of    Buzzards   Bay    in   southeastern   Massachusetts.\n\nPlaintiffs are owners of residential waterfront property on the bay\n\nwho brought suit as individuals and as members of a proposed class.\n\nThe district court denied class certification, but because the\n\ncourt did not subject the parties’ contentions to the plenary\n\nanalysis that precedent requires, we vacate the judgment and\n\nremand.\n\n                                         I\n\n            Defendants (collectively, Bouchard) owned and operated\n\nboth the tugboat Evening Tide and the fuel barge Bouchard No. 120\n\nin tow across Buzzards Bay on April 27, 2003.           The vessels strayed\n\noff course, and the barge struck a reef west of the clearly marked\n\nshipping channel, spilling as much as 98,000 barrels of fuel oil,\n\nand contaminating about 90 miles of the shore.\n\n            The cleanup efforts were directed initially by a “Unified\n\nCommand,”      drawn    from   the   United    States   Coast   Guard,   the\n\nMassachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and Bouchard,\n\nand later by a “Licensed Site Professional” (LSP) acting on behalf\n\nof Bouchard but under the supervision of the Commonwealth.               The\n\nCommand divided the shoreline into 149 segments, which Shoreline\n\nCleanup Assessment Teams inspected and categorized according to the\n\ndegree of oiling observed (clean, very light, light, moderate,\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fheavy), the final tally being that 120 of the 149 segments were\n\ncontaminated.      The   observations   were   collected   along   with\n\ninformation from other sources and used to produce maps identifying\n\nboth the location of oil and the degree of oiling along the water’s\n\nedge.    The LSP then used the same segment and degree-of-oiling\n\nreferences to evaluate the effectiveness of the cleanup efforts,\n\nwhich the LSP declared complete as to any segment that posed no\n\nsignificant risk to human health, safety, public welfare, or the\n\nenvironment. Those segments subject to very light or light oiling,\n\nand those including stretches of sandy beach subject to moderate\n\noiling, were certified to pose no such risk in May 2004.            The\n\nsegments remaining (subject to moderate and heavy oiling) were,\n\nwith two apparent exceptions, certified in August 2006,1 and the\n\nCommonwealth approved the LSP’s comprehensive assessment in October\n\n2006.\n\n            Plaintiffs sued in April 2006, raising three claims, one\n\nunder Massachusetts General Law ch. 21E, § 5 (imposing strict\n\nliability for damage to real property on the owner of a vessel from\n\nwhich oil has spilled), a second for violation of Massachusetts\n\nGeneral Law ch. 91, § 59A (providing double damages for the\n\nnegligent discharge of petroleum), and a third for common law\n\nnuisance.    Plaintiffs moved the district court to certify a class\n\n\n     1\n       Despite the late date of certification, it appears that\nthere were no documented closures of recreational areas following\nthe spill.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fconsisting of all persons having an interest in property damaged by\n\nthe    spill,     save   for   shorefront       residents    of   the    town     of\n\nMattapoisett, who had been certified as their own class in a state\n\ncourt action against the defendants.\n\n            The     district    court    denied     the     motion    for      class\n\ncertification upon making a finding under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 23(b)(3) that common issues of law and fact do not\n\npredominate throughout the many potential claims of those who own,\n\nor own interests in, the bay shoreline.                The judge noted that\n\nBouchard has not conceded liability to any individual plaintiffs,\n\nthat   on   the   public   nuisance     claim    plaintiffs    must     show    both\n\nunreasonable interference and special injury to each claimant, and\n\nthat plaintiffs must establish compensatory damages specific to\n\neach piece of property.        The court relied heavily on the denial of\n\nclass certification in Church v. General Electric Co., 138 F. Supp.\n\n2d 169 (D. Mass. 2001), which had stressed that recovery for\n\ncontamination of land downstream from a point of toxic discharge\n\ninto a river would require parcel-by-parcel determinations as to\n\ninjury and damages.\n\n                                        II\n\n            Decisions on class certification must rest on rigorous\n\nanalysis, Gen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982); Smilow\n\nv. Sw Bell Mobile Sys., 323 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2003), a standard\n\nthat we think is not met by the district court’s opinion, which\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\flisted the elements to be proven by evidence that ultimately must\n\nspeak to individual claims, and cited one precedent example among\n\ncases going different ways.          Although the district court’s fact\n\nfinding was too sparse to provide a prudent basis for us to say\n\nthat a class should have been certified, we can say that plaintiffs\n\npresented substantial evidence of predominating common issues that\n\ncalled for a searching evaluation.\n\n            To begin with, Church does not support a general rule\n\nthat pollution torts charged against a single defendant escape\n\nclass treatment on the ground that the requirements to show injury,\n\ncause and compensatory amount must be sustainable as to specific\n\nplaintiffs.    If that were the law, the point of the Rule 23(b)(3)\n\nprovision for class treatment would be blunted beyond utility, as\n\nevery plaintiff must show specific entitlement to recovery, and\n\nstill Rule 23 has to be read to authorize class actions in some set\n\nof cases where seriatim litigation would promise such modest\n\nrecoveries as to be economically impracticable.                   Amchem Prods.,\n\nInc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997); Smilow, 323 F.3d at 41.\n\nThus the Supreme Court has said, “[e]ven mass tort cases arising\n\nfrom   a    common   cause      or   disaster     may,    depending         on   the\n\ncircumstances, satisfy the predominance requirement.”                Amchem, 521\n\nU.S.   at   625.     Although    Church     is   one    example    of   a    single\n\ntortfeasor-multiple victim case in which certification was denied,\n\nothers in the same genre go the other way.             See, e.g., In re Methyl\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fTertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Prods. Liab. Litig., 241 F.R.D. 435,\n\n447 & nn. 98-104 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (collecting cases involving a\n\nsingle incident or cause of harm where certification was granted);\n\nsee also Mejdrech v. Met-Coil Sys. Corp., 319 F.3d 910, 910-11 (7th\n\nCir. 2003) (noting that case law on “the appropriateness of class\n\naction treatment in pollution cases” is divided and collecting\n\ncases).   Whether Church’s reasoning survives Smilow is a question\n\nwe need not address; here, it is enough to note such counter\n\nexamples on the books, and the need for a trial court to come to\n\ngrips with the actual alternatives of common versus individual\n\nlitigation in the specific circumstances.\n\n          When that is done on remand, the focus will be on the\n\nplaintiffs’ claim that common evidence will suffice to prove\n\ninjury, causation and compensatory damages for at least a very\n\nsubstantial   proportion   of   the    claims   that   can   be   brought   by\n\nputative class members. The proffer of common evidence goes beyond\n\nBouchard’s admission of negligence in causing the spill, and\n\nincludes the contamination and clean-up records that will be\n\noffered to show harm to individual ownership parcels. Bouchard, to\n\nbe sure, says not so fast, for it denies that records of the spill\n\nand its aftermath are exact enough to serve as proof keyed to very\n\nmany specific parcels, and the briefs before us contend strenuously\n\nover the evidentiary adequacy of the documentation in question.\n\nBut Bouchard’s very opposition to the use of the arguably helpful\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\frecords seems to promise that most or all cases, if individually\n\nlitigated, would require repetitious resolution of an objection by\n\nBouchard that is common to each one of them.                       Bouchard’s position,\n\nin other words, apparently guarantees a crucial common issue of\n\ngreat importance in the event of individual litigation.\n\n           Bouchard has also made it abundantly clear that appraisal\n\nmethodology     will        be    another     highly   significant         common    issue.\n\nPlaintiffs have offered affidavits of their expert economist in\n\nsupport   of     a    class-wide        methodology       for      appraising       damages\n\ndepending on severity and duration of contamination.                           Bouchard’s\n\neffort to discredit this approach apparently portends a fight over\n\nadmissibility and weight that would be identical in at least a high\n\nproportion of cases if tried individually.\n\n           It is enough to say here that Bouchard’s arguments in\n\nthis appeal appear to show that substantial and serious common\n\nissues would arise over and over in potential individual cases.\n\nIndeed,   the        only        apparent   mitigation        of    this    prospect     of\n\nduplicative litigation lies in the possibility that not many\n\nindividual actions would be brought if separate actions were the\n\nonly   course,       and     this     implicates       the    second       condition    for\n\ncertification        under        paragraph    (3),    that     class      litigation    be\n\nsuperior to a string of individual plaintiffs going alone.                           While\n\nsuperiority is a separate base to be touched, it is addressed by\n\nmany of the considerations that inform a trial court’s judgment\n\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fcall about how clearly predominant the common issues must be.                 See\n\nSmilow, 323 F.3d at 41-42.    Here there is evidence that may well go\n\nto the very reason for Rule 23(b)(3), mentioned before (i.e., to\n\nmake room for claims that plaintiffs could never afford to press\n\none by one), since the record contains one estimate that potential\n\nindividual recoveries are probably in the $12 to $39 thousand\n\nrange. Given the elements of injury, causation and compensation on\n\nwhich Bouchard intends to join issue, there is a real question\n\nwhether the putative class members could sensibly litigate on their\n\nown for these amounts of damages, especially with the prospect of\n\nexpert   testimony    required.    Like       predominance,    the    issue   of\n\nsuperiority is thus a serious one in these circumstances and should\n\nbe addressed thoroughly.\n\n           We repeat that the district court’s spare treatment of\n\nthe contending factual claims makes it inadvisable for us to decide\n\nhere whether denying class certification (on damages alone or on\n\nall issues, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(c)(4); Smilow, 323 F.3d at\n\n40-41)   would   be   an   abuse   of    discretion.          But    ruling   on\n\ncertification    without   grappling     in    detail   with    the    parties’\n\ncontending proffers and arguments stopped short of exercising\n\ninformed discretion, and for that reason we vacate and remand for\n\nplenary consideration.2     Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n     2\n        Bouchard argues for affirmance on grounds of issue\npreclusion, invoking the judgment of the Massachusetts state court\ncertifying a class limited to owners of property in Mattapoisett,\n\n                                   -8-\n\f          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\ninstead of the baywide class originally requested by the named\nplaintiffs. But that judgment has no preclusive effect against\nthese plaintiffs, who were neither parties to the state action nor\nin privity with those who were.     See Migra v. Warren City Sch.\nDist. Bd. of Educ., 465 U.S. 75, 81 (1984) (preclusive effect in\nfederal court of state-court judgment is determined by state law);\nSena v. Commonwealth, 629 N.E. 2d 986, 992 (Mass. 1994); Mass.\nProp. Ins. Underwriting Ass’n v. Norrington, 481 N.E.2d 1364, 1366-\n67 (Mass. 1985) (“A nonparty to a prior adjudication can be bound\nby it only where the nonparty’s interest was represented by a party\nto the prior litigation.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

If that were the law, the point of the Rule 23(b)(3)\n\nprovision for class treatment would be blunted beyond utility, as\n\nevery plaintiff must show specific entitlement to recovery, and\n\nstill Rule 23 has to be read to authorize class actions in some set\n\nof cases where seriatim litigation would promise such modest\n\nrecoveries as to be economically impracticable.

Whether Church’s reasoning survives Smilow is a question\n\nwe need not address; here, it is enough to note such counter\n\nexamples on the books, and the need for a trial court to come to\n\ngrips with the actual alternatives of common versus individual\n\nlitigation in the specific circumstances.\n\n          When that is done on remand, the focus will be on the\n\nplaintiffs’ claim that common evidence will suffice to prove\n\ninjury, causation and compensatory damages for at least a very\n\nsubstantial   proportion   of   the    claims   that   can   be   brought   by\n\nputative class members. The proffer of common evidence goes beyond\n\nBouchard’s admission of negligence in causing the spill, and\n\nincludes the contamination and clean-up records that will be\n\noffered to show harm to individual ownership parcels. Bouchard, to\n\nbe sure, says not so fast, for it denies that records of the spill\n\nand its aftermath are exact enough to serve as proof keyed to very\n\nmany specific parcels, and the briefs before us contend strenuously\n\nover the evidentiary adequacy of the documentation in question.\n\nBut Bouchard’s very opposition to the use of the arguably helpful\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\frecords seems to promise that most or all cases, if individually\n\nlitigated, would require repetitious resolution of an objection by\n\nBouchard that is common to each one of them.                       Bouchard’s position,\n\nin other words, apparently guarantees a crucial common issue of\n\ngreat importance in the event of individual litigation.\n\n           Bouchard has also made it abundantly clear that appraisal\n\nmethodology     will        be    another     highly   significant         common    issue.\n\nPlaintiffs have offered affidavits of their expert economist in\n\nsupport   of     a    class-wide        methodology       for      appraising       damages\n\ndepending on severity and duration of contamination.                           Bouchard’s\n\neffort to discredit this approach apparently portends a fight over\n\nadmissibility and weight that would be identical in at least a high\n\nproportion of cases if tried individually.\n\n           It is enough to say here that Bouchard’s arguments in\n\nthis appeal appear to show that substantial and serious common\n\nissues would arise over and over in potential individual cases.\n\nIndeed,   the        only        apparent   mitigation        of    this    prospect     of\n\nduplicative litigation lies in the possibility that not many\n\nindividual actions would be brought if separate actions were the\n\nonly   course,       and     this     implicates       the    second       condition    for\n\ncertification        under        paragraph    (3),    that     class      litigation    be\n\nsuperior to a string of individual plaintiffs going alone.                           While\n\nsuperiority is a separate base to be touched, it is addressed by\n\nmany of the considerations that inform a trial court’s judgment\n\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fcall about how clearly predominant the common issues must be.                 See\n\nSmilow, 323 F.3d at 41-42.    Here there is evidence that may well go\n\nto the very reason for Rule 23(b)(3), mentioned before (i.e., to\n\nmake room for claims that plaintiffs could never afford to press\n\none by one), since the record contains one estimate that potential\n\nindividual recoveries are probably in the $12 to $39 thousand\n\nrange. Given the elements of injury, causation and compensation on\n\nwhich Bouchard intends to join issue, there is a real question\n\nwhether the putative class members could sensibly litigate on their\n\nown for these amounts of damages, especially with the prospect of\n\nexpert   testimony    required.    Like       predominance,    the    issue   of\n\nsuperiority is thus a serious one in these circumstances and should\n\nbe addressed thoroughly.\n\n           We repeat that the district court’s spare treatment of\n\nthe contending factual claims makes it inadvisable for us to decide\n\nhere whether denying class certification (on damages alone or on\n\nall issues, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(c)(4); Smilow, 323 F.3d at\n\n40-41)   would   be   an   abuse   of    discretion.          But    ruling   on\n\ncertification    without   grappling     in    detail   with    the    parties’\n\ncontending proffers and arguments stopped short of exercising\n\ninformed discretion, and for that reason we vacate and remand for\n\nplenary consideration.2     Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n     2\n        Bouchard argues for affirmance on grounds of issue\npreclusion, invoking the judgment of the Massachusetts state court\ncertifying a class limited to owners of property in Mattapoisett,\n\n                                   -8-\n\f          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\ninstead of the baywide class originally requested by the named\nplaintiffs. But that judgment has no preclusive effect against\nthese plaintiffs, who were neither parties to the state action nor\nin privity with those who were.     See Migra v. Warren City Sch.\nDist.
