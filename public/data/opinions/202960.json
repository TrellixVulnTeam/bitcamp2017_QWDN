Gonzales as respondent.\n     **\n      Of the      Northern   District     of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f          Per    Curiam.    Efrain   Palma-Mazariegos,   a   Guatemalan\n\nnational, entered the United States without permission in December\n\n1991, and filed for asylum shortly after. \"Nothing happened\" until\n\nthe INS initiated removal proceedings some eight years later.\n\nPalma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 2005).       On\n\nOctober 6, 2003, an immigration judge rejected Palma's applications\n\nfor asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United\n\nNations   Convention    Against   Torture,   but   granted   voluntary\n\ndeparture.   The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed on\n\nFebruary 28, 2005, and this court denied a petition for review.\n\nId.\n\n          On May 26, 2005, while his original petition for review\n\nwas pending in this court, Palma filed with the BIA a timely motion\n\nto reopen proceedings; his wife had just become an American citizen\n\nin April 2005.     Palma had married her in November 2000 (a few\n\nmonths after his removal proceedings began), at which point she was\n\na permanent resident.      Soon thereafter, on April 16, 2001, she\n\nfiled an I-130 visa petition on his behalf.\n\n          As the spouse of a United States citizen, Palma was now\n\nan \"immediate relative,\" 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i) (2000), and\n\nthus exempt from the worldwide and numerical limitations imposed by\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1151(a) on immigrant visas.        Id. § 1151(b).      Palma\n\ntherefore sought a remand by the Board, so that he could apply for\n\nan adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i), which allows\n\n                                  -2-\n\faliens physically present in the country to apply for permanent\n\nresidence     if   (among   other   requirements)     immigrant    visas   are\n\n\"immediately available\" to them.\n\n            The BIA denied on two grounds the motion to reopen.\n\nFirst, it found that Palma had not provided \"clear and convincing\"\n\nevidence that the marriage was bona fide, as is required under its\n\ndecision in In re Velarde, 23 I. & N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002).\n\nSecond, Palma did not submit with his motion a completed I-485\n\napplication to adjust status, as the regulations require. 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(c).\n\n            Palma petitioned this court for review of the BIA's\n\ndenial of his motion to reopen.             He also filed with the BIA a\n\nmotion to reconsider its decision.          There was some confusion as to\n\nwhether the latter motion was timely; the BIA initially denied the\n\nmotion as time-barred but later, after sorting out the confusion,\n\nit appeared that negligence by the mail carrier was involved and\n\nthe   Board    reconsidered     the   matter    sua    sponte     and   denied\n\nreconsideration on the merits.\n\n            In his brief in this court, Palma challenges both the\n\ndenial of his motion to reopen, and the denial of his motion to\n\nreconsider, which he claims the BIA failed to adjudicate on the\n\nmerits.     But he appealed only the former order, and so we lack\n\njurisdiction to consider the latter.           Each denial constitutes a\n\nfinal BIA order that must be appealed independently.               DaCosta v.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fGonzales, 449 F.3d 45, 50 n.4 (1st Cir. 2006); cf. Ven v. Ashcroft,\n\n386 F.3d 357, 359 (1st Cir. 2004).               Anyway, the BIA did consider--\n\nand reject on the merits--Palma's motion for reconsideration once\n\nit realized that \"his failure timely to file [that motion] was due\n\nto the mail carrier's negligence.\"\n\n          Turning to the motion to reopen, we review for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, reversing only if the BIA's denial rested on an error\n\nof law or constituted arbitrary or capricious decision-making.\n\nFalae v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Until recently, a motion to reopen to seek adjustment of\n\nstatus could only be granted if the visa petition on which the\n\nalien intended to base his status adjustment application had\n\nalready been approved.        Velarde, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 255.               The BIA\n\nchanged that policy, recognizing the unfairness caused by slow\n\nprocessing of visa petitions combined with strict filing deadlines\n\nfor motions to reopen.        Such motions may now be granted even on the\n\nbasis of unadjudicated visa petitions if the alien meets a series\n\nof   requirements,     including       the       presentation   of    \"clear       and\n\nconvincing   evidence    indicating          a    strong   likelihood       that   the\n\n[alien's] marriage is bona fide.\"                Id. at 256.\n\n          The requirement of clear and convincing evidence--which\n\nis important to this petition for review--is directed at the same\n\npurpose as the old requirement that the visa petition be approved\n\nin   advance--to     ensure     that   the        motion   reflects     a    genuine\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fentitlement to relief and is not merely a delay tactic.              Because\n\nthe marriage occurred after removal proceedings had begun, the same\n\nrequirement would appear to apply--the rationale is different but\n\nobvious--even if the application had been filed before the removal\n\norder was issued by the immigration judge and Board.           8 C.F.R. §\n\n245.1(c)(8)(iii)(F).\n\n          The BIA found that Palma had not presented \"clear and\n\nconvincing\" evidence that his marriage was bona fide. As evidence,\n\nhe submitted affidavits from himself and his wife, a joint lease,\n\na utility bill in his name, a phone bill in his wife's name, his\n\nwife's car insurance policy, several joint tax returns, and some\n\nphotos.   The   BIA    found   the   bills   and   the   insurance   policy\n\nunconvincing since neither included the names of both Palma and his\n\nwife; it also noted the lack of evidence that assets or liability\n\nhad been co-mingled during the marriage.\n\n          The Board's explanation is debatable.          The fairly recent\n\nbills do suggest that Palma and his wife were residing at the same\n\naddress, as does the lease (which dates back to 1999).          Palma did\n\nnot submit evidence of any joint bank accounts (at least not at\n\nthis stage) but the couple did file joint taxes and his wife's\n\naffidavit indicates that she is unemployed and supported by Palma.1\n\n\n\n     1\n      On appeal Palma attempts to explain why he was not listed on\nthe insurance policy (he cannot drive due to medical problems), but\nthat explanation offered for the first time on appeal comes too\nlate.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fIn sum, there was no clear flaw or obvious discrepancy in the\n\nevidence.     At the same time the clear and convincing evidence\n\nrequirement is stiff and the Board did weigh the relevant factors\n\nand seems ultimately to have decided that the high threshold simply\n\nhad not been crossed.\n\n            We need not resolve the matter because the BIA's second\n\nground is more straightforward and is independently sufficient to\n\njustify the denial.          The regulations explicitly mandate that a\n\n\"motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an\n\napplication for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate\n\napplication for relief and all supporting documentation.\" 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(c).        Palma's motion to reopen was for the purpose of\n\nacting on an application for relief--to adjust status--yet was not\n\naccompanied by that application.\n\n            Although       the    BIA   has    on   occasion      granted     motions\n\nnotwithstanding the absence of a completed application for relief,\n\nthat practice has been limited to situations where the government\n\njoins the motion and thus provides \"a sufficient cure for the\n\n[alien's] procedural failure to submit a Form I-485.\"                          In re\n\nYewondwosen, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1025, 1026 (BIA 1997).                      The BIA's\n\nwillingness    to    overlook       procedural      default      in   those   unique\n\ncircumstances       does    not    render      an   abuse   of    discretion      its\n\nunwillingness to do so here.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          The result appears harsh--Palma did submit his I-485 a\n\nfew weeks later with his motion for reconsideration--but the\n\nrequirement for the completed application was straightforward. The\n\nBoard is already overwhelmed and, lest its proceedings be further\n\ndelayed, is entitled to insist that the required documents be\n\nsupplied at the outset.   Even immigration proceedings must at some\n\npoint come to an end.\n\n          The petition is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790569\"><a href=\"/opinion/790569/michael-olusean-falae-aka-vincent-olanrewaju-adeyemi-v-alberto-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Until recently, a motion to reopen to seek adjustment of status could only be granted if the visa petition on which the alien intended to base his status adjustment application had already been approved. <i>Velarde,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 255. The BIA changed that policy, recognizing the unfairness caused by slow processing of visa petitions combined with strict filing deadlines for motions to reopen. Such motions may now be granted even on the basis of unadjudicated visa petitions if the alien meets a series of requirements, including the presentation of \"clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that the [alien's] marriage is bona fide.\" <i>Id.</i> at 256.</p>\n<p>The requirement of clear and convincing evidence  which is important to this petition for review-is directed at the same purpose as the old requirement that the visa petition be approved in advanceto ensure that the motion reflects a genuine entitlement to relief and is not merely a delay tactic. Because the marriage occurred after removal proceedings had begun, the same requirement would appear to apply  the rationale is different but obvious  even if the application had been filed before the removal order was issued by the immigration judge and Board. 8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8)(iii)(F).</p>\n<p>The BIA found that Palma had not presented \"clear and convincing\" evidence that his marriage was bona fide. As evidence, he submitted affidavits from himself and his wife, a joint lease, a utility bill in his name, a phone bill in his wife's name, his wife's car insurance policy, several joint tax returns, and some photos. The BIA found the bills and the insurance policy unconvincing since neither included the names of both Palma and his wife; it also noted the lack of evidence that assets or liabilities had been co-mingled during the marriage.</p>\n<p>The Board's explanation is debatable. The fairly recent bills do suggest that Palma and his wife were residing at the same address, as does the lease (which dates back to 1999). Palma did not submit evidence of any joint bank accounts (at least not at this stage) but the couple did file joint taxes and his wife's affidavit indicates that she is unemployed and supported by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*147</span> Palma.<sup>[1]</sup> In sum, there was no clear flaw or obvious discrepancy in the evidence. At the same time the clear and convincing evidence requirement is stiff and the Board did weigh the relevant factors and seems ultimately to have decided that the high threshold simply had not been crossed.</p>\n<p>We need not resolve the matter because the BIA's second ground is more straight-forward and is independently sufficient to justify the denial. The regulations explicitly mandate that a \"motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Palma's motion to reopen was for the purpose of acting on an application for relief  to adjust status  yet was not accompanied by that application.</p>\n<p>Although the BIA has on occasion granted motions notwithstanding the absence of a completed application for relief, that practice has been limited to situations where the government joins the motion and thus provides \"a sufficient cure for the [alien's] procedural failure to submit a Form I-485.\" <i>In re Yewondwosen,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1025, 1026 (BIA 1997). The BIA's willingness to overlook procedural default in those unique circumstances does not render an abuse of discretion its unwillingness to do so here.</p>\n<p>The result appears harshPalma did submit his I-485 a few weeks later with his motion for reconsiderationbut the requirement for the completed application was straightforward. The Board is already overwhelmed and, lest its proceedings be further delayed, is entitled to insist that the required documents be supplied at the outset. Even immigration proceedings must at some point come to an end.</p>\n<p>The petition is <i>denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Pursuant to Fed.
