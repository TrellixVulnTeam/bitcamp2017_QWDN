Raymond L. Acosta, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                   Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n\n                            and Restani,* Judge.\n\n\n     Mariángela Tirado-Vales, with whom Ricardo Collazo-Suarez was\non brief, for appellant.\n     Miriam González Olivencia for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              November 3, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *Chief Judge of the United States Court of International\nTrade, sitting by designation.\n\f               Per   curiam.    Plaintiff         Iris   Monrouzeau     appeals   the\n\ndistrict court's entry of summary judgment in favor of defendant\n\nAsociacíon del Hospital del Maestro, Inc. (Hospital), on the ground\n\nthat her suit, brought pursuant to the Emergency Treatment Active\n\nLabor Act (EMTALA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd, following the death of her\n\nmother at the Hospital, was untimely. Monrouzeau concedes that the\n\nsuit was brought outside EMTALA's two-year statute of limitations,\n\nbut asserts that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether\n\nan earlier malpractice action filed by her against the Hospital and\n\nseveral of its physicians in the Puerto Rico Court of First\n\nInstance should toll the running of EMTALA's limitations period.\n\n               Monrouzeau's argument is largely premised on an assertion\n\nthat she timely pleaded an EMTALA claim in the Commonwealth court\n\naction.       The Hospital contests whether Monrouzeau's Commonwealth\n\ncourt       complaint   set    forth   an    EMTALA      claim,   and   Monrouzeau's\n\nalternative argument in favor of equitable tolling -- that she did\n\nnot learn that she had a viable EMTALA claim until she received a\n\ncopy of her expert report in the Commonwealth court action (after\n\nthe EMTALA limitations period had run)1 -- tends to support the\n\n\n        1\n      Monrouzeau's late discovery of her federal cause of action\ndoes not make this an appropriate circumstance to apply the\nequitable tolling doctrine. This sparingly applied doctrine, see\nIrwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89,96 (1990), is\ngenerally available only where circumstances beyond the plaintiff's\ncontrol precluded timely filing, see Neverson v. Farquharson, 366\nF.3d 32, 42 (1st Cir. 2003). And here, there is no reason to think\nthat Monrouzeau's late discovery of her federal cause of action was\nbeyond her control.\n\n                                            -2-\n\fHospital's position.   But even if we assume, solely for the sake of\n\nargument, that the Commonwealth pleadings did set forth an EMTALA\n\nclaim, and even if we further assume, over the Hospital's contrary\n\nargument, that the running of EMTALA's limitations period, in some\n\ncases, may be equitably tolled, Monrouzeau is not entitled to\n\ntolling here.\n\n          That Monrouzeau timely pleaded her federal claim in the\n\nCommonwealth court action -- where she was allowed to have it\n\nadjudicated, see Burks v. St. Joseph Hosp., 596 N.W. 391, 400\n\n(Wisc. 1999) -- does not entitle her to replead it beyond the\n\nstatutory window in this parallel federal lawsuit.   See Ramirez de\n\nArellano v. Alvarez de Choudens, 575 F.2d 315, 319 (1st Cir. 1978)\n\n(\"[P]rior judicial actions generally do not toll the statute of\n\nlimitations, no matter how close their relationship to the case at\n\nbar.\"); accord Drumm v. Sizeler Realty Corp., 817 F.2d 1195, 1196\n\nn.2 (5th Cir. 1987); Pace Indus., Inc. v. Three Phoenix Co., 813\n\nF.2d 234, 240 (9th Cir. 1987).   So far as we can tell, there are no\n\nadditional equities on Monrouzeau's side favoring tolling.      The\n\nequitable tolling doctrine is not a means by which a litigant may\n\nbelatedly reconsider a choice to pursue a federal claim in a non-\n\nfederal forum.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f",
