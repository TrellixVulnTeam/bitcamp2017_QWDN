Defendant-appellant Luis Rivera\n\nSiaca (“Rivera”) appeals a decision of the Bankruptcy Appellate\n\nPanel (“BAP”) subjecting him to over $3 million in liability for\n\nretaining payments in breach of trust.              The progenitor of this\n\nprocedural gem, plaintiff-appellee DCC Operating, Inc. (“DCC”),\n\noriginally brought suit in diversity in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico. After obtaining a favorable\n\nsummary judgment ruling, nondiverse debtors-in-possession Coachman,\n\nInc. (“Coachman”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary Olympic Mills\n\nCorp. (“Olympic Mills”), intervened, requesting that the case be\n\nreferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico.   Digesting the issue for several months, the district\n\ncourt eventually referred the case to the bankruptcy court, which,\n\nover a year later, awarded damages and entered final judgment.\n\nRivera appealed the unfavorable ruling to the BAP; unsuccessful\n\nthere as well, he appealed to us.\n\n           Before we reach the merits of this appeal, we must cut\n\nthrough a factual and procedural knot of Gordian complexity.                  This\n\ntask calls upon us to examine at the outset whether we have\n\nsubject-matter      jurisdiction    or   if    it   was    destroyed    by    the\n\nintervention   of    nondiverse    intervenors;     in     turn,    whether   the\n\nintervenors are indispensable; and ultimately, whether remand would\n\nbe appropriate to sort all this out.           We cut the knot by stepping\n\nforward   to   address   these     issues     without     remand.      Once   the\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fprocedural issues are resolved we move to the merits, which by\n\ncomparison present a fairly straightforward issue for resolution.\n\nAfter careful review, we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n                  A.   The Hampshire Venture.\n\n                  This contract dispute began with a $2 million bridge loan\n\nessentially to finance the acquisition of sweaters.1                The lender,\n\nDevelopment Capital Ventures, LP (“DCV”), is an investment company\n\nthat provides venture capital to small businesses.                 The borrower,\n\nnow-defunct Coachman, was a small business operating in Puerto\n\nRico.       In connection with the bridge loan, which was to be made in\n\ntwo $1 million installments (one on February 25, 2000, the other on\n\nMarch       10,     2000),   Coachman   delivered   to   DCV   a    “CONVERTIBLE\n\nSUBORDINATED DEMAND NOTE” (the “Note”) on February 24, 2000.                The\n\nNote had a maturity date of June 30, 2000,2 and provided for the\n\nconversion of the principal amount into company stock at DCV’s\n\noption at any time before the balance was paid in full, or\n\nautomatically upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.\n\n                  The Note identified, described, and attached as annexes\n\nfour documents that bore upon the bridge loan.             Annex A was a term\n\n\n        1\n       A bridge loan, also known as a swing loan, is a short-term\nhigh-interest loan to finance a discrete, typically time-sensitive,\nproject or venture.\n        2\n       An amendment to the Note extended the maturity date to\nJanuary 31, 2001, and increased the principal amount to $2.5\nmillion.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fsheet detailing the conversion of stock; it, along with a guaranty\n\nembodied in annex C, is not involved in this dispute.                  Annex B was\n\na document entitled “ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT,” which the Note\n\nidentified as the “Hampshire Agreement” and defined in ¶ 1.(viii)\n\nas follows:\n\n                   “Hampshire Agreement” shall mean the\n              agreement between the Company [Coachman] and\n              Hampshire Corporation (“Hampshire”) whereby\n              the Company establishes a subsidiary to\n              acquire inventory and equipment from Hampshire\n              and Hampshire guarantees to acquire a minimum\n              of 12 million sweaters from such subsidiary\n              over the next five (5) years, or an average\n              annual purchase of 2.4 million sweater units.\n              See draft agreement under Annex B.\n\nThe   draft     version    of   the    Hampshire      Agreement     identified   the\n\n“subsidiary”       referenced          above     as      Glamourette/OM,         Inc.\n\n(“Glamourette”).3     The last document attached to the Note (as annex\n\nD) was a “SUBORDINATION AND STANDBY AGREEMENT” (the “Subordination\n\nAgreement”).        According     to     the    terms    of   the   Note,   Rivera,\n\nCoachman’s affluent chairman and sometimes lender, was required to\n\nexecute the Subordination Agreement as a condition precedent to the\n\nbridge loan.\n\n              Rivera executed the Subordination Agreement, along with\n\nthe Note (on behalf of Coachman), on February 24, 2000.                     At that\n\ntime, Coachman owed Rivera approximately $5.75 million on past\n\nloans,    but    neither    the   Note    nor    the    Subordination    Agreement\n\n\n      3\n       The record reflects that, at some point after January 24,\n2000, the entity’s name was changed to Glamourette/OG, Inc.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fidentified the particular loans to be subordinated to DCV’s bridge\n\nloan.       Almost a year later, Coachman fell into default.    DCV’s\n\ncorporate general partner, DCC, demanded that Coachman pay its\n\nbalance.      When Coachman took no action to satisfy its obligations\n\nunder the Note, DCC demanded that Rivera pay all amounts due from\n\npayments he had received from Coachman or its affiliates over the\n\nprevious year.      (Between February 24, 2000, and October 18, 2001,\n\nRivera made a series of loans to Coachman, Olympic Mills, and\n\nGlamourette totaling $16.6 million, and was repaid at least $5.6\n\nmillion.)      On November 7, 2001, DCC, alleging various state-law\n\nclaims under the Subordination Agreement, sued Rivera in diversity\n\nin federal district court.       Shortly thereafter, on November 26,\n\n2001, Coachman, Olympic Mills, and Glamourette filed in bankruptcy\n\ncourt voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11.4\n\n              B.   The Litigation.\n\n              Discovery proceeded in district court for almost a year\n\nbefore DCC and Rivera filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nDCC argued that Rivera violated his trust obligations under the\n\nSubordination Agreement by retaining certain payments from Coachman\n\nor its affiliates.     Specifically, DCC contended that, pursuant to\n\n¶ 4 of the Subordination Agreement, Rivera was required to forward\n\n\n\n        4\n       The separately-filed bankruptcy petitions were consolidated\nwithin a week. On December 19, 2002, the bankruptcy court granted\nGlamourette’s motion for conversion to chapter 7 liquidation;\nCoachman and Olympic Mills followed suit on May 4, 2004.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fsuch payments to DCV for application against the bridge loan.\n\nRivera responded that the Subordination Agreement covered only\n\nthose loans made before January 24, 2000. The disbursements he had\n\nreceived, Rivera explained, were in payment of loans made after the\n\nexecution of the Subordination Agreement.           The district court\n\ndisagreed and ruled that the Subordination Agreement unambiguously\n\ncovered the repayment of all loans, whenever made, until Coachman\n\nsatisfied its obligations under the Note.         However, the district\n\ncourt reserved decision on the amount of damages hoping that, in\n\nlight of its ruling, the parties would reach an agreement on their\n\nown.   The district court entered partial summary judgment on\n\nDecember 16, 2002.\n\n            Nine days later, Rivera moved to dismiss the case for\n\nfailure to join Coachman and Olympic Mills. Rivera argued, for the\n\nfirst time, that these parties were necessary, indispensable, and\n\n(importantly)   nondiverse   by   virtue   of   their   incorporation   in\n\nDelaware.   (DCC was a Delaware corporation as well.)       The next day,\n\nCoachman and Olympic Mills filed in the district court through\n\nspecial counsel a motion to intervene as of right under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 24(a)(2).     Citing DCC’s recent victory, Coachman and\n\nOlympic Mills argued, without actually asserting any claim, that\n\nthe payments to Rivera “may be subject to the avoidance powers”\n\ngranted to them as debtors-in-possession.        Because their interest\n\nin these payments “may preempt” that of DCC, and because “DCC’s\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fattempt to collect the funds for its own benefit implicate[s]\n\nnumerous    core    bankruptcy      issues,”      Coachman      and    Olympic    Mills\n\nrequested that the case be referred to the bankruptcy court for\n\nfurther adjudication.            In a text order entered on December 31,\n\n2002, the district court granted the motion to intervene without\n\ndiscussion (and without addressing Rivera’s motion or soliciting\n\nDCC’s position on either motion), and ordered the parties to appear\n\nat   a   status    conference      on   January      16,   2003,      to   address   the\n\nintervenors’       referral      request.      DCC    filed     a   motion      opposing\n\ndismissal, intervention, and referral on January 15.\n\n            At the status conference, DCC said that it would consent\n\nto referral only if Rivera would deposit over $5 million with the\n\nbankruptcy court.         The district court gave Rivera until January 24\n\nto respond, set a briefing schedule on the referral question if\n\nRivera declined DCC’s offer (which he did), and stated that the\n\ncase would proceed to trial on May 27, 2003 if the case were not\n\nreferred.     Coachman and Olympic Mills submitted a memorandum on\n\nFebruary 24 pursuant to the scheduling order, but, short-circuiting\n\nthe process, initiated an adversarial proceeding (No. 03-0042) in\n\nbankruptcy court the very next day.               The complaint, filed against\n\nRivera,    DCC,    DCV,    and    others,   alleged        a   variety     of   claims,\n\nincluding preferential payments and fraudulent conveyances.\n\n            The referral remained under advisement in the district\n\ncourt for the next two months.           With a trial date approaching, the\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fdistrict court finally referred the parties’ contract dispute to\n\nthe bankruptcy court on May 1, 2003.             (Taking care of old business,\n\nthe district court also denied as moot Rivera’s January request to\n\nfile       another    indispensability      memo.)      The    case   proceeded      in\n\nbankruptcy court as a separate adversary proceeding (No. 03-0090),\n\ndespite Rivera’s motion in adversary proceeding No. 03-0042 to\n\nconsolidate them.         DCC moved to dismiss Coachman and Olympic Mills\n\nas intervenors, but the bankruptcy court denied the motion without\n\ndiscussion in a text order on February 12, 2004.                         After some\n\nadditional         discovery,   DCC   and   Rivera     filed    cross-motions     for\n\nsummary judgment.          Ruling upon the motions in August 2004, the\n\nbankruptcy court, recognizing that the “sole remaining issue” was\n\nthe amount of damages DCC should receive, rejected Rivera’s call to\n\nvacate       the     district   court’s     previous       ruling   on   liability.5\n\nCalculating the appropriate figure, the bankruptcy court granted\n\nDCC’s motion, denied Rivera’s, and, several days later, entered\n\nfinal judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\n\n               Rivera    timely   appealed      to   the    BAP,    which,   after    a\n\nthorough examination of its authority to review interlocutory\n\norders of the district court,6 affirmed.               Luis Rivera Siaca v. DCC\n\n\n       5\n       Rivera made the same argument in adversary proceeding No.\n03-0042, with the same result.\n       6\n       Judge Arthur N. Volotato dissented from the majority’s\ndecision to review the district court’s interlocutory order\ngranting partial summary judgment, arguing that, under our opinion\nin Brandt v. Wand Partners, 242 F.3d 6, 13-15 (1st Cir. 2001),\n\n                                          -9-\n\fOperating, Inc. (In re Olympic Mills Corp.), 333 B.R. 540 (1st Cir.\n\nB.A.P. 2005).       This appeal ensued.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            A.      Subject-Matter Jurisdiction.\n\n            Before addressing the merits, we must deal with the\n\nprocedural tangle and determine if we have jurisdiction, even\n\nthough the parties did not originally contest our jurisdiction on\n\nappeal.    See Doyle v. Huntress, Inc., 419 F.3d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(holding    that,    even   where    subject-matter   jurisdiction    may   go\n\nunchallenged on appeal, “we have an obligation to inquire sua\n\nsponte into our jurisdiction over the matter”). Indicating at oral\n\nargument that the integrity of complete diversity in this case was\n\na matter of primary importance, we permitted the parties to submit\n\nsupplemental briefing on whether the intervention of Coachman and\n\nOlympic    Mills      divested      the   district    court   of   diversity\n\njurisdiction.       We now conclude that it did not.\n\n            1.      Complete Diversity.      The district courts of the\n\nUnited States are “courts of limited jurisdiction.             They possess\n\nonly that power authorized by Constitution and statute.”             Kokkonen\n\nv. Guardian Life Ins. Co. Of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994).             In 28\n\n\n\n\nneither the BAP nor the bankruptcy court possessed the jurisdiction\nto do so. We take no position generally on the BAP’s authority to\nreview interlocutory orders of the district court, but assume, for\nthe limited purpose of deciding this rather complicated appeal,\nthat the BAP’s ruling in this respect is appropriate.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fU.S.C. § 1332, the sole basis for jurisdiction in this case,7\n\nCongress bestowed upon the district courts original jurisdiction in\n\ncivil actions between citizens of different states.                      The diversity\n\nrequirement of § 1332 must be complete.                         In cases involving\n\nmultiple          plaintiffs   or   defendants,       the     presence    of   but   one\n\nnondiverse          party    divests    the        district    court     of    original\n\njurisdiction over the entire action.                  See Strawbridge v. Curtiss,\n\n7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 267 (1806).\n\n                  The   complete-diversity     rule     is    not   a   constitutional\n\nrequirement, see State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386\n\nU.S.       523,    530-31   (1967),    or   even     explicitly     required    by   the\n\n\n\n       7\n        DCC’s argument that the district court’s original\njurisdiction continued uninterrupted from diversity of citizenship\nto bankruptcy jurisdiction is unsupported and mischaracterizes the\ncircumstances of this case.    The theory appears to rely on the\ntortured application of a limited exception to the complete-\ndiversity rule when a plaintiff joins a nondiverse defendant sued\nunder federal law with a diverse defendant sued in diversity. See\nRomero v. Int’l Terminal Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 381 (1959)\n(“Since the Jones Act provides an independent basis of federal\njurisdiction over the non-diverse respondent . . . the rule of\nStrawbridge v. Curtiss . . . does not require dismissal of the\nclaims against the diverse respondents.”).           The exception\nrecognizes and attempts to ameliorate the “anomaly that would be\ncreated by ‘not allowing a plaintiff to do in one federal suit what\nhe would be entitled to do in two separate federal suits.’” Hiram\nWalker & Sons, Inc., v. Kirk Line, 877 F.2d 1508, 1512 (11th Cir.\n1989) (quoting Baker v. J.C. Penney Co., 496 F. Supp. 922, 924\n(N.D. Ga. 1980)).    The present case is clearly distinguishable\nbecause, at the commencement of the case, there was no independent\nbasis of original federal jurisdiction that DCC could have invoked\nto bring suit against Coachman or Olympic Mills (nondiverse\nparties) on its state-law contract claims under the Subordination\nAgreement while, at the same time, bringing suit against Rivera (a\ndiverse party) in diversity.\n\n                                            -11-\n\fgoverning statute, see § 1332, but it is nonetheless strictly\n\nconstrued.     Acton Co., Inc. of Mass. v. Bachman Foods, Inc., 668\n\nF.2d 76, 79 (1st Cir. 1982).      History is in part responsible both\n\nfor the rule’s genesis and its rigid application.          The historic\n\nprimary function of the diversity requirement was “to provide a\n\n‘neutral’ forum for the out-of-state litigant who fears that the\n\nstate court may be unduly, if unconsciously and inarticulately,\n\nsolicitous for the interests of its own citizens.”               Caso v.\n\nLafayette Radio Elecs. Corp., 370 F.2d 707, 710 (1st Cir. 1966).\n\nThe presence of a nondiverse party eliminates this concern over\n\nlitigating in the state court.     See Wis. Dept. of Corr. v. Schacht,\n\n524 U.S. 381, 389 (1998).\n\n            The rule is most inflexibly applied at the time of\n\nfiling, for it has long been settled that “the jurisdiction of the\n\ncourt depends upon the state of things at the time of the action\n\nbrought.”      Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S.\n\n567, 570 (2004) (quoting Mollan v. Torrance, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.)\n\n537, 539 (1824)).    The postfiling context is more elastic because,\n\nas a general matter, “if jurisdiction exists at the time an action\n\nis commenced, such jurisdiction may not be divested by subsequent\n\nevents.” Freeport-McMoRan, Inc. v. K N Energy, Inc., 498 U.S. 426,\n\n428 (1991) (per curiam) (involving substitution under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.   25(c)).      There   are   exceptions,   however:   the   postfiling\n\nintroduction of a nondiverse party may, in certain circumstances,\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fspoil the jurisdiction that obtained when the suit commenced.          For\n\nexample, in   Am. Fiber & Finishing, Inc. v. Tyco Healthcare Group,\n\nLP, 362 F.3d 136, 139 (1st Cir. 2004), we read Freeport-McMoRan to\n\napply in the context of postfiling transfers of interest under Rule\n\n25, but not in the postfiling addition of a nondiverse party under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).    See also Casas Office Machs., Inc. v. Mita\n\nCopystar Am., Inc., 42 F.3d 668, 674 (1st Cir. 1994) (substitution\n\nof dispensable nondiverse defendants for fictitious defendants\n\ndestroyed diversity jurisdiction).         Yet the rule championed in\n\nFreeport-McMoRan    is   one   of   general   application,   as   we   have\n\nobserved.    Whether intervention under Rule 24(a) fits this mold is\n\nthe question to which we now turn.\n\n            We are mindful of our remark, in B. Fernandez & Hnos.,\n\nInc. v. Kellogg USA, Inc., 440 F.3d 541 (1st Cir. 2006), that the\n\naddition of a nondiverse intervenor as of right divested the\n\ndistrict court of diversity jurisdiction. At the puerile stages of\n\nthe litigation in Kellogg, a nondiverse company, Kellogg Caribbean\n\nServices, Inc. (“Kellogg Caribbean”), appealed the district court’s\n\ndenial of its motion to intervene as of right as a defendant.\n\nKellogg Caribbean argued that it, not Kellogg USA, Inc. (“Kellogg\n\nUSA” — the original diverse defendant), was the proper defendant to\n\nthe litigation because Kellogg USA previously had assigned its\n\nrights and obligations under the disputed contract to Kellogg\n\nCaribbean.    We began by framing the inquiry:\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f            [F]ederal jurisdiction is premised on the\n            diversity of citizenship between Kellogg USA\n            (a Michigan company) and [B. Fernandez &\n            Hnos.] and [Carribean Warehouse Logistics]\n            (Puerto Rico companies).      But, if Kellogg\n            Caribbean (a Puerto Rico company) is entitled\n            to intervene as a matter of right under Rule\n            24(a)(2) and is an indispensable party under\n            Rule 19(b), the litigation must be dismissed\n            because there would not be complete diversity.\n\nKellogg, 440 F.3d at 544.     Tackling the intervention issue first,\n\nwe concluded that the nondiverse company had satisfied the Rule\n\n24(a)(2) requirements and that the district court had abused its\n\ndiscretion   in   denying   the   motion.     Because,   as   a   corollary,\n\n“intervention would destroy complete diversity,” id. at 547, we\n\nthen turned to the indispensability analysis mandated by Rule\n\n19(b).   The analysis did not get far; observing that the district\n\ncourt had not independently analyzed the Rule 19(b) question, we\n\nremanded for further findings and an opportunity for the district\n\ncourt to select the way in which to resolve the problem (i.e.,\n\ndismiss the entire case, retain jurisdiction but limit the relief\n\navailable to the nondiverse company, et cetera, see id. at 547-48).\n\nIn doing so, however, we suggested strongly that, insofar as\n\nappellees sought an injunction that would affect the assignee’s\n\ninterests    under   the    contract,       Kellogg   Caribbean     was   an\n\nindispensable party.\n\n            In the case under review, the original and amended\n\ncomplaints alleged only state-law claims, observed that DCC was a\n\nDelaware corporation and Rivera a Puerto Rican resident, and thus\n\n                                   -14-\n\fproperly   invoked   the   district    court’s   diversity   jurisdiction.\n\nHowever, intervenors Coachman and Olympic Mills, were, like DCC,\n\nDelaware   corporations,      and     entered    as   (nondiverse)   party\n\ndefendants.8    Because the parties, on appeal at least, do not\n\nassign error to the intervention of Coachman and Olympic Mills per\n\nse, we proceed directly to the Rule 19(b) analysis to determine\n\nwhether that intervention divested the district court of subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction. See Kellogg, 440 F.3d at 547; cf. Metro. Life\n\nIns. Co. v. Ditmore, 729 F.2d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1984) (holding that a\n\nnecessary party under Rule 19(a) would be entitled a priori to\n\nintervene as of right under Rule 24(a)).\n\n           2.   Indispensability.       This task requires us to decide\n\nwhether Coachman and Olympic Mills are indispensable; if they are,\n\nthe entire case must be dismissed for want of subject-matter\n\n\n\n     8\n       Coachman and Olympic Mills appear to have entered the\ncontract dispute (later adversary proceeding No. 03-0090) as\ndefendant intervenors, although their alignment is not entirely\nclear from the record. We have the authority to determine this\nmatter for ourselves, see City of Indianapolis v. Chase Nat’l Bank,\n314 U.S. 63, 69 (1941) (courts have a “duty” to “look beyond the\npleadings and arrange the parties according to their sides in the\ndispute”); Gabriel v. Preble, 396 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2005), but\nthe inquiry is academic: Coachman and Olympic Mills are nondiverse\nno matter whom they are aligned against in this case.           The\nadversary complaint filed on behalf of Coachman and Olympic Mills\nin adversary proceeding No. 03-0042 identifies Coachman and Olympic\nMills as Delaware corporations with their principal place of\nbusiness in Puerto Rico. Consequently, even if an analysis of the\nparties’ actual interests more accurately pitted Coachman and\nOlympic Mills against Rivera, and we were to realign the parties\naccordingly, citizens of Puerto Rico would then stare at each other\nfrom across the “v.” See § 1332(c)(1).\n\n                                    -15-\n\fjurisdiction.   See Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust v. Patterson,\n\n390 U.S. 102, 116-19 (1968).   As we stated in Kellogg, “Rule 19(b)\n\nprovides that, if a nonparty is deemed necessary to litigation but\n\njoining that nonparty would deprive the court of jurisdiction, the\n\ncourt should permit the action to proceed only to the extent that\n\n‘equity and good conscience’ warrant.”    Kellogg, 440 F.3d at 547\n\n(quoting Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust, 390 U.S. at 109). Four\n\nfactors guide the inquiry:\n\n          [F]irst to what extent a judgment rendered in\n          the person's absence might be prejudicial to\n          the person or those already parties; second,\n          the extent to which, by protective provisions\n          in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or\n          other measures, the prejudice can be lessened\n          or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered\n          in the person's absence will be adequate;\n          fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an\n          adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for\n          nonjoinder.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 19(b).   From these factors, the Supreme Court has\n\nidentified four corresponding interests: (1) the interest of the\n\noutsider whom it would have been desirable to join; (2) the\n\ndefendant's interest in avoiding multiple litigation, inconsistent\n\nrelief, or sole responsibility for a liability it shares with\n\nanother; (3) the interest of the courts and the public in complete,\n\nconsistent, and efficient settlement of controversies; and (4) the\n\nplaintiff's interest in having a forum.   H.D. Corp. of P.R. v. Ford\n\nMotor Co., 791 F.2d 987, 992 (1st Cir. 1986) (citing Provident\n\nTradesmens Bank & Trust, 390 U.S. at 108-11).\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f            We pause momentarily to address a wrinkle.           The above\n\nfactors and interests require fact-intensive analysis, “involve the\n\nbalancing    of   competing   interest[,]    and   must    be   steeped   in\n\n‘pragmatic considerations.’” Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dingwell, 884\n\nF.2d 629, 635 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting Advisory Committee Notes).\n\nFor these reasons, the findings and conclusions of a district court\n\nare entitled to deference on appeal, id., and the absence of\n\nindependent analysis (or any analysis at all) is a reason for\n\nremand.     See Kellogg, 440 F.3d at 548.     In the present case, the\n\ndistrict court’s text order granting intervention did not address\n\nthe dispensability or indispensability of Coachman and Olympic\n\nMills, and there is nothing in the record in the five months\n\nseparating intervention from referral that sufficiently indicates\n\nwhat consideration, if any, the district court gave the matter.\n\nYet in this situation remanding this case to the district court,\n\nwhich, as we have said, is in the “preferred position” to make Rule\n\n19(b) determinations, Travelers Indem. Co., 884 F.2d at 635, would\n\nbe nothing short of Kafkaesque.          As the above recitation makes\n\nclear, the travel of this case to date borders on the bizarre, and\n\nwe see little wisdom in further complicating it.          Here, the BAP did\n\naddress the question and concluded that Coachman and Olympic Mills\n\nwere not indispensable.       Given the procedural tangle described\n\nabove, and the impracticality (bordering on absurdity) of remand,\n\nwe will proceed to decide the matter without remand under the\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fplenary standard normally used in reviewing the legal conclusions\n\nof the BAP.   See Carvalho v. Fed. Nat’l Mortgage Assoc. (In re\n\nCarvalho), 335 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2003); Takeda v. Nw. Nat’l\n\nLife. Ins. Co., 765 F.2d 815, 818 n.2 (9th Cir. 1985) (“Although in\n\nsome cases it might be desirable to remand to allow a district\n\ncourt to determine whether a nondiverse party is indispensable, we\n\nhave the power to decide the joinder issue on appeal.”).\n\n          A review of the factors and interests outlined above\n\nleads us inexorably to the conclusion that Coachman and Olympic\n\nMills are not indispensable.\n\n          Rivera’s argument that Coachman and Olympic Mills are\n\nindispensable because they have competing claims over the same res\n\nignores the posture of this case.     First, the causes of action\n\ninvolved in the district court (later adversary proceeding No. 04-\n\n0090) and the bankruptcy court (adversary proceeding No. 03-0042)\n\nwere completely different.   In district court, DCC pursued Rivera\n\nin his personal capacity for violating ¶ 4 of the Subordination\n\nAgreement, which required Rivera (1) to hold in trust any cash or\n\ncollateral received from Coachman in payment of the principal of\n\nthe subordinated debt, and (2) immediately to pay over to DCV the\n\ncash or collateral held in trust for application to the senior debt\n\nuntil the senior debt was repaid in full.    Coachman and Olympic\n\nMills had no such claim against Rivera (before or after they filed\n\nfor bankruptcy), and instead sued him in bankruptcy court in\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fadversary proceeding No. 03-0042, alleging fraudulent conveyances\n\nand other related causes of action.      See Torcise v. Cmty. Bank of\n\nHomestead (In re Torcise), 116 F.3d 860, 865-66 (11th Cir. 1997)\n\n(secured creditor that initiated separate state-law action against\n\nbank was not indispensable party to adversary proceeding brought by\n\nChapter 11 debtors’ unsecured creditors committee against bank to\n\nrecover    fraudulent   and   preferential   payments).   Second,   and\n\nrelatedly, Coachman and Olympic Mills were independently capable of\n\nmaking a run at Rivera’s money using different means from the point\n\nin time when they filed for Chapter 11 protection, November 26,\n\n2001.     Cf. Baker v. Minn. Min. and Mfg. Co., Inc., 99 Fed. Appx.\n\n718, 723-24 (6th Cir. 2004) (partial subrogee not an indispensable\n\nparty because it can recover whatever it is owed in a separate\n\naction); Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co. v. CFMT, Inc., 142 F.3d 1266,\n\n1272 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (licencee of patent is not indispensable\n\nbecause it could cause the patent owner to bring a separate action\n\nfor infringement).\n\n            Rivera also relies unduly on Coachman’s obligations under\n\nthe Subordination Agreement to support his indispensability pitch.\n\nUnder the terms of the Subordination Agreement, the subordination\n\nand trust obligations ran from Rivera (the obligor) to DVC (the\n\nobligee). Coachman was a signatory to the Subordination Agreement,\n\nbut its participation was perfunctory: Coachman simply promised\n\nthat Rivera’s obligations under the Subordination Agreement would\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fnot impair its obligations under the Note, under which it was the\n\nsole obligor.        Even if we were to conclude that Coachman was a co-\n\nobligor under the Subordination Agreement — as opposed to a mere\n\npromissor      —    it   is    clear    that    co-obligors     generally     are    not\n\nindispensable parties in contract disputes that do not involve\n\nreformation, cancellation, rescission, or otherwise challenge the\n\nvalidity of the contract.              See, e.g., Universal Reinsurance Co. v.\n\nSt. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 312 F.3d 82, 87 (2d Cir. 2002)\n\n(joint       obligors    not    indispensable);        Janney    Montgomery    Scott,\n\nInc. v. Shepard Niles, Inc., 11 F.3d 399, 405 (3d Cir. 1993) (co-\n\nobligor/non-obligee not indispensable); Brackin Tie, Lumber & Chip\n\nCo., Inc. v. McLarty Farms, Inc., 704 F.2d 585, 586-87 (11th Cir.\n\n1983)    (co-obligors/non-obligees              are    not   indispensable);        Bio-\n\nAnalytical Servs., Inc. v. Edgewater Hosp., Inc., 565 F.2d 450,\n\n452-53 (7th Cir. 1977) (guarantor/co-obligor not indispensable);\n\nTrans. Pacific Corp. v. S. Seas Enters., Ltd., 291 F.2d 435, 436\n\n(9th Cir. 1961) (per curiam) (joint obligors not indispensable when\n\nthe suit is not for rescission, but for damages for breach of\n\ncontract);      7   Charles     Alan     Wright   et    al.,    Federal   Practice     &\n\nProcedure § 1613, at 177-78 (3d ed. 2001) (“Joint obligors thus\n\ntypically are treated as Rule 19(a) parties, but are not deemed\n\nindispensable under Rule 19(b).”); c.f. H.D. Corp. of P.R., 791\n\nF.2d    at    993   (nondiverse        parent   corporation      was   indispensable\n\nbecause it was a signatory to the agreements at issue in the\n\n\n                                           -20-\n\flitigation and plaintiffs’ claims were largely directed against it,\n\nnot the diverse defendant subsidiary corporation); Acton Co., Inc.\n\nof Mass., 668 F.2d at 77-78 (nondiverse parent corporation was\n\nindispensable because it was a party to the agreements at issue in\n\nthe litigation, played a substantial role in the negotiation of\n\nthose agreements, and stood to lose a sizable deposit).\n\n             Finally, Rivera’s assertion that DCC sought injunctive\n\nrelief against Coachman and Olympic Mills misrepresents the record.\n\nIf   true,   such   a   request   might    weigh   heavily   in    favor     of\n\nindispensability.       See, e.g., Kellogg, 440 F.3d at 548 (stating\n\nthat nondiverse intervenor was indispensable insofar as plaintiff\n\nsought an injunction that affected the intervenor’s interests under\n\nthe agreements); Acton Co., Inc. of Mass., 668 F.2d at 81-82\n\n(seeking recision of a contract makes all parties to that contract,\n\nand others having a substantial interest in it, indispensable\n\nparties);    7   Charles   Alan   Wright   et   al.,   Federal    Practice    &\n\nProcedure § 1613, at 196 (3rd ed. 2001) (“[I]n an action seeking\n\nspecific performance of a contract all persons who will be required\n\nto act to carry out a court order compelling performance have been\n\nheld to be indispensable parties.”).            But review of the amended\n\ncomplaint shows that DCC sought only to prevent Rivera, in his\n\ncapacity as chairman and chief executive officer, from directing\n\nCoachman and Olympic Mills to repay his subordinated loans until\n\nDCV’s senior loan was paid in full.              DCC sought nothing from\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fCoachman or Olympic Mills directly or in any way that would affect\n\ntheir interest under the Subordination Agreement.\n\n            Under these circumstances, where pragmatism strongly\n\nmilitates against a finding of indispensability and Rivera has not\n\npersuaded us otherwise, the plaint falls far short of the mark.\n\n            3.     Divestiture.        Whether   dispensable,     nondiverse\n\ndefendant-intervenors destroy complete diversity is a question we\n\nhave not addressed squarely.          An insensitive reading of Kellogg —\n\nbut one that would not necessarily be inconsistent with our strict\n\nconstruction of the complete-diversity rule — would seem to suggest\n\nthat nondiverse intervenors are incompatible with the tenets of the\n\nrule.   But “[j]udges expect their pronunciamentos to be read in\n\ncontext,” Wisehart v. Davis, 408 F.3d 321, 326 (7th Cir. 2005), and\n\nthe broader context of Kellogg does not support such an absolutist\n\napproach.    Kellogg involved a likely indispensable party that, as\n\nassignee under the contract at issue, sought (effectively) to\n\nsubstitute       itself   for   the    diverse   defendant   by   means   of\n\nintervention as of right. Intervention was thus the product of the\n\nplaintiff-appellees’ choice to sue the diverse assignor instead of\n\nthe nondiverse assignee.        This was untenable in Kellogg because a\n\nplaintiff cannot circumvent complete diversity by artful pleading;\n\notherwise, “a plaintiff could leave non-diverse defendants out of\n\nthe original lawsuit and then wait for them to be impleaded or\n\notherwise joined.”        Acton Co., Inc. of Mass., 668 F.2d at 79; see\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\falso Owen Equip. & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 374-75,\n\n377 (1978).\n\n            The      circumstances      surrounding   the     intervention   of\n\nCoachman and Olympic Mills in the present case are strikingly\n\ndifferent     from     those    in   Kellogg.     DCC   did     not   need   the\n\nparticipation of Coachman or Olympic Mills to collect the money\n\nRivera had retained in breach of the Subordination Agreement. When\n\nCoachman and Olympic Mills eventually sought intervention as of\n\nright, the interests they advanced flowed directly from their\n\nstatus as debtors-in-possession.           Critically, these interests did\n\nnot arise until Coachman and Olympic Mills filed for bankruptcy on\n\nNovember 26, 2001, almost a month after DCC filed suit against\n\nRivera.   See Freeport-McMoRan, Inc., 498 U.S. at 428 (a nondiverse\n\ndispensable party that had no interest in the outcome of the\n\nlitigation until sometime after suit was commenced did not defeat\n\ndiversity jurisdiction); Aurora Loan Servs., Inc. v. Craddieth, 442\n\nF.3d   1018,      1025   (7th    Cir.    2006)   (holding     that    diversity\n\njurisdiction was not destroyed by the intervention of a nondiverse\n\nparty whose claims arose in the course of a foreclosure proceeding\n\nafter it obtained the certificate of sale); Salt Lake Tribune\n\nPubl’g Co., LLC v. AT & T Corp., 320 F.3d 1081, 1095-97 (10th Cir.\n\n2003) (similar, but in the context of a disputed option to purchase\n\nthe assets of a newspaper operation).            There was thus no two-step\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fevasion of the diversity requirement here such as was lurking\n\nbehind the pleadings in Kellogg.\n\n          In similar situations, the weight of authority holds that\n\nclaims launched by necessary but dispensable, nondiverse defendant-\n\nintervenors do not defeat the original jurisdiction (diversity)\n\nthat obtained at the commencement of the action.9       See, e.g.,\n\nMattel, Inc. v. Bryant, 446 F.3d 1011, 1013 (9th Cir. 2006) (per\n\ncuriam); Aurora, 442 F.3d at 1025-26; Grimes v. Mazda N. Am.\n\nOperations, 355 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2004); Viacom Int’l, Inc.,\n\n212 F.3d at 726-28; United Capitol Ins. Co. v. Kapiloff, 155 F.3d\n\n488, 492 (4th Cir. 1998); Dev. Fin. Corp. v. Alpha Hous. & Health\n\nCare, Inc., 54 F.3d 156, 160 (3d Cir. 1995); see also Freeport-\n\nMcMoRan, 498 U.S. at 428 (citing Wichita R.R. & Light Co. v. Pub.\n\nUtil. Comm’n of Kan., 260 U.S. 48, 54 (1922) (“Jurisdiction once\n\n\n\n     9\n       From this perspective, the proper alignment of Coachman and\nOlympic Mills becomes more than an academic exercise, see supra\nnote 8, because the intervention of a nondiverse party as a\nplaintiff raises a suspicious judicial eyebrow under § 1332. See,\ne.g., Aurora, 442 F.3d at 1025-26; Viacom Int’l, Inc. v. Kearney,\n212 F.3d 721, 726-28 (2d Cir. 2000); accord Acton Co., Inc. of\nMass., 668 F.2d at 79.    Although this is a close call (perhaps\nbecause it is difficult to quantify and compare the parties’\ncompeting and complex interests), the record does not support\nrealigning Coachman and Olympic Mills as plaintiff intervenors.\nCoachman and Olympic Mills intervened to forestall DCC from\ncollecting on a favorable judgment it had received just ten days\nearlier, and then sued DCC (plus Rivera and others) when the\ndistrict court did not immediately refer the case to the bankruptcy\ncourt.    Certainly the intervenors had interests adverse to\nRivera’s, but, on balance and in light of the circumstances\nsurrounding the intervention, DCC was the more antipodean player as\ncompetitor for Rivera’s ill-gotten gains.\n\n                               -24-\n\facquired . . . is not divested by a subsequent change in the\n\ncitizenship    of    the   parties.    Much   less   is   such   jurisdiction\n\ndefeated by the intervention, by leave of the court, of a party\n\nwhose presence is not essential to a decision of the controversy\n\nbetween the original parties.”)).            The present case offends the\n\ncomplete-diversity rule even less: in adversary proceeding No. 03-\n\n0090 (the case at bar), Coachman and Olympic Mills made no claims\n\nagainst any party and no party made any claims against them.           (This\n\nis not the case, of course, in adversary proceeding No. 03-0042,\n\nwhich is not before us.)10\n\n          Confident in our jurisdiction, we proceed directly to the\n\nmerits.\n\n          B.        The Contract Claims\n\n          1.        Subordination.    The parties dispute the capture of\n\nthe term “Subordinated Debt” as defined in ¶ 1.a the Subordination\n\nAgreement.    DCC contends, and the lower courts unanimously agreed,\n\n\n\n     10\n       In its supplemental brief, DCC suggests that, were we to\nhold that intervention had defeated the district court’s\njurisdiction (which we do not), we should exercise our power under\nFed. R. Civ. P. 21 and, to preserve diversity, dismiss the case as\nto Coachman and Olympic Mills. See Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-\nLarrain, 490 U.S. 826, 837 (1989). DCC’s suggestion is puzzling.\nAlthough neither party brought this fact to the Court’s attention,\nour independent review of the record reveals that Coachman and\nOlympic Mills were to be dismissed from adversary proceeding No.\n03-0090 in accordance with a settlement stipulation in adversary\nproceeding No. 03-0042. This dismissal alone would have cured any\njurisdictional defect ailing the case up to that point and\ninvocation of Rule 21 would be superfluous as a result.        Cf.\nCaterpillar, Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 65, 68-69 (1996).\n\n                                      -25-\n\fthat the plain language in the Subordination Agreement subordinates\n\nall of Rivera’s loans to Coachman and its affiliates, irrespective\n\nof the time they were made.       Rivera disputes this conclusion and\n\nargues that the plain language subordinates only loans made before\n\nthe   execution    of   the   Subordination        Agreement   or,   in   the\n\nalternative, that the language is ambiguous and should thus be\n\nconstrued against its drafter, DCC.            This distinction is critical\n\nbecause Rivera submits that the contested payments apply only to\n\nhis loans that post-date the Subordination Agreement, not his\n\nprevious loans that, under the Subordination Agreement, constitute\n\nsubordinated debt.\n\n            The parties identify two provisions in the Subordination\n\nAgreement    as   evidence    tending     to    support   their   respective\n\npositions.    The first is defining “Subordinated Debt,” provided\n\nbelow in full:\n\n                 “Subordinated   Debt”    shall  mean   all\n            principal, interest, fees, costs, enforcement\n            expenses    (including     legal    fees    and\n            disbursements), collateral protection expenses\n            and   other   reimbursement     and   indemnity\n            obligations that the Subordinating Creditor\n            [Rivera] has loaned to the Borrower [Coachman]\n            or any of its affiliates.\n\nThe second details “Subordination,” and reads in pertinent part:\n\n                 7. Subordination. The Senior Debt [DCV’s\n            $2 million bridge loan] and the Note and any\n            and all other documents and instruments\n            evidencing or creating the Senior Debt and all\n            guaranties, mortgages, security agreements,\n            pledges and other collateral guarantying or\n            securing the Senior Debt or any part thereof\n\n                                   -26-\n\f              shall be senior to the Subordinated Debt\n              irrespective of the time of the execution,\n              delivery or issuance of any thereof.\n\nBoth DCC and Rivera agree (ignoring Rivera’s alternate argument for\n\nthe moment) that these provisions are unambiguous, but in opposite\n\nways.    Displaying its conjugative prowess, DCC argues that “shall\n\nmean” indicates “the future progressive tense and, as the main verb\n\nphrase in this definitional section, use of the those words require\n\nthat    the   entire   definition   is   to   be     read   at   the   time   the\n\n[Subordination Agreement] is being enforced, not the time at which\n\nit was executed.”        Not to be syntactically outplayed, Rivera\n\nresponds that “has loaned” can only refer to loans outstanding as\n\nof the date of the Subordination Agreement, and cannot possibly\n\nencompass loans made after that date.              The grammatical acrobatics\n\ncontinue with competing interpretations of the “Subordination”\n\nclause,   specifically     with   respect     to    the   following    language:\n\n“irrespective of the time of the execution, delivery or issuance of\n\nany thereof.” DCC posits that this language modifies “Subordinated\n\nDebt,” which is the closest noun; Rivera argues that it modifies\n\n“Senior Debt,” which is the direct object of “shall be senior.”\n\n              DCC also invokes two provisions in the Note to support\n\nits interpretation of the Subordination Agreement.                The first is\n\nthe Note’s definition of the Subordination Agreement, which is\n\nattached to the Note as an annex, provided in ¶ 1.(xiv):\n\n                   “Subordination and Standby Agreement”\n              shall mean the agreement (Annex D) by Mr. Luis\n\n                                    -27-\n\f           Rivera to subordinate and defer repayment of\n           the principal of any loan by him to the\n           Company [Coachman], Olympic Mills Corp.,\n           Olympic Group, Inc. or the new entity pursuant\n           to the Hampshire Agreement until this Note is\n           converted and repaid.\n\nThe second, a condition precedent to DCV’s loan under the Note, is\n\nprovided in ¶ 5.1:\n\n                Subordination and Standby Agreement. Mr\n           Luis Rivera Siaca shall execute an irrevokable\n           Subordination and Standby Agreement, in the\n           form attached here to as Annex D, whereby his\n           loans to the Company [Coachman] or its\n           affiliates are subordinated to this Note and\n           he agrees to defer payment of principal on\n           such loans until this Note is either converted\n           into Series E preferred Stock or is repaid.\n\nUsing    this    language,          and    corresponding            language     in    the\n\nSubordination Agreement that it claims expressly incorporates the\n\nNote by reference (i.e., the recital that identifies the execution\n\nof the Subordination Agreement as a “condition precedent to the\n\nLender’s   [DCV]       willingness        to    make    a    loan    to   the    Borrower\n\n[Coachman]      pursuant       to    the       Note”),       DCC    argues      that   the\n\n“Subordinated Debt” unambiguously applies to all of Rivera’s loans\n\nto   Coachman    and    its    affiliates.             Rivera      concedes     that   the\n\nSubordination Agreement “refers to and describes the Note,” but\n\ndenies that it incorporates the Note by reference.                        Also, Rivera\n\nargues   that    the    Note    is    “outside         the   four    corners”     of   the\n\nSubordination Agreement, and, for the purposes of deciding their\n\ncontract dispute, constitutes extrinsic evidence.\n\n\n\n                                           -28-\n\f            We review de novo the decisions of the district court\n\n(liability) and the bankruptcy court (damages) granting summary\n\njudgment, and owe no particular deference to the conclusions of the\n\nBAP.   See Razzaboni v. Schifano (In re Schifano), 378 F.3d 60, 66\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).      We also review de novo questions of contractual\n\ninterpretation, unless disputed and genuine issues of material fact\n\n(over extrinsic evidence, for example) bear upon the interpretation\n\nof ambiguous language. See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Greenwich Ins.\n\nCo., 417 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            It   is   undisputed   that,   pursuant   to   ¶   12   of   the\n\nSubordination Agreement (and ¶ 16 of the Note), Delaware provides\n\nthe governing substantive law.       Under Delaware law, “[t]he basic\n\nrule of contract construction gives priority to the intention of\n\nthe parties.”     E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Shell Oil Co., 498\n\nA.2d 1108, 1113 (Del. 1985).       “In upholding the intentions of the\n\nparties, a court must construe the agreement as a whole, giving\n\neffect to all provisions therein.”         Id.   “Moreover, the meaning\n\nwhich arises from a particular portion of an agreement cannot\n\ncontrol the meaning of the entire agreement where such inference\n\nruns counter to the agreement’s overall scheme or plan.”                 Id.\n\n“Where the contract language is clear and unambiguous, the parties’\n\nintent is ascertained by giving the language its ordinary and usual\n\nmeaning.”    Nw. Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Esmark, Inc., 672 A.2d 41, 43\n\n(Del. 1996).     “Courts consider extrinsic evidence to interpret the\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fagreement only if there is an ambiguity in the contract.”     Id.   “A\n\ncontract is not rendered ambiguous simply because the parties do\n\nnot agree upon its proper construction.       Rather, a contract is\n\nambiguous only when the provisions in controversy are reasonably or\n\nfairly susceptible of different interpretations.”      Rhone-Poulenc\n\nBasic Chems. Co. v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co., 616 A.2d 1192, 1196\n\n(Del. 1992).\n\n             To our knowledge, the Delaware Supreme Court has not yet\n\nhad occasion to apply, as we have, the long-recognized principle\n\nthat,\n\n             in the absence of anything to indicate a\n             contrary intention, instruments executed at\n             the same time, by the same contracting\n             parties, for the same purpose, and in the\n             course of the same transaction will be\n             considered and construed together as one\n             contract or instrument, even though they do\n             not in terms refer to each other.11\n\n11 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 30:26 at 239-42 (4th\n\ned.     1999) (citing Bailey v. Hannibal & St. Joseph R.R. Co., 84\n\n\n        11\n        This principle is associated with but distinct from a\ncourt’s consideration of a separate writing expressly incorporated\nby reference — something the Delaware Supreme Court has recognized\n(but with material limitations) and what DCC argues should permit\nthis court to read the Subordination Agreement along side the Note.\nCompare 11 Williston on Contracts § 30:25 (“Writing Expressly\nIncorporated By Reference”), with id. § 30:26 (“Writing Implicitly\nIncorporated By Reference”); see Delaware v. Black, 83 A.2d 678,\n681 (Del. 1951) (holding that a contract may incorporate by\nreference provisions in another instrument but only to the extent\nthat the incorporated matter is specifically set forth or\nidentified); see also Realty Growth Investors v. Council of Unit\nOwners, 453 A.2d 450, 454 (Del. 1982) (similar); Pauley Petroleum,\nInc. v. Cont’l Oil Co., 231 A.2d 450, 456 (Del. Ch. 1967) (same).\n\n                                 -30-\n\fU.S. 96 (1872)); see Crowe v. Bolduc, 365 F.3d 86, 95-97 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (using other documents in same transaction to find that\n\ncontract was not ambiguous under Maine law); Crowe v. Bolduc, 334\n\nF.3d 124, 137 (1st Cir. 2003) (using principle to find contract\n\nambiguous under Maine law); cf. Senior v. NSTAR Elec. & Gas Corp.,\n\n449 F.3d 206, 219 (1st Cir. 2006) (using principle to construe an\n\nambiguous collective bargaining agreement).           We think it fair to\n\npredict that, were the Delaware Supreme Court presented with this\n\nquestion, it would read the disputed language of the Subordination\n\nAgreement in light of the pertinent provisions of the Note.12             Both\n\ncontracts were signed on the same day (February 24, 2000) between\n\nsubstantially   the   same    parties    (Rivera    signed   the   Note    as\n\nCoachman’s   chairman)   as   facets    of   the   same   transaction     (the\n\n\n     12\n        We observe that Delaware’s Chancery courts, in the\nfigurative trenches of contract interpretation, have recognized and\napplied this precept in making ambiguity determinations. Gildor v.\nOptical Solutions, Inc., No. 1416-N, 2006 WL 1596678 at *6 n.16\n(Del. Ch. June 5, 2006) (Strine, V.C.) (unpublished); Simon v. The\nNavellier Series Fund., No. 17734, 2000 WL 1597890 at *7 & n.33\n(Del. Ch. Oct. 19, 2000) (Strine, V.C.) (unpublished); Crown Books\nCorp. v. Bookstop, Inc., No. 11255, 1990 WL 26166 at *6 (Del. Ch.\nFeb. 28, 1990) (Allen, C.J.) (unpublished).      The lower federal\ncourts in Delaware have recognized this principle as well. See\nMagten Asset Mgmt. Corp. & Law Debenture Trust Co. of N.Y. v. Nw.\nCorp. (In re Nw. Corp.), 313 B.R. 595, 601 (Bankr. D. Del. 2004)\n(“Under Delaware law, all related documents and instruments in a\nsingle transaction together are harmonized to the extent\npossible.”); Huyler’s v. Ritz-Carlton Rest. & Hotel Co. of Atlantic\nCity, 1 F.2d 491, 492 (D. Del. 1924) ( “It is true that the\nprinciple by which instruments executed at the same time, by the\nsame parties, for the same purpose, and in the course of the same\ntransaction are considered as one, and receive the same\nconstruction as if embodied in one instrument, is of wide\napplication and the illustrative cases are many.”).\n\n                                  -31-\n\finfusion of capital into the Coachman enterprise) for a unitary\n\npurpose (to fund the acquisition of sweaters). As further evidence\n\nof symbiosis, the execution of the Subordination Agreement was\n\nlisted as a condition precedent to the Note, and the document was\n\nphysically attached to the Note as an annex.                     Also, neither\n\ndocument contains a merger clause or any indication of the parties’\n\nintent to read each contract in isolation.\n\n            The language of the Subordination Agreement quickly comes\n\ninto focus when viewed through the lens of the Note.                  The most\n\nobvious   blow    to    Rivera’s   interpretation    of    the    Subordination\n\nAgreement is the Note’s use of “any loan” in ¶ 1.(xiv), without any\n\naccompanying prospective limitation.           In fact, subsequent language\n\nin ¶ 1.(xiv) shows that such a limitation could not have been\n\nintended.        In    pertinent   part,   ¶   1.(xiv)    explains    that   the\n\nSubordination Agreement would require Rivera “to subordinate and\n\ndefer repayment of the principal of any loan by him to the Company\n\n[Coachman], Olympic Mills Corp., Olympic Group, Inc. or the new\n\nentity pursuant to the Hampshire Agreement until this Note is\n\nconverted and repaid.”         (Emphasis supplied.)        However, prior to\n\nFebruary 24, 2000, Rivera had extended loans to Coachman and\n\nOlympic Mills only; he did not extend any loans to the “new entity”\n\n(a/k/a/ Glamourette) until afterwards. (It is unclear even whether\n\nGlamourette existed on the date of the signing.)                 Further, ¶ 5.1\n\nprovides that DCV’s loan would issue only if Rivera would agree\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\fthat “his loans to the Company [Coachman] or its affiliates [not\n\nsimply “and its affiliate Olympic Mills”] are subordinated to this\n\nNote.”     (Emphasis supplied.)     The Subordination Agreement uses\n\nsimilarly broad language in ¶ 1.(xiv): “the Subordinating Creditor\n\n[Rivera] has loaned to the Borrower [Coachman] or any of its\n\naffiliates.”     (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n             We are unwilling to endorse, as Rivera would have us do,\n\nan interpretation of “has loaned” that would render the above\n\nlanguage meaningless or superfluous, see Crowe, 365 F.3d at 97, and\n\nthat would run counter to the overall scheme that these documents\n\nwere designed to effect.13      See E.I. du Pont de Nemours, 498 A.2d\n\nat   1113.     Because   the   disputed   language   is   not   reasonably\n\nsusceptible of different interpretations, see Rhone-Poulenc, 616\n\nA.2d at 1195, we hold that the Subordination Agreement, when\n\nproperly read in conjunction with the Note, unambiguously covers\n\nthe post-Subordination Agreement loans at issue in this case.14        We\n\n\n      13\n       Rivera’s argument that the phrase “pursuant to the Hampshire\nAgreement” in ¶ 1.(xiv) of the Note limits subordination to\n“specific indebtedness” lacks merit. As an initial matter, it is\ndebatable whether this language imports a subject-matter restraint\non the Subordination Agreement or simply associates the “new\nentity” with the Hampshire venture. But even giving Rivera the\nbenefit of the doubt, he admits that the loans that post-date the\nSubordination Agreement were to provide additional capital for the\nacquisition of Hampshire assets, presumably after the depletion of\nDCV’s loan.\n      14\n       We reach this conclusion in spite of DCC’s assertion that\n“shall mean,” as it is used to define “Subordinated Debt” in ¶ 1.b\nof the Subordination Agreement, independently denotes the very\nspecific intention that DCC assigns to it (without any further\n\n                                   -33-\n\fare therefore not required (or permitted), under Delaware law, to\n\nconsider evidence extrinsic to these documents.     See Eagle Indus.,\n\nInc. v. DeVilbiss Health Care, Inc., 702 A.2d 1228, 1232 (Del.\n\n1997).15\n\n           2.   Equitable Estoppel.     In a last-ditch attempt to\n\navert liability, Rivera contends that the doctrine of equitable\n\nestoppel precludes DCC from enforcing the Subordination Agreement.\n\nSpecifically, Rivera argues that president of DCC and then Coachman\n\ndirector   Wayne   Foren   “expressly   consented   to   or   knowingly\n\nacquiesced in” the repayment of Rivera’s loans.16        To support his\n\nargument, Rivera touts (1) an April 14, 2000 letter in which Foren\n\nproposed that Rivera provide a $3 million short-term credit line\n\nthat would be exempt from the Subordination Agreement, and (2) the\n\n\nindication here that “shall mean” bears on the question presented).\nSuch language is common in defining contractual terms, as\nexemplified by the very contracts in this case: both defined terms\nin the Subordination Agreement (“Senior Debt” is the other, in ¶\n1.a), and all fourteen in the Note, employ “shall mean” to convey\nthe terms’ intended meaning.\n     15\n        We need not, and therefore do not, address the parties’\ncompeting interpretations of the “Subordination” clause in ¶ 7 of\nthe Subordination Agreement.      Assuming without deciding that\n“irrespective of the time of the execution, delivery or issuance of\nany thereof” modifies the term “Senior Debt,” this interpretation\nis not at all inconsistent with our holding with respect to the\ndefinition of “Subordinated Debt” in ¶ 1.b and the related\nprovisions in the Note.\n     16\n       Foren was elected to Coachman’s board of directors as a\ncondition precedent to the bridge loan, pursuant to ¶ 5.3 of the\nNote. Although his term in office was to continue “as long as any\namount is outstanding” under the Note, Foren resigned in February\n2001 when Coachman defaulted.\n\n                                 -34-\n\fDecember 12, 2000 board minutes that do not indicate whether Foren\n\nobjected to the prospect that Coachman would use proceeds from the\n\nPuerto Rico Industrial Incentive Fund to repay Rivera’s $4 million\n\nloan that pre-dated the Subordination Agreement. Ignoring the fact\n\nthat Rivera did not present the April 14 letter to the district\n\ncourt in his opposition to DCC’s summary judgment motion, the\n\ndispositive flaw in this evidence is that it fails to show how\n\nRivera was induced to rely — let alone detrimentally — on Foren’s\n\nconduct.   See VonFeldt v. Stifel Financial Corp., 714 A.2d 79, 87\n\n(Del. 1998) (requiring a showing of detrimental reliance to support\n\na claim of equitable estoppel).          Without more, we are bound to\n\nreject this argument.\n\n           3.     Damages.   Rivera’s contention that the bankruptcy\n\ncourt’s award does not accurately reflect expectation damages, see\n\nDuncan v. Theratx, Inc., 775 A.2d 1019, 1022 (Del. 2001) (requiring\n\nthe   breaching   promisor   to   compensate    the   promisee   for   the\n\npromisee’s reasonable expectation of the value of the breached\n\ncontract), is waived on at least two grounds.         First, as presented\n\nto the district court (and later reiterated to the bankruptcy\n\ncourt), the argument was fatally undeveloped, comprising only four\n\nsentences, a citation to a district court opinion, and no analysis\n\nwhatsoever.     See McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (“theories not raised squarely in the district\n\ncourt cannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal”).          Second,\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\fas presented to us, the argument impermissibly depends on an\n\nentirely new factual predicate: that “Olympic and Glamourette had\n\nmany other creditors besides Rivera Siaca to whom money was owned\n\nand who could have been paid without violating the Subordination\n\nAgreement.”      See Cochran v. Quest Software, Inc., 328 F.3d 1, 11\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (“a party may not advance for the first time on\n\nappeal either a new argument or an old argument that depends on a\n\nnew   factual    predicate”).       For    these    reasons,     we   decline   to\n\nentertain it.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\n           To    sum   up,   we   hold    first    that   the   intervention    of\n\nnondiverse Coachman and Olympic Mills has not destroyed diversity\n\njurisdiction, and that we have jurisdiction to decide the merits of\n\nthis appeal as a result; second, that the Subordination Agreement,\n\nwhen properly read in tandem with the Note, unambiguously governs\n\nthe loans disputed in this case; and third, that Rivera’s remaining\n\narguments are either without merit (equitable estoppel) or waived\n\n(damages).      The judgment of the BAP is therefore\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\f",

The progenitor of this procedural gem, plaintiff-appellee DCC Operating, Inc. (\"DCC\"), originally brought suit in diversity in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. After obtaining a favorable summary judgment ruling, nondiverse debtors-in-possession Coachman, Inc. (\"Coachman\"), and its wholly-owned subsidiary Olympic Mills Corp. (\"Olympic Mills\"), intervened, requesting that the case be referred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Puerto Rico. Digesting the issue for several months, the district court eventually referred the case to the bankruptcy court, which, over a year later, awarded damages and entered final judgment. Rivera appealed the unfavorable ruling to the BAP; unsuccessful there as well, he appealed to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we reach the merits of this appeal, we must cut through a factual and procedural knot of Gordian complexity. This task calls upon us to examine at the outset whether we have subject-matter jurisdiction or if it was destroyed by the intervention of nondiverse intervenors; in turn, whether the intervenors are indispensable; and ultimately, whether remand would be appropriate to sort all this out. We cut the knot by stepping forward to address these issues without remand. Once the procedural issues are resolved we move to the merits, which by comparison present a fairly straightforward issue for resolution. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Hampshire Venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contract dispute began with a $2 million bridge loan essentially to finance the acquisition of sweaters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The lender, Development Capital Ventures, LP (\"DCV\"), is an investment company that provides venture capital to small businesses. The borrower, now-defunct Coachman, was a small business operating in Puerto Rico. In connection with the bridge loan, which was to be made in two $1 million installments (one on February 25, 2000, the other on March 10, 2000), Coachman delivered to DCV a \"CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEMAND NOTE\" (the \"Note\") on February 24, 2000. The Note had a maturity date of June 30, 2000,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and provided for the conversion of the principal amount into company stock at DCV's option at any time before the balance was paid in full, or automatically upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Note identified, described, and attached as annexes four documents that bore upon the bridge loan. Annex A was a term sheet detailing the conversion of stock; it, along with a guaranty embodied in annex C, is not involved in this dispute. Annex B was a document entitled \"ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT,\" which the Note identified as the \"Hampshire Agreement\" and defined in &#182; 1.(viii) as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Hampshire Agreement\" shall mean the agreement between the Company [Coachman] and Hampshire Corporation (\"Hampshire\") whereby the Company establishes a subsidiary to acquire inventory and equipment from Hampshire and Hampshire guarantees to acquire a minimum of 12 million sweaters from such subsidiary over the next five (5) years, or an average annual purchase of 2.4 million sweater units. See draft agreement under <i>Annex B.,</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The draft version of the Hampshire Agreement identified the \"subsidiary\" referenced above as Glamourette/OM, Inc. (\"Glamourette\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The last document attached to the Note (as annex D) was a \"SUBORDINATION AND STANDBY AGREEMENT\" (the \"Subordination Agreement\"). According to the terms of the Note, Rivera, Coachman's affluent chairman and sometimes lender, was required to execute the Subordination Agreement as a condition precedent to the bridge loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera executed the Subordination Agreement, along with the Note (on behalf of Coachman), on February 24, 2000. At that time, Coachman owed Rivera approximately $5.75 million on past loans, but neither the Note nor the Subordination Agreement identified the particular loans to be subordinated to DCV's bridge loan. Almost a year later, Coachman fell into default. DCV's corporate general partner, DCC, demanded that Coachman pay its balance. When Coachman took no action to satisfy its obligations under the Note, DCC demanded that Rivera pay all amounts due from payments he had received from Coachman or its affiliates over the previous year. (Between February 24, 2000, and October 18, 2001, Rivera made a series of loans to Coachman, Olympic Mills, and Glamourette totaling $16.6 million, and was repaid at least $5.6 million.) On November 7, 2001, DCC, alleging various state-law claims under the Subordination Agreement, sued Rivera in diversity in federal district court. Shortly thereafter, on November 26, 2001, Coachman, Olympic Mills, and Glamourette filed in bankruptcy court voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discovery proceeded in district court for almost a year before DCC and Rivera filed cross-motions for summary judgment. DCC argued that Rivera violated his trust obligations under the Subordination Agreement by retaining certain payments from Coachman or its affiliates. Specifically, DCC contended that, pursuant to &#182; 4 of the Subordination Agreement, Rivera was required to forward such payments to DCV for application against the bridge loan. Rivera responded that the Subordination Agreement covered only those loans made before January 24, 2000. The disbursements he had received, Rivera explained, were in payment of loans made after the execution of the Subordination Agreement. The district court disagreed and ruled that the Subordination Agreement unambiguously covered the repayment of all loans, whenever made, until Coachman satisfied its obligations under the Note. However, the district court reserved decision on the amount of damages hoping that, in light of its ruling, the parties would reach an agreement on their own. The district court entered partial summary judgment on December 16, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nine days later, Rivera moved to dismiss the case for failure to join Coachman and Olympic Mills. Rivera argued, for the first time, that these parties were necessary, indispensable, and (importantly) nondiverse by virtue of their incorporation in Delaware. (DCC was a Delaware corporation as well.) The next day, Coachman and Olympic Mills filed in the district court through special counsel a motion to intervene as of right under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2). Citing DCC's recent victory, Coachman and Olympic Mills argued, without actually asserting any claim, that the payments to Rivera \"may be subject to the avoidance powers\" granted to them as debtors-in-possession. Because their interest in these payments \"may preempt\" that of DCC, and because \"DCC's attempt to collect the funds for its own benefit implicate[s] numerous core bankruptcy issues,\" Coachman and Olympic Mills requested that the case be referred to the bankruptcy court for further adjudication. In a text order entered on December 31, 2002, the district court granted the motion to intervene without discussion (and without addressing Rivera's motion or soliciting DCC's position on either motion), and ordered the parties to appear at a status conference on January 16, 2003, to address the intervenors' referral request. DCC filed a motion opposing dismissal, intervention, and referral on January 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the status conference, DCC said that it would consent to referral only if Rivera would deposit over $5 million with the bankruptcy court. The district court gave Rivera until January 24 to respond, set a briefing schedule on the referral question if Rivera declined DCC's offer (which he did), and stated that the case would proceed to trial on May 27, 2003 if the case were not referred. Coachman and Olympic Mills submitted a memorandum on February 24 pursuant to the scheduling order, but, short-circuiting the process, initiated an adversarial proceeding (No. 03-0042) in bankruptcy court the very next day. The complaint, filed against Rivera, DCC, DCV, and others, alleged a variety of claims, including preferential payments and fraudulent conveyances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The referral remained under advisement in the district court for the next two months. With a trial date approaching, the district court finally referred the parties' contract dispute to the bankruptcy court on May 1, 2003. (Taking care of old business, the district court also denied as moot Rivera's January request to file another indispensability memo.) The case proceeded in bankruptcy court as a separate adversary proceeding (No. 03-0090), despite Rivera's motion in adversary proceeding No. 03-0042 to consolidate them. DCC moved to dismiss Coachman and Olympic Mills as intervenors, but the bankruptcy court denied the motion without discussion in a text order on February 12, 2004. After some additional discovery, DCC and Rivera filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Ruling upon the motions in August 2004, the bankruptcy court, recognizing that the \"sole remaining issue\" was the amount of damages DCC should receive, rejected Rivera's call to vacate the district court's previous ruling on liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Calculating the appropriate figure, the bankruptcy court granted DCC's motion, denied Rivera's, and, several days later, entered final judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera timely appealed to the BAP, which, after a thorough examination of its authority to review interlocutory orders of the district court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> affirmed. <i>Luis Rivera</i> <i>Siaca v. DCC Operating, Inc. (In re Olympic Mills Corp.),</i> 333 B.R. 540 (1st Cir.BAP 2005). This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the merits, we must deal with the procedural tangle and determine if we have jurisdiction, even though the parties did not originally contest our jurisdiction on appeal. <i>See Doyle v. Huntress, Inc.,</i> 419 F.3d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding that, even where subject-matter jurisdiction may go unchallenged on appeal, \"we have an obligation to inquire <i>sua sponte</i> into our jurisdiction over the matter\"). Indicating at oral argument that the integrity of complete diversity in this case was a matter of primary importance, we permitted the parties to submit supplemental briefing on whether the intervention of Coachman and Olympic Mills divested the district court of diversity jurisdiction. We now conclude that it did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Complete Diversity. The district courts of the United States are \"courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute.\" <i>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. Of Am.,</i> 511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). In 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, the sole basis for jurisdiction in this case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Congress bestowed upon the district courts original jurisdiction in civil actions between citizens of different states. The diversity requirement of &#167; 1332 must be complete. In cases involving multiple plaintiffs or defendants, the presence of but one nondiverse party divests the district court of original jurisdiction over the entire action. <i>See Strawbridge v. Curtiss,</i> 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 267, 267, 2 L.Ed. 435 (1806).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complete-diversity rule is not a constitutional requirement, <i>see State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Tashire,</i> 386 U.S. 523, 530-31, 87 S.Ct. 1199, 18 L.Ed.2d 270 (1967), or even explicitly required by the governing statute, <i>see</i> &#167; 1332, but it is nonetheless strictly construed. <i>Acton Co., Inc. of Mass. v. Bachman Foods, Inc.,</i> 668 F.2d 76, 79 (1st Cir.1982). History is in part responsible both for the rule's genesis and its rigid application. The historic primary function of the diversity requirement was \"to provide a `neutral' forum for the out-of-state litigant who fears that the state court may be unduly, if unconsciously and inarticulately, solicitous for the interests of its own citizens.\" <i>Caso v. Lafayette Radio Elecs. Corp.,</i> 370 F.2d 707, 710 (1st Cir.1966). The presence of a nondiverse party eliminates this concern over litigating in the state court. <i>See Wis. Dept. of Corr. v. Schacht,</i> 524 U.S. 381, 389, 118 S.Ct. 2047, 141 L.Ed.2d 364 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule is most inflexibly applied at the time of filing, for it has long been settled that \"the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought.\" <i>Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P.,</i> 541 U.S. 567, 570, 124 S.Ct. 1920, 158 L.Ed.2d 866 (2004) (quoting <i>Mullan v. Torrance,</i> 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 537, 539, 6 L.Ed. 154 (1824)). The postfiling context is more elastic because, as a general matter, \"if jurisdiction exists at the time an action is commenced, such jurisdiction may not be divested by subsequent events.\" <i>Freeport-McMoRan, Inc. v. K N Energy, Inc.,</i> 498 U.S. 426, 428, 111 S.Ct. 858, 112 L.Ed.2d 951 (1991) (per curiam) (involving substitution under Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(c)). There are exceptions, however: the postfiling introduction of a nondiverse party may, in certain circumstances, spoil the jurisdiction that obtained when the suit commenced. For example, in <i>Am. Fiber &amp; Finishing, Inc. v. Tyco Healthcare Group, LP,</i> 362 F.3d 136, 139 (1st Cir.2004), we read <i>Freeport-McMoRan</i> to apply in the context of postfiling transfers of interest under Rule 25, but not in the postfiling addition of a nondiverse party under Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a). <i>See also Casas Office Machs., Inc. v. Mita Copystar Am., Inc.,</i> 42 F.3d 668, 674 (1st Cir.1994) (substitution of dispensable nondiverse defendants for fictitious defendants destroyed diversity jurisdiction). Yet the rule championed in <i>Freeport-McMoRan</i> is one of general application, as we have observed. Whether intervention under Rule 24(a) fits this mold is the question to which we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful of our remark, in <i>B. Fernandez &amp; Hnos., Inc. v. Kellogg USA, Inc.,</i> 440 F.3d 541 (1st Cir.2006), that the addition of a nondiverse intervenor as of right divested the district court of diversity jurisdiction. At the puerile stages of the litigation in <i>Kellogg,</i> a nondiverse company, Kellogg Caribbean Services, Inc. (\"Kellogg Caribbean\"), appealed the district court's denial of its motion to intervene as of right as a defendant. Kellogg Caribbean argued that it, not Kellogg USA, Inc. (\"Kellogg USA\" &#8212; the original diverse defendant), was the proper defendant to the litigation because Kellogg USA previously had assigned its rights and obligations under the disputed contract to Kellogg Caribbean. We began by framing the inquiry:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[F]ederal jurisdiction is premised on the diversity of citizenship between Kellogg USA (a Michigan company) and [B. Fernandez &amp; Hnos.] and [Carribean Warehouse Logistics] (Puerto Rico companies). But, if Kellogg Caribbean (a Puerto Rico company) is entitled to intervene as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2) and is an indispensable party under Rule 19(b), the litigation must be dismissed because there would not be complete diversity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Kellogg,</i> 440 F.3d at 544. Tackling the intervention issue first, we concluded that the nondiverse company had satisfied the Rule 24(a)(2) requirements and that the district court had abused its discretion in denying the motion. Because, as a corollary, \"intervention would destroy complete diversity,\" <i>id.</i> at 547, we then turned to the indispensability analysis mandated by Rule 19(b). The analysis did not get far; observing that the district court had not independently analyzed the Rule 19(b) question, we remanded for further findings and an opportunity for the district court to select the way in which to resolve the problem (<i>i.e.,</i> dismiss the entire case, retain jurisdiction but limit the relief available to the nondiverse company, <i>et cetera, see id.</i> at 547-48). In doing so, however, we suggested strongly that, insofar as appellees sought an injunction that would affect the assignee's interests under the contract, Kellogg Caribbean was an indispensable party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case under review, the original and amended complaints alleged only state-law claims, observed that DCC was a Delaware corporation and Rivera a Puerto Rican resident, and thus properly invoked the district court's diversity jurisdiction. However, intervenors Coachman and Olympic Mills, were, like DCC, Delaware corporations, and entered as (nondiverse) party defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Because the parties, on appeal at least, do not assign error to the intervention of Coachman and Olympic Mills <i>per se,</i> we proceed directly to the Rule 19(b) analysis to determine `whether that intervention divested the district court of subject-matter jurisdiction. <i>See Kellogg,</i> 440 F.3d at 547; <i>cf. Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Ditmore,</i> 729 F.2d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1984) (holding that a necessary party under Rule 19(a) would be entitled <i>a priori</i> to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Indispensability.</i> This task requires us to decide whether Coachman and Olympic Mills are indispensable; if they are, the entire case must be dismissed for want of subject-matter jurisdiction. <i>See Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust v. Patterson,</i> 390 U.S. 102, 116-19, 88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968). As we stated in <i>Kellogg,</i> \"Rule 19(b) provides that, if a nonparty is deemed necessary to litigation but joining that nonparty would deprive the court of jurisdiction, the court should permit the action to proceed only to the extent that `equity and good conscience' warrant.\" <i>Kellogg,</i> 440 F.3d at 547 (quoting <i>Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust,</i> 390 U.S. at 109, 88 S.Ct. 733). Four factors guide the inquiry:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[F]irst to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b). From these factors, the Supreme Court has identified four corresponding interests: (1) the interest of the outsider whom it would have been desirable to join; (2) the defendant's interest in avoiding multiple litigation, inconsistent relief, or sole responsibility for a liability it shares with another; (3) the interest of the courts and the public in complete, consistent, and efficient settlement of controversies; and (4) the plaintiff's interest in having a forum. <i>H.D. Corp. of P.R. v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 791 F.2d 987, 992 (1st Cir.1986) (citing <i>Provident Tradesmen Bank &amp; Trust,</i> 390 U.S. at 108-11, 88 S.Ct. 733).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pause momentarily to address a wrinkle. The above factors and interests require fact-intensive analysis, \"involve the balancing of competing interest[,] and must be steeped in `pragmatic considerations.'\" <i>Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dingwell,</i> 884 F.2d 629, 635 (1st Cir.1989) (quoting Advisory Committee Notes). For these reasons, the findings and conclusions of a district court are entitled to deference on appeal, <i>id.,</i> and the absence of independent analysis (or any analysis at all) is a reason for remand. <i>See Kellogg,</i> 440 F.3d at 548. In the present case, the district court's text order granting intervention did not address the dispensability or indispensability of Coachman and Olympic Mills, and there is nothing in the record in the five months separating intervention from referral that sufficiently indicates what consideration, if any, the district court gave the matter. Yet in this situation remanding this case to the district court, which, as we have said, is in the \"preferred position\" to make Rule 19(b) determinations, <i>Travelers Indem. Co.,</i> 884 F.2d at 635, would be nothing short of Kafkaesque. As the above recitation makes clear, the travel of this case to date borders on the bizarre, and we see little wisdom in further complicating it. Here, the BAP did address the question and concluded that Coachman and Olympic Mills were not indispensable. Given the procedural tangle described above, and the impracticality (bordering on absurdity) of remand, we will proceed to decide the matter without remand under the plenary standard normally used in reviewing the legal conclusions of the BAP. <i>See Carvalho v. Fed. Nat'l Mortgage Assoc. (In re Carvalho),</i> 335 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Takeda v. Nw. Nat'l Life. Ins. Co.,</i> 765 F.2d 815, 818 n. 2 (9th Cir.1985) (\"Although in some cases it might be desirable to remand to allow a district court to determine whether a nondiverse party is indispensable, we have the power to decide the joinder issue on appeal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the factors and interests outlined above leads us inexorably to the conclusion that Coachman and Olympic Mills are not indispensable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera's argument that Coachman and Olympic Mills are indispensable because they have competing claims over the same <i>res</i> ignores the posture of this case. First, the causes of action involved in the district court (later adversary proceeding No. 04-0090) and the bankruptcy court (adversary proceeding No. 03-0042) were completely different. In district court, DCC pursued Rivera in his personal capacity for violating &#182; 4 of the Subordination Agreement, which required Rivera (1) to hold in trust any cash or collateral received from Coachman in payment of the principal of the subordinated debt, and (2) immediately to pay over to DCV the cash or collateral held in trust for application to the senior debt until the senior debt was repaid in full. Coachman and Olympic Mills had no such claim against Rivera (before or after they filed for bankruptcy), and instead sued him in bankruptcy court in adversary proceeding No. 03-0042, alleging fraudulent conveyances and other related causes of action. <i>See Torcise v. Cmty. Bank of Homestead (In re Torcise),</i> 116 F.3d 860, 865-66 (11th Cir.1997) (secured creditor that initiated separate state-law action against bank was not indispensable party to adversary proceeding brought by Chapter 11 debtors' unsecured creditors committee against bank to recover fraudulent and preferential payments). Second, and relatedly, Coachman and Olympic Mills were independently capable of making a run at Rivera's money using different means from the point in time when they filed for Chapter 11 protection, November 26, 2001. <i>Cf. Baker v. Minn. Min. and Mfg. Co., Inc.,</i> 99 Fed.Appx. 718, 723-24 (6th Cir.2004) (partial subrogee not an indispensable party because it can recover whatever it is owed in a separate action); <i>Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co. v. CFMT, Inc.,</i> 142 F.3d 1266, 1272 (Fed.Cir.1998) (licencee of patent is not indispensable because it could cause the patent owner to bring a separate action for infringement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera also relies unduly on Coachman's obligations under the Subordination Agreement to support his indispensability pitch. Under the terms of the Subordination Agreement, the subordination and trust obligations ran from Rivera (the obligor) to DVC (the obligee). Coachman was a signatory to the Subordination Agreement, but its participation was perfunctory: Coachman simply promised that Rivera's obligations under the Subordination Agreement would not impair its obligations under the Note, under which it was the sole obligor. Even if we were to conclude that Coachman was a co-obligor under the Subordination Agreement &#8212; as opposed to a mere promissor &#8212; it is clear that co-obligors generally are not indispensable parties in contract disputes that do not involve reformation, cancellation, rescission, or otherwise challenge the validity of the contract. <i>See, e.g., Universal Reinsurance Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,</i> 312 F.3d 82, 87 (2d Cir.2002) (joint obligors not indispensable); <i>Janney Montgomery Scott, Inc. v. Shepard Niles, Inc.,</i> 11 F.3d 399, 405 (3d Cir.1993) (co-obligor/non-obligee not indispensable); <i>Brackin Tie, Lumber &amp; Chip Co., Inc. v. McLarty Farms, Inc.,</i> 704 F.2d 585, 586-87 (11th Cir.1983) (co-obligors/non-obligees are not indispensable); <i>Bio-Analytical Servs., Inc. v. Edgewater Hosp., Inc.,</i> 565 F.2d 450, 452-53 (7th Cir.1977) (guarantor/co-obligor not indispensable); <i>Trans. Pacific Corp. v. S. Seas Enters., Ltd.,</i> 291 F.2d 435, 436 (9th Cir.1961) (per curiam) (joint obligors not indispensable when the suit is not for rescission, but for damages for breach of contract); 7 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> &#167; 1613, at 177-78 (3d ed. 2001) (\"Joint obligors thus typically are treated as Rule 19(a) parties, but are not deemed indispensable under Rule 19(b).\"); <i>c.f. H.D. Corp. of P.R.,</i> 791 F.2d at 993 (nondiverse parent corporation was indispensable because it was a signatory to the agreements at issue in the litigation and plaintiffs' claims were largely directed against it, not the diverse defendant subsidiary corporation); <i>Acton Co., Inc. of Mass.,</i> 668 F.2d at 77-78 (nondiverse parent corporation was indispensable because it was a party to the agreements at issue in the litigation, played a substantial role in the negotiation of those agreements, and stood to lose a sizable deposit).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rivera's assertion that DCC sought injunctive relief against Coachman and Olympic Mills misrepresents the record. If true, such a request might weigh heavily in favor of indispensability. <i>See, e.g., Kellogg,</i> 440 F.3d at 548 (stating that nondiverse intervenor was indispensable insofar as plaintiff sought an injunction that affected the intervenor's interests under the agreements); <i>Acton Co., Inc. of Mass.,</i> 668 F.2d at 81-82 (seeking recision of a contract makes all parties to that contract, and others having a substantial interest in it, indispensable parties); 7 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> &#167; 1613, at 196 (3rd ed. 2001) (\"[I]n an action seeking specific performance of a contract all persons who will be required to act to carry out a court order compelling performance have been held to be indispensable parties.\"). But review of the amended complaint shows that DCC sought only to prevent <i>Rivera,</i> in his capacity as chairman and chief executive officer, from directing Coachman and Olympic Mills to repay his subordinated loans until DCV's senior loan was paid in full. DCC sought nothing from Coachman or Olympic Mills directly or in any way that would affect their interest under the Subordination Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, where pragmatism strongly militates against a finding of indispensability and Rivera has not persuaded us otherwise, the plaint falls far short of the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Divestiture.</i> Whether dispensable, nondiverse defendant-intervenors destroy complete diversity is a question we have not addressed squarely. An insensitive reading of <i>Kellogg</i> &#8212; but one that would not necessarily be inconsistent with our strict construction of the complete-diversity rule &#8212; would seem to suggest that nondiverse intervenors are incompatible with the tenets of the rule. But \"[j]udges expect their pronunciamentos to be read in context,\" <i>Wisehart v. Davis,</i> 408 F.3d 321, 326 (7th Cir.2005), and the broader context of <i>Kellogg</i> does not support such an absolutist approach. <i>Kellogg</i> involved a likely indispensable party that, as assignee under the contract at issue, sought (effectively) to substitute itself for the diverse defendant by means of intervention as of right. Intervention was thus the product of the plaintiff-appellees' choice to sue the diverse assignor instead of the nondiverse assignee. This was untenable in <i>Kellogg</i> because a plaintiff cannot circumvent complete diversity by artful pleading; otherwise, \"a plaintiff could leave non-diverse defendants out of the original lawsuit and then wait for them to be impleaded or otherwise joined.\" <i>Acton Co., Inc. of Mass.,</i> 668 F.2d at 79; <i>see also Owen Equip. &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger,</i> 437 U.S. 365, 374-75, 377, 98 S.Ct. 2396, 57 L.Ed.2d 274 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances surrounding the intervention of Coachman and Olympic Mills in the present case are strikingly different from those in <i>Kellogg.</i> DCC did not need the participation of Coachman or Olympic Mills to collect the money Rivera had retained in breach of the Subordination Agreement. When Coachman and Olympic Mills eventually sought intervention as of right, the interests they advanced flowed directly from their status as debtors-in-possession. Critically, these interests did not arise until Coachman and Olympic Mills filed for bankruptcy on November 26, 2001, almost a month <i>after</i> DCC filed suit against Rivera. <i>See Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.,</i> 498 U.S. at 428, 111 S.Ct. 858 (a nondiverse dispensable party that had no interest in the outcome of the litigation until sometime after suit was commenced did not defeat diversity jurisdiction); <i>Aurora Loan Servs., Inc. v. Craddieth,</i> 442 F.3d 1018, 1025 (7th Cir. 2006) (holding that diversity jurisdiction was not destroyed by the intervention of a nondiverse party whose claims arose in the course of a foreclosure proceeding after it obtained the certificate of sale); <i>Salt Lake Tribune Publ'g Co., LLC v. AT &amp; T Corp.,</i> 320 F.3d 1081, 1095-97 (10th Cir.2003) (similar, but in the context of a disputed option to purchase the assets of a newspaper operation). There was thus no two-step evasion of the diversity requirement here such as was lurking behind the pleadings in <i>Kellogg.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In similar situations, the weight of authority holds that claims launched by necessary but dispensable, nondiverse defendant-intervenors do not defeat the original jurisdiction (diversity) that obtained at the commencement of the action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See, e.g., Mattel, Inc. v.

Much less is such jurisdiction defeated by the intervention, by leave of the court, of a party whose presence is not essential to a decision of the controversy between the original parties.\")). The present case offends the complete-diversity rule even less: in adversary proceeding No. 03-0090 (the case at bar), Coachman and Olympic Mills made no claims against any party and no party made any claims against them. (This is not the case, of course, in adversary proceeding No. 03-0042, which is not before us.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confident in our jurisdiction, we proceed directly to the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Contract Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Subordination.</i> The parties dispute the capture of the term \"Subordinated Debt\" as defined in &#182; 1.a the Subordination Agreement. DCC contends, and the lower courts unanimously agreed, that the plain language in the Subordination Agreement subordinates all of Rivera's loans to Coachman and its affiliates, irrespective of the time they were made. Rivera disputes this conclusion and argues that the plain language subordinates only loans made before the execution of the Subordination Agreement or, in the alternative, that the language is ambiguous and should thus be construed against its drafter, DCC. This distinction is critical because Rivera submits that the contested payments apply only to his loans that post-date the Subordination Agreement, not his previous loans that, under the Subordination Agreement, constitute subordinated debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties identify two provisions in the Subordination Agreement as evidence tending to support their respective positions. The first is defining \"Subordinated Debt,\" provided below in full:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Subordinated Debt\" shall mean all principal, interest, fees, costs, enforcement expenses (including legal fees and disbursements), collateral protection expenses and other reimbursement and indemnity obligations that the Subordinating Creditor [Rivera] has loaned to the Borrower [Coachman] or any of its affiliates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second details \"Subordination,\" and reads in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. <i>Subordination.</i> The Senior Debt [DCV's $2 million bridge loan] and the Note and any and all other documents and instruments evidencing or creating the Senior Debt and all guaranties, mortgages, security agreements, pledges and other collateral guarantying or securing the Senior Debt or any part thereof shall be senior to the Subordinated Debt irrespective of the time of the execution, delivery or issuance of any thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both DCC and Rivera agree (ignoring Rivera's alternate argument for the moment) that these provisions are unambiguous, but in opposite ways. Displaying its conjugative prowess, DCC argues that \"shall mean\" indicates \"the future progressive tense and, as the main verb phrase in this definitional section, use of the those words require that the entire definition is to be read at the time the [Subordination Agreement] is being enforced, not the time at which it was executed.\" Not to be syntactically outplayed, Rivera responds that \"has loaned\" can only refer to loans outstanding as of the date of the Subordination Agreement, and cannot possibly encompass loans made after that date. The grammatical acrobatics continue with competing interpretations of the \"Subordination\" clause, specifically with respect to the following language: \"irrespective of the time of the execution, delivery or issuance of any thereof.\" DCC posits that this language modifies \"Subordinated Debt,\" which is the closest noun; Rivera argues that it modifies \"Senior Debt,\" which is the direct object of \"shall be senior.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DCC also invokes two provisions in the Note to support its interpretation of the Subordination Agreement. The first is the Note's definition of the Subordination Agreement, which is attached to the Note as an annex, provided in &#182; 1.(xiv):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Subordination and Standby Agreement\" shall mean the agreement <i>(Annex D)</i> by Mr. Luis Rivera to subordinate and defer repayment of the principal of any loan by him to the Company [Coachman], Olympic Mills Corp., Olympic Group, Inc. or the new entity pursuant to the Hampshire Agreement until this Note is converted and repaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second, a condition precedent to DCV's loan under the Note, is provided in &#182; 5.1:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Subordination and Standby Agreement.</i> Mr Luis Rivera Siaca shall execute an irrevokable Subordination and Standby Agreement, in the form attached here to as <i>Annex D,</i> whereby his loans to the Company [Coachman] or its affiliates are subordinated to this Note and he agrees to defer payment of principal on such loans until this Note is either converted into Series E preferred Stock or is repaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using this language, and corresponding language in the Subordination Agreement that it claims expressly incorporates the Note by reference (<i>i.e.,</i> the recital that identifies the execution of the Subordination Agreement as a \"condition precedent to the Lender's [DCV] willingness to make a loan to the Borrower [Coachman] pursuant to the Note\"), DCC argues that the \"Subordinated Debt\" unambiguously applies to all of Rivera's loans to Coachman and its affiliates. Rivera concedes that the Subordination Agreement \"refers to and describes the Note,\" but denies that it incorporates the Note by reference. Also, Rivera argues that the Note is \"outside the four corners\" of the Subordination Agreement, and, for the purposes of deciding their contract dispute, constitutes extrinsic evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the decisions of the district court.

NSTAR Elec. &amp; Gas Corp.,</i> 449 F.3d 206, 219 (1st Cir.2006) (using principle to construe an ambiguous collective bargaining agreement). We think it fair to predict that, were the Delaware Supreme Court presented with this question, it would read the disputed language of the Subordination Agreement in light of the pertinent provisions of the Note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Both contracts were signed on the same day (February 24, 2000) between substantially the same parties (Rivera signed the Note as Coachman's chairman) as facets of the same transaction (the infusion of capital into the Coachman enterprise) for a unitary purpose (to fund the acquisition of sweaters). As further evidence of symbiosis, the execution of the Subordination Agreement was listed as a condition precedent to the Note, and the document was physically attached to the Note as an annex. Also, neither document contains a merger clause or any indication of the parties' intent to read each contract in isolation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the Subordination Agreement quickly comes into focus when viewed through the lens of the Note. The most obvious blow to Rivera's interpretation of the Subordination Agreement is the Note's use of \"any loan\" in &#182; 1.(xiv), without any accompanying prospective limitation. In fact, subsequent language in &#182; 1.(xiv) shows that such a limitation could not have been intended. In pertinent part, &#182; 1.(xiv) explains that the Subordination Agreement would require Rivera \"to subordinate and defer repayment of the principal of <i>any loan,</i> by him to the Company [Coachman], Olympic Mills Corp., Olympic Group, Inc. <i>or the new entity,</i> pursuant to the Hampshire Agreement until this Note is converted and repaid.\" (Emphasis supplied.) However, prior to February 24, 2000, Rivera had extended loans to Coachman and Olympic Mills only; he did not extend any loans to the \"new entity\" (a/k/a/ Glamourette) until afterwards. (It is unclear even whether Glamourette existed on the date of the signing.) Further, &#182; 5.1 provides that DCV's loan would issue only if Rivera would agree that \"his loans to the Company [Coachman] <i>or its affiliates</i> [not simply \"and its affiliate Olympic Mills\"] are subordinated to this Note.\" (Emphasis supplied.) The Subordination Agreement uses similarly broad language in &#182; 1.(xiv): \"the Subordinating Creditor [Rivera] has loaned to the Borrower [Coachman] <i>or any of its affiliates.\"</i> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unwilling to endorse, as Rivera would have us do, an interpretation of \"has loaned\" that would render the above language meaningless or superfluous, <i>see Crowe,</i> 365 F.3d at 97, and that would run counter to the overall scheme that these documents were designed to effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> <i>See E.I. du Pont de Nemours,</i> 498 A.2d at 1113. Because the disputed language is not <i>reasonably</i> susceptible of different interpretations, <i>see Rhone-Poulenc,</i> 616 A.2d at 1195, we hold that the Subordination Agreement, when properly read in conjunction with the Note, unambiguously covers the post-Subordination Agreement loans at issue in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> We are therefore not required (or permitted), under Delaware law, to consider evidence extrinsic to these documents. <i>See Eagle Indus., Inc. v. DeVilbiss Health Care, Inc.,</i> 702 A.2d 1228, 1232 (Del.1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Equitable Estoppel.</i> In a last-ditch attempt to avert liability, Rivera contends that the doctrine of equitable estoppel precludes DCC from enforcing the Subordination Agreement. Specifically, Rivera argues that president of DCC and then Coachman director Wayne Foren \"expressly consented to or knowingly acquiesced in\" the repayment of Rivera's loans.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> To support his argument, Rivera touts (1) an April 14, 2000 letter in which Foren <i>proposed</i> that Rivera provide a $3 million short-term credit line that would be exempt from the Subordination Agreement, and (2) the December 12, 2000 board minutes that do not indicate whether Foren objected to the <i>prospect</i> that Coachman would use proceeds from the Puerto Rico Industrial Incentive Fund to repay Rivera's $4 million loan that pre-dated the Subordination Agreement. Ignoring the fact that Rivera did not present the April 14 letter to the district court in his opposition to DCC's summary judgment motion, the dispositive flaw in this evidence is that it fails to show how Rivera was induced to rely &#8212; let alone detrimentally &#8212; on Foren's conduct. <i>See VonFeldt v. Stifel Financial Corp.,</i> 714 A.2d 79, 87 (Del.1998) (requiring a showing of detrimental reliance to support a claim of equitable estoppel). Without more, we are bound to reject this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Damages.</i> Rivera's contention that the bankruptcy court's award does not accurately reflect expectation damages, <i>see Duncan v. Theratx, Inc.,</i> 775 A.2d 1019, 1022 (Del.2001) (requiring the breaching promisor to compensate the promisee for the promisee's reasonable expectation of the value of the breached contract), is waived on at least two grounds. First, as presented to the district court (and later reiterated to the bankruptcy court), the argument was fatally undeveloped, comprising only four sentences, a citation to a district court opinion, and no analysis whatsoever. <i>See McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir.1991) (\"theories not raised squarely in the district court cannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal\"). Second, as presented to us, the argument impermissibly depends on an entirely new factual predicate: that \"Olympic and Glamourette had many other creditors besides Rivera Siaca to whom money was owned and who could have been paid without violating the Subordination Agreement.\" <i>See Cochran v. Quest Software, Inc.,</i> 328 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2003) (\"a party may not advance for the first time on appeal either a new argument or an old argument that depends on a new factual predicate\"). For these reasons, we decline to entertain it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

We take no position generally on the BAP's authority to review interlocutory orders of the district court, but assume, for the limited purpose of deciding this rather complicated appeal, that the BAP's ruling in this respect is appropriate.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> DCC's argument that the district court's original jurisdiction continued uninterrupted from diversity of citizenship to bankruptcy jurisdiction is unsupported and mischaracterizes the circumstances of this case. The theory appears to rely on the tortured application of a limited exception to the complete-diversity rule when a plaintiff joins a nondiverse defendant sued under federal law with a diverse defendant sued in diversity<i>See Romero v. Int'l Terminal Operating Co.,</i> 358 U.S. 354, 381, 79 S.Ct. 468, 3 L.Ed.2d 368 (1959) (\"Since the Jones Act provides an independent basis of federal jurisdiction over the non-diverse respondent ... the rule of <i>Strawbridge v. Curtiss,</i> . . . does not require dismissal of the claims against the diverse respondents.\"). The exception recognizes and attempts to ameliorate the \"anomaly that would be created by `not allowing a plaintiff to do in one federal suit what he would be entitled to do in two separate federal suits.'\" <i>Hiram Walker &amp; Sons, Inc., v. Kirk Line,</i> 877 F.2d 1508, 1512 (11th Cir.1989) (quoting <i>Baker v. J.C. Penney Co.,</i> 496 F.Supp. 922, 924 (N.D.Ga.1980)). The present case is clearly distinguishable because, at the commencement of the case, there was no independent basis of original federal jurisdiction that DCC could have invoked to bring suit against Coachman or Olympic Mills (nondiverse parties) on its state-law contract claims under the Subordination Agreement while, at the same time, bringing suit against Rivera (a diverse party) in diversity.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Coachman and Olympic Mills appear to have entered the contract dispute (later adversary proceeding No. 03-0090) as defendant intervenors, although their alignment is not entirely clear from the record. We have the authority to determine this matter for ourselves,<i>see City of Indianapolis v. Chase Nat'l Bank,</i> 314 U.S. 63, 69, 62 S.Ct. 15, 86 L.Ed.47 (1941) (courts have a \"duty\" to \"look beyond the pleadings and arrange the parties according to their sides in the dispute\"); <i>Gabriel v. Preble,</i> 396 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir.2005), but the inquiry is academic: Coachman and Olympic Mills are nondiverse no matter whom they are aligned against in this case. The adversary complaint filed on behalf of Coachman and Olympic Mills in adversary proceeding No. 03-0042 identifies Coachman and Olympic Mills as Delaware corporations with their principal place of business in Puerto Rico. Consequently, even if an analysis of the parties' actual interests more accurately pitted Coachman and Olympic Mills against Rivera, and we were to realign the parties accordingly, citizens of Puerto Rico would then stare at each other from across the \"v.\" <i>See</i> &#167; 1332(c)(1).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> From this perspective, the proper alignment of Coachman and Olympic Mills becomes more than an academic exercise, see<i>supra</i> note 8, because the intervention of a nondiverse party as a <i>plaintiff</i> raises a suspicious judicial eyebrow under &#167; 1332. <i>See, e.g., Aurora,</i> 442 F.3d at 1025-26; <i>Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. Kearney,</i> 212 F.3d 721, 726-28 (2d Cir. 2000); <i>accord Acton Co., Inc. of Mass.,</i> 668 F.2d at 79. Although this is a close call (perhaps because it is difficult to quantify and compare the parties' competing and complex interests), the record does not support realigning Coachman and Olympic Mills as plaintiff intervenors. Coachman and Olympic Mills intervened to forestall DCC from collecting on a favorable judgment it had received just ten days earlier, and then sued DCC (plus Rivera and others) when the district court did not immediately refer the case to the bankruptcy court. Certainly the intervenors had interests adverse to Rivera's, but, on balance and in light of the circumstances surrounding the intervention, DCC was the more antipodean player as competitor for Rivera's ill-gotten gains.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In its supplemental brief, DCC suggests that, were we to hold that intervention had defeated the district court's jurisdiction (which we do not), we should exercise our power under Fed.R.Civ.P. 21 and, to preserve diversity, dismiss the case as to Coachman and Olympic Mills<i>See Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain,</i> 490 U.S. 826, 837, 109 S.Ct. 2218, 104 L.Ed.2d 893 (1989). DCC's suggestion is puzzling. Although neither party brought this fact to the Court's attention, our independent review of the record reveals that Coachman and Olympic Mills were to be dismissed from adversary proceeding No. 03-0090 in accordance with a settlement stipulation in adversary proceeding No. 03-0042. This dismissal alone would have cured any jurisdictional defect ailing the case up to that point and invocation of Rule 21 would be superfluous as a result. <i>Cf. Caterpillar, Inc. v.

As an initial matter, it is debatable whether this language imports a subject-matter restraint on the Subordination Agreement or simply associates the \"new entity\" with the Hampshire venture.

Such language is common in defining contractual terms, as exemplified by the very contracts in this case: both defined terms in the Subordination Agreement (\"Senior Debt\" is the other, in &#182; 1.a), and all fourteen in the Note, employ \"shall mean\" to convey the terms' intended meaning</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> We need not, and therefore do not, address the parties' competing interpretations of the \"Subordination\" clause in &#182; 7 of the Subordination Agreement.

The progenitor of this procedural gem, plaintiff-appellee DCC Operating, Inc. (\"DCC\"), originally brought suit in diversity in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. After obtaining a favorable summary judgment ruling, nondiverse debtors-in-possession Coachman, Inc. (\"Coachman\"), and its wholly-owned subsidiary Olympic Mills Corp. (\"Olympic Mills\"), intervened, requesting that the case be referred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Puerto Rico. Digesting the issue for several months, the district court eventually referred the case to the bankruptcy court, which, over a year later, awarded damages and entered final judgment. Rivera appealed the unfavorable ruling to the BAP; unsuccessful there as well, he appealed to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we reach the merits of this appeal, we must cut through a factual and procedural knot of Gordian complexity. This task calls upon us to examine at the outset whether we have subject-matter jurisdiction or if it was destroyed by the intervention of nondiverse intervenors; in turn, whether the intervenors are indispensable; and ultimately, whether remand would be appropriate to sort all this out. We cut the knot by stepping forward to address these issues without remand. Once the procedural issues are resolved we move to the merits, which by comparison present a fairly straightforward issue for resolution.

The Hampshire Venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contract dispute began with a $2 million bridge loan essentially to finance the acquisition of sweaters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The lender, Development Capital Ventures, LP (\"DCV\"), is an investment company that provides venture capital to small businesses. The borrower, now-defunct Coachman, was a small business operating in Puerto Rico. In connection with the bridge loan, which was to be made in two $1 million installments (one on February 25, 2000, the other on March 10, 2000), Coachman delivered to DCV a \"CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEMAND NOTE\" (the \"Note\") on February 24, 2000. The Note had a maturity date of June 30, 2000,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and provided for the conversion of the principal amount into company stock at DCV's option at any time before the balance was paid in full, or automatically upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Note identified, described, and attached as annexes four documents that bore upon the bridge loan. Annex A was a term sheet detailing the conversion of stock; it, along with a guaranty embodied in annex C, is not involved in this dispute. Annex B was a document entitled \"ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT,\" which the Note identified as the \"Hampshire Agreement\" and defined in &#182; 1.(viii) as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Hampshire Agreement\" shall mean the agreement between the Company [Coachman] and Hampshire Corporation (\"Hampshire\") whereby the Company establishes a subsidiary to acquire inventory and equipment from Hampshire and Hampshire guarantees to acquire a minimum of 12 million sweaters from such subsidiary over the next five (5) years, or an average annual purchase of 2.4 million sweater units. See draft agreement under <i>Annex B.,</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The draft version of the Hampshire Agreement identified the \"subsidiary\" referenced above as Glamourette/OM, Inc. (\"Glamourette\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The last document attached to the Note (as annex D) was a \"SUBORDINATION AND STANDBY AGREEMENT\" (the \"Subordination Agreement\"). According to the terms of the Note, Rivera, Coachman's affluent chairman and sometimes lender, was required to execute the Subordination Agreement as a condition precedent to the bridge loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera executed the Subordination Agreement, along with the Note (on behalf of Coachman), on February 24, 2000. At that time, Coachman owed Rivera approximately $5.75 million on past loans, but neither the Note nor the Subordination Agreement identified the particular loans to be subordinated to DCV's bridge loan. Almost a year later, Coachman fell into default. DCV's corporate general partner, DCC, demanded that Coachman pay its balance. When Coachman took no action to satisfy its obligations under the Note, DCC demanded that Rivera pay all amounts due from payments he had received from Coachman or its affiliates over the previous year. (Between February 24, 2000, and October 18, 2001, Rivera made a series of loans to Coachman, Olympic Mills, and Glamourette totaling $16.6 million, and was repaid at least $5.6 million.) On November 7, 2001, DCC, alleging various state-law claims under the Subordination Agreement, sued Rivera in diversity in federal district court. Shortly thereafter, on November 26, 2001, Coachman, Olympic Mills, and Glamourette filed in bankruptcy court voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discovery proceeded in district court for almost a year before DCC and Rivera filed cross-motions for summary judgment. DCC argued that Rivera violated his trust obligations under the Subordination Agreement by retaining certain payments from Coachman or its affiliates. Specifically, DCC contended that, pursuant to &#182; 4 of the Subordination Agreement, Rivera was required to forward such payments to DCV for application against the bridge loan. Rivera responded that the Subordination Agreement covered only those loans made before January 24, 2000. The disbursements he had received, Rivera explained, were in payment of loans made after the execution of the Subordination Agreement. The district court disagreed and ruled that the Subordination Agreement unambiguously covered the repayment of all loans, whenever made, until Coachman satisfied its obligations under the Note. However, the district court reserved decision on the amount of damages hoping that, in light of its ruling, the parties would reach an agreement on their own. The district court entered partial summary judgment on December 16, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nine days later, Rivera moved to dismiss the case for failure to join Coachman and Olympic Mills. Rivera argued, for the first time, that these parties were necessary, indispensable, and (importantly) nondiverse by virtue of their incorporation in Delaware. (DCC was a Delaware corporation as well.) The next day, Coachman and Olympic Mills filed in the district court through special counsel a motion to intervene as of right under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2). Citing DCC's recent victory, Coachman and Olympic Mills argued, without actually asserting any claim, that the payments to Rivera \"may be subject to the avoidance powers\" granted to them as debtors-in-possession. Because their interest in these payments \"may preempt\" that of DCC, and because \"DCC's attempt to collect the funds for its own benefit implicate[s] numerous core bankruptcy issues,\" Coachman and Olympic Mills requested that the case be referred to the bankruptcy court for further adjudication. In a text order entered on December 31, 2002, the district court granted the motion to intervene without discussion (and without addressing Rivera's motion or soliciting DCC's position on either motion), and ordered the parties to appear at a status conference on January 16, 2003, to address the intervenors' referral request. DCC filed a motion opposing dismissal, intervention, and referral on January 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the status conference, DCC said that it would consent to referral only if Rivera would deposit over $5 million with the bankruptcy court. The district court gave Rivera until January 24 to respond, set a briefing schedule on the referral question if Rivera declined DCC's offer (which he did), and stated that the case would proceed to trial on May 27, 2003 if the case were not referred. Coachman and Olympic Mills submitted a memorandum on February 24 pursuant to the scheduling order, but, short-circuiting the process, initiated an adversarial proceeding (No. 03-0042) in bankruptcy court the very next day. The complaint, filed against Rivera, DCC, DCV, and others, alleged a variety of claims, including preferential payments and fraudulent conveyances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The referral remained under advisement in the district court for the next two months. With a trial date approaching, the district court finally referred the parties' contract dispute to the bankruptcy court on May 1, 2003. (Taking care of old business, the district court also denied as moot Rivera's January request to file another indispensability memo.) The case proceeded in bankruptcy court as a separate adversary proceeding (No. 03-0090), despite Rivera's motion in adversary proceeding No. 03-0042 to consolidate them. DCC moved to dismiss Coachman and Olympic Mills as intervenors, but the bankruptcy court denied the motion without discussion in a text order on February 12, 2004. After some additional discovery, DCC and Rivera filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Ruling upon the motions in August 2004, the bankruptcy court, recognizing that the \"sole remaining issue\" was the amount of damages DCC should receive, rejected Rivera's call to vacate the district court's previous ruling on liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Calculating the appropriate figure, the bankruptcy court granted DCC's motion, denied Rivera's, and, several days later, entered final judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera timely appealed to the BAP, which, after a thorough examination of its authority to review interlocutory orders of the district court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> affirmed. <i>Luis Rivera</i> <i>Siaca v.

At the puerile stages of the litigation in <i>Kellogg,</i> a nondiverse company, Kellogg Caribbean Services, Inc. (\"Kellogg Caribbean\"), appealed the district court's denial of its motion to intervene as of right as a defendant. Kellogg Caribbean argued that it, not Kellogg USA, Inc. (\"Kellogg USA\" &#8212; the original diverse defendant), was the proper defendant to the litigation because Kellogg USA previously had assigned its rights and obligations under the disputed contract to Kellogg Caribbean. We began by framing the inquiry:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[F]ederal jurisdiction is premised on the diversity of citizenship between Kellogg USA (a Michigan company) and [B.

Tackling the intervention issue first, we concluded that the nondiverse company had satisfied the Rule 24(a)(2) requirements and that the district court had abused its discretion in denying the motion. Because, as a corollary, \"intervention would destroy complete diversity,\" <i>id.</i> at 547, we then turned to the indispensability analysis mandated by Rule 19(b). The analysis did not get far; observing that the district court had not independently analyzed the Rule 19(b) question, we remanded for further findings and an opportunity for the district court to select the way in which to resolve the problem (<i>i.e.,</i> dismiss the entire case, retain jurisdiction but limit the relief available to the nondiverse company, <i>et cetera, see id.</i> at 547-48). In doing so, however, we suggested strongly that, insofar as appellees sought an injunction that would affect the assignee's interests under the contract, Kellogg Caribbean was an indispensable party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case under review, the original and amended complaints alleged only state-law claims, observed that DCC was a Delaware corporation and Rivera a Puerto Rican resident, and thus properly invoked the district court's diversity jurisdiction.

From these factors, the Supreme Court has identified four corresponding interests: (1) the interest of the outsider whom it would have been desirable to join; (2) the defendant's interest in avoiding multiple litigation, inconsistent relief, or sole responsibility for a liability it shares with another; (3) the interest of the courts and the public in complete, consistent, and efficient settlement of controversies; and (4) the plaintiff's interest in having a forum. <i>H.D.

For these reasons, the findings and conclusions of a district court are entitled to deference on appeal, <i>id.,</i> and the absence of independent analysis (or any analysis at all) is a reason for remand. <i>See Kellogg,</i> 440 F.3d at 548. In the present case, the district court's text order granting intervention did not address the dispensability or indispensability of Coachman and Olympic Mills, and there is nothing in the record in the five months separating intervention from referral that sufficiently indicates what consideration, if any, the district court gave the matter. Yet in this situation remanding this case to the district court, which, as we have said, is in the \"preferred position\" to make Rule 19(b) determinations, <i>Travelers Indem. Co.,</i> 884 F.2d at 635, would be nothing short of Kafkaesque. As the above recitation makes clear, the travel of this case to date borders on the bizarre, and we see little wisdom in further complicating it.

First, the causes of action involved in the district court (later adversary proceeding No. 04-0090) and the bankruptcy court (adversary proceeding No. 03-0042) were completely different. In district court, DCC pursued Rivera in his personal capacity for violating &#182; 4 of the Subordination Agreement, which required Rivera (1) to hold in trust any cash or collateral received from Coachman in payment of the principal of the subordinated debt, and (2) immediately to pay over to DCV the cash or collateral held in trust for application to the senior debt until the senior debt was repaid in full. Coachman and Olympic Mills had no such claim against Rivera (before or after they filed for bankruptcy), and instead sued him in bankruptcy court in adversary proceeding No. 03-0042, alleging fraudulent conveyances and other related causes of action. <i>See Torcise v.

Second, and relatedly, Coachman and Olympic Mills were independently capable of making a run at Rivera's money using different means from the point in time when they filed for Chapter 11 protection, November 26, 2001. <i>Cf. Baker v. Minn. Min. and Mfg.

Under the terms of the Subordination Agreement, the subordination and trust obligations ran from Rivera (the obligor) to DVC (the obligee). Coachman was a signatory to the Subordination Agreement, but its participation was perfunctory: Coachman simply promised that Rivera's obligations under the Subordination Agreement would not impair its obligations under the Note, under which it was the sole obligor. Even if we were to conclude that Coachman was a co-obligor under the Subordination Agreement &#8212; as opposed to a mere promissor &#8212; it is clear that co-obligors generally are not indispensable parties in contract disputes that do not involve reformation, cancellation, rescission, or otherwise challenge the validity of the contract. <i>See, e.g., Universal Reinsurance Co. v.

But review of the amended complaint shows that DCC sought only to prevent <i>Rivera,</i> in his capacity as chairman and chief executive officer, from directing Coachman and Olympic Mills to repay his subordinated loans until DCV's senior loan was paid in full. DCC sought nothing from Coachman or Olympic Mills directly or in any way that would affect their interest under the Subordination Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, where pragmatism strongly militates against a finding of indispensability and Rivera has not persuaded us otherwise, the plaint falls far short of the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Divestiture.</i> Whether dispensable, nondiverse defendant-intervenors destroy complete diversity is a question we have not addressed squarely. An insensitive reading of <i>Kellogg</i> &#8212; but one that would not necessarily be inconsistent with our strict construction of the complete-diversity rule &#8212; would seem to suggest that nondiverse intervenors are incompatible with the tenets of the rule.

Intervention was thus the product of the plaintiff-appellees' choice to sue the diverse assignor instead of the nondiverse assignee. This was untenable in <i>Kellogg</i> because a plaintiff cannot circumvent complete diversity by artful pleading; otherwise, \"a plaintiff could leave non-diverse defendants out of the original lawsuit and then wait for them to be impleaded or otherwise joined.\" <i>Acton Co., Inc. of Mass.,</i> 668 F.2d at 79; <i>see also Owen Equip. &amp; Erection Co. v.

When Coachman and Olympic Mills eventually sought intervention as of right, the interests they advanced flowed directly from their status as debtors-in-possession. Critically, these interests did not arise until Coachman and Olympic Mills filed for bankruptcy on November 26, 2001, almost a month <i>after</i> DCC filed suit against Rivera. <i>See Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.,</i> 498 U.S. at 428, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112531\"><a href=\"/opinion/112531/freeport-mcmoran-inc-v-k-n-energy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

DCC contends, and the lower courts unanimously agreed, that the plain language in the Subordination Agreement subordinates all of Rivera's loans to Coachman and its affiliates, irrespective of the time they were made. Rivera disputes this conclusion and argues that the plain language subordinates only loans made before the execution of the Subordination Agreement or, in the alternative, that the language is ambiguous and should thus be construed against its drafter, DCC. This distinction is critical because Rivera submits that the contested payments apply only to his loans that post-date the Subordination Agreement, not his previous loans that, under the Subordination Agreement, constitute subordinated debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties identify two provisions in the Subordination Agreement as evidence tending to support their respective positions. The first is defining \"Subordinated Debt,\" provided below in full:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Subordinated Debt\" shall mean all principal, interest, fees, costs, enforcement expenses (including legal fees and disbursements), collateral protection expenses and other reimbursement and indemnity obligations that the Subordinating Creditor [Rivera] has loaned to the Borrower [Coachman] or any of its affiliates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second details \"Subordination,\" and reads in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. <i>Subordination.</i> The Senior Debt [DCV's $2 million bridge loan] and the Note and any and all other documents and instruments evidencing or creating the Senior Debt and all guaranties, mortgages, security agreements, pledges and other collateral guarantying or securing the Senior Debt or any part thereof shall be senior to the Subordinated Debt irrespective of the time of the execution, delivery or issuance of any thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both DCC and Rivera agree (ignoring Rivera's alternate argument for the moment) that these provisions are unambiguous, but in opposite ways. Displaying its conjugative prowess, DCC argues that \"shall mean\" indicates \"the future progressive tense and, as the main verb phrase in this definitional section, use of the those words require that the entire definition is to be read at the time the [Subordination Agreement] is being enforced, not the time at which it was executed.\" Not to be syntactically outplayed, Rivera responds that \"has loaned\" can only refer to loans outstanding as of the date of the Subordination Agreement, and cannot possibly encompass loans made after that date. The grammatical acrobatics continue with competing interpretations of the \"Subordination\" clause, specifically with respect to the following language: \"irrespective of the time of the execution, delivery or issuance of any thereof.\" DCC posits that this language modifies \"Subordinated Debt,\" which is the closest noun; Rivera argues that it modifies \"Senior Debt,\" which is the direct object of \"shall be senior.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DCC also invokes two provisions in the Note to support its interpretation of the Subordination Agreement. The first is the Note's definition of the Subordination Agreement, which is attached to the Note as an annex, provided in &#182; 1.(xiv):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Subordination and Standby Agreement\" shall mean the agreement <i>(Annex D)</i> by Mr. Luis Rivera to subordinate and defer repayment of the principal of any loan by him to the Company [Coachman], Olympic Mills Corp., Olympic Group, Inc. or the new entity pursuant to the Hampshire Agreement until this Note is converted and repaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second, a condition precedent to DCV's loan under the Note, is provided in &#182; 5.1:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Subordination and Standby Agreement.</i> Mr Luis Rivera Siaca shall execute an irrevokable Subordination and Standby Agreement, in the form attached here to as <i>Annex D,</i> whereby his loans to the Company [Coachman] or its affiliates are subordinated to this Note and he agrees to defer payment of principal on such loans until this Note is either converted into Series E preferred Stock or is repaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using this language, and corresponding language in the Subordination Agreement that it claims expressly incorporates the Note by reference (<i>i.e.,</i> the recital that identifies the execution of the Subordination Agreement as a \"condition precedent to the Lender's [DCV] willingness to make a loan to the Borrower [Coachman] pursuant to the Note\"), DCC argues that the \"Subordinated Debt\" unambiguously applies to all of Rivera's loans to Coachman and its affiliates. Rivera concedes that the Subordination Agreement \"refers to and describes the Note,\" but denies that it incorporates the Note by reference. Also, Rivera argues that the Note is \"outside the four corners\" of the Subordination Agreement, and, for the purposes of deciding their contract dispute, constitutes extrinsic evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the decisions of the district court.

We think it fair to predict that, were the Delaware Supreme Court presented with this question, it would read the disputed language of the Subordination Agreement in light of the pertinent provisions of the Note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Both contracts were signed on the same day (February 24, 2000) between substantially the same parties (Rivera signed the Note as Coachman's chairman) as facets of the same transaction (the infusion of capital into the Coachman enterprise) for a unitary purpose (to fund the acquisition of sweaters). As further evidence of symbiosis, the execution of the Subordination Agreement was listed as a condition precedent to the Note, and the document was physically attached to the Note as an annex. Also, neither document contains a merger clause or any indication of the parties' intent to read each contract in isolation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the Subordination Agreement quickly comes into focus when viewed through the lens of the Note. The most obvious blow to Rivera's interpretation of the Subordination Agreement is the Note's use of \"any loan\" in &#182; 1.(xiv), without any accompanying prospective limitation. In fact, subsequent language in &#182; 1.(xiv) shows that such a limitation could not have been intended. In pertinent part, &#182; 1.(xiv) explains that the Subordination Agreement would require Rivera \"to subordinate and defer repayment of the principal of <i>any loan,</i> by him to the Company [Coachman], Olympic Mills Corp., Olympic Group, Inc. <i>or the new entity,</i> pursuant to the Hampshire Agreement until this Note is converted and repaid.\" (Emphasis supplied.) However, prior to February 24, 2000, Rivera had extended loans to Coachman and Olympic Mills only; he did not extend any loans to the \"new entity\" (a/k/a/ Glamourette) until afterwards. (It is unclear even whether Glamourette existed on the date of the signing.) Further, &#182; 5.1 provides that DCV's loan would issue only if Rivera would agree that \"his loans to the Company [Coachman] <i>or its affiliates</i> [not simply \"and its affiliate Olympic Mills\"] are subordinated to this Note.\" (Emphasis supplied.)

Specifically, Rivera argues that president of DCC and then Coachman director Wayne Foren \"expressly consented to or knowingly acquiesced in\" the repayment of Rivera's loans.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> To support his argument, Rivera touts (1) an April 14, 2000 letter in which Foren <i>proposed</i> that Rivera provide a $3 million short-term credit line that would be exempt from the Subordination Agreement, and (2) the December 12, 2000 board minutes that do not indicate whether Foren objected to the <i>prospect</i> that Coachman would use proceeds from the Puerto Rico Industrial Incentive Fund to repay Rivera's $4 million loan that pre-dated the Subordination Agreement. Ignoring the fact that Rivera did not present the April 14 letter to the district court in his opposition to DCC's summary judgment motion, the dispositive flaw in this evidence is that it fails to show how Rivera was induced to rely &#8212; let alone detrimentally &#8212; on Foren's conduct. <i>See VonFeldt v.

First, as presented to the district court (and later reiterated to the bankruptcy court), the argument was fatally undeveloped, comprising only four sentences, a citation to a district court opinion, and no analysis whatsoever. <i>See McCoy v.

The present case is clearly distinguishable because, at the commencement of the case, there was no independent basis of original federal jurisdiction that DCC could have invoked to bring suit against Coachman or Olympic Mills (nondiverse parties) on its state-law contract claims under the Subordination Agreement while, at the same time, bringing suit against Rivera (a diverse party) in diversity.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Coachman and Olympic Mills appear to have entered the contract dispute (later adversary proceeding No. 03-0090) as defendant intervenors, although their alignment is not entirely clear from the record.

The adversary complaint filed on behalf of Coachman and Olympic Mills in adversary proceeding No. 03-0042 identifies Coachman and Olympic Mills as Delaware corporations with their principal place of business in Puerto Rico. Consequently, even if an analysis of the parties' actual interests more accurately pitted Coachman and Olympic Mills against Rivera, and we were to realign the parties accordingly, citizens of Puerto Rico would then stare at each other from across the \"v.\" <i>See</i> &#167; 1332(c)(1).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> From this perspective, the proper alignment of Coachman and Olympic Mills becomes more than an academic exercise, see<i>supra</i> note 8, because the intervention of a nondiverse party as a <i>plaintiff</i> raises a suspicious judicial eyebrow under &#167; 1332. <i>See, e.g., Aurora,</i> 442 F.3d at 1025-26; <i>Viacom Int'l, Inc. v.

Although this is a close call (perhaps because it is difficult to quantify and compare the parties' competing and complex interests), the record does not support realigning Coachman and Olympic Mills as plaintiff intervenors. Coachman and Olympic Mills intervened to forestall DCC from collecting on a favorable judgment it had received just ten days earlier, and then sued DCC (plus Rivera and others) when the district court did not immediately refer the case to the bankruptcy court. Certainly the intervenors had interests adverse to Rivera's, but, on balance and in light of the circumstances surrounding the intervention, DCC was the more antipodean player as competitor for Rivera's ill-gotten gains.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In its supplemental brief, DCC suggests that, were we to hold that intervention had defeated the district court's jurisdiction (which we do not), we should exercise our power under Fed.R.Civ.P. 21 and, to preserve diversity, dismiss the case as to Coachman and Olympic Mills<i>See Newman-Green, Inc. v.
