GALLANT,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n          Jane Elizabeth Lee for appellant.\n\n          Karen L. Goodwin, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        October 15, 2002\n\f             LYNCH, Circuit Judge.         The principal issue in this case\n\nis whether the plaintiff forfeited his objection to an error that\n\nmight but need not have resulted in a shorter sentence.                       On appeal,\n\nthe   defendant,    Norman     Gallant,        objects   to      the    denial    of   an\n\nadditional     one-level      downward     adjustment           for    acceptance      of\n\nresponsibility under § 3E1.1(b) of the United States Sentencing\n\nGuidelines, after the district court had granted a two-level\n\ndownward adjustment. The government concedes that the court erred,\n\nbut nonetheless argues that there should be no relief because the\n\nissue was not preserved.            Forfeited sentencing objections are\n\nreviewed   for   plain     error    and    there    is     no    plain     error,      the\n\ngovernment argues, because Gallant's 24-month sentence falls within\n\nthe guidelines sentencing range that would have applied had the\n\ndistrict court given Gallant the additional one-level adjustment.\n\n             Though the government's reasoning is not implausible, we\n\nfind that Gallant did not forfeit his objection.                        The defendant\n\nconsistently     argued      that   he    was    entitled        to    a   three-level\n\nreduction, the government warned the district court against its\n\neventual     ruling,   the    ruling      was    contrary        to    both     parties'\n\npositions,    and   the    sentencing      judge     did      not      invite    further\n\narguments.\n\n             Gallant also challenges the imposition of an order that,\n\nas a special condition of supervised release, he transfer to the\n\ngovernment all property necessary to make restitution.                           Gallant\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fargues that there was no criminal forfeiture provision in the\n\ninformation or indictment, and that the court's order is best\n\ncharacterized as requiring forfeiture.    This argument fails.         The\n\norder does not amount to an order of forfeiture.       Rather, it was a\n\nreasonable use of the court's authority to effectuate restitution.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          Norman Gallant bilked the U.S. government out of roughly\n\n$300,000 over a decade.   He waived indictment on May 21, 2001, and\n\nwas charged by information.   He timely pled guilty on two counts of\n\nmail fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (2000), one count of fraudulent\n\nreceipt of Social Security benefits, 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(4) (2000),\n\nand one count of tax evasion, 26 U.S.C. § 7201 (2000).          Between\n\nAugust 1992 and October 2000, Gallant fraudulently obtained $29,130\n\nin Section 8 rental subsidies from the Department of Housing and\n\nUrban Development.    Between   January   1995   and   April   2001,    he\n\nfraudulently secured $102,021 in Medicaid funds for a personal care\n\nattendant.   Between July 1992 and February 2001, he fraudulently\n\nobtained $162,000 in Social Security disability benefits.              The\n\ninformation had charged Gallant with cheating on his 1999 income\n\ntaxes by a sum in excess of $11,000; Gallant pled guilty to\n\ncommitting tax fraud totaling between $23,500 and $40,000 over tax\n\nyears 1995 to 1999.   As part of the plea, the parties agreed that\n\nthe total loss to the government was between $200,000 and $350,000.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f             In the plea agreement the government agreed to recommend\n\na three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 (2002),1 provided defendant met five conditions,\n\nthree of which are pertinent here.      Conditions (3), (4), and (5)\n\nstated that Gallant:\n\n             (3) acknowledges that he is the sole effective owner and\n             has sole effective control of the assets owned by the\n             Macantosh Realty Trust, the Serenity Equity Trust and the\n             Serenity Equity Trust II, and that all such assets are\n             available for restitution; (4) takes all necessary steps\n             to make such assets available for restitution as the\n             Court may order; and (5) makes an initial payment of\n             $15,000 in restitution to the clerk of the court prior to\n             sentencing.\n\n             The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) originally recommended that\n\nGallant receive a three-level reduction if he complied with the\n\ngovernment's conditions.      The government responded to the PSR,\n\n\n     1\n         U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 provides:\n             (a) If the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of\n                  responsibility for his offense, decrease the\n                  offense level by 2 levels.\n             (b) If the defendant qualifies for a decrease under\n                  subsection (a), the offense level determined prior\n                  to the operation of subsection (a) is level 16 or\n                  greater, and the defendant has assisted authorities\n                  in the investigation or prosecution of his own\n                  misconduct by taking one or more of the following\n                  steps:\n                  (1) timely providing complete information to the\n                       government concerning his own involvement in\n                       the offense; or\n                  (2) timely notifying authorities of his intention\n                       to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting\n                       the government to avoid preparing for trial\n                       and permitting the court to allocate its\n                       resources efficiently,\n                  decrease the offense level by 1 additional level.\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fobjecting that no three-level reduction should be granted for\n\nacceptance of responsibility because Gallant had not yet satisfied\n\nthe terms of the agreement.         Gallant had no objection, of course,\n\nto the recommended three-level reduction.\n\n            After   reviewing       the     government's    objections,    the\n\nprobation officer prepared an Addendum to the PSR revising his\n\nrecommendations as follows:\n\n            (25)   The defendant admitted his involvement in the\n            instant offense and is being granted acceptance of\n            responsibility.  The offense level is reduced two (2)\n            levels per U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a) as he has clearly\n            demonstrated acceptance of responsibility for his\n            offense.\n\n            (25a)   Per U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), if the defendant has\n            assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution\n            of his own misconduct by taking one or more of the\n            following steps:      (1) Timely providing complete\n            information to the government concerning his own\n            involvement in the offense; or (2) Timely notifying\n            authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty,\n            thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for\n            trial and permitting the Court to allocate its resources\n            efficiently, decrease the offense level by 1 additional\n            level. As of this date, the defendant has not satisfied\n            this criteria.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n            Although the PSR correctly stated that there are two\n\nalternate   conditions   for    a    further    one-level   reduction     under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), it also said that \"this criteria\" had not been\n\nmet.   The PSR was incorrect -- there has never been any question\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthat Gallant had met the second condition it described,2 and the\n\ngovernment never argued that defendant had not \"timely notified the\n\nauthorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.\"            The PSR\n\nAddendum did not alert the court to the relationship between the\n\ngranting of a two-level reduction and the granting of the third\n\nlevel.\n\n          Gallant's    subsequent      Sentencing   Memorandum      to    the\n\ndistrict court    argued   that   he   was   entitled   to   a   three-level\n\nreduction.3    The government's position was that Gallant was not\n\nentitled to any reduction for acceptance of responsibility.              If he\n\nwas not entitled to a two-level reduction because he had not\n\nassisted the authorities, then he was ineligible for a third-level\n\nreduction.    No party focused on the possibility that the court\n\nwould deny a third-level reduction if the Court granted a two-level\n\nreduction.    It simply was not an issue.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      It is possible the PSR was worded clumsily and meant only to\nsay the first criterion was not met.\n     3\n      In his sentencing memorandum, Gallant argued he had made\n\"timely admission of the relevant conduct underlying his\nconviction.\" This is not quite the same as saying he had timely\nnotified the prosecutor of his intent to plead guilty under\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b)(2). Cf. United States v. Hines, 196 F.3d 270,\n273 (1st Cir. 1999) (absent unusual circumstances or an agreement\nstating otherwise, defendant who communicates intent to plead\nguilty does not normally qualify for one-level reduction under\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b)(2) unless he intends to plead unconditionally\nto all counts of the indictment). But there was no real dispute on\nthe point. In this sense Gallant replied to the PSR Addendum.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f           That was the posture in which the parties entered the\n\nsentencing hearing, and which they articulated at the hearing. The\n\ngovernment continued to press its position that Gallant should\n\nreceive no reduction for acceptance of responsibility.        Its basis\n\nwas that Gallant had not assisted the government: he had not\n\ndisclosed all trust assets (he claimed a boat allegedly owned by\n\none of the trusts had been sold to another party) and he had been\n\nunwilling to sell immediately the condominiums not occupied by\n\nhimself   or    his   sons   to   meet   his   restitution   obligation.\n\nNonetheless, the government raised the issue of a third-level\n\nreduction.     The government's position at sentencing was that the\n\ndefendant \"may well have satisfied the timeliness and the timely\n\nplea, which you need for the third point, but he hasn't satisfied\n\nwhat he needs to do for the first two points.\"        Gallant responded\n\nthat he had satisfied the conditions necessary for the first two\n\npoints.   He added that he was willing to make restitution, but did\n\nnot think his assets should all be liquidated immediately.\n\n             The court stated that Gallant's assets were ill-gotten\n\nand should be liquidated immediately, so that restitution could be\n\nmade promptly, rather than being drawn out through the probation\n\nperiod.   Concerned by Gallant's temporizing about restitution, the\n\ncourt said:\n\n             I'm puzzled . . . about whether it's appropriate for me\n             to give somebody the benefit of acceptance of\n             responsibility when there isn't an acknowledgment that\n             there is any immediate obligation to return or pay back\n\n                                   -7-\n\f          or reimburse monies which were wrongfully obtained and\n          that's the struggle that I'm having.\n\n          At the end of the hearing the court then solved its\n\npuzzling dilemma with a compromise:     the court granted two levels\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility but denied a third. The court\n\nexplained:\n\n          As far as the three-level reduction goes, I think it is\n          somewhat artificial but I think that a two point, not a\n          three point, reduction is appropriate. I think the level\n          16 offense level is where this case should be.\n                 I recognize in doing that I'm acknowledging the\n          somewhat unusual facts of this case, but I do not think\n          that the defendant has made the sort of recognition of\n          fault and the intent to correct that fault which is\n          within his power that would justify the full three-level\n          reduction.\n                 I have considered and frankly come close to the\n          decision of not allowing any reduction whatsoever for\n          acceptance of responsibility. But I have in mind that\n          the defendant did offer his pleas of guilty, did save the\n          government the necessity of going to trial with this case\n          and is entitled to some benefit for having done that,\n          even though what I would call the moral aspect of\n          acceptance of responsibility seems to me to be lacking to\n          some degree here.\n\nThen the court promptly moved on to the next sentencing issue\n\nwithout entertaining any objections to its ruling.     Neither party\n\ninterrupted the court to ask it to revisit its denial of the third\n\npoint on the grounds that, by its decision to give Gallant two\n\npoints, the court had inherently determined that Gallant must\n\nreceive three points.    It is this \"if two levels, then necessarily\n\nthree levels\" rationale which Gallant argues on appeal.\n\n             The court also ordered Gallant to pay a $50,000 fine and\n\nto make restitution in the amounts of $29,130 to HUD, $102,021 to\n\n                                  -8-\n\fMedicaid, and $162,000 to the Social Security Administration.             The\n\ncourt ordered the restitution payable \"immediately or according to\n\na court-ordered repayment schedule.\"             Along with the standard\n\nconditions of supervised release, the court ordered, as a special\n\ncondition,    that   the   condominium   units    be   surrendered   to   the\n\ngovernment and sold for cash during the period of supervised\n\nrelease.     The court ordered Gallant to pay the balance of the\n\nrestitution according to a court-ordered repayment schedule, and\n\nstated:\n\n             [T]he defendant will execute all necessary papers\n             permitting the timely sale of properties that are owned\n             by him either directly or through others to permit\n             restitution.\n\n             The execution of these papers will include execution of\n             any papers necessary to transfer the sailboat referred to\n             in the pre-sentence report to the government for sale as\n             part of the restitution.\n\n             The defendant takes the position that the sailboat no\n             longer belongs to him, but to the extent it's necessary\n             for him to execute any documents to assist the government\n             in obtaining that sailboat if it is available, he will do\n             so.\n\n             The court also found that the properties held in the\n\nthree trusts (the Macantosh Realty Trust, the Serenity Equity\n\nTrust, and the Serenity Equity Trust II) all belonged to the\n\ndefendant, so the government was free to place liens on the\n\nproperties.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f                                 II.\n\nAcceptance of Responsibility Reductions\n\n          A district court lacks discretion to deny the additional\n\none-level reduction if the defendant is found to have accepted\n\nresponsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a) and has complied with the\n\nconditions specified in U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b)(2).    United States v.\n\nMarroquin, 136 F.3d 220, 223 (1st Cir. 1998). The government\n\nconcedes it was error not to give a three-level reduction, because\n\nthe court found Gallant was entitled to a two-level reduction and\n\nhe had satisfied the criteria for the third level. The government,\n\nhowever, argues that Gallant has forfeited the issue by failing to\n\nraise it in the trial court.   As a result, the government contends,\n\nthis court should apply a plain error test, and Gallant does not\n\nmeet the test.4\n\n          The defendant argues he did not forfeit the issue.     In\n\nthe alternative, he says, his substantial rights were affected\n\n\n\n     4\n      In United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993), and Johnson\nv. United States, 520 U.S. 461 (1997), the Supreme Court set forth\na now-familiar four-step analysis to determine whether a mistake\nconstitutes plain error under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b). \"[T]here\nmust be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects\nsubstantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate\ncourt may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,\nbut only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness,\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Johnson,\n520 U.S. at 467 (internal quotations omitted); see Olano, 507 U.S.\nat 732. See generally United States v. Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000) (contrasting the harmless error test, which\nprevails when an issue has been preserved for appeal, with the\nplain error test, which applies when an issue has been forfeited).\n\n                                -10-\n\fbecause he was given a total offense level of 16, with a GSR of 21\n\nto 27 months imprisonment.       The 24-month sentence he received was\n\nwithin the GSR of 18 to 24 months that would have applied if the\n\ncourt had granted the additional one-level reduction.             We do not\n\nconsider this alternative \"plain error\" argument because Gallant\n\ndid not forfeit his objection.\n\n          The issue of when a forfeiture of an objection occurs\n\ncomes up in many different contexts.        The issue is bounded on both\n\nends by clear and firm rules in particular settings.                    If a\n\ndefendant, for example, fails to timely object to a question put to\n\na witness, then he has forfeited his evidentiary objection.             If he\n\nobjects and states the nature of his evidentiary objection, he has\n\npreserved it.      Between these clear poles, the matter of what\n\nconstitutes forfeiture is more one of degree and judgment by the\n\nappellate court.\n\n          The nature of the issue on review influences the outcome\n\nof the forfeiture analysis.       For example, this circuit is notably\n\nrigorous in requiring a party unhappy with a trial court's jury\n\ninstruction to promptly state the precise objection after the\n\ninstruction has been given. See Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 54\n\nF.3d 931, 944 (1st Cir. 1995) (a party must not only identify the\n\nerror in the jury instruction but also explain how the judge can\n\ncorrect it); Cyr v. B. Offen & Co., 501 F.2d 1145, 1155 (1st Cir.\n\n1974) (quoting     Palmer   v.   Hoffman,   318   U.S.   109,   119   (1943))\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f(objection to the jury instruction \"must be sufficiently specific\n\nto bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error\").              The\n\nrequirement for a post-instruction objection is set forth in the\n\nfederal rules, Fed. R. Crim. P. 30, and counsel are on clear notice\n\nof   the   requirement.     Counsel    must    make   the    post-instruction\n\nobjection even if she has objected earlier.              This rule gives the\n\ntrial court an opportunity to rectify any error in the instruction\n\nbefore the jury begins to deliberate. See Golden v. United States,\n\n318 F.2d 357, 360 (1st Cir. 1963).\n\n            There is no such equivalent requirement for counsel to\n\nmake an objection after an evidentiary ruling when an earlier\n\ntimely objection was made.        Nor is there a requirement that an\n\nobjection be made before the grounds for the objection reasonably\n\nshould have been known to the objector:               the defense is \"not\n\nrequired to anticipate the government's line of questioning in\n\norder for an objection to be timely.\"           U.S. v. Meserve, 271 F.3d\n\n314, 323 (1st Cir. 2001).       Indeed, under Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(1) a\n\nparty may oppose the admission of testimony through either a timely\n\nobjection or a motion to strike.        The operative principle is that\n\nthe objection need not be made before the grounds are reasonably\n\nknown.\n\n            Our   case    concerns    neither     jury      instructions    nor\n\nevidentiary    issues.     It   concerns      sentencing    and   whether   the\n\ncontinued insistence of Gallant's counsel that Gallant was entitled\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fto a three-level reduction was sufficient, although Gallant's\n\ncounsel did not present the precise argument made here. Context is\n\nimportant. This is not a situation in which the government took the\n\nposition contrary to defendant on the precise argument and the\n\ndefendant failed to protest.   To the contrary, the government said\n\nthat if Gallant was entitled to the two-level reduction, most\n\nlikely he was entitled to a third level.   Gallant obviously would\n\nnot object to this part of the government's position.    Nothing in\n\nthe government's position at any time put defendant on notice that\n\nhe might receive two levels but not three.   Although the Addendum\n\nto the PSR may be thought to have provided some notice, neither\n\nparty adopted its legal conclusions and both argued implicitly\n\nagainst them.5   Further, Gallant consistently had said he was\n\nentitled to a three-level reduction. Gallant had no real reason to\n\nthink this was at issue until after the court ruled.    We generally\n\ndo not require objections to be made to hypothetical outcomes which\n\nneither party anticipated.\n\n          To support its forfeiture argument, the government relies\n\nheavily on United States v. Keppler, 2 F.3d 21 (2nd Cir. 1993).\n\n\n     5\n     The district judge may rely on factual assertions in a\nPSR that are not rebutted by the defendant, United States v.\nTorres-Otero, 232 F.3d 24, 32-33 (1st Cir. 2000), but we would\nbe reluctant to permit such reliance on legal conclusions,\nparticularly ones that neither party endorses. Fed. R. Crim.\nP. 32(b)(6)(D) provides only that the district court may,\nabsent objection, adopt the findings of fact in the PSR, as\ndid occur here.\n\n                                -13-\n\fThat case is easily distinguished.          Far from conveying that the\n\nsentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility was an all-\n\nor-nothing     proposition,    the   government   there   argued    at   the\n\nsentencing hearing that the court should deny \"all or part\" of the\n\nthree-level reduction.        Id. at 22-23 (emphasis added).       Moreover,\n\nwhen the court granted a two- but not a three-level reduction, the\n\ncourt specifically asked for objections and defense counsel had\n\nnone.6    Id. at 23.\n\n             The government also points to our case law saying that a\n\ndefendant cannot present one legal argument at the trial court and\n\nanother on appeal.       See United States v. Lilly, 13 F.3d 15, 17-18\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).       That is quite so, but even that doctrine has its\n\nlimits.     The doctrine has not been applied where the defendant\n\ncould not reasonably have anticipated the issue would arise until\n\nafter the court had ruled in a way contrary to both parties'\n\npositions.\n\n             The government's argument that Gallant forfeited the\n\nissue then depends on the premise that a criminal defendant must\n\nstate objections to the imposition of a particular sentence after\n\nthe sentence has been announced by the court -- even when the\n\nruling has not been advocated by any of the parties and the court\n\ndoes not invite further arguments. Here, both parties had together\n\n\n     6\n      It is also unclear whether defendant in that case requested\na three-point reduction prior to or during the sentencing hearing.\nSee Keppler, 2 F.3d at 22-23.\n\n                                     -14-\n\fargued a position before sentencing which would, if followed, have\n\nobviated the error.\n\n            The government's argument that a post-sentence objection\n\nis required is not implausible.      If defense counsel had been quick\n\nenough after the ruling to object, even absent any invitation from\n\nthe court, this problem might have been avoided.7        Considerations\n\nof judicial economy may be thought to support a requirement of\n\nobjection after a sentence is given, even to unanticipated issues.\n\nBut judicial economy works two ways.        There is also a need for\n\nfinality and few trial judges would warm to a rule which requires\n\ncontinued argument after the court gives its sentence.           Further,\n\nunlike other areas, there is no Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n\ngiving advance notice to counsel of a requirement to make post-\n\nsentence objections.    Indeed, Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3) provides\n\nthat the court entertain argument from both defendant's counsel and\n\nthe government \"before imposing sentence.\"            There is also the\n\ninterest,   expressed   in   other   contexts,   of   avoiding   judicial\n\nproceedings conducted through surprise, sometimes called \"trial by\n\nambush.\"    Lawyers should have fair notice and an opportunity to\n\nprepare.8    On balance, given the facts here, we think it simply\n\n\n     7\n      Counsel could also have sought a correction of the sentence\nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c).\n     8\n      Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129 (1991), and its First\nCircuit progeny affirm the crucial importance of providing notice\nof otherwise unexpected sentencing rulings.        Burns states,\n\"Congress did not intend district courts to depart from the\n\n                                 -15-\n\fwould be unfair and unwise as a matter of policy to hold that\n\nGallant forfeited the argument. Accordingly, we will remand to the\n\ndistrict court for resentencing in light of the error.\n\n            To its credit, the government has simplified matters by\n\nagreeing that there would be no claim by it on remand that the\n\ndefendant    is   not   entitled   to   any   credit   or   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility.     See generally United States v. Ticchiarelli, 171\n\nF.3d 24, 29-30 (1st Cir. 1999).           The district court is free on\n\nremand to determine where within the applicable GSR the defendant\n\nshould be resentenced.      It is not a foregone conclusion that on\n\nremand the appropriate sentence will be 21 months rather than 24\n\nmonths.\n\nRestitution\n\n            Gallant also challenges the order requiring, as a special\n\ncondition of supervised release, that he sell such of his assets as\n\nnecessary to permit restitution.          Gallant argues that this was\n\neffectively an asset forfeiture and that the government complied\n\nwith none of the procedures for obtaining a forfeiture order.            See\n\n\n[Sentencing] Guidelines sua sponte without first affording notice\nto the parties.\" Id. at 136. United States v. Walker, 234 F.3d\n780 (1st Cir. 2000), reconciles Burns and a case distinguishing\nBurns, United States v. Canada, 960 F.2d 263 (1st Cir. 1992), by\nobserving that \"[b]oth are premised on defendant's having adequate\nnotice of the facts and the law.\"       Walker, 234 F.3d at 786.\nIndeed, First Circuit cases limiting Burns consistently involve\nfact patterns where the defendant had constructive notice. See\nUnited States v. Sharpton, 252 F.3d 536, 543 & n.8 (1st Cir. 2001);\nUnited States v. Brown, 235 F.3d 2, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2000); Canada,\n960 F.2d at 266-67 & n.4.\n\n                                   -16-\n\fFed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(2), 32.2(a); see also United States v. Loe,\n\n248 F.3d 449, 464 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\n              This argument mischaracterizes the order.              The order\n\nmerely effectuates the court's power to order restitution under 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 3663-3664 and U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(a)(6).                It is true that\n\nGallant's assets are to be surrendered to the government and sold\n\nfor cash.     The government here wears two hats.        Several agencies of\n\nthe government were defrauded by Gallant and are entitled to\n\nrestitution.      Another branch of government, the prosecution, has\n\nbeen    authorized    to   sell   the   assets   in    order    to   make   that\n\nrestitution.     This is not a case of asset forfeiture at all and the\n\norder   was    well   within   the   district    court's    discretion      over\n\nconditions of supervised release. See United States v. Phaneuf, 91\n\nF.3d 255, 262-63 (1st Cir. 1996).            We bypass the government's\n\ncontention that this argument was not preserved either, and affirm\n\nthe restitution order on the merits.\n\n              For the reasons stated above, we remand for resentencing\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.             So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f",

Goodwin, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Michael J. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA and LYNCH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal issue in this case is whether the plaintiff forfeited his objection to an error that might but need not have resulted in a shorter sentence. On appeal, the defendant, Norman Gallant, objects to the denial of an additional one-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under &#167; 3E1.1(b) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, after the district court had granted a two-level downward adjustment. The government concedes that the court erred, but nonetheless argues that there should be no relief because the issue was not preserved. Forfeited sentencing objections are reviewed for plain error and there is no plain error, the government argues, because Gallant's 24-month sentence falls within the guidelines sentencing range that would have applied had the district court given Gallant the additional one-level adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the government's reasoning is not implausible, we find that Gallant did not forfeit his objection. The defendant consistently argued that he was entitled to a three-level reduction, the government warned the district court against its eventual ruling, the ruling was contrary to both parties' positions, and the sentencing judge did not invite further arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallant also challenges the imposition of an order that, as a special condition of supervised release, he transfer to the government all property necessary to make restitution. Gallant argues that there was no criminal forfeiture provision in the information or indictment, and that the court's order is best characterized as requiring forfeiture. This argument fails. The order does not amount to an order of forfeiture. Rather, it was a reasonable use of the court's authority to effectuate restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Norman Gallant bilked the U.S. government out of roughly $300,000 over a decade. He waived indictment on May 21, 2001, and was charged by information. He timely pled guilty on two counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (2000), one count of fraudulent receipt of Social Security benefits, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 408(a)(4) (2000), and one count of tax evasion, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7201 (2000). Between August 1992 and October 2000, Gallant fraudulently obtained $29,130 in Section 8 rental subsidies from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Between January 1995 and April 2001, he fraudulently secured $102,021 in Medicaid funds for a personal care attendant. Between July 1992 and February 2001, he fraudulently obtained $162,000 in Social Security disability benefits. The information had charged Gallant with cheating on his 1999 income taxes by a sum in excess of $11,000; Gallant pled guilty to committing tax fraud totaling between $23,500 and $40,000 over tax years 1995 to 1999. As part of the plea, the parties agreed that the total loss to the government was between $200,000 and $350,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the plea agreement the government agreed to recommend a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 (2002),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> provided defendant met five conditions, three of which are pertinent here. Conditions (3), (4), and (5) stated that Gallant:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) acknowledges that he is the sole effective owner and has sole effective control of the assets owned by the Macantosh Realty Trust, the Serenity Equity Trust and the Serenity Equity Trust II, and that all such assets are available for restitution; (4) takes all necessary steps to make such assets available for restitution as the Court may order; and (5) makes an initial payment of $15,000 in restitution to the clerk of the court prior to sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) originally recommended that Gallant receive a three-level reduction if he complied with the government's conditions. The government responded to the PSR, objecting that no three-level reduction should be granted for acceptance of responsibility because Gallant had not yet satisfied the terms of the agreement. Gallant had no objection, of course, to the recommended three-level reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the government's objections, the probation officer prepared an Addendum to the PSR revising his recommendations as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(25) The defendant admitted his involvement in the instant offense and is being granted acceptance of responsibility. The offense level is reduced two (2) levels per U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a) as he has clearly demonstrated acceptance of responsibility for his offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(25a) Per U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b), if the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by taking one or more of the following steps: (1) Timely providing complete information to the government concerning his own involvement in the offense; or (2) Timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the Court to allocate its resources efficiently, decrease the offense level by 1 additional level. <i>As of this date, the defendant has not satisfied this criteria.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the PSR correctly stated that there are two alternate conditions for a further one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b), it also said that \"this criteria\" had not been met. The PSR was incorrect &#8212; there has never been any question that Gallant had met the second condition it described,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the government never argued that defendant had not \"timely notified the authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.\" The PSR Addendum did not alert the court to the relationship between the granting of a two-level reduction and the granting of the third level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallant's subsequent Sentencing Memorandum to the district court argued that he was entitled to a three-level reduction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The government's position was that Gallant was not entitled to any reduction for acceptance of responsibility. If he was not entitled to a two-level reduction because he had not assisted the authorities, then he was ineligible for a third-level reduction. No party focused on the possibility that the court would deny a third-level reduction if the Court granted a two-level reduction. It simply was not an issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That was the posture in which the parties entered the sentencing hearing, and which they articulated at the hearing. The government continued to press its position that Gallant should receive no reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Its basis was that Gallant had not assisted the government: he had not disclosed all trust assets (he claimed a boat allegedly owned by one of the trusts had been sold to another party) and he had been unwilling to sell immediately the condominiums not occupied by himself or his sons to meet his restitution obligation. Nonetheless, the government raised the issue of a third-level reduction. The government's position at sentencing was that the defendant \"may well have satisfied the timeliness and the timely plea, which you need for the third point, but he hasn't satisfied what he needs to do for the first two points.\" Gallant responded that he had satisfied the conditions necessary for the first two points. He added that he was willing to make restitution, but did not think his assets should all be liquidated immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court stated that Gallant's assets were ill-gotten and should be liquidated immediately, so that restitution could be made promptly, rather than being drawn out through the probation period. Concerned by Gallant's temporizing about restitution, the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm puzzled ... about whether it's appropriate for me to give somebody the benefit of acceptance of responsibility when there isn't an acknowledgment that there is any immediate obligation to return or pay back or reimburse monies which were wrongfully obtained and that's the struggle that I'm having.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the hearing the court then solved its puzzling dilemma with a compromise: the court granted two levels for acceptance of responsibility but denied a third. The court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As far as the three-level reduction goes, I think it is somewhat artificial but I think that a two point, not a three point, reduction is appropriate. I think the level 16 offense level is where this case should be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I recognize in doing that I'm acknowledging the somewhat unusual facts of this case, but I do not think that the defendant has made the sort of recognition of fault and the intent to correct that fault which is within his power that would justify the full three-level reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have considered and frankly come close to the decision of not allowing any reduction whatsoever for acceptance of responsibility. But I have in mind that the defendant did offer his pleas of guilty, did save the government the necessity of going to trial with this case and is entitled to some benefit for having done that, even though what I would call the moral aspect of acceptance of responsibility seems to me to be lacking to some degree here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then the court promptly moved on to the next sentencing issue without entertaining any objections to its ruling. Neither party interrupted the court to ask it to revisit its denial of the third point on the grounds that, by its decision to give Gallant two points, the court had inherently determined that Gallant must receive three points. It is this \"if two levels, then necessarily three levels\" rationale which Gallant argues on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also ordered Gallant to pay a $50,000 fine and to make restitution in the amounts of $29,130 to HUD, $102,021 to Medicaid, and $162,000 to the Social Security Administration. The court ordered the restitution payable \"immediately or according to a court-ordered repayment schedule.\" Along with the standard conditions of supervised release, the court ordered, as a special condition, that the condominium units be surrendered to the government and sold for cash during the period of supervised release. The court ordered Gallant to pay the balance of the restitution according to a court-ordered repayment schedule, and stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he defendant will execute all necessary papers permitting the timely sale of properties that are owned by him either directly or through others to permit restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The execution of these papers will include execution of any papers necessary to transfer the sailboat referred to in the pre-sentence report to the government for sale as part of the restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant takes the position that the sailboat no longer belongs to him, but to the extent it's necessary for him to execute any documents to assist the government in obtaining that sailboat if it is available, he will do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also found that the properties held in the three trusts (the Macantosh Realty Trust, the Serenity Equity Trust, and the Serenity Equity Trust II) all belonged to the defendant, so the government was free to place liens on the properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Acceptance of Responsibility Reductions</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court lacks discretion to deny the additional one-level reduction if the defendant is found to have accepted responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a) and has complied with the conditions specified in U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b)(2). <i>United States v. Marroquin,</i> 136 F.3d 220, 223 (1st Cir.1998). The government concedes it was error not to give a three-level reduction, because the court found Gallant was entitled to a two-level reduction and he had satisfied the criteria for the third level. The government, however, argues that Gallant has forfeited the issue by failing to raise it in the trial court. As a result, the government contends, this court should apply a plain error test, and Gallant does not meet the test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues he did not forfeit the issue. In the alternative, he says, his substantial rights were affected because he was given a total offense level of 16, with a GSR of 21 to 27 months imprisonment. The 24-month sentence he received was within the GSR of 18 to 24 months that would have applied if the court had granted the additional one-level reduction. We do not consider this alternative \"plain error\" argument because Gallant did not forfeit his objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of when a forfeiture of an objection occurs comes up in many different contexts. The issue is bounded on both ends by clear and firm rules in particular settings. If a defendant, for example, fails to timely object to a question put to a witness, then he has forfeited his evidentiary objection. If he objects and states the nature of his evidentiary objection, he has preserved it. Between these clear poles, the matter of what constitutes forfeiture is more one of degree and judgment by the appellate court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of the issue on review influences the outcome of the forfeiture analysis. For example, this circuit is notably rigorous in requiring a party unhappy with a trial court's jury instruction to promptly state the precise objection after the instruction has been given. <i>See Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc.,</i> 54 F.3d 931, 944 (1st Cir.1995) (a party must not only identify the error in the jury instruction but also explain how the judge can correct it); <i>Cyr v. B. Offen &amp; Co.,</i> 501 F.2d 1145, 1155 (1st Cir.1974) (quoting <i>Palmer v. Hoffman,</i> 318 U.S. 109, 119, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943)) (objection to the jury instruction \"must be sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error\"). The requirement for a post-instruction objection is set forth in the federal rules, Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, and counsel are on clear notice of the requirement. Counsel must make the post-instruction objection even if she has objected earlier. This rule gives the trial court an opportunity to rectify any error in the instruction before the jury begins to deliberate. <i>See Golden v. United States,</i> 318 F.2d 357, 360 (1st Cir.1963).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no such equivalent requirement for counsel to make an objection after an evidentiary ruling when an earlier timely objection was made. Nor is there a requirement that an objection be made before the grounds for the objection reasonably should have been known to the objector: the defense is \"not required to anticipate the government's line of questioning in order for an objection to be timely.\" <i>U.S. v. Meserve,</i> 271 F.3d 314, 323 (1st Cir.2001). Indeed, under Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1) a party may oppose the admission of testimony through either a timely objection or a motion to strike. The operative principle is that the objection need not be made before the grounds are reasonably known.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case concerns neither jury instructions nor evidentiary issues. It concerns sentencing and whether the continued insistence of Gallant's counsel that Gallant was entitled to a three-level reduction was sufficient, although Gallant's counsel did not present the precise argument made here. Context is important. This is not a situation in which the government took the position contrary to defendant on the precise argument and the defendant failed to protest. To the contrary, the government said that if Gallant was entitled to the two-level reduction, most likely he was entitled to a third level. Gallant obviously would not object to this part of the government's position. Nothing in the government's position at any time put defendant on notice that he might receive two levels but not three. Although the Addendum to the PSR may be thought to have provided some notice, neither party adopted its legal conclusions and both argued implicitly against them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Further, Gallant consistently had said he was entitled to a three-level reduction. Gallant had no real reason to think this was at issue until after the court ruled. We generally do not require objections to be made to hypothetical outcomes which neither party anticipated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support its forfeiture argument, the government relies heavily on <i>United States v. Keppler,</i> 2 F.3d 21 (2nd Cir.1993). That case is easily distinguished. Far from conveying that the sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility was an all-or-nothing proposition, the government there argued at the sentencing hearing that the court should deny \"all <i>or part</i>\" of the three-level reduction. <i>Id.</i> at 22-23 (emphasis added). Moreover, when the court granted a two- but not a three-level reduction, the court specifically asked for objections and defense counsel had none.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Id.</i> at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also points to our case law saying that a defendant cannot present one legal argument at the trial court and another on appeal. <i>See United States v. Lilly,</i> 13 F.3d 15, 17-18 (1st Cir.1994). That is quite so, but even that doctrine has its limits. The doctrine has not been applied where the defendant could not reasonably have anticipated the issue would arise until after the court had ruled in a way contrary to both parties' positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's argument that Gallant forfeited the issue then depends on the premise that a criminal defendant must state objections to the imposition of a particular sentence after the sentence has been announced by the court &#8212; even when the ruling has not been advocated by any of the parties and the court does not invite further arguments. Here, both parties had together argued a position before sentencing which would, if followed, have obviated the error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's argument that a post-sentence objection is required is not implausible. If defense counsel had been quick enough after the ruling to object, even absent any invitation from the court, this problem might have been avoided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Considerations of judicial economy may be thought to support a requirement of objection after a sentence is given, even to unanticipated issues. But judicial economy works two ways. There is also a need for finality and few trial judges would warm to a rule which requires continued argument after the court gives its sentence. Further, unlike other areas, there is no Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure giving advance notice to counsel of a requirement to make post-sentence objections. Indeed, Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3) provides that the court entertain argument from both defendant's counsel and the government \"before imposing sentence.\" There is also the interest, expressed in other contexts, of avoiding judicial proceedings conducted through surprise, sometimes called \"trial by ambush.\" Lawyers should have fair notice and an opportunity to prepare.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> On balance, given the facts here, we think it simply would be unfair and unwise as a matter of policy to hold that Gallant forfeited the argument. Accordingly, we will remand to the district court for resentencing in light of the error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To its credit, the government has simplified matters by agreeing that there would be no claim by it on remand that the defendant is not entitled to any credit or acceptance of responsibility. <i>See generally United States v. Ticchiarelli,</i> 171 F.3d 24, 29-30 (1st Cir.1999). The district court is free on remand to determine where within the applicable GSR the defendant should be resentenced. It is not a foregone conclusion that on remand the appropriate sentence will be 21 months rather than 24 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Restitution</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallant also challenges the order requiring, as a special condition of supervised release, that he sell such of his assets as necessary to permit restitution. Gallant argues that this was effectively an asset forfeiture and that the government complied with none of the procedures for obtaining a forfeiture order. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(2), 32.2(a); <i>see also United States v. Loe,</i> 248 F.3d 449, 464 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument mischaracterizes the order. The order merely effectuates the court's power to order restitution under 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663-3664 and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(a)(6). It is true that Gallant's assets are to be surrendered to the government and sold for cash. The government here wears two hats. Several agencies of the government were defrauded by Gallant and are entitled to restitution. Another branch of government, the prosecution, has been authorized to sell the assets in order to make that restitution. This is not a case of asset forfeiture at all and the order was well within the district court's discretion over conditions of supervised release. <i>See United States v. Phaneuf,</i> 91 F.3d 255, 262-63 (1st Cir.1996). We bypass the government's contention that this argument was not preserved either, and affirm the restitution order on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we <i>remand</i> for resentencing proceedings consistent with this opinion. <i>So ordered.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 provides:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(a) If the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense, decrease the offense level by 2 levels.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(b) If the defendant qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a), the offense level determined prior to the operation of subsection (a) is level <i>16</i> or greater, and the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by taking one or more of the following steps:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(1) timely providing complete information to the government concerning his own involvement in the offense; or</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(2) timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently, decrease the offense level by <i>1</i> additional level.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It is possible the PSR was worded clumsily and meant only to say the first criterion was not met</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In his sentencing memorandum, Gallant argued he had made \"timely admission of the relevant conduct underlying his conviction.\" This is not quite the same as saying he had timely notified the prosecutor of his intent to plead guilty under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b)(2)<i>Cf. United States v.

On appeal, the defendant, Norman Gallant, objects to the denial of an additional one-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under &#167; 3E1.1(b) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, after the district court had granted a two-level downward adjustment. The government concedes that the court erred, but nonetheless argues that there should be no relief because the issue was not preserved. Forfeited sentencing objections are reviewed for plain error and there is no plain error, the government argues, because Gallant's 24-month sentence falls within the guidelines sentencing range that would have applied had the district court given Gallant the additional one-level adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the government's reasoning is not implausible, we find that Gallant did not forfeit his objection. The defendant consistently argued that he was entitled to a three-level reduction, the government warned the district court against its eventual ruling, the ruling was contrary to both parties' positions, and the sentencing judge did not invite further arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallant also challenges the imposition of an order that, as a special condition of supervised release, he transfer to the government all property necessary to make restitution. Gallant argues that there was no criminal forfeiture provision in the information or indictment, and that the court's order is best characterized as requiring forfeiture. This argument fails. The order does not amount to an order of forfeiture. Rather, it was a reasonable use of the court's authority to effectuate restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Norman Gallant bilked the U.S. government out of roughly $300,000 over a decade. He waived indictment on May 21, 2001, and was charged by information. He timely pled guilty on two counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (2000), one count of fraudulent receipt of Social Security benefits, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 408(a)(4) (2000), and one count of tax evasion, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7201 (2000). Between August 1992 and October 2000, Gallant fraudulently obtained $29,130 in Section 8 rental subsidies from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Between January 1995 and April 2001, he fraudulently secured $102,021 in Medicaid funds for a personal care attendant. Between July 1992 and February 2001, he fraudulently obtained $162,000 in Social Security disability benefits. The information had charged Gallant with cheating on his 1999 income taxes by a sum in excess of $11,000; Gallant pled guilty to committing tax fraud totaling between $23,500 and $40,000 over tax years 1995 to 1999. As part of the plea, the parties agreed that the total loss to the government was between $200,000 and $350,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the plea agreement the government agreed to recommend a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 (2002),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> provided defendant met five conditions, three of which are pertinent here. Conditions (3), (4), and (5) stated that Gallant:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) acknowledges that he is the sole effective owner and has sole effective control of the assets owned by the Macantosh Realty Trust, the Serenity Equity Trust and the Serenity Equity Trust II, and that all such assets are available for restitution; (4) takes all necessary steps to make such assets available for restitution as the Court may order; and (5) makes an initial payment of $15,000 in restitution to the clerk of the court prior to sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) originally recommended that Gallant receive a three-level reduction if he complied with the government's conditions. The government responded to the PSR, objecting that no three-level reduction should be granted for acceptance of responsibility because Gallant had not yet satisfied the terms of the agreement. Gallant had no objection, of course, to the recommended three-level reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the government's objections, the probation officer prepared an Addendum to the PSR revising his recommendations as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(25) The defendant admitted his involvement in the instant offense and is being granted acceptance of responsibility. The offense level is reduced two (2) levels per U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a) as he has clearly demonstrated acceptance of responsibility for his offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(25a) Per U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b), if the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by taking one or more of the following steps: (1) Timely providing complete information to the government concerning his own involvement in the offense; or (2) Timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the Court to allocate its resources efficiently, decrease the offense level by 1 additional level. <i>As of this date, the defendant has not satisfied this criteria.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the PSR correctly stated that there are two alternate conditions for a further one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b), it also said that \"this criteria\" had not been met. The PSR was incorrect &#8212; there has never been any question that Gallant had met the second condition it described,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the government never argued that defendant had not \"timely notified the authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.\" The PSR Addendum did not alert the court to the relationship between the granting of a two-level reduction and the granting of the third level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallant's subsequent Sentencing Memorandum to the district court argued that he was entitled to a three-level reduction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The government's position was that Gallant was not entitled to any reduction for acceptance of responsibility. If he was not entitled to a two-level reduction because he had not assisted the authorities, then he was ineligible for a third-level reduction. No party focused on the possibility that the court would deny a third-level reduction if the Court granted a two-level reduction. It simply was not an issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That was the posture in which the parties entered the sentencing hearing, and which they articulated at the hearing. The government continued to press its position that Gallant should receive no reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Its basis was that Gallant had not assisted the government: he had not disclosed all trust assets (he claimed a boat allegedly owned by one of the trusts had been sold to another party) and he had been unwilling to sell immediately the condominiums not occupied by himself or his sons to meet his restitution obligation. Nonetheless, the government raised the issue of a third-level reduction. The government's position at sentencing was that the defendant \"may well have satisfied the timeliness and the timely plea, which you need for the third point, but he hasn't satisfied what he needs to do for the first two points.\" Gallant responded that he had satisfied the conditions necessary for the first two points. He added that he was willing to make restitution, but did not think his assets should all be liquidated immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court stated that Gallant's assets were ill-gotten and should be liquidated immediately, so that restitution could be made promptly, rather than being drawn out through the probation period. Concerned by Gallant's temporizing about restitution, the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm puzzled ... about whether it's appropriate for me to give somebody the benefit of acceptance of responsibility when there isn't an acknowledgment that there is any immediate obligation to return or pay back or reimburse monies which were wrongfully obtained and that's the struggle that I'm having.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the hearing the court then solved its puzzling dilemma with a compromise: the court granted two levels for acceptance of responsibility but denied a third. The court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As far as the three-level reduction goes, I think it is somewhat artificial but I think that a two point, not a three point, reduction is appropriate. I think the level 16 offense level is where this case should be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I recognize in doing that I'm acknowledging the somewhat unusual facts of this case, but I do not think that the defendant has made the sort of recognition of fault and the intent to correct that fault which is within his power that would justify the full three-level reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have considered and frankly come close to the decision of not allowing any reduction whatsoever for acceptance of responsibility. But I have in mind that the defendant did offer his pleas of guilty, did save the government the necessity of going to trial with this case and is entitled to some benefit for having done that, even though what I would call the moral aspect of acceptance of responsibility seems to me to be lacking to some degree here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then the court promptly moved on to the next sentencing issue without entertaining any objections to its ruling. Neither party interrupted the court to ask it to revisit its denial of the third point on the grounds that, by its decision to give Gallant two points, the court had inherently determined that Gallant must receive three points. It is this \"if two levels, then necessarily three levels\" rationale which Gallant argues on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also ordered Gallant to pay a $50,000 fine and to make restitution in the amounts of $29,130 to HUD, $102,021 to Medicaid, and $162,000 to the Social Security Administration. The court ordered the restitution payable \"immediately or according to a court-ordered repayment schedule.\" Along with the standard conditions of supervised release, the court ordered, as a special condition, that the condominium units be surrendered to the government and sold for cash during the period of supervised release. The court ordered Gallant to pay the balance of the restitution according to a court-ordered repayment schedule, and stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he defendant will execute all necessary papers permitting the timely sale of properties that are owned by him either directly or through others to permit restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The execution of these papers will include execution of any papers necessary to transfer the sailboat referred to in the pre-sentence report to the government for sale as part of the restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant takes the position that the sailboat no longer belongs to him, but to the extent it's necessary for him to execute any documents to assist the government in obtaining that sailboat if it is available, he will do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also found that the properties held in the three trusts (the Macantosh Realty Trust, the Serenity Equity Trust, and the Serenity Equity Trust II) all belonged to the defendant, so the government was free to place liens on the properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Acceptance of Responsibility Reductions</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court lacks discretion to deny the additional one-level reduction if the defendant is found to have accepted responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a) and has complied with the conditions specified in U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b)(2). <i>United States v. Marroquin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751617\"><a href=\"/opinion/751617/united-states-v-willy-marroquin-aka-willy-adolfo-marroquin-mendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 223 (1st Cir.1998). The government concedes it was error not to give a three-level reduction, because the court found Gallant was entitled to a two-level reduction and he had satisfied the criteria for the third level. The government, however, argues that Gallant has forfeited the issue by failing to raise it in the trial court. As a result, the government contends, this court should apply a plain error test, and Gallant does not meet the test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues he did not forfeit the issue. In the alternative, he says, his substantial rights were affected because he was given a total offense level of 16, with a GSR of 21 to 27 months imprisonment. The 24-month sentence he received was within the GSR of 18 to 24 months that would have applied if the court had granted the additional one-level reduction. We do not consider this alternative \"plain error\" argument because Gallant did not forfeit his objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of when a forfeiture of an objection occurs comes up in many different contexts. The issue is bounded on both ends by clear and firm rules in particular settings. If a defendant, for example, fails to timely object to a question put to a witness, then he has forfeited his evidentiary objection. If he objects and states the nature of his evidentiary objection, he has preserved it. Between these clear poles, the matter of what constitutes forfeiture is more one of degree and judgment by the appellate court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of the issue on review influences the outcome of the forfeiture analysis. For example, this circuit is notably rigorous in requiring a party unhappy with a trial court's jury instruction to promptly state the precise objection after the instruction has been given. <i>See Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196064\"><a href=\"/opinion/196064/scarfo-v-cabletron-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span>, 944 (1st Cir.1995) (a party must not only identify the error in the jury instruction but also explain how the judge can correct it); <i>Cyr v. B. Offen &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"321143\"><a href=\"/opinion/321143/alphonse-cyr-jr-and-arlene-cyr-v-b-offen-co-inc-and-third-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1145</span></a></span>, 1155 (1st Cir.1974) (quoting <i>Palmer v. Hoffman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103772\"><a href=\"/opinion/103772/palmer-v-hoffman/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span>, 119, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></span> (1943)) (objection to the jury instruction \"must be sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error\"). The requirement for a post-instruction objection is set forth in the federal rules, Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, and counsel are on clear notice of the requirement. Counsel must make the post-instruction objection even if she has objected earlier. This rule gives the trial court an opportunity to rectify any error in the instruction before the jury begins to deliberate. <i>See Golden v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"260842\"><a href=\"/opinion/260842/john-f-golden-jr-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 360 (1st Cir.1963).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no such equivalent requirement for counsel to make an objection after an evidentiary ruling when an earlier timely objection was made. Nor is there a requirement that an objection be made before the grounds for the objection reasonably should have been known to the objector: the defense is \"not required to anticipate the government's line of questioning in order for an objection to be timely.\" <i>U.S. v. Meserve,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span>, 323 (1st Cir.2001). Indeed, under Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1) a party may oppose the admission of testimony through either a timely objection or a motion to strike. The operative principle is that the objection need not be made before the grounds are reasonably known.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case concerns neither jury instructions nor evidentiary issues. It concerns sentencing and whether the continued insistence of Gallant's counsel that Gallant was entitled to a three-level reduction was sufficient, although Gallant's counsel did not present the precise argument made here. Context is important. This is not a situation in which the government took the position contrary to defendant on the precise argument and the defendant failed to protest. To the contrary, the government said that if Gallant was entitled to the two-level reduction, most likely he was entitled to a third level. Gallant obviously would not object to this part of the government's position. Nothing in the government's position at any time put defendant on notice that he might receive two levels but not three. Although the Addendum to the PSR may be thought to have provided some notice, neither party adopted its legal conclusions and both argued implicitly against them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Further, Gallant consistently had said he was entitled to a three-level reduction. Gallant had no real reason to think this was at issue until after the court ruled. We generally do not require objections to be made to hypothetical outcomes which neither party anticipated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support its forfeiture argument, the government relies heavily on <i>United States v. Keppler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628064\"><a href=\"/opinion/628064/united-states-v-frederick-c-keppler/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span> (2nd Cir.1993). That case is easily distinguished. Far from conveying that the sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility was an all-or-nothing proposition, the government there argued at the sentencing hearing that the court should deny \"all <i>or part</i>\" of the three-level reduction. <i>Id.</i> at 22-23 (emphasis added). Moreover, when the court granted a two- but not a three-level reduction, the court specifically asked for objections and defense counsel had none.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Id.</i> at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also points to our case law saying that a defendant cannot present one legal argument at the trial court and another on appeal. <i>See United States v. Lilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195133\"><a href=\"/opinion/195133/united-states-v-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 17-18 (1st Cir.1994). That is quite so, but even that doctrine has its limits. The doctrine has not been applied where the defendant could not reasonably have anticipated the issue would arise until after the court had ruled in a way contrary to both parties' positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's argument that Gallant forfeited the issue then depends on the premise that a criminal defendant must state objections to the imposition of a particular sentence after the sentence has been announced by the court &#8212; even when the ruling has not been advocated by any of the parties and the court does not invite further arguments. Here, both parties had together argued a position before sentencing which would, if followed, have obviated the error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's argument that a post-sentence objection is required is not implausible. If defense counsel had been quick enough after the ruling to object, even absent any invitation from the court, this problem might have been avoided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Considerations of judicial economy may be thought to support a requirement of objection after a sentence is given, even to unanticipated issues. But judicial economy works two ways. There is also a need for finality and few trial judges would warm to a rule which requires continued argument after the court gives its sentence. Further, unlike other areas, there is no Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure giving advance notice to counsel of a requirement to make post-sentence objections. Indeed, Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3) provides that the court entertain argument from both defendant's counsel and the government \"before imposing sentence.\" There is also the interest, expressed in other contexts, of avoiding judicial proceedings conducted through surprise, sometimes called \"trial by ambush.\" Lawyers should have fair notice and an opportunity to prepare.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> On balance, given the facts here, we think it simply would be unfair and unwise as a matter of policy to hold that Gallant forfeited the argument. Accordingly, we will remand to the district court for resentencing in light of the error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To its credit, the government has simplified matters by agreeing that there would be no claim by it on remand that the defendant is not entitled to any credit or acceptance of responsibility. <i>See generally United States v. Ticchiarelli,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198379\"><a href=\"/opinion/198379/united-states-v-ticchiarelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29-30 (1st Cir.1999). The district court is free on remand to determine where within the applicable GSR the defendant should be resentenced. It is not a foregone conclusion that on remand the appropriate sentence will be 21 months rather than 24 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Restitution</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallant also challenges the order requiring, as a special condition of supervised release, that he sell such of his assets as necessary to permit restitution. Gallant argues that this was effectively an asset forfeiture and that the government complied with none of the procedures for obtaining a forfeiture order. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(2), 32.2(a); <i>see also United States v. Loe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773034\"><a href=\"/opinion/773034/united-states-of-america-v-cornelius-dewitte-loe-jr-also-known-as-cd/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 464 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument mischaracterizes the order. The order merely effectuates the court's power to order restitution under 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663-3664 and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(a)(6). It is true that Gallant's assets are to be surrendered to the government and sold for cash. The government here wears two hats. Several agencies of the government were defrauded by Gallant and are entitled to restitution. Another branch of government, the prosecution, has been authorized to sell the assets in order to make that restitution. This is not a case of asset forfeiture at all and the order was well within the district court's discretion over conditions of supervised release. <i>See United States v. Phaneuf,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196902\"><a href=\"/opinion/196902/united-states-v-phaneuf/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 262-63 (1st Cir.1996).
