Petitioner Jing Jing Jiang\n\npetitions us to review a decision of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\") affirming an Immigration Judge's (\"IJ's\") denial of\n\nher asylum application.1      We deny the petition for review and\n\naffirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n                            I.   Background\n\n            Jiang is a native and citizen of China who entered the\n\nUnited States at the Los Angeles International Airport on July 19,\n\n2001, without a valid entry document.    She was sixteen years old at\n\nthe time.    On July 30, 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (\"INS\")2 issued a Notice to Appear charging that Jiang was\n\nremovable   under   §   212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)    of   the   Immigration   and\n\nNationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), as an\n\nalien not in possession of a valid immigration document.                On\n\nJuly 9, 2002,3 Jiang admitted the allegations against her, conceded\n\n\n1\n   The BIA also denied Jiang's application for withholding of\nremoval. While Jiang states in the concluding paragraph of her\nbrief that she is eligible for withholding of removal, she has not\naddressed the issue in any other part of her brief. We therefore\ndeem the issue waived. See Qin v. Ashcroft, 360 F.3d 302, 305 n.5\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n2\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n3\n   Jiang was originally ordered to appear before an IJ in San\nPedro, California. However, she filed two motions for a change of\nvenue, both of which were granted. In the first, she requested\nthat her removal proceeding be moved to New York, New York, where\n\n                                  -2-\n\fremovability, and filed applications for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval.   Jiang testified at a hearing before an IJ on February 4,\n\n2003.   We draw the following facts from this testimony and the\n\ndocuments Jiang presented in support of her applications.\n\n           Jiang's father owned a bookstore that he opened in 1997\n\nin Wuhan Changle Township in China.       Jiang worked in the bookstore\n\nsoon after graduating from middle school in July 2000.           In October\n\n2000,   Jiang's   father   began   practicing   Falun   Gong,4   which   the\n\nChinese government has classified as a cult and banned.             Jiang's\n\nfather also sold Falun Gong books in his bookstore.              Jiang, her\n\nmother, and her sister do not practice Falun Gong.\n\n           In May 2001, Jiang's father went into hiding.5            He was\n\ngone for four or five days before Jiang noticed his absence.\n\n\n\nshe was living with her uncle. In the second, she requested a\nchange of venue to Boston, Massachusetts, which is where her\nhearing eventually took place.\n4\n    According to the U.S. Department of State, Falun Gong\n\n      blends aspects of Taoism, Buddhism, and the meditation\n      techniques   and   physical   exercises  of   qigong   (a\n      traditional Chinese exercise discipline) with the\n      teachings of Falun Gong leader Li Hongzhi . . . .\n      Despite the spiritual content of some of Li's teachings,\n      Falun Gong does not consider itself a religion and has no\n      clergy or places of worship.\n\n2002 International Religious Freedom Report: China (U.S. Dep't of\nState, 2002).\n5\n   There is no indication in the record of what exactly prompted\nJiang's father to go into hiding, although Jiang stated he went\ninto hiding from the government because he practiced Falun Gong.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fAccording to Jiang, her father was often gone from their home for\n\ndays at a time while visiting friends or relatives, and she thus\n\ndid not think it strange when she did not see him for a few days.\n\n           Around the same time, government officials came to the\n\nfamily bookstore while Jiang was working there. The officials were\n\nlooking for Jiang's father and told Jiang that they knew her father\n\npracticed Falun Gong.    Jiang told the officials that she did not\n\nknow where her father was.     After the officials repeated their\n\nquestions a few times, they took Jiang with them.   Jiang was taken\n\nto a very small room in a building that looked like a local police\n\nstation.   The room had a small window just above the bed.   The next\n\nday, the officials came to the room and told Jiang to give them\n\n\"the real answers.\"\n\n           The officials detained Jiang for around a week, during\n\nwhich time they gave her one meal per day.    They never physically\n\nharmed her.    On the last evening of her captivity there was a\n\ntyphoon, during which the window above her bed shattered.      Jiang\n\nwas able to climb out the window and jump to the ground below.\n\nAlthough she did not know exactly where she was, Jiang walked until\n\nshe found a telephone, which she used to call her mother.    Jiang's\n\nmother sent a car to pick her up, and Jiang went into hiding.    She\n\nstayed at an aunt's house for one evening, then stayed in a hotel\n\nfor a week or two.      Jiang's mother arranged her departure from\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fChina to the United States.          Jiang's mother and sister still live\n\nin China and have not reported any problems to Jiang.\n\n            The IJ denied Jiang's applications, finding that Jiang's\n\ntestimony was not credible.            First, the IJ found it odd that\n\nJiang's father was missing for four or five days before Jiang\n\nnoticed and wondered how Jiang was able to operate the bookstore\n\nwithout her father.     Second, the IJ stated that \"[i]t simply is not\n\nreasonable . . . that the police officers would question a then 16-\n\nyear-old girl as to the whereabouts of her father when, if they\n\ntruly   wanted   to   know   where    her    father   was,   they   would   have\n\nquestioned [Jiang's] mother.\"          Third, the IJ disbelieved Jiang's\n\ntestimony that she was held in a small room for a week by the\n\npolice because it did not make sense that the police would hold\n\nJiang and not Jiang's mother.         Fourth, the IJ disbelieved Jiang's\n\ntestimony regarding her escape, stating that \"[i]t would certainly\n\nseem to me that if she was being held somewhere in detention . . .\n\nthat she would have been held in a cell in the police station and\n\nnot just a small room with a window.\"            Fifth, the IJ disbelieved\n\nJiang's testimony regarding how she was able to contact her mother\n\nand how her mother was able to have a car pick her up.                  The IJ\n\nstated that \"[o]ne would wonder where the respondent would have\n\ncalled from, and how her mother would have known where to send a\n\ntaxi to.\"     Finally, the IJ stated that, if Jiang had really\n\nescaped, then the police would have sent officers after her, and\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f\"certainly . . . would have gone to the mother's home, and . . .\n\nvery likely would have held the mother in detention.                  All of these\n\nthings did not happen.\"         The IJ also stated that Jiang was not a\n\npractitioner of Falun Gong and concluded that, at best, \"she was\n\nnot being persecuted because she was a Falun Gong practitioner, but\n\nrather abused by the police, who wanted to find her father.\"\n\n            Jiang appealed to the BIA, which adopted and affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision on November 16, 2004.              Jiang now contests the BIA's\n\ndecision.\n\n                                II.   Discussion\n\n            In order to establish eligibility for asylum, an asylum\n\napplicant has the burden of establishing that she is a \"refugee.\"\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).                 \"Refugee\" means\n\nany person who is outside of her home country and \"is unable or\n\nunwilling to return to . . . that country because of persecution or\n\na well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion . . . .\"      8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).          An applicant may meet\n\nthis   burden    by   showing    past       persecution   --   which    creates   a\n\nrebuttable      presumption     of      a    well-founded      fear    of   future\n\npersecution, Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n-- or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one\n\nof the five statutory grounds.              8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f           To establish past persecution, an applicant must provide\n\n\"conclusive evidence\" that she was targeted on any of the five\n\ngrounds.   Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 18.       To show a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution, \"the asylum applicant's fear must be both\n\ngenuine and objectively reasonable.\"          Aguilar-Solís v. INS, 168\n\nF.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           We review decisions of the BIA under the substantial\n\nevidence standard, Mihaylov v. Ashcroft, 379 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n2004), and will uphold the BIA's decision if it is \"'supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.'\"     INS v. Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992)(quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(4)). Under this standard, \"[t]o\n\nreverse the BIA finding, we must find that the evidence not only\n\nsupports   that    conclusion,    but   compels   it.\"   Id.   at   481   n.1\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\nA.   Credibility\n\n           In order to establish eligibility for asylum, \"an alien\n\nmust support [her] claim of persecution through credible testimony.\n\nCredible testimony, standing alone, may be adequate to sustain the\n\nalien's burden of proof.         But if the proffered testimony is not\n\ncredible, it may be either disregarded or sharply discounted\n\n. . . .\"   Nikijuluw v. Gonzáles, 427 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f            Both Jiang and the government took the position in their\n\nbriefs that the BIA did not address the IJ's adverse credibility\n\ndetermination and, in effect, assumed that Jiang presented credible\n\ntestimony.    However, having carefully reviewed the BIA's decision,\n\nwe believe that the parties have erroneously interpreted that\n\ndecision.\n\n            The BIA stated that it agreed with the IJ's decision\n\n            to the extent that the [IJ] determined that\n            [Jiang] failed to carry her burden of proof\n            with respect to her claim for asylum . . . In\n            this regard, the [IJ] identified a number of\n            assertions by [Jiang] which are of such a\n            nature that they would reasonably require\n            corroboration in order to merit the assignment\n            of full probative value. However, the record\n            is devoid of such objective evidence.\n\n(emphasis added).    It is true that the BIA agreed with the IJ's\n\ndecision because it found that Jiang had failed to carry her burden\n\nof proof.    However, it appears to us that the reason the BIA found\n\nJiang had failed to carry her burden of proof was that portions of\n\nher testimony were not entirely credible and therefore required\n\ncorroborative evidence, which Jiang did not provide.\n\n            This conclusion is bolstered by two other portions of the\n\nBIA's decision.     First, in support of its statement that Jiang\n\nshould have provided certain corroborative evidence, the BIA cited\n\nSidhu v. INS, 220 F.3d 1085 (9th Cir. 2000).       Sidhu involved a\n\nsituation where the BIA made an adverse credibility finding and\n\ndenied the petitioner's asylum application because the petitioner\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\ffailed to present certain corroborating evidence. As in Sidhu, id.\n\nat 1092, it appears that the BIA in the instant case was affirming\n\nthe    IJ's     adverse    credibility        determination   and   requiring\n\ncorroborative evidence. Second, the BIA stated near the end of its\n\ndecision that \"[i]nasmuch as we are in agreement with the decision\n\nof the [IJ] as noted above, we adopt and affirm his decision.\"              The\n\nIJ's decision focused almost exclusively on Jiang's credibility.\n\nIt would not make sense for the BIA to state that it adopted the\n\nIJ's decision if it in fact did not even purport to address the\n\nmajority of that decision.         For all these reasons, we believe that\n\nthe BIA affirmed the IJ's credibility determination.6\n\n              When \"the BIA adopt[s] the IJ's credibility determination\n\nand decision, we review the IJ's decision as the adopted final\n\nagency determination.\"        Chen v. Gonzáles, 418 F.3d 110, 113 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).       We review the credibility determinations of the IJ or\n\nBIA under the substantial evidence standard and will uphold the\n\ncredibility determination \"'unless any reasonable adjudicator would\n\nbe    compelled    to   conclude   to   the    contrary.'\"    Kheireddine   v.\n\nGonzáles, 427 F.3d 80, 88 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252\n\n(b)(4)(B)).       Often adverse credibility determinations are made as\n\na result of inconsistencies in a petitioner's testimony or the\n\n\n6\n   Jiang cites to several cases in her brief wherein the BIA did\nnot address the petitioner's credibility yet required certain\ncorroborative evidence. However, in those cases the BIA explicitly\nstated that it was either not addressing credibility or was\nassuming credibility. That is not the situation in Jiang's case.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fdemeanor of the petitioner while testifying.                  See, e.g., Long v.\n\nGonzáles, 422 F.3d 37, 39-41 (1st Cir. 2005) (inconsistencies);\n\nFalae v. Gonzáles, 411 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2005) (demeanor).                     In\n\nthe instant case, however, the IJ focused on aspects of Jiang's\n\ntestimony that he found inherently implausible.                     We have stated\n\nthat where adverse credibility findings are based on \"analysis of\n\ntestimony rather than on demeanor [such findings] deserve less than\n\nusual deference.\" Cordero-Trejo v. INS, 40 F.3d 482, 487 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n             We believe that some of the \"implausibilities\" identified\n\nby the IJ were adequately explained by Jiang in her testimony.                    For\n\nexample, the IJ found it \"curious\" that Jiang's family did not\n\ndiscuss the fact that Jiang's father was going into hiding, and\n\nthat Jiang's father was gone for four or five days before she\n\nnoticed his absence.         Jiang explained this by stating that her\n\nfather was often away for days at a time visiting friends and\n\nrelatives, so she thought nothing of his absence at first.                      Jiang\n\nfurther explained that her mother did not immediately tell her that\n\nher father had gone into hiding because she was still a child at\n\nthe   time   and   her   mother     did   not   want    her    to    worry.      This\n\nexplanation is plausible, in that parents often keep problems from\n\ntheir children.\n\n             However,    other     implausibilities      were       not   so   easily\n\nexplained.      For     example,    Jiang   stated     that   she     escaped    from\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fcaptivity when a typhoon broke a small window in her cell, so that\n\nshe was then able to climb through and jump to the ground below.\n\nAs the IJ noted, if Jiang were being held as she claimed, it is\n\nunlikely that she was being held in a room with a window which she\n\ncould access and escape through.            Further, if officers had taken\n\nJiang and she had escaped, it is highly likely that the officers\n\nwould   have   at   the   least   questioned    her   mother   about   Jiang's\n\nwhereabouts, put Jiang's mother under surveillance, or even put\n\nJiang's mother in detention. After all, the authorities would have\n\nstill been looking for Jiang's father, and would also want to find\n\nJiang, who had escaped.       It does not appear from the record that\n\nany of this ever occurred.          In fact, Jiang testified that her\n\nmother and sister still live in the same location in China, and\n\nneither has reported any problems to Jiang since she came to the\n\nUnited States.\n\n           Reviewing for substantial evidence, we are not compelled\n\nto conclude that the BIA and IJ erred in the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination.      While we think that certain aspects of Jiang's\n\ntestimony which the IJ found problematic were adequately explained\n\nby Jiang, other portions were not.            On the whole, Jiang's story\n\nsimply was not entirely credible and would have been greatly helped\n\nby corroborative evidence such as an affidavit from Jiang's mother\n\n(who was able to send a copy of the bookstore's business license to\n\nJiang). We therefore affirm the adverse credibility determination.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fB.    Past Persecution\n\n             The adverse credibility determination disposes of Jiang's\n\nclaim of past persecution.               However, we wish to note that, even\n\nassuming Jiang's testimony was credible, her experiences do not\n\nrise    to   the       level   of      past    persecution.7          \"To    qualify   as\n\npersecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering.\"                    Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d\n\n258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000) (no persecution where petitioner was\n\nbriefly detained on three separate occasions, physically abused,\n\nand    occasionally       under     surveillance).          In   the    instant    case,\n\nalthough Jiang was allegedly detained for a week, she was fed every\n\nday and was never physically harmed in any way.                              We are not\n\ncompelled to find that her alleged experiences constituted past\n\npersecution.\n\nC.    Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n             Since Jiang has not proven past persecution, she is not\n\nentitled     to    a    presumption      of     a    well-founded     fear    of   future\n\npersecution.       However, she can still demonstrate a well-founded\n\nfear if she shows that her fear is \"both genuine and objectively\n\nreasonable.\"       Aguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 572.               Both the objective\n\nand    subjective       prongs    of    this    test    depend   on    an    applicant's\n\ncredibility.       To satisfy the subjective prong, the applicant must\n\n\n7\n    We believe this to be true even considering Jiang's age\n(sixteen) at the time of the events that allegedly occurred in\nChina.\n\n                                              -12-\n\fshow her fear is genuine.   Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzáles, 428 F.3d\n\n30, 35 (1st Cir. 2005).       To satisfy the objective prong, the\n\napplicant \"must show by credible evidence that her fear of future\n\npersecution is reasonable.\"    Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 65\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           Jiang claims that the BIA failed to consider whether\n\nJiang had a well-founded fear of future persecution.      Jiang is\n\ncorrect that the BIA never explicitly stated that Jiang did not\n\nhave a well-founded fear.     However, the BIA did state that Jiang\n\nhad failed to carry her burden of proof for her asylum claim, and\n\nit gave as its main reason her lack of credibility and the need for\n\ncertain corroborative evidence.    The BIA's opinion certainly was\n\nnot a model of clarity, and, in a different situation, we might be\n\ncompelled to vacate its order.     See, e.g., Halo v. Gonzáles, 419\n\nF.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2005) (vacating BIA's order where the BIA\n\ngave only a conclusory explanation for finding the petitioner did\n\nnot make sufficient showing of persecution to meet burden of\n\nproof).   In the instant case, however, we believe it is clear that\n\nthe BIA and IJ based their decisions on the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination. Consequently, Jiang cannot meet either prong of the\n\nwell-founded fear test.   We therefore find substantial evidence to\n\nsupport the BIA's denial of Jiang's asylum claim.8\n\n\n8\n   We also note that the fact that Jiang's mother and sister\ncontinue to live in China and have not reported any problems to\nJiang undercuts Jiang's claim of having a well-founded fear. See\n\n                                 -13-\n\f                        III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the BIA's denial of Jiang's\n\nasylum claims is supported by substantial evidence.   We deny the\n\npetition for review and affirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nAli v.

Background\n\n            Jiang is a native and citizen of China who entered the\n\nUnited States at the Los Angeles International Airport on July 19,\n\n2001, without a valid entry document.    She was sixteen years old at\n\nthe time.    On July 30, 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (\"INS\")2 issued a Notice to Appear charging that Jiang was\n\nremovable   under   §   212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)    of   the   Immigration   and\n\nNationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), as an\n\nalien not in possession of a valid immigration document.                On\n\nJuly 9, 2002,3 Jiang admitted the allegations against her, conceded\n\n\n1\n   The BIA also denied Jiang's application for withholding of\nremoval. While Jiang states in the concluding paragraph of her\nbrief that she is eligible for withholding of removal, she has not\naddressed the issue in any other part of her brief. We therefore\ndeem the issue waived. See Qin v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200904\"><a href=\"/opinion/200904/qin-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 305 n.5\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n2\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n3\n   Jiang was originally ordered to appear before an IJ in San\nPedro, California. However, she filed two motions for a change of\nvenue, both of which were granted. In the first, she requested\nthat her removal proceeding be moved to New York, New York, where\n\n                                  -2-\n\fremovability, and filed applications for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval.   Jiang testified at a hearing before an IJ on February 4,\n\n2003.   We draw the following facts from this testimony and the\n\ndocuments Jiang presented in support of her applications.\n\n           Jiang's father owned a bookstore that he opened in 1997\n\nin Wuhan Changle Township in China.       Jiang worked in the bookstore\n\nsoon after graduating from middle school in July 2000.           In October\n\n2000,   Jiang's   father   began   practicing   Falun   Gong,4   which   the\n\nChinese government has classified as a cult and banned.             Jiang's\n\nfather also sold Falun Gong books in his bookstore.              Jiang, her\n\nmother, and her sister do not practice Falun Gong.\n\n           In May 2001, Jiang's father went into hiding.5            He was\n\ngone for four or five days before Jiang noticed his absence.\n\n\n\nshe was living with her uncle. In the second, she requested a\nchange of venue to Boston, Massachusetts, which is where her\nhearing eventually took place.\n4\n    According to the U.S. Department of State, Falun Gong\n\n      blends aspects of Taoism, Buddhism, and the meditation\n      techniques   and   physical   exercises  of   qigong   (a\n      traditional Chinese exercise discipline) with the\n      teachings of Falun Gong leader Li Hongzhi . . . .\n      Despite the spiritual content of some of Li's teachings,\n      Falun Gong does not consider itself a religion and has no\n      clergy or places of worship.\n\n2002 International Religious Freedom Report: China (U.S. Dep't of\nState, 2002).\n5\n   There is no indication in the record of what exactly prompted\nJiang's father to go into hiding, although Jiang stated he went\ninto hiding from the government because he practiced Falun Gong.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fAccording to Jiang, her father was often gone from their home for\n\ndays at a time while visiting friends or relatives, and she thus\n\ndid not think it strange when she did not see him for a few days.\n\n           Around the same time, government officials came to the\n\nfamily bookstore while Jiang was working there. The officials were\n\nlooking for Jiang's father and told Jiang that they knew her father\n\npracticed Falun Gong.    Jiang told the officials that she did not\n\nknow where her father was.     After the officials repeated their\n\nquestions a few times, they took Jiang with them.   Jiang was taken\n\nto a very small room in a building that looked like a local police\n\nstation.   The room had a small window just above the bed.   The next\n\nday, the officials came to the room and told Jiang to give them\n\n\"the real answers.\"\n\n           The officials detained Jiang for around a week, during\n\nwhich time they gave her one meal per day.    They never physically\n\nharmed her.    On the last evening of her captivity there was a\n\ntyphoon, during which the window above her bed shattered.      Jiang\n\nwas able to climb out the window and jump to the ground below.\n\nAlthough she did not know exactly where she was, Jiang walked until\n\nshe found a telephone, which she used to call her mother.    Jiang's\n\nmother sent a car to pick her up, and Jiang went into hiding.    She\n\nstayed at an aunt's house for one evening, then stayed in a hotel\n\nfor a week or two.      Jiang's mother arranged her departure from\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fChina to the United States.          Jiang's mother and sister still live\n\nin China and have not reported any problems to Jiang.\n\n            The IJ denied Jiang's applications, finding that Jiang's\n\ntestimony was not credible.            First, the IJ found it odd that\n\nJiang's father was missing for four or five days before Jiang\n\nnoticed and wondered how Jiang was able to operate the bookstore\n\nwithout her father.     Second, the IJ stated that \"[i]t simply is not\n\nreasonable . . . that the police officers would question a then 16-\n\nyear-old girl as to the whereabouts of her father when, if they\n\ntruly   wanted   to   know   where    her    father   was,   they   would   have\n\nquestioned [Jiang's] mother.\"          Third, the IJ disbelieved Jiang's\n\ntestimony that she was held in a small room for a week by the\n\npolice because it did not make sense that the police would hold\n\nJiang and not Jiang's mother.         Fourth, the IJ disbelieved Jiang's\n\ntestimony regarding her escape, stating that \"[i]t would certainly\n\nseem to me that if she was being held somewhere in detention . . .\n\nthat she would have been held in a cell in the police station and\n\nnot just a small room with a window.\"            Fifth, the IJ disbelieved\n\nJiang's testimony regarding how she was able to contact her mother\n\nand how her mother was able to have a car pick her up.                  The IJ\n\nstated that \"[o]ne would wonder where the respondent would have\n\ncalled from, and how her mother would have known where to send a\n\ntaxi to.\"     Finally, the IJ stated that, if Jiang had really\n\nescaped, then the police would have sent officers after her, and\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f\"certainly . . . would have gone to the mother's home, and . . .\n\nvery likely would have held the mother in detention.                  All of these\n\nthings did not happen.\"         The IJ also stated that Jiang was not a\n\npractitioner of Falun Gong and concluded that, at best, \"she was\n\nnot being persecuted because she was a Falun Gong practitioner, but\n\nrather abused by the police, who wanted to find her father.\"\n\n            Jiang appealed to the BIA, which adopted and affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision on November 16, 2004.              Jiang now contests the BIA's\n\ndecision.\n\n                                II.   Discussion\n\n            In order to establish eligibility for asylum, an asylum\n\napplicant has the burden of establishing that she is a \"refugee.\"\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).                 \"Refugee\" means\n\nany person who is outside of her home country and \"is unable or\n\nunwilling to return to . . . that country because of persecution or\n\na well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion . . . .\"      8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).

Gonzáles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f            Both Jiang and the government took the position in their\n\nbriefs that the BIA did not address the IJ's adverse credibility\n\ndetermination and, in effect, assumed that Jiang presented credible\n\ntestimony.    However, having carefully reviewed the BIA's decision,\n\nwe believe that the parties have erroneously interpreted that\n\ndecision.\n\n            The BIA stated that it agreed with the IJ's decision\n\n            to the extent that the [IJ] determined that\n            [Jiang] failed to carry her burden of proof\n            with respect to her claim for asylum . . . In\n            this regard, the [IJ] identified a number of\n            assertions by [Jiang] which are of such a\n            nature that they would reasonably require\n            corroboration in order to merit the assignment\n            of full probative value. However, the record\n            is devoid of such objective evidence.\n\n(emphasis added).    It is true that the BIA agreed with the IJ's\n\ndecision because it found that Jiang had failed to carry her burden\n\nof proof.    However, it appears to us that the reason the BIA found\n\nJiang had failed to carry her burden of proof was that portions of\n\nher testimony were not entirely credible and therefore required\n\ncorroborative evidence, which Jiang did not provide.\n\n            This conclusion is bolstered by two other portions of the\n\nBIA's decision.     First, in support of its statement that Jiang\n\nshould have provided certain corroborative evidence, the BIA cited\n\nSidhu v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769714\"><a href=\"/opinion/769714/manraj-singh-sidhu-v-immigration-and-naturalizationservice/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2000).       Sidhu involved a\n\nsituation where the BIA made an adverse credibility finding and\n\ndenied the petitioner's asylum application because the petitioner\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\ffailed to present certain corroborating evidence. As in Sidhu, id.\n\nat 1092, it appears that the BIA in the instant case was affirming\n\nthe    IJ's     adverse    credibility        determination   and   requiring\n\ncorroborative evidence. Second, the BIA stated near the end of its\n\ndecision that \"[i]nasmuch as we are in agreement with the decision\n\nof the [IJ] as noted above, we adopt and affirm his decision.\"              The\n\nIJ's decision focused almost exclusively on Jiang's credibility.\n\nIt would not make sense for the BIA to state that it adopted the\n\nIJ's decision if it in fact did not even purport to address the\n\nmajority of that decision.         For all these reasons, we believe that\n\nthe BIA affirmed the IJ's credibility determination.6\n\n              When \"the BIA adopt[s] the IJ's credibility determination\n\nand decision, we review the IJ's decision as the adopted final\n\nagency determination.\"        Chen v.

We review the credibility determinations of the IJ or\n\nBIA under the substantial evidence standard and will uphold the\n\ncredibility determination \"'unless any reasonable adjudicator would\n\nbe    compelled    to   conclude   to   the    contrary.'\"    Kheireddine   v.\n\nGonzáles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201881\"><a href=\"/opinion/201881/kheireddine-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252\n\n(b)(4)(B)).       Often adverse credibility determinations are made as\n\na result of inconsistencies in a petitioner's testimony or the\n\n\n6\n   Jiang cites to several cases in her brief wherein the BIA did\nnot address the petitioner's credibility yet required certain\ncorroborative evidence. However, in those cases the BIA explicitly\nstated that it was either not addressing credibility or was\nassuming credibility.

In\n\nthe instant case, however, the IJ focused on aspects of Jiang's\n\ntestimony that he found inherently implausible.                     We have stated\n\nthat where adverse credibility findings are based on \"analysis of\n\ntestimony rather than on demeanor [such findings] deserve less than\n\nusual deference.\" Cordero-Trejo v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195749\"><a href=\"/opinion/195749/cordero-trejo-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n             We believe that some of the \"implausibilities\" identified\n\nby the IJ were adequately explained by Jiang in her testimony.                    For\n\nexample, the IJ found it \"curious\" that Jiang's family did not\n\ndiscuss the fact that Jiang's father was going into hiding, and\n\nthat Jiang's father was gone for four or five days before she\n\nnoticed his absence.         Jiang explained this by stating that her\n\nfather was often away for days at a time visiting friends and\n\nrelatives, so she thought nothing of his absence at first.                      Jiang\n\nfurther explained that her mother did not immediately tell her that\n\nher father had gone into hiding because she was still a child at\n\nthe   time   and   her   mother     did   not   want    her    to    worry.      This\n\nexplanation is plausible, in that parents often keep problems from\n\ntheir children.\n\n             However,    other     implausibilities      were       not   so   easily\n\nexplained.      For     example,    Jiang   stated     that   she     escaped    from\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fcaptivity when a typhoon broke a small window in her cell, so that\n\nshe was then able to climb through and jump to the ground below.\n\nAs the IJ noted, if Jiang were being held as she claimed, it is\n\nunlikely that she was being held in a room with a window which she\n\ncould access and escape through.            Further, if officers had taken\n\nJiang and she had escaped, it is highly likely that the officers\n\nwould   have   at   the   least   questioned    her   mother   about   Jiang's\n\nwhereabouts, put Jiang's mother under surveillance, or even put\n\nJiang's mother in detention. After all, the authorities would have\n\nstill been looking for Jiang's father, and would also want to find\n\nJiang, who had escaped.       It does not appear from the record that\n\nany of this ever occurred.          In fact, Jiang testified that her\n\nmother and sister still live in the same location in China, and\n\nneither has reported any problems to Jiang since she came to the\n\nUnited States.\n\n           Reviewing for substantial evidence, we are not compelled\n\nto conclude that the BIA and IJ erred in the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination.      While we think that certain aspects of Jiang's\n\ntestimony which the IJ found problematic were adequately explained\n\nby Jiang, other portions were not.            On the whole, Jiang's story\n\nsimply was not entirely credible and would have been greatly helped\n\nby corroborative evidence such as an affidavit from Jiang's mother\n\n(who was able to send a copy of the bookstore's business license to\n\nJiang). We therefore affirm the adverse credibility determination.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fB.    Past Persecution\n\n             The adverse credibility determination disposes of Jiang's\n\nclaim of past persecution.               However, we wish to note that, even\n\nassuming Jiang's testimony was credible, her experiences do not\n\nrise    to   the       level   of      past    persecution.7          \"To    qualify   as\n\npersecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering.\"                    Nelson v.

In   the    instant    case,\n\nalthough Jiang was allegedly detained for a week, she was fed every\n\nday and was never physically harmed in any way.                              We are not\n\ncompelled to find that her alleged experiences constituted past\n\npersecution.\n\nC.    Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n             Since Jiang has not proven past persecution, she is not\n\nentitled     to    a    presumption      of     a    well-founded     fear    of   future\n\npersecution.       However, she can still demonstrate a well-founded\n\nfear if she shows that her fear is \"both genuine and objectively\n\nreasonable.\"       Aguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 572.               Both the objective\n\nand    subjective       prongs    of    this    test    depend   on    an    applicant's\n\ncredibility.       To satisfy the subjective prong, the applicant must\n\n\n7\n    We believe this to be true even considering Jiang's age\n(sixteen) at the time of the events that allegedly occurred in\nChina.\n\n                                              -12-\n\fshow her fear is genuine.

To satisfy the objective prong, the\n\napplicant \"must show by credible evidence that her fear of future\n\npersecution is reasonable.\"    Laurent v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200882\"><a href=\"/opinion/200882/laurent-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           Jiang claims that the BIA failed to consider whether\n\nJiang had a well-founded fear of future persecution.      Jiang is\n\ncorrect that the BIA never explicitly stated that Jiang did not\n\nhave a well-founded fear.     However, the BIA did state that Jiang\n\nhad failed to carry her burden of proof for her asylum claim, and\n\nit gave as its main reason her lack of credibility and the need for\n\ncertain corroborative evidence.    The BIA's opinion certainly was\n\nnot a model of clarity, and, in a different situation, we might be\n\ncompelled to vacate its order.     See, e.g., Halo v. Gonzáles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201773\"><a href=\"/opinion/201773/halo-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (1st Cir. 2005) (vacating BIA's order where the BIA\n\ngave only a conclusory explanation for finding the petitioner did\n\nnot make sufficient showing of persecution to meet burden of\n\nproof).   In the instant case, however, we believe it is clear that\n\nthe BIA and IJ based their decisions on the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination. Consequently, Jiang cannot meet either prong of the\n\nwell-founded fear test.   We therefore find substantial evidence to\n\nsupport the BIA's denial of Jiang's asylum claim.8\n\n\n8\n   We also note that the fact that Jiang's mother and sister\ncontinue to live in China and have not reported any problems to\nJiang undercuts Jiang's claim of having a well-founded fear. See\n\n                                 -13-\n\f                        III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the BIA's denial of Jiang's\n\nasylum claims is supported by substantial evidence.   We deny the\n\npetition for review and affirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nAli v.
