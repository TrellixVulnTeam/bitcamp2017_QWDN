This   multi-district    consumer\n\naction   alleges    a   conspiracy   by     automobile     manufacturers   to\n\nillegally block lower-priced imports from Canada, which is alleged\n\nto have inflated the price of new cars sold in America.            We granted\n\nthis interlocutory appeal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n23(f) from the district court's certifications of (1) a nationwide\n\nplaintiff class seeking injunctive relief under section 16 of the\n\nClayton Act and Rule 23(b)(2), and (2) a class seeking damages\n\nunder the antitrust and consumer protection laws of twenty states\n\nand Rule 23(b)(3).\n\n           Interlocutory appeals from class certification under Rule\n\n23(f) are especially appropriate where the plaintiffs' theory is\n\nnovel or where a doubtful class certification results in financial\n\nexposure   to   defendants    so   great     as    to   provide   substantial\n\nincentives for defendants to settle non-meritorious cases in an\n\neffort to avoid both risk of liability and litigation expense.\n\nTardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2004); Waste Mgmt.\n\nHoldings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir. 2000); see\n\nalso West v. Prudential Sec., Inc., 282 F.3d 935, 937 (7th Cir.\n\n2002) (\"The effect of a class certification in inducing settlement\n\nto curtail the risk of large awards provides a powerful reason to\n\ntake an interlocutory appeal.\").           The defendants assert that the\n\namount at stake in the damages classes alone, counting treble\n\ndamages, could be as much as $3 billion, and these classes include\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\froughly thirteen million car purchasers.              There is no reliable\n\nmeans for measuring the size of the injunctive class, but it is\n\npotentially massive.1\n\n              By the same token, an erroneous failure to certify a\n\nclass where individual claims are small may deprive plaintiffs of\n\nthe only realistic mechanism to vindicate meritorious claims. See,\n\ne.g., Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 7 (citing Amchem Prods., Inc. v.\n\nWindsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997)).           All of these concerns are very\n\nmuch implicated here.\n\n              We summarize our holdings.       We reverse the certification\n\nof the injunctive class under the Clayton Act for lack of a live\n\ncontroversy and order dismissal of the claim.             Because there is no\n\njurisdiction under the Clayton Act, we remand to the district court\n\nfor determination of the several issues concerning the existence of\n\nfederal jurisdiction.       On the representation of the parties that\n\nthere is diversity jurisdiction over at least some of the state\n\ndamages claims, we review the certification of the damages classes.\n\nWe   vacate    that   certification;    the    district   court   is   free   to\n\nreconsider the class certification orders on a more complete\n\nrecord.\n\n\n      1\n          The district court observed that \"it is reasonable to\ninfer that the proposed federal injunctive class numbers in the\nmillions\"; the defendants have represented to the district court\nthat the proposed class includes \"more than a hundred million\nAmerican consumers.\"    In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export\nAntitrust Litig.

Before\n\ndescribing the class certification issues, we sketch the outline of\n\nthe underlying case.\n\n               The plaintiffs' claim is that from at least 2001 through\n\n2003, the currency exchange rate differential between the strong\n\nUnited States dollar and the cheaper Canadian dollar created\n\narbitrage opportunities2 in the gray market3 to sell lower-priced\n\nCanadian cars in the United States.             These arbitrage opportunities\n\narose from the difference between the price at which a broker could\n\nbuy a vehicle in Canada (plus the costs of exporting the vehicle to\n\nthe United States) and the price at which the broker could resell\n\nthe vehicle, whether to a dealer or consumer, in the United States.\n\nThese       arbitrage   opportunities    were    enhanced   by   liberal    trade\n\nagreements       and    the   harmonization      of   automotive   safety    and\n\nenvironmental standards between the two countries in the 1990s. As\n\na result, an exporter could make most new cars sold in Canada\n\nphysically indistinguishable from comparable models sold in the\n\nUnited States by replacing the speedometer and odometer with gauges\n\n\n     2\n          Arbitrage describes the practice of simultaneously buying\nand selling identical securities, currency, or other assets in\ndifferent markets, \"with the hope of profiting from the price\ndifference in those markets.\" Black's Law Dictionary 112 (8th ed.\n2004).\n        3\n          A gray market is one \"in which the seller uses legal but\nsometimes unethical methods to avoid a manufacturer's distribution\nchain and thereby sell goods (esp. imported goods) at prices lower\nthan those envisioned by the manufacturer.\" Black's Law Dictionary\n989 (8th ed. 2004).\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthat   measured     miles    instead    of     kilometers.        All   of   these\n\ncircumstances converged in what plaintiffs refer to as a \"perfect\n\nstorm\" of cross-border arbitrage opportunities.\n\n           Plaintiffs        allege          that    individual         automobile\n\nmanufacturers      engaged   in   business      practices,   both       legal   and\n\nillegal, designed to restrict the flow of Canadian cars into the\n\nUnited States. Manufacturers allegedly refused to honor warranties\n\non Canadian cars in the United States and discouraged dealers from\n\ninstalling domestic gauges on Canadian cars; they mandated \"no\n\nexport\" clauses in sales agreements between dealers and consumers\n\nand required Canadian dealers to conduct due diligence into whether\n\npotential customers were likely to export their cars out of Canada;\n\nand they withheld information about safety recalls from exporting\n\ncustomers.      Manufacturers     also       allegedly   imposed    disciplinary\n\nmeasures on Canadian dealers who sold to exporting customers. When\n\nCanadian cars were discovered in the United States, automakers\n\nwould impose a \"chargeback,\" a monetary penalty sometimes amounting\n\nto thousands of dollars, on the Canadian dealer who sold the car;\n\nmanufacturers threatened to withhold inventory of desirable models\n\nfrom   offending    dealerships;       and    they   threatened    to   terminate\n\ndealerships that sold to exporters.\n\n           Plaintiffs allege that these business practices had the\n\neffect of suppressing the supply of Canadian cars in the United\n\nStates. This stifling of supply led to increases in two key prices\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fin the domestic United States automobile market: the Manufacturer's\n\nSuggested Retail Price (\"MSRP\") and the dealer invoice price.   The\n\nMSRP represents the retail price presented to the public.       The\n\ndealer invoice price represents the manufacturer-determined net\n\nwholesale price to dealers.4   Both the MSRP and the list dealer\n\ninvoice price are determined annually by manufacturers and apply\n\nnationally.   Under plaintiffs' theory, these two prices in turn\n\ndefine the bargaining parameters for the price actually paid by\n\nconsumers.    Actual sales prices vary according to individual\n\nnegotiations between dealers and consumers, but plaintiffs assume\n\nthat negotiated prices fall within the range between the dealer\n\ninvoice price and the MSRP.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n           Plaintiffs distinguish between list and effective dealer\ninvoice prices.     The list dealer invoice price is determined\nannually for the national market by the manufacturers. Effective\ndealer invoice prices reflect dealer- or region- specific\nincentives provided by the manufacturers. Similarly, the effective\nMSRP takes into account direct manufacturer-to-consumer incentives,\nsuch as cash back offers.        This distinction is crucial to\nplaintiffs' theory of antitrust impact.\n\n                               -8-\n\f              Defendants5 take the position that the business practices\n\ndescribed above amount to vertical restraints between manufacturers\n\nand   their    dealers   that   do   not      violate   the   antitrust    laws.\n\nPlaintiffs, however, allege that defendants violated section 1 of\n\nthe Sherman Act by conspiring to coordinate their anti-export\n\nbusiness practices across the industry in response to increased\n\narbitrage     opportunities     after    2000.     Plaintiffs     allege    that\n\ndefendants accomplished the illegal conspiracy over the course of\n\nseveral meetings and through dissemination of best practices and\n\nother information through the dealer associations.              These illegal\n\nhorizontal agreements allegedly enhanced the effectiveness of the\n\nextant legal vertical restraints. According to plaintiffs' theory,\n\n\"but for\" the illegal horizontal conspiracy and its suppression of\n\ninter-brand competition, American consumers would have paid lower\n\nprices and have thus suffered antitrust-type injury.\n\n              For example, the plaintiffs allege that Ford's 2002\n\nWindstar LX minivan had an MSRP of $16,448 (USD) in Canada and\n\n$22,340 (USD) in the United States -- a difference of 26%.                   The\n\n\n      5\n          Defendants on appeal include Ford Motor Company, Ford\nMotor Company of Canada, Ltd., General Motors Corp., General Motors\nof Canada, Ltd., Honda Motor Co., Honda Canada, Inc., Nissan North\nAmerica, Inc., Chrysler LLC, Chrysler Motors LLC, Chrysler Canada\nInc., and Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC.     In addition, the plaintiffs\nnamed two automobile dealers' associations, the domestic National\nAutomobile Dealers Association (\"NADA\") and the Canadian Automobile\nDealers Association (\"CADA\"). Two automakers originally named as\ndefendants are no longer in the case: Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A.,\nInc. entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs, and\nplaintiffs voluntarily dismissed BMW of North America, LLC.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fMSRP for a 2002 Lexus SC430 was 13% lower in Canada than in the\n\nUnited States.   Plaintiffs claim that if the car-makers had not\n\nconspired to impede arbitrageurs from exporting Canadian cars to\n\nthe United States, the manufacturers could not maintain these\n\npricing gaps and instead would have been forced to compete by\n\nlowering prices across the United States.\n\n           To summarize, plaintiffs' theory of antitrust impact\n\noperates in two stages.         In the first stage, the horizontal\n\nconspiracy   allowed   the   manufacturers   to   maintain   artificially\n\ninflated national MSRPs and dealer invoice prices within the United\n\nStates.   In the second stage, the higher official pricing resulted\n\nin higher purchase prices paid by individual consumers.\n\n           Throughout the proceedings in the district court, the\n\ndefendants have denied any conspiracy.       They have also argued that\n\neven if such a conspiracy existed, it would not have impacted the\n\ndomestic market in any case due to the effects of the entirely\n\nlegal vertical restraints.6       Defendants have also argued that\n\ncontrary to plaintiffs' theory, there would have been no flood of\n\nCanadian cars into the United States given the number of new cars\n\nsold in Canada, the limited opportunities for arbitrage, and the\n\nsmall size and spottiness of the gray market.         Defendants assert\n\nthat even if there were some impact on MSRPs and dealer invoice\n\n\n     6\n          The district court has not decided this issue, deeming it\na merits inquiry that it would be premature to resolve at the class\ncertification stage. Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at 131 n.10.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fprices in the American market, there was no widespread antitrust\n\nimpact on consumers, and plaintiffs have no viable theory to show\n\neither causation or damages that would apply to the plaintiff\n\nclasses.\n\n                                      II.\n\n              Nationwide Injunctive Relief Plaintiff Class\n\n             Defendants challenge the certification of the injunctive\n\nclass on the basis that plaintiffs lack standing to sue for\n\ninjunctive relief under the federal antitrust laws.                 Because\n\nstanding is a threshold consideration, the resolution of which may\n\nrender subsequent arguments irrelevant, we discuss it first.7\n\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498-99 (1975).\n\n             Plaintiffs seek federal injunctive relief pursuant to\n\nsection 16 of the Clayton Act on behalf of a nationwide class under\n\nRule 23(b)(2) for alleged violations of section 1 of the Sherman\n\nAct.       Section   16   makes   available   injunctive   relief   \"against\n\nthreatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws.\"\n\n15 U.S.C. § 26; see also Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc.,\n\n\n\n       7\n          Plaintiffs object that defendants cannot raise a standing\nchallenge to the Rule 23(b)(2) class on appeal because they failed\nto present the argument to the district court. For their part,\ndefendants claim they previously raised the issue in oral argument.\nEither way, courts must be vigilant about compliance with standing\nrequirements regardless of what the parties argue, see Pagán v.\nCalderón, 448 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 2006), and must remain so\nthroughout the entire life cycle of a case.       See generally II\nAreeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 335b, at 289 (2d ed. 2000).\nThe issue has not been waived.\n\n                                     -11-\n\f479 U.S. 104, 110-11 (1986).             Plaintiffs allege that injunctive\n\nrelief is necessary because the conspiracy is ongoing and will\n\ncontinue unless enjoined by the court.\n\n          Specifically, plaintiffs seek an injunction that would\n\nrequire defendants to honor warranties in the United States on all\n\nnew motor vehicles sold in Canada; enjoin the defendants from\n\nblacklisting    Canadian     exporters;         enjoin    the     defendants      from\n\nexchanging     certain     information          with   each      other,    including\n\nblacklists     and   methods       for     avoiding      export     sales;       enjoin\n\nchargebacks to Canadian dealers; enjoin the tracking of Canadian\n\ncars' Vehicle Identification Numbers (\"VINs\"); enjoin American\n\nmanufacturers    from    penalizing        American    dealers     for     buying    or\n\nselling Canadian vehicles; enjoin the Canadian Automobile Dealers'\n\nAssociation     (\"CADA\")     and     the     National         Automobile       Dealers'\n\nAssociation    (\"NADA\")     from    discouraging         or    acting     to   prevent\n\nCanadian exports; and enjoin the defendants from withholding safety\n\nrecall information based on a vehicle's export status.                           Motor\n\nVehicles IV, 2006 WL 623591, at *1-2.\n\n          On March 10, 2006, the district court issued an order\n\ncertifying a nationwide injunctive class under Rule 23(b)(2).8                      Id.\n\n\n     8\n          The court found the injunctive relief class met the\nrequirements of Rule 23(a) -- numerosity, commonality, typicality,\nand adequacy -- then turned to the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); Motor Vehicles IV, 2006 WL 623591, at *2-6.\nRule 23(b)(2) allows for class actions when \"the party opposing the\nclass has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally\nto the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding\n\n                                         -12-\n\fat *1.   In doing so, the court noted that a national injunction was\n\nthe only relief available to members of the proposed class who\n\nreside in twenty-seven states because the court had previously\n\ndismissed a proposed nationwide class for damages under the federal\n\nantitrust laws as well as state-law damages claims for all but\n\ntwenty-three states and the District of Columbia.   Id. at *7.   The\n\ndistrict court has, with the agreement of the parties, stayed\n\ndetermination of class notice issues pending this appeal.\n\n           The district court addressed the scope of standing to\n\nseek injunctive relief under section 16 of the Clayton Act in the\n\ncourse of analyzing the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3).\n\nMotor Vehicles IV, 2006 WL 623591, at *3-4.   Defendants had argued\n\nthat some named plaintiffs did not have standing to sue for an\n\ninjunction because not all named plaintiffs actually paid an\n\novercharge due to the alleged conspiracy, and some actually paid\n\nless because of it.   Id. at *3.\n\n           The court correctly held that a plaintiff seeking relief\n\nunder section 16 need not show actual antitrust damages but only a\n\n\"threatened loss or damage.\"   15 U.S.C. § 26; see also Cargill, 479\n\n\ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\"\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). The court held that the defendants fall\nwithin the language of Rule 23(b)(2) because they had acted or\nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class. Motor\nVehicles IV, 2006 WL 623591, at *7. The court further held that\nthe proposed class satisfied the rule's requirement that injunctive\nrelief be \"appropriate . . . with respect to the class as a whole.\"\nId. at *7-10.\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fU.S. at 111; Ocean State Physicians Health Plan, Inc. v. Blue Cross\n\n& Blue Shield of R.I., 883 F.2d 1101, 1106 (1st Cir. 1989).              This\n\nin turn means that the requirements for standing for injunctive\n\nrelief are less stringent than those under section 4 of the Clayton\n\nAct, 15 U.S.C. § 15, for standing to pursue damages claims.                  Cia\n\nPetrolera Caribe, Inc. v.

Co.\n\nv. Cont'l Group, Inc., 596 F.2d 573, 591 (3rd Cir. 1979) (quoting\n\nZenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 130\n\n(1969)) (internal quotation marks omitted).            The threatened injury\n\nmust be an injury for which the plaintiff would be entitled to\n\ncompensation if the injury actually occurred. Cargill, 479 U.S. at\n\n110-13.     There is no doubt that the types of injuries alleged here\n\n-- consumers paying artificially inflated prices due to antitrust\n\nviolations -- are antitrust injuries.            Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,\n\n442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979); see also Motor Vehicles IV, 2006 WL\n\n623591,     at   *3    (\"Higher   prices   for   consumers   resulting   from\n\nantitrust violations are antitrust injuries.\").\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f            The district court rejected the defendants' standing\n\nargument, reasoning that whether or not the named plaintiffs\n\nsuffered an actual overcharge, \"[t]hey confront or confronted a\n\nthreatened    loss     or    damage   resulting    from    restrictions   on\n\ncompetition . . . [that] the antitrust laws were designed to\n\nprevent.\"     Id.     at    *4.   The   district   court    relied   on   two\n\npropositions that are now called into question.            First, the court\n\nreasoned that \"whether exchange rates during some periods [within\n\nthe class period] temporarily made Canadian cars more expensive and\n\ntherefore not price competitive, does not affect the standing of\n\nthese plaintiffs to seek an injunction against continuation of such\n\na conspiracy.\"9      Id. (emphasis added).    Second, the court noted in\n\nan opinion now two years old that \"[t]here is no indication that\n\nexchange-related arbitrage opportunities have permanently ended.\"\n\nId.\n\n            As the defendants point out on appeal, the standing issue\n\nemanates from Article III's requirement that there remain a live\n\ncase or controversy throughout the course of a litigation.           Golden\n\nv. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 108-09 (1969).            If a named plaintiff\n\n\n      9\n          The district court noted the defendants' position that\nbecause the complained-of export restrictions operated to restrict\nthe flow of American cars into Canada as well as vice versa,\nconsumers buying cars in the United States during periods when the\nvalue of the Canadian dollar and the prices of Canadian cars rose\nwere actually protected from higher domestic prices. Plaintiffs'\nexpert conceded that the defendants' two-way restrictions could\nprotect American consumers in such a scenario. Motor Vehicles IV,\n2006 WL 623591, at *3 n.23.\n\n                                      -15-\n\ffails to establish such a continuing controversy, she normally may\n\nnot invoke the power of the federal courts to seek relief on her\n\nown behalf or that of other members of a putative class.      O'Shea v.\n\nLittleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974); see also Sosna v. Iowa, 419\n\nU.S. 393, 402 (1975) (\"There must not only be a named plaintiff who\n\nhas . . . a case or controversy at the time the complaint is filed,\n\nand at the time the class action is certified by the District Court\n\n. . . but there must be a live controversy at the time this Court\n\nreviews the case.\"). Under certain circumstances, a court may find\n\nthat the requisite controversy exists \"between a named defendant\n\nand a member of the class represented by the named plaintiff, even\n\nthough the claim of the named plaintiff has become moot\" due to\n\nthat plaintiff's individual circumstances. Sosna, 419 U.S. at 402.\n\n          The defendants contend that even if the named plaintiffs\n\nhad standing to seek injunctive relief at some time in the past,\n\ncircumstances have changed such that there is no longer a live\n\ncontroversy between named plaintiffs and the defendants to bolster\n\nplaintiffs' standing to seek injunctive relief.       We agree.\n\n          Section   16's   requirement   of   \"threatened   injury,\"   15\n\nU.S.C. § 26, dovetails with Article III's requirement that in order\n\nto obtain forward-looking relief, a plaintiff must face a threat of\n\ninjury that is both \"'real and immediate,' not 'conjectural' or\n\n'hypothetical.'\" O'Shea, 414 U.S. at 494 (quoting Golden, 394 U.S.\n\nat 109-10).   \"Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fshow a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief\n\n. . . if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.\"\n\nId. at 495-96.\n\n             As with the other elements of standing, it is plaintiffs\n\nwho,   by    invoking     federal     jurisdiction,       bear     the    burden       of\n\nestablishing the presence of a threat of injury.                  McInnis-Misenor\n\nv. Me. Med. Ctr., 319 F.3d 63, 67 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Bennett\n\nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167-68 (1997)).                    \"There must be some\n\nimmediacy or imminence to the threatened injury.\"                         Id. at 68\n\n(citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02 (1983)).\n\n             Plaintiffs    have      failed    to   establish      the    continuing\n\npresence of the requisite threatened injury.                   The \"perfect storm\"\n\nthat allegedly precipitated massive arbitrage opportunities for\n\nselling     Canadian    cars   in    the   United    States     ceased    long     ago.\n\nPlaintiffs' theory of antitrust violation posits that exceptional\n\narbitrage     opportunities     arose      early    in   this    decade   due     to    a\n\ncombination of relaxed trade restrictions between the United States\n\nand Canada, physical harmonization of cars manufactured for the two\n\nmarkets, and a differential between the values of American and\n\nCanadian     currencies.       The    last     factor    has    varied    since     the\n\nbeginning of the class period, and plaintiffs themselves measure\n\nwindows of actual arbitrage opportunity in large part according to\n\nundulations in exchange rates.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f          After the district court certified the injunctive class,\n\nit ordered the parties to make submissions regarding proposed end\n\ndates for the damages classes.      Plaintiffs' expert submitted an\n\naffidavit indicating that arbitrage opportunities for Canadian cars\n\nsignificant enough to impact United States prices for new vehicles\n\nended in May 2003.   The district court accordingly adopted April\n\n30, 2003 as the endpoint for the state damages classes.       Motor\n\nVehicles VI, 241 F.R.D. at 79.   Plaintiffs have not made any effort\n\nsince the district court's ruling to demonstrate whether or when\n\nprevailing conditions -- primarily, exchange rates between Canada\n\nand the United States -- might reasonably be expected once again to\n\nresemble those during the class period.    This is for good reason,\n\nas the value of the United States dollar relative to the Canadian\n\ndollar in the years 1998-2003 hit an apex unseen in at least the\n\nlast half century.10 In the nearly five years since April 2003, the\n\ntime at which plaintiffs concede actual injury to the damages\n\nclasses abated, the exchange rate has fallen in favor of the\n\n\n     10\n          We take judicial notice of these undisputed facts.\nBetween 1950 and the present, it has generally cost between $0.96\nand $1.40 Canadian dollar (\"CAD\") to purchase one United States\ndollar (\"USD\"). During that period, the exchange rate has risen\nsignificantly above $1.40 CAD to $1.00 USD only once for any length\nof time. This occurred between the years 1998 and 2003, when the\nrate ranged between $1.40 and $1.61        CAD to $1.00 USD.     5E\nHistorical Statistics of the United States 5-572 to 5-574 (S.\nCarter et al. eds., 2006); Federal Reserve Statistical Release:\nH i s t o r i c a l       R a t e s       f o r      C a n a d a ,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/hist/dat00_ca.htm. This\ndeviation corresponds with the period during which plaintiffs'\nalleged arbitrage opportunities occurred.\n\n                                 -18-\n\fCanadian dollar.11       In the circumstances of this case, that alone\n\neliminates any realistic current threat.\n\n                The speculative nature of the claim that exchange rates\n\ncould     one    day   create   additional   arbitrage   opportunities   is\n\nreinforced by a second contingency inherent in the plaintiffs'\n\ntheory of threatened future harm. In order for antitrust injury to\n\nbefall a class member, she must also intend to purchase a new car\n\nat a time when arbitrage opportunities are ripe for exploitation.\n\nThe district court certified an injunctive class defined as \"[a]ll\n\npersons . . . who purchased or leased or intended to purchase or\n\nlease a new motor vehicle manufactured by a defendant from a United\n\nStates dealer during the period from January 1, 2001, to March 10,\n\n2006.\"     The complaint names thirty-six individuals who bought or\n\nleased new cars in the United States during the class period.\n\nNowhere, however, does the complaint make any allegation regarding\n\na named plaintiff's intention to buy or lease another new vehicle\n\nwithin such a time frame as could be deemed imminent.            The fact\n\nthat the injunctive class has been restricted to a period of time\n\n\n\n\n     11\n          The exchange rate on April 30, 2003 was $1.43 CAD to\n$1.00 USD, and as of publication of this opinion, the exchange rate\nhas not once returned to that level. Instead, the relative value\nof the domestic dollar has been in more or less steady decline. On\nSeptember 28, 2007, the value of the Canadian dollar surpassed that\nof the United States dollar. As of February 1, 2008, the exchange\nrate was $0.90 CAD to $1.00 USD.

Maine Medical Center, this court\n\ninquired whether the plaintiff faced an \"immedia[te] or imminen[t]\"\n\nthreat of injury that would support standing in federal court. 319\n\nF.3d at 68.    We held that standing was lacking where any possible\n\ninjury to the plaintiff was \"contingent on several events which may\n\nor may not happen.\"    Id. at 72.   Here, there is nothing to suggest\n\nthat any named plaintiff harbors an \"imminent\" intention to buy a\n\nnew car in coincidence with another \"perfect storm\" of arbitrage-\n\nfriendly market conditions.\n\n            Plaintiffs attempt to revive the controversy by arguing\n\nthat the defendants' conspiracy to hinder cross-border sales is\n\nongoing.    Even if this were true, the argument ignores the point\n\nthat the relevant question is whether plaintiffs suffer a realistic\n\nthreat of injury stemming from those alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAn antitrust violation and standing are distinct and independently\n\nnecessary prerequisites for the relief sought by the injunctive\n\nclass.    See II Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 335f, at 297 (2d\n\ned. 2000); cf. SAS of P.R., Inc. v. P.R. Tel. Co., 48 F.3d 39, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            The Rule 23(b)(2) class is vacated for lack of a live\n\ncontroversy between the parties such as would justify an injunctive\n\nremedy.    The injunctive relief claim is dismissed.\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f                                   III.\n\n           Jurisdiction over Remaining Plaintiff Classes\n\n           The claim for injunctive relief under the Clayton Act\n\nprovided the federal jurisdictional spine of this case. That basis\n\nfor federal jurisdiction is now gone, and the question of federal\n\njurisdiction over the state-law damages claims presents itself. It\n\nmay be that the district court could retain jurisdiction over the\n\nstate damages claims on either of two theories, but we leave it to\n\nthe   district    court   to   decide     on   remand   whether   there   is\n\njurisdiction.12\n\n           The parties and the district court have referred to\n\ndiversity, see 28 U.S.C. § 1332,13 as a basis for maintaining the\n\nstate damages classes in federal court.            To this point in the\n\nproceedings, however, the state damages claims have been analyzed\n\nas within the court's supplemental jurisdiction based on the\n\npresence of the federal claim.      See, e.g., Motor Vehicles II, 335\n\n\n\n      12\n          Although the defendants challenge plaintiffs' standing to\nmaintain the injunctive class, neither side addressed to this court\nany of the jurisdictional issues that might arise in the event that\nwe vacated the federal injunctive class.     We do not purport to\nraise an exhaustive checklist of questions to address on remand,\nbut advert to some salient issues.\n      13\n          The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (\"CAFA\"), Pub. L.\n109-2, 119 Stat. at 4 (amending 28 U.S.C. § 1332) was enacted after\nthe complaints in this action were filed.        The existence of\ndiversity jurisdiction must therefore, under the express terms of\nthe CAFA, be determined under the pre-CAFA diversity statute. See\nCAFA § 9, 119 Stat. 14 (\"[CAFA] shall apply to any civil action\ncommenced on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\").\n\n                                   -21-\n\fF. Supp. 2d 126.14       Whether the diversity basis is sound has not\n\nbeen tested.\n\n           At    oral    argument,   the    defendants    pointed    out   that\n\nproceeding on the basis of diversity jurisdiction would require\n\nanalysis of each individual state-based class.               Defendants also\n\nconceded that diversity could provide an independent basis for\n\nfederal jurisdiction for at least some of the state-law damages\n\nclasses.   The district court has not had the opportunity to assess\n\nwhether each state class satisfies the requirements of § 1332 and\n\nmay do so on remand.\n\n           The district court may, in the alternative, consider\n\nwhether    to    exercise    its     discretion    to     continue     exerting\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1367, over the state\n\ndamages claims.     See Rodríguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d\n\n1168, 1177 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"In an appropriate situation, a federal\n\ncourt may retain [supplemental] jurisdiction over state-law claims\n\nnotwithstanding    the    early    demise   of   all    foundational    federal\n\nclaims.\").      In weighing this option, the district court should\n\n\n\n     14\n          In its September 7, 2004 order addressing supplemental\njurisdiction over the state-law claims, the district court in\naddition asserted pendent personal jurisdiction over certain\nCanadian defendants based on the personal jurisdiction created by\nthe federal antitrust claim. Motor Vehicles II, 335 F. Supp. 2d at\n128; see also In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust\nLitig., 307 F. Supp. 2d 145, 147-48 (D. Me. 2004) (finding personal\njurisdiction over certain Canadian defendants). To the extent that\nthe district court relied on the existence of the federal claim,\npersonal jurisdiction may yet be an issue on remand.\n\n                                     -22-\n\fconsider \"the totality of the attendant circumstances,\" including\n\nconsiderations of judicial economy, fairness to the parties, and\n\nthe nature of the applicable state law.

Mowbray, 208 F.3d at\n\n295.    This standard has teeth:\n\n            An abuse occurs when a court, in making a\n            discretionary ruling, relies upon an improper\n            factor, omits consideration of a factor entitled\n            to substantial weight, or mulls the correct mix\n            of factors but makes a clear error of judgment in\n            assaying them.    An abuse of discretion also\n            occurs if the court adopts an incorrect legal\n            rule.\n\nId. (citation omitted).    Furthermore, a class certification appeal\n\n\"can pose pure issues of law reviewed de novo.\"    Tardiff, 365 F.3d\n\nat 4.    Review of mixed questions of law and fact varies from non-\n\ndeferential review for law-dominated issues to deferential clear-\n\nerror review for fact-dominated ones.     In re PolyMedica Corp. Sec.\n\nLitig. (PolyMedica), 432 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Johnson\n\nv. Watts Regulator Co., 63 F.3d 1129, 1132 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\n            Intertwined with the scope of our review on appeal is the\n\nquestion of how far a district court should go in testing legal and\n\n                                   -23-\n\ffactual premises at the class certification stage.         When such\n\npremises are disputed, the court may \"probe behind the pleadings,\"\n\nGen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982), to\n\n\"formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out\"\n\nin order to assess whether the proposed class meets the legal\n\nrequirements for certification, Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 298.          In\n\nshort, \"a court has the power to test disputed premises [at the\n\ncertification stage] if and when the class action would be proper\n\non one premise but not another.\"   Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 4-5.    Here,\n\nthe premises are challenged as to both steps of plaintiffs' theory.\n\n          In   performing   this   predictive   function     and   in\n\n\"[e]xercising its broad discretion, . . . the district court must\n\nevaluate the plaintiff's evidence . . . critically without allowing\n\nthe defendant to turn the class-certification proceeding into an\n\nunwieldy trial on the merits.\"        PolyMedica, 432 F.3d at 17.\n\nHowever, as both we and other circuit courts have emphasized,\n\nweighing whether to certify a plaintiff class may inevitably\n\noverlap with some critical assessment regarding the merits of the\n\ncase.   See, e.g., Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Credit Suisse\n\nFirst Boston (USA), Inc., 482 F.3d 372, 380 (5th Cir. 2007), cert.\n\ndenied, ___ U.S. ___, 2008 WL 169504 (Jan. 22, 2008).   It would be\n\ncontrary to the \"rigorous analysis of the prerequisites established\n\nby Rule 23 before certifying a class\" to put blinders on as to an\n\nissue simply because it implicates the merits of the case.

Motor Vehicles I, 307 F. Supp. 2d at 137.         Illinois\n\nBrick embodies a policy judgment that the reach of damages for\n\nfederal     antitrust   violations    does   not   extend   to   indirect\n\npurchasers, even if they have suffered some impact in fact.        See II\n\nAreeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 395, at 554-55.\n\n            After dismissal of the federal damages claim, plaintiffs\n\nfiled a second amended complaint which added damages claims under\n\ncommon and statutory law for all fifty states and the District of\n\nColumbia.

After\n\nconsidering for each disputed state15 whether plaintiffs had pled\n\nfacts sufficient to state a claim under that state's laws, the\n\n\n     15\n          The defendants did not move to dismiss all the state\nclaims, and the plaintiffs consented to the dismissal of some of\nthe state claims. Motor Vehicles III, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 168, 175.\n\n                                 -25-\n\fdistrict court dismissed the state law damages claims for all but\n\ntwenty-three states and the District of Columbia.          Id. at 168.      The\n\npropriety of that dismissal is not now before us.              This appeal is\n\nfrom three orders that did certify state damages classes.\n\n            Before discovery was completed, the plaintiffs moved on\n\nJuly 29, 2005, to certify six exemplar classes of state damages\n\nclaims.16   On May 12, 2006, the court preliminarily certified five\n\nof the six exemplar state damages classes under Rule 23(b)(3) and\n\nasked for additional materials regarding the date on which the\n\nclass period should end.       Motor Vehicles IV, 235 F.R.D. at 129.17\n\nOn March 21, 2007, the court issued a supplemental order concluding\n\nthat the class period for the state damages claims should end on\n\nApril 30, 2003, and certifying fifteen additional state damages\n\nclasses for a total of twenty.           Motor Vehicles VI, 241 F.R.D. at\n\n79,   84.    On   June   15,   2007,    the   court   issued   an   order   and\n\nexplanatory memorandum under Rule 23(c)(1)(B) defining the class\n\nand class claims, issues, and defenses.           Motor Vehicles VII, 243\n\nF.R.D. 17; Motor Vehicles VIII, 243 F.R.D. 20.\n\n\n\n\n      16\n          The district court had requested, in a March 15, 2005\norder, that each side designate three exemplar states.         The\nplaintiffs selected Maine, Kansas, and Vermont, and the defendants\nchose California, New Mexico, and Tennessee.\n      17\n          The Kansas class was not certified because plaintiffs\nconceded that the class representative had not in fact been injured\nby the alleged conspiracy and thus lacked standing. Motor Vehicles\nV, 235 F.R.D. at 131.\n\n                                       -26-\n\f            1.      Requirements for Class Certification\n\n            To certify the statewide damages classes, the district\n\ncourt had to evaluate whether the four threshold requirements of\n\nRule 23(a) were met, as well as whether Rule 23(b)(3)'s two\n\nadditional prerequisites were satisfied.        Amchem, 521 U.S. at 614;\n\nSmilow, 323 F.3d at 38.      Rule 23(a) requires that (1) there be\n\nnumerosity, (2) there be common questions of law or fact, (3) the\n\nclass representative's claims be typical of the class, and (4) the\n\nrepresentative's representation of the class be adequate.         Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 23(a).     To certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), a judge\n\nmust further find \"that the questions of law or fact common to\n\nclass    members   predominate   over   any   questions   affecting   only\n\nindividual members\" (\"predominance\"), and that \"a class action is\n\nsuperior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently\n\nadjudicating the controversy\" (\"superiority\").            Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n23(b)(3).     In classes certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the Rules\n\n\"invite[] a close look at the case before it is accepted as a class\n\naction.\"    Amchem, 521 U.S. at 615 (quoting B. Kaplan, Continuing\n\nWork of the Civil Committee: 1966 Amendments of the Federal Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure (I), 81 Harv. L. Rev. 356, 390 (1967)).\n\n            The court held that numerosity was not disputed and that\n\nadequacy was established.        Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at 130,\n\n141.    It also concluded that a class action was by far the superior\n\nmethod for proceeding.      Id. at 148.       The real dispute revolved\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\faround whether common evidence could be used to prove the impact of\n\nthe alleged conspiracy on U.S. consumers (\"common impact\") and any\n\nresulting damages (\"common proof of damages\").         Id. at 129, 132.18\n\nThe court noted it did not yet have enough evidence to determine\n\nthe merits question of whether the plaintiff classes actually\n\nsuffered antitrust or consumer protection injury.          It repeatedly\n\nemphasized it would address that question later on a proper record\n\n-- for example, at summary judgment.19     Id. at 131, 136, 139.\n\n           As the district court noted, there is some overlap among\n\nthe   certification   criteria   of     commonality,    Rule   23(a)(2),\n\n\n      18\n          To establish an antitrust claim, plaintiffs typically\nmust prove (1) a violation of the antitrust laws, (2) an injury\nthey suffered as a result of that violation, and (3) an estimated\nmeasure of damages. Sullivan v. Nat'l Football League, 34 F.3d\n1091, 1103 (1st Cir. 1994). For a class action to be appropriate,\n\"plaintiffs need to demonstrate that common issues prevail as to\n[both] the existence of a conspiracy and the fact of injury.\"\nBlades v. Monsanto Co., 400 F.3d 562, 566 (8th Cir. 2005).      If\nthese two elements are established by common proof, the measure of\ndamages can sometimes be left to individual proof, as we discuss\nfurther below.\n          The element of injury in the antitrust context is often\nreferred to as \"impact\" or \"fact of damage.\" Alabama v. Blue Bird\nBody Co., 573 F.2d 309, 317 & n.18 (5th Cir. 1978). It is the\ncausal link between the antitrust violation and the damages sought\nby plaintiffs. Sullivan, 34 F.3d at 1103. It thus requires both\ninjury-in-fact and a showing that the injury is the result of the\nantitrust activity. Cordes & Co. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. A.G. Edwards\n& Sons, Inc., 502 F.3d 91, 106 (2d Cir. 2007).\n      19\n          The court reiterated in its March 21, 2007 order that it\nwould not \"make a final determination of the existence of antitrust\nimpact at the certification stage.\" Motor Vehicles VI, 241 F.R.D.\nat 80 (emphasis added).     \"Whether an illegal agreement halting\nCanadian imports (or removing their threat) produced antitrust\ncausation or retail purchase price impact remains to be proven at\ntrial or demonstrated at summary judgment.\" Id. at 82 n.5.\n\n                                 -28-\n\ftypicality, Rule 23(a)(3), and predominance, Rule 23(b)(3). Id. at\n\n130 n.4 (\"[I]f the proof of impact is not common across the class,\n\nthen not only is the named plaintiffs' claim of injury not typical,\n\nbut the predominance assessment is also affected.\"); see also\n\nAmchem, 521 U.S. at 623 n.18 (predominance and typicality are\n\nsimilar in some respects); 6 A. Conte & H.B. Newberg, Newberg on\n\nClass Actions § 18:8, at 24 n.2 (4th ed. 2002).   The questions in\n\nthis case of common impact (antitrust-type causation) and common\n\nproof of damages are relevant to all three criteria.\n\n          Rule 23(a)'s requirement of commonality is a low bar, and\n\ncourts have generally given it a \"permissive application.\" 7A C.A.\n\nWright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1763, at 221 (3d\n\ned. 2005).    The district court did not have trouble finding\n\nsufficient commonality in this case.     The court pointed to the\n\ncommon questions of whether there was a conspiracy; if so, whether\n\nit affected either dealer invoice prices or MSRPs; and whether\n\nthere was any violation of state antitrust or consumer protection\n\nlaws.   Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at 130; see also 6 Conte &\n\nNewberg, supra, § 18:5, at 14 & n.3 (gathering cases that hold that\n\n\"allegations concerning the existence, scope, and efficacy of an\n\nalleged conspiracy present questions adequately common to class\n\nmembers to satisfy the commonality requirement\").\n\n          \"[T]he predominance criterion is far more demanding,\"\n\nhowever, than the commonality requirement.    Amchem, 521 U.S. at\n\n\n                               -29-\n\f624.      Under the predominance inquiry, \"a district court must\n\nformulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out\n\nin   order      to   determine   whether     common   or    individual    issues\n\npredominate in a given case.\"              Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 298.         In\n\nantitrust class actions, common issues do not predominate if the\n\nfact of antitrust violation and the fact of antitrust impact cannot\n\nbe established through common proof.            See Blades v. Monsanto Co.,\n\n400 F.3d 562, 566 (8th Cir. 2005).           The district court did not find\n\npredominance and typicality as easily established as commonality.\n\nThe court chose to analyze under the heading of typicality whether\n\nplaintiffs were asserting sufficiently common proof of impact,\n\nMotor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at 130-40, and it considered under the\n\nheading    of     predominance   whether     any   resulting    damages    would\n\nlikewise be established by sufficiently common proof, id. at 142-\n\n45. In consideration of these issues, the district court relied on\n\nthe submissions of the parties' experts.\n\n             2.        Submissions of Expert Witnesses\n\n             Plaintiffs relied primarily on their expert Professor\n\nRobert E. Hall of Stanford University and the Hoover Institute,\n\nwho, along with the defense expert, assumed that plaintiffs'\n\nallegations of conspiracy were true.               In his July 2005 report,\n\nProfessor     Hall    noted   that   collectively     the   defendants'    sales\n\naccounted for 89% of the U.S. market and 84% of the Canadian\n\nmarket.      He concluded that \"if defendants were unable to impose\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\fexport restraints or were less effective in imposing them, they\n\nwould [have] lower[ed] U.S. [dealer] invoice prices and MSRPs for\n\nmost, if not all, of their vehicles.\"           Expert Report of Robert E.\n\nHall,   Ph.D.    ¶   51.    Even    though     retail   sales    of   cars   are\n\nindividually negotiated, Professor Hall opined that class members\n\nwould have experienced common impact from the changed MSRPs and\n\ndealer invoice prices because a change in these prices would shift\n\nthe entire negotiating range, benefitting (or harming) essentially\n\nall consumers.\n\n           Professor       Hall    initially     proposed       two   different\n\napproaches to establishing common evidence of damages to class\n\nmembers.        The first approach would be to rely on statistical\n\nmodels (\"Nash equilibriums\") used in the auto industry to predict\n\nmarket outcomes.      Under his second approach, a benchmark method,\n\nthe U.S.-Canadian market would be evaluated against a comparable\n\nmarket not affected by the challenged conduct.              Both approaches,\n\nProfessor Hall asserted, would account for \"heterogeneity across\n\nvehicles, dealers, consumers, and time, [and] they can be used to\n\nidentify cars or time periods for which there are no damages.\"               Id.\n\n¶ 62.   Professor Hall also asserted that data existed that would\n\nallow him to implement these models, though the most detailed data\n\nwere in the hands of defendants.\n\n           The defense expert, Professor Joseph P. Kalt of Harvard\n\nUniversity, filed his expert report on September 30, 2005.                   Even\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\fassuming a conspiracy, he disputed that there was any common impact\n\non   either    the   national   manufacturer-to-dealer   prices   or   the\n\nindividual dealer-to-consumer sales.        His critique focused on a\n\ndescription of the actual gray market for Canadian vehicles in the\n\nUnited States, which he asserted was spotty, erratic, and too\n\ninsignificant to affect the national market, even absent any\n\ncollusive activity.       He also criticized Professor Hall for not\n\ndistinguishing between the effects of the manufacturers' legal\n\nvertical restraints and those of the alleged horizontal conspiracy.\n\nAs to damages, he disputed that there were any common methods of\n\nproof and asserted that Professor Hall's suggested approach of\n\nemploying Nash equilibriums was just \"an empty phrase.\"           Expert\n\nReport of Joseph P. Kalt, Ph.D. 63-64.\n\n              In reply to Professor Kalt's critique, Professor Hall\n\nsubmitted a rebuttal report on December 20, 2005.         He took issue\n\nwith Professor Kalt's conclusions regarding the gray market20 and,\n\napplying regression analysis to Professor Kalt's data on arbitrage\n\nopportunity and export activity, concluded that \"a larger price gap\n\n[between Canadian and United States car prices] is associated with\n\ngreater export activity and that this relationship is not the\n\nresult of randomness.\"      Rebuttal Report of Robert E. Hall, Ph.D.\n\n\n      20\n          Professor Kalt had described the contours of the gray\nmarket in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Professor Hall argued that the\ngray market in 2001 and 2002 would reflect the impact of the\nalleged horizontal conspiracy and that the relevant arbitrage\nopportunities were not present in 2000.\n\n                                    -32-\n\f¶ 25.     Specifically, his regressions suggested that \"a $1,000\n\nincrease in the price gap for a given model [of car] is, on\n\naverage, associated with an increase in exports of at least 33\n\npercent.\"      Id. ¶ 24.          The minor increase in gray market sales in\n\n2001-2002 despite the conceded greater arbitrage opportunities,\n\nthen, did not indicate the lack of a conspiracy, but rather\n\nsuggested an effective one.\n\n              Professor Hall argued that a Nash equilibrium model could\n\ndistinguish the effects of unilateral restraints from those of any\n\nhorizontal conspiracy, and he also suggested that further discovery\n\nmight reduce the need for modeling by yielding direct evidence on\n\nthe   effectiveness          of    the     unilateral      and     alleged   horizontal\n\nconstraints.            He    stated       that    he     had    offered     preliminary\n\nmathematical formulas at his deposition to establish the viability\n\nof both this approach and the approach of his proposed damages\n\nmodel,   and       he   included     the    preliminary         damages   model    in   his\n\nrebuttal report. Professor Hall again asserted his view that there\n\nwere methods based on common evidence, such as the econometric\n\nmodel    he    was      proposing,       that     could   account     for    the   \"major\n\ndimensions in which damages might vary among potential class\n\nmembers.\"      Id. ¶ 50.\n\n              3.         Typicality and Predominance\n\n              On     this    evidence,      the    district       court    preliminarily\n\ncertified five exemplar state classes.                     The court held that the\n\n\n                                            -33-\n\fpresentation by Professor Hall, supported by extrinsic economic\n\nstudies, sufficed for purposes of showing common proof of impact.21\n\nThe court found \"unexceptionable\" the plaintiffs' theory that other\n\nthings being equal, a restriction on the supply of lower-priced\n\ncars coming into the United States market will exert an upward\n\npressure on domestic car prices.          Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at\n\n137.     This pressure will apply both to the prices dealers pay to\n\nmanufacturers and to the prices paid by consumers to dealers.\n\nWhile individual negotiations may determine the final price, the\n\nstarting point for most negotiations is the MSRP, and the final\n\npurchase price for most consumers is between the dealer invoice\n\nprice and the MSRP.      Id.     In effect, the overall negotiating range\n\nwould be elevated, resulting in higher consumer prices across the\n\nboard.      Id.   at   138-39.      The   court   accepted   some   of   these\n\ncontentions as adequate to demonstrate that the named plaintiffs'\n\nclaims would be typical of the class, although the court was\n\ncareful to note that it was not then deciding whether plaintiffs'\n\nproof of impact was sufficient to withstand a motion for summary\n\njudgment.    Id. at 139.\n\n\n\n\n       21\n          For example, Professor Hall cited a study showing that\ndealers tend to pass on to consumers at least some pricing\nincentives given by manufacturers. Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at\n137 (citing M. Busse et al., $1000 Cash Back: Asymmetric\nInformation in Auto Manufacturer Promotions 45 (Nat'l Bureau of\nEcon. Res. Working Paper Series No. 10887, 2004)).\n\n                                      -34-\n\f             The court was also careful to note that the proffered\n\ncommon proof of impact might be insufficient under some states'\n\nlaws.     Id. at 132.   The court sua sponte examined the laws of five\n\nof the exemplar states to determine what level of proof of consumer\n\nimpact each state required and what inferences were acceptable to\n\nshow impact.22      The   court   concluded   that   there   was   a   range.\n\nCalifornia, at one end, permitted \"an inference of antitrust\n\nimpact, even as to indirect purchasers, from the existence of the\n\nconspiracy.\"23    Id. at 135; see also id. (\"In the consumer context,\n\nat least a portion of the illegal overcharge by a manufacturer will\n\npresumably be passed on by the independent distributors to consumer\n\nclass members in the form of higher prices.\"             (quoting Global\n\nMinerals & Metals Corp. v. Superior Court, 7 Cal. Rptr. 3d 28, 44-\n\n45 (Ct. App. 2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n             Maine was at the other end of the spectrum, requiring\n\nevidence, not inference, of impact.           While the Maine antitrust\n\nstatute explicitly permits recovery for indirect injury, Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1104, the Maine Law Court has not yet\n\ncommented on what indirect purchasers must show to establish impact\n\nor causation.     Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at 132.        The district\n\n\n     22\n          The parties filed briefs on these issues of state\nsubstantive law before the March 21, 2007 order. The court found\nthat the parties' briefing did not cause it to change its prior\nviews.\n     23\n          Defendants say this is not an accurate representation of\nCalifornia law, but do not press the point on appeal.\n\n                                   -35-\n\fcourt turned to Maine superior court decisions, which the court\n\nsummarized as holding that \"indirect purchasers in Maine must\n\nproduce specific proof that they paid higher prices as a result of\n\nthe conspiracy (in the face of the possibility that all such\n\nincreases were absorbed at the retailer level).\"           Id. at 134; see\n\nalso   id.   (\"Because   indirect    purchasers    must   demonstrate    that\n\novercharges have been passed on to them, such claims present an\n\nentirely separate level of evidence and proof than that found in a\n\ndirect purchaser claim.\" (quoting Melnick v. Microsoft Corp., Nos.\n\nCV-99-709, CV-99-752, 2001 WL 1012261, at *6 (Me. Super. Ct. Aug.\n\n24, 2001))).    Likewise, the Maine consumer protection statute, Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, §§ 205-A to 214, allows indirect purchasers\n\nto recover, but injury is not presumed.              Motor Vehicles V, 235\n\nF.R.D. at 135 (citing State v. Weinschenk, 868 A.2d 200 (Me.\n\n2005)).\n\n             The court also discussed the states that fell between\n\nthose two poles. New Mexico, it concluded, seems to allow indirect\n\npurchasers    to   establish   antitrust    impact    through    correlation\n\nanalysis.     See id. at 136.       Tennessee and Vermont have not yet\n\nfully addressed the question.          See id.    The court noted that in\n\nstates like Maine where the passing on of an antitrust or consumer\n\nprotection    injury   to   indirect    purchasers    cannot    be   presumed,\n\nplaintiffs might have difficulty proving injury to individual\n\n\n\n\n                                    -36-\n\fconsumers if their common proof can establish only an inference of\n\ninjury.    See id. at 139.\n\n            Turning   to   the   question   of   predominance    under   Rule\n\n23(b)(3), the court found there were at least five common disputed\n\nissues weighing in favor of class certification.24              Id. at 142.\n\nDefendants argued that the lack of common impact at both stages of\n\nplaintiffs' theory and the lack of common proof of damages defeat\n\npredominance.    The court reiterated that it had found plaintiffs'\n\nproposal   to   prove   impact    through   common   proof    preliminarily\n\nsufficient, and it pointed out that the existence of a common\n\ndisputed issue weighs in favor of class certification, not against\n\nit.   Id. at 142 (citing Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 4-5).          The adequacy of\n\nplaintiffs' proof of common impact, and whether the impact even\n\nconstitutes cognizable antitrust or consumer protection injury,\n\n\"are merits determinations that are common in each [state] class\"\n\nand would be resolved at trial.

First, the\n\ncourt noted that \"[w]here, as here, common questions predominate\n\nregarding liability, then courts generally find the predominance\n\nrequirement to be satisfied even if individual damages issues\n\nremain.\"   Id. at 143 (quoting Smilow, 323 F.3d at 40).         Second, the\n\ncourt stated that it would not determine at the class certification\n\nstage whether plaintiffs' method of proving damages was adequate.\n\nId. at 144.   The mere fact that there are differences among members\n\nof a class regarding their individual amounts of damages does not\n\npreclude   class   certification.      Smilow,    323   F.3d   at    40   (\"The\n\nindividuation of damages in consumer class actions is rarely\n\ndeterminative under Rule 23(b)(3).\"); 7AA Wright et al., supra,\n\n§ 1781, at 235.

Smilow,\n\n323 F.3d at 40.    Plaintiffs proposed to use such an approach here.\n\nMotor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at 143-44.          The district court noted\n\nthat it was \"not overwhelmed by the plaintiffs' offer of damage\n\ncalculation models,\" but it \"conclude[d] that damages [were] not\n\nyet a ground to deny certification.\"       Id. at 144-45; see also id.\n\nat 145 n.63 (specifying some of the problems plaintiffs' damages\n\nmodels faced).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\f              Finally, the district court raised the question of the\n\nend date for the damages classes.               Id. at 140.      Another round of\n\nexpert reports ensued, accompanied by briefing repeating many of\n\nthe same arguments.          The court focused on the choice of end date in\n\nits   March    21,    2007    order;    it   commented    that    the   defendants'\n\nadditional critiques did not alter its views that a class should be\n\ncertified.25         Motor   Vehicles    VI,    241   F.R.D.     at   80-82.      Over\n\ndefendants'      insistence      that    the    court    determine      whether   the\n\n\"alleged      horizontal     conspiracy      actually    impacted     American    car\n\nprices,\" the court refused to reexamine the issue -- as well as the\n\nrelated    issue      of     \"what   vertical     restraints      the    individual\n\nmanufacturers maintained, their legality and their effect\" -- at\n\nthat time.

It is a settled question that some inquiry into the merits\n\nat the class certification stage is not only permissible but\n\nappropriate to the extent that the merits overlap the Rule 23\n\ncriteria.    Falcon, 457 U.S. at 160; PolyMedica, 432 F.3d at 6;\n\nMowbray, 208 F.3d at 297-98.        It is less settled what degree of\n\nmerits inquiry is required at the class certification stage, and\n\nthe Supreme Court has not yet addressed the issue.\n\n            Our sister circuits agree that when class criteria and\n\nmerits overlap, the district court must conduct a searching inquiry\n\nregarding   the   Rule   23   criteria,    but   how   they   articulate   the\n\nnecessary degree of inquiry ranges along a spectrum which suggests\n\nsubstantial differences.       The Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh\n\nCircuits coalesce around the more rigorous end of this spectrum,\n\nforbidding district courts from relying on plaintiffs' allegations\n\nof sufficiently common proof and requiring the courts to make\n\nspecific findings that each Rule 23 criterion is met.               Miles v.\n\nMerrill Lynch & Co. (In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec.

Amedisys Inc.,\n\n401 F.3d 316, 321-22 (5th Cir. 2005) (requiring courts to find\n\nfacts favoring class certification through the use of \"rigorous,\n\nthough   preliminary,    standards    of    proof\");     Gariety   v.

These circuits' use of\n\nthe term \"findings\" in this context should not be confused with\n\nbinding findings on the merits.             The judge's consideration of\n\nmerits issues at the class certification stage pertains only to\n\nthat stage; the ultimate factfinder, whether judge or jury, must\n\nstill reach its own determination on these issues.             In re IPO, 471\n\nF.3d at 39; Gariety, 368 F.3d at 366.\n\n             On the other end of the spectrum, the Third and Eighth\n\nCircuits     sometimes     require   an   inquiry     into   and     preliminary\n\nresolution of disputes, but they do not require findings and do not\n\nhold that such inquiry will always be necessary.             Blades, 400 F.3d\n\nat 567, 575 (holding that sometimes courts will be required to\n\nresolve factual disputes preliminarily at the class certification\n\nstage but voicing caution); Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner\n\n&   Smith,   Inc.,   259   F.3d   154,    166   (3d   Cir.   2001)    (\"A   class\n\ncertification decision requires a thorough examination of the\n\nfactual and legal allegations.\"); id. at 168 (\"In reviewing a\n\nmotion for class certification, a preliminary inquiry into the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\fmerits is sometimes necessary to determine whether the alleged\n\nclaims can be properly resolved as a class action.\").\n\n            This court has grappled with this issue as well. We have\n\nsaid in Smilow that \"a district court must conduct a rigorous\n\nanalysis\" of Rule 23's prerequisites, 323 F.3d at 38, and in\n\nMowbray that \"a district court must formulate some prediction as to\n\nhow specific issues will play out,\" 208 F.3d at 298.           See also\n\nTardiff, 365 F.3d at 4-5 (noting that the common presumption at\n\nearly stages of litigation that \"the complaint's allegations are\n\nnecessarily controlling\" does not apply in class certification\n\nsituations because \"class action machinery is expensive and in our\n\nview a court has the power to test disputed premises early on if\n\nand when the class action would be proper on one premise but not\n\nanother\").\n\n            In PolyMedica, a securities class action, we said that\n\nthe court \"was entitled to look beyond the pleadings in its\n\nevaluation\" of both the question of class certification generally\n\nand   the   applicability   of   the   fraud-on-the-market   presumption\n\nspecifically, even though those questions overlapped with the\n\nmerits of the case.   PolyMedica, 432 F.3d at 6.     The fraud-on-the-\n\nmarket presumption in securities class actions allows plaintiffs to\n\nestablish the necessary element of reliance through common proof.\n\nIf the market is efficient, the theory goes, market prices will\n\nincorporate all publicly available information, including material\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\fmisrepresentations, so that an investor who buys or sells stock in\n\nreliance on the integrity of the market price is in fact buying or\n\nselling stock in reliance on the material misrepresentations.                 See\n\nid. at 7-8.      Because common issues would no longer predominate in\n\na   securities    class    action    if    plaintiffs   could   not   at   trial\n\nestablish reliance through the common proof of the fraud-on-the-\n\nmarket presumption, courts at the class certification stage probe\n\nthe factual basis of the fraud-on-the-market presumption to make\n\nsure it will be a viable form of proof in a given case.\n\n           In both PolyMedica and its companion case, Stuebler v.\n\nXcelera.Com (In re Xcelera.Com Sec. Litig.), 430 F.3d 503 (1st Cir.\n\n2005), we, along with the district court, rigorously tested the\n\nevidence submitted by both sides to determine whether the fraud-on-\n\nthe-market presumption was reasonably applicable, specifically\n\nwhether the plaintiffs would be able to demonstrate that the market\n\nwas   efficient.      At    the    class   certification    stage,    we   noted,\n\nplaintiffs needed to present \"basic facts\" that the fraud-on-the-\n\nmarket   presumption       could   be   invoked,   even    though    its   actual\n\napplicability was to be resolved at trial. PolyMedica, 432 F.3d at\n\n19. Our review of the district court's determination of whether or\n\nnot the fraud-on-the-market presumption could be invoked was based\n\nnot on the level of detail in the district court's explanation, but\n\non \"whether the evidence supports its determination to apply the\n\npresumption.\"      Xcelera, 430 F.3d at 512.       In Xcelera, for example,\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\fthe   district   court   actively    evaluated   the   testimony   of   two\n\ncompeting   experts   and   preliminarily    credited    the   plaintiffs'\n\nexpert, a determination this court upheld -- after surveying the\n\nexpert testimony ourselves -- on clear error review.           Id. at 512-\n\n16.\n\n            PolyMedica and Xcelera could be read, but we think not\n\nproperly, as limiting this requirement that district courts probe\n\ninto the viability of the premises of plaintiffs' theory of injury\n\nto cases employing only legal presumptions of injury.          Under this\n\ncircuit's approach, in our view, a searching inquiry is in order\n\nwhere there are not only disputed basic facts, but also a novel\n\ntheory of legally cognizable injury.       Plaintiffs cannot make their\n\ncase without common proof of causation, and they can only prove\n\ncausation through common means if their novel theory is viable;\n\nthat viability in turn depends on their ability to establish --\n\nwhether through mathematical models or further data or other means\n\n-- the key logical steps behind their theory.          Such reliance on a\n\nnovel theory to establish a primary element of a claim necessitates\n\na more searching inquiry into whether plaintiffs will be able to\n\nprove the pivotal elements of their theory at trial.               This is\n\nespecially so when a case implicates the sort of factors that we\n\nhave deemed important in the Rule 23(f) calculus, namely, when the\n\ngranting of class status \"raises the stakes of litigation so\n\n\n\n\n                                    -44-\n\fsubstantially that the defendant likely will feel irresistible\n\npressure to settle.\"         Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 293.\n\n            We   do    not   need   to    resolve    now   whether    \"findings\"\n\nregarding the class certification criteria are ever necessary, but\n\nwe do hold that when a Rule 23 requirement relies on a novel or\n\ncomplex theory as to injury, as the predominance inquiry does in\n\nthis case, the district court must engage in a searching inquiry\n\ninto the viability of that theory and the existence of the facts\n\nnecessary for the theory to succeed.\n\n            Contrary to defendants' assertions, the district court\n\ndid not believe itself limited by Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin,\n\n417 U.S. 156 (1974), to non-merits inquiries.              Instead, the court\n\nattempted to meet its obligations under PolyMedica, Mowbray, and\n\nour other cases to conduct a rigorous analysis at the certification\n\nstage.    See Motor Vehicles V, 241 F.R.D. at 81 n.7.                The court's\n\nability to probe into the viability of plaintiffs' proffered theory\n\nand to formulate some predictions as to how key issues in this\n\nnovel and complex case would develop was hampered, however, by the\n\nincomplete record at the time, as well as by the fact that\n\nplaintiffs' expert had not yet fully formulated all aspects of his\n\nanalysis.     The court pointed out that it was ruling on class\n\ncertification before discovery was completed and was relying upon\n\nthe plaintiffs' representation that they would fill in the gaps in\n\ntheir    evidence     with   further     discovery   and   further   work.    It\n\n\n                                         -45-\n\frepeatedly said that it was willing to take another look at these\n\nquestions when the record was more complete.26\n\n            This court has had little occasion to discuss the timing\n\nof the issuance of class certification orders, much less of damages\n\nclasses under Rule 23(b)(3).         See Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 299 n.7.\n\nRule 23(c)(1)(A) says only that the court must act \"at an early\n\npracticable time.\"      Rule 23(c)(1)(C) also provides that a class\n\ncertification   order    may   be    altered   or   amended   before   final\n\njudgment.27 A district court which has taken an initial look at the\n\nmerits is not foreclosed from later entertaining, post-discovery,\n\na summary judgment motion from defendants asserting that plaintiffs\n\ncannot establish the requisite antitrust and consumer protection\n\nimpact through common means.        See 3 Conte & Newberg, supra, § 7:15,\n\nat 48-57.    Indeed, it is not uncommon to defer final decision on\n\ncertifications pending completion of relevant discovery.                 Id.\n\n§ 7:16, at 57-59.\n\n\n\n     26\n          Defendants attempt to answer this problem by saying these\nstatements demonstrate that the district court failed to inquire\nadequately into the record; that answer is a mismatch with the\nproblem presented of an incomplete record and of incomplete work by\nthe plaintiffs' expert.\n     27\n          The 2003 amendments to Rule 23 deleted the provision\nallowing class certifications to be conditional.      The advisory\ncommittee notes explain that \"[a] court that is not satisfied that\nthe requirements of Rule 23 have been met should refuse\ncertification until they have been met.\" This does not prevent a\njudge from modifying its certification if it becomes clear, as the\ncase develops, that the class action vehicle is in fact\ninappropriate.\n\n                                     -46-\n\f            When the decision on class certification is made before\n\nfull class discovery has been completed, as here, it is necessarily\n\nmore predictive. As the Eighth Circuit has noted, the decision may\n\nrequire revisiting upon completion of full discovery.    Blades, 400\n\nF.3d at 567; see also Gariety, 368 F.3d at 368.\n\n            In another case, this posture of certification being\n\ndecided before completion of class discovery might not raise any\n\nconcerns.      In this case it does because of the novelty and\n\ncomplexity of the theories advanced and the gaps in the evidence\n\nproferred. The district court expressed multiple times its concern\n\nabout the adequacy of several of plaintiffs' showings and expressed\n\na willingness to revisit the question once it had a better record\n\nin front of it.    We share those concerns.\n\n            Plaintiffs' theory of impact on indirect purchasers is\n\nboth novel and complex.    Injury in price-fixing cases is sometimes\n\nnot difficult to establish.     Plaintiffs do not, however, advance\n\nsuch a price-fixing theory. Rather, the plaintiffs' theory is that\n\nthe higher prices are the result of a \"but-for\" world.   In step one\n\nof plaintiff's theory, but for the defendants' illegal stifling of\n\ncompetition, the manufacturers would have had to set dealer invoice\n\nprices and MSRPs lower to avoid losing sales to the lower-priced\n\nCanadian cars coming across the border for resale in the United\n\nStates.     In step two, the higher dealer invoice prices and MSRPs\n\n\n\n\n                                 -47-\n\fenabled by this stifling of competition resulted in injury to\n\nconsumers in the form of higher retail prices.\n\n                The   first     step    of        plaintiffs'       theory   requires\n\ndemonstrating     that   the    defendants'          actions    did   result   in   an\n\nincrease in dealer invoice prices and MSRPs in the United States.\n\nThis in turn depends on at least two factors.                   First, there would\n\nhave had to be, in this but-for world, a flood of significantly\n\nlower-priced Canadian cars coming across the border for resale in\n\nthe United States during times of arbitrage opportunities, enough\n\ncars to cause manufacturers to take steps to protect the American\n\nmarket from this competition by decreasing nationally set prices.\n\nAs plaintiffs themselves note, without a very large number of cars\n\npoised to cross the border, a nationwide impact on the automobile\n\nmarket of the sort required by plaintiffs' theory is implausible,\n\nand    the   theory   collapses.        In     our    view,    plaintiffs'     expert\n\nProfessor Hall had not yet, at the time of class certification,\n\nfully answered such potentially relevant questions as how the size\n\nof the but-for influx of cars would be established or how large\n\nthat   influx    would   have   to     be    to    affect     the   national   market\n\nsufficiently to raise effective dealer invoice prices and MSRPs.\n\n             Second, the plaintiffs must be able to sort out the\n\neffects of any permissible vertical restraints from the effects of\n\nthe alleged, impermissible horizontal conspiracy.                      This question\n\nwas raised below but was not fully addressed.                         Professor Hall\n\n\n                                        -48-\n\fasserted in a purely conclusory manner that the effects could be\n\nseparated   out   using   the    concept     of   Nash    equilibriums.        If\n\nplaintiffs do not have a viable means for distinguishing between\n\nthese two sets of effects, they cannot show that it was the\n\nhorizontal conspiracy that caused the impact on the domestic\n\nnational market upon which their theory depends.28\n\n            As for the second step of plaintiffs' theory, it must\n\ninclude some means of determining that each member of the class was\n\nin fact injured, even if the amount of each individual injury could\n\nbe determined in a separate proceeding.                  Predominance is not\n\ndefeated by individual damages questions as long as liability is\n\nstill subject to common proof.         Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 6; Smilow, 323\n\nF.3d at 40; 6 Conte & Newberg, supra, § 18:27, at 91.                   This is\n\nbecause   the   class   action   can    be   limited     to   the   question   of\n\nliability, leaving damages for later individualized determinations.\n\nSee Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 7; Smilow, 323 F.3d at 41; 6 Conte &\n\n\n\n\n     28\n          While these are both questions that are themselves\nsusceptible to common proof (the potential size of the gray market\nand the distinction between the effects of horizontal and vertical\nrestraints), they go to the viability of a novel theory upon which\nplaintiffs rely to establish an element of their claim through\ncommon means. In that sense, these factual questions are akin to\nthe question of market efficiency in securities class actions\nemploying the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance. Cases\nlike PolyMedica and Xcelera demonstrate that such factual bases of\ntheories of common proof are appropriately, although preliminarily,\ntested at the class certification stage.\n\n                                   -49-\n\fNewberg, supra, § 18:53, at 179 & n.10, § 18:56, at 190-92.29\n\nEstablishing liability, however, still requires showing that class\n\nmembers were injured at the consumer level.    It is unclear to us\n\nhow plaintiffs intend to make this connection.\n\n          The plaintiffs might intend to use their damages model to\n\nprove both fact of damages and the measure of those damages.    If\n\nso, the district court would need enough information to evaluate\n\npreliminarily whether the proposed model will be able to establish,\n\nwithout need for individual determinations for the many millions of\n\npotential class members, which consumers were impacted by the\n\nalleged antitrust violation and which were not. See, e.g., Blades,\n\n400 F.3d at 570 (affirming denial of class status where the actual\n\nprices paid by class members could not be determined via common\n\nproof because \"[t]he amount of premiums paid, if any, is relevant\n\nto a determination of impact . . . and is not merely an assessment\n\nof the amount of damages, which may be properly ascertained at a\n\nlater time\"); Newton, 259 F.3d at 187-88 (affirming denial of class\n\nstatus where plaintiffs had not only provided no model formula for\n\nmeasuring damages, but more fundamentally had also not demonstrated\n\nthe fact of damages).    \"The ability to calculate the aggregate\n\namount of damages,\" as plaintiffs propose to do here, \"does not\n\n\n\n     29\n          The district court noted that \"some states permit\nconsumers to recover the full purchase price once liability is\nproven,\" further simplifying the calculation of individual damages\nawards. Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D. at 143 n.53.\n\n                               -50-\n\fabsolve plaintiffs from the duty to prove each [class member] was\n\nharmed by the defendants' practice.\"         Newton, 259 F.3d at 188.\n\n            The district court, while expressing skepticism regarding\n\nplaintiffs' proposal for measuring damages, relied on this court's\n\nconsideration in Smilow of an incomplete damages model.           It noted\n\nthat   in    Smilow,   this   court    had   accepted   as   sufficient   a\n\nrepresentation by plaintiffs' expert that he \"could fashion\" a\n\ncomputerized method of calculating class damages.            Motor Vehicles\n\nV, 235 F.R.D. at 144 (quoting Smilow, 323 F.3d at 40) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).        The proposed computerized model in\n\nSmilow would draw from the defendant's records, which listed the\n\nconsumers who were charged the allegedly illegal fees. Smilow, 323\n\nF.3d at 40-41.    That is, the model would have relied on data that\n\nclearly established which consumers suffered injury.              Professor\n\nHall similarly claimed that data in defendants' hands would provide\n\nthe information he would need for his damages model; whether that\n\ndata will be sufficient to establish consumer-level impact for each\n\nclass member is a question that can now be answered with discovery\n\ncompleted.\n\n            Plaintiffs seem to rely on an inference that any upward\n\npressure on national pricing would necessarily raise the prices\n\nactually paid by individual consumers.         There is intuitive appeal\n\nto this theory, but intuitive appeal is not enough.           Even if it is\n\nfair to assume that hard bargainers will usually pay prices closer\n\n                                      -51-\n\fto the dealer invoice price and poor negotiators will usually pay\n\nprices closer to the MSRP, a minimal increase in national pricing\n\nwould not necessarily mean that all consumers would pay more.   Too\n\nmany factors play into an individual negotiation to allow an\n\nassumption -- at least without further theoretical development --\n\nthat any price increase or decrease will always have the same\n\nmagnitude of effect on the final price paid.    Even if Professor\n\nHall's proposed models could determine when MSRPs and dealer\n\ninvoice prices were affected for which models and to what degree,\n\nit is a further question whether it can be presumed that all\n\npurchasers of those affected cars paid higher retail prices.\n\n          Some courts have allowed a presumption of class-wide\n\nimpact in price-fixing cases when \"the price structure in the\n\nindustry is such that nationwide the conspiratorially affected\n\nprices at the wholesale level fluctuated within a range which,\n\nthough different in different regions, was higher in all regions\n\nthan the range which would have existed in all regions under\n\ncompetitive conditions.\"   Winoff Indus. Inc. v. Stone Container\n\nCorp. (In re Linderboard Antitrust Litig.), 305 F.3d 145, 151 (3d\n\nCir. 2002) (quoting Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434, 455\n\n(3d Cir. 1977)).   If effective dealer invoice prices in the real\n\nworld were equal to or greater than the effective MSRPs in the but-\n\nfor world -- that is, if the entire negotiating range in the but-\n\nfor world would have been below the entire negotiating range in the\n\n\n                               -52-\n\freal world -- it would be easier to presume that all consumers\n\nsuffered   impact.      The    district    court   discussed   the   Bogosian\n\npresumption in its May 12, 2006 order, Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D.\n\nat 138 n.35, but plaintiffs disclaim any intent to rely on the\n\nBogosian model.\n\n           It is true that the validity of plaintiffs' theory is a\n\ncommon disputed issue.        Cf. Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 4-5.      It will be\n\nfor the fact finder to decide whether this theory is persuasive.\n\nAt the class certification stage, however, the district court must\n\nstill ensure that the plaintiffs' presentation of their case will\n\nbe through means amenable to the class action mechanism.              We are\n\nlooking here not for hard factual proof, but for a more thorough\n\nexplanation of how the pivotal evidence behind plaintiff's theory\n\ncan be established.     If there is no realistic means of proof, many\n\nresources will be wasted setting up a trial that plaintiffs cannot\n\nwin.\n\n           In sum, the district court's oft-expressed instinct that\n\naspects of plaintiffs' theory remained to be developed dovetails\n\nwith our own.        At the time of class certification, more work\n\nremained to be done in the building of plaintiffs' damages model\n\nand the filling out of all steps of plaintiffs' theory of impact.\n\nTime has now passed: it is almost two years since the district\n\ncourt's May 12, 2006 order, and all discovery was scheduled to be\n\ncompleted by March 3, 2008.         The plaintiffs should now have the\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\fevidence they need to put their best foot forward, and they have\n\nhad additional time to work out their models and formulas.     The\n\ndistrict court should now have a complete record before it from\n\nwhich to test the viability of plaintiffs' novel theory for proving\n\ncommon impact.\n\n          We thus vacate and remand the certification of the state\n\ndamages classes so that the district court, which has handled this\n\ncase admirably so far, may reconsider those class certification\n\norders in light of this opinion and the more fully developed\n\nrecord.\n\n          We reverse in part, vacate in part, remand in part, and\n\norder dismissal of the Clayton Act injunctive relief claim.    All\n\nparties shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n           -Concurring and Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                               -54-\n\f                 TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, (Concurring in part, Dissenting\n\nin part).          Although I concur with the majority regarding the\n\ninjunctive class, I respectfully dissent from the discussion of the\n\nstate damages classes.30               In my view, the opinion erodes the\n\ndiscretion which we are required to afford to the district court in\n\nclass certification proceedings.                   A district court's decision to\n\ncertify      a    class   is     reviewed    under     the    deferential      abuse    of\n\ndiscretion         standard.       See   Smilow,      323     F.3d   at   37   (\"Orders\n\ncertifying or decertifying a class are reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\") (citing Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 703\n\n(1979)); see also Blyden v. Mancusi, 186 F.3d 252, 269 (2d Cir.\n\n1999) (\"A district court's decision to certify a class is reviewed\n\nfor abuse of discretion, and '[a] reviewing court must exercise\n\neven greater deference when the district court has certified a\n\nclass than when it has declined to do so.'\" (citation omitted)).\n\n                 Rule 23 grants the district court broad discretion to\n\ndetermine whether a class should be certified.                   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.\n\nOur review is, therefore, focused on whether the district court\n\nproperly applied the criteria set out in Rule 23.                    See Mowbray, 208\n\nF.3d    at       295   (\"An    abuse   occurs      when   a   court,      in   making   a\n\ndiscretionary          ruling,    relies     upon    an   improper     factor,    omits\n\nconsideration of a factor entitled to substantial weight, or mulls\n\n\n       30\n      I agree that the case is properly remanded to the district\ncourt so that it can first establish whether there is jurisdiction\nunder § 1332 or § 1367.\n\n                                            -55-\n\fthe correct mix of factors but makes a clear error of judgment in\n\nassaying them.\").       Importantly, a district court remains free at a\n\nlater stage to modify or even decertify a class if later evidence\n\ndisproves the plaintiffs' assertions regarding, for example, the\n\npredominance of common issues.             See Falcon, 457 U.S. at 160 (\"Even\n\nafter a certification order is entered, the judge remains free to\n\nmodify   it    in     the    light   of    subsequent       developments      in    the\n\nlitigation.\"); In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 280\n\nF.3d 124, 141 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n            In this case, the district court addressed all of the\n\nRule 23 requirements: numerosity of the class members; commonality\n\nof the questions of law or fact; typicality of the claims or\n\ndefenses;     adequacy       of   representation;       predominance     of    common\n\nquestions;     and     the    superiority        of   the   class    action    as    an\n\nadjudicative vehicle.             And, as required in this circuit, the\n\ndistrict      court     \"conduct[ed]        a     rigorous    analysis        of    the\n\nprerequisites established by Rule 23,\" Smilow, 323 F.3d at 38, and\n\n\"formulate[d] some prediction as to how specific issues w[ould]\n\nplay out in order to determine whether common or individual issues\n\npredominate,\" Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 298.\n\n            The majority does not question the rigor with which the\n\ncourt conducted its analysis.              Indeed, the opinion applauds the\n\ncourt's \"attempt[] to meet its obligations . . . to conduct a\n\nrigorous analysis at the certification stage.\"                      Slip op. at 44.\n\n\n                                          -56-\n\fRather, the basis for the majority's remand on the certification of\n\nthe damages classes is the insufficiency of evidence available to\n\nthe district court.   Although the opinion faults the timing of the\n\ncertification (and, thus the incompleteness of the record), I am\n\nconcerned that in vacating and remanding the certification order\n\nfor reconsideration with additional evidence from the plaintiffs,\n\nthe opinion stands for the proposition that we now require a high\n\nlevel of fact-finding before certification.\n\n          I agree with the district court that our case law does\n\nnot \"mandat[e] a particular level of factfinding by the district\n\njudge at the certification stage.\"    Motor Vehicles VI, 241 F.R.D.\n\nat 82 n.7.   On the contrary, in PolyMedica, we stated that:\n\n          The question of how much evidence . . . is\n          necessary for a court to accept the [theory of\n          reliance] at the class certification stage is\n          therefore one of degree. District courts must\n          draw these lines sensibly . . . . We have no\n          illusions that this line-drawing is easy.\n          Knowing the high stakes in the class-\n          certification decision, the parties will try\n          to move the court in different directions,\n          with plaintiffs arguing for less evidence\n          . . . and defendants for more . . . the\n          district court must evaluate the plaintiff's\n          evidence . . .    critically without allowing\n          the defendant to turn the class certification\n          proceeding into an unwieldy trial on the\n          merits.\n\n\n432 F.3d at 17 (emphasis added).      The district court drew those\n\nlines sensibly in this case.   We are not entitled to second-guess\n\nthat decision in the absence of evidence that it engaged in an\n\n\n                               -57-\n\fabuse of discretion.            Our decision to vacate and remand the\n\ncertification of the damages classes to allow the district court\n\nthe benefit of full discovery, effectively overrides the district\n\ncourt's assessment of how much evidence it needed to certify the\n\nclass.      Under the banner of a \"novel and complex\" theory in a class\n\ncertification proceeding, we now appear to require district courts\n\nto fully vet and test the underpinnings of a plaintiff's legal\n\ntheory.      See slip op. at 44 (\"[I]n our view, a searching inquiry is\n\nin order where there are not only disputed basic facts, but also a\n\nnovel theory of legally cognizable injury.\").\n\n              At   issue   in   this    case   are   questions    regarding     the\n\nplaintiffs' theory of impact. Although the district court admitted\n\nsome concern about whether the plaintiffs' proof of impact would be\n\n\"sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment or for\n\njudgment as a matter of law at trial,\" Motor Vehicles V, 235 F.R.D.\n\nat   139,    the   district     court   properly     remained    focused   on   the\n\ncertification requirements and concluded that \"the plaintiffs'\n\nproof does meet the commonality and typicality standard.\" Id. The\n\nmajority even admits that these questions regarding the plaintiffs'\n\ntheory of impact \"are themselves susceptible to common proof (the\n\npotential size of the gray market and the distinction between the\n\neffects of horizontal and vertical restraints).\"                  Slip op. at 48\n\nn.29.       The opinion goes on, however, to conclude that a more\n\n\n\n\n                                        -58-\n\fsearching inquiry into the factual basis of that theory is required\n\nhere.    I disagree.\n\n            In this case, the questions regarding the viability of\n\nthe plaintiffs' theory of impact are not limited to certification\n\nissues, but go to the merits of the plaintiffs' claim.                    I disagree\n\nwith the majority's reading of PolyMedica and Xcelera, which they\n\ncite in support of their position that \"factual bases of theories\n\nof common proof are appropriately, although preliminarily, tested\n\nat the class certification stage.\"               Id.     PolyMedica and Xcelera\n\nwere securities class actions in which the plaintiffs sought to use\n\nthe     fraud-on-the-market         presumption        to     demonstrate      market\n\nefficiency.       Those class actions were brought under § 10(b) of the\n\nSecurities    Exchange      Act    of    1934,   and    Rule    10b-5    promulgated\n\nthereunder, which require that each plaintiff prove that he or she\n\nindividually       relied    on    the     alleged      misrepresentation.          A\n\nrequirement of individualized reliance \"would effectively preclude\n\nsecurities    fraud     class     actions     under    Rule    23(b)(3)    [because]\n\n[i]ndividual issues of reliance would necessarily overwhelm the\n\ncommon ones.\"      Xcelera, 430 F.3d at 507.            The applicability of the\n\nfraud-on-the-market theory is central to the appropriateness of the\n\nclass    action    as   a   vehicle     for   litigation:      under     the   theory,\n\nplaintiffs are no longer required to prove individualized reliance.\n\nSee PolyMedica, 432 F.3d at 18-19 (vacating and remanding the class\n\ncertification       after    concluding       that     the    district    court   had\n\n\n                                         -59-\n\fcommitted error in adopting the incorrect definition of \"market\n\nefficiency,\" one of the elements for invoking the fraud-on-the-\n\nmarket presumption).      In this antitrust case, the majority points\n\nto no legal error committed by the district court in assessing the\n\nappropriateness of certification.\n\n           In remanding the certification of the damages classes for\n\nreconsideration   with    the    benefit    of    additional    evidence,    the\n\nmajority   conflates     the    dispute    as    to   the   viability   of   the\n\nplaintiffs' theory with the specific inquiries required at class\n\ncertification.    As we noted in PolyMedica, \"a court has the power\n\nto test disputed premises early on if and when the class action\n\nwould be proper on one premise but not another.\"               PolyMedica, 432\n\nF.3d at 6 (quoting Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 4-5) (emphasis added).\n\nIndeed, insofar as those premises are not preclusive of the class\n\naction as a vehicle, we have no basis for requiring a district\n\ncourt to inquire further into the merits of the case.               While the\n\nplaintiffs' theory of antitrust impact is novel and complex, it,\n\nunlike the fraud-on-the-market theory, is not determinative of\n\nwhether a class action is proper or not.              Indeed, the identified\n\nuncertainties within the plaintiffs' theory challenge only the\n\nability of the plaintiffs (as a group) to successfully prove their\n\ntheory of impact.      Slip op. at 46-49.         In this case, an inquiry\n\nthat tests each stage of the plaintiffs' theory is, in effect, an\n\nassessment of the case's merits.          As such, we are putting the cart\n\n\n                                    -60-\n\fbefore the horse and turning the class certification stage into a\n\nmotion for summary judgment proceeding -- the appropriate juncture\n\nat which to fully vet the viability of the plaintiffs' theory.   In\n\nso holding today, I fear that we are removing the underpinnings of\n\nthe discretion we grant district courts to draw sensible lines and\n\nfurther blurring the distinction between the certification inquiry\n\nand a trial on the merits.   I believe this course is erroneous and\n\ncontrary to established precedent, and thus dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                -61-\n\f",

We granted this interlocutory appeal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) from the district court's certifications of (1) a nationwide plaintiff class seeking injunctive relief under, section 16 of the Clayton Act and Rule 23(b)(2), and (2) a class seeking damages under the antitrust and consumer protection laws of twenty states and Rule 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p>Interlocutory appeals from class certification under Rule 23(f) are especially appropriate where the plaintiffs' theory is novel or where a doubtful class certification results in financial exposure to defendants so great as to provide substantial incentives for defendants to settle nonmeritorious cases in an effort to avoid both risk of liability and litigation expense. <i>Tardiff v. Knox County,</i> 365 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Waste Mgmt Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also </i><i>West v. Prudential Sec, Inc.,</i> 282 F.3d 935, 937 (7th Cir.2002) (\"The effect of a class certification in inducing settlement to curtail the risk of large awards provides a powerful reason to take an interlocutory appeal.\"). The defendants assert that the amount at stake in the damages classes alone, counting treble damages, could be as much as $3 billion, and these classes include roughly thirteen million car purchasers. There is no reliable means for measuring the size of the injunctive class, but it is potentially massive.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>By the same token, an erroneous failure to certify a class where individual claims are small may deprive plaintiffs of the only realistic mechanism to vindicate meritorious claims. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 7 (citing <i>Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor,</i> 521 U.S. 591, 617, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997)). All of these concerns are very much implicated here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> We summarize our holdings. We reverse the certification of the injunctive class under the Clayton Act for lack of a live controversy and order dismissal of the claim. Because there is no jurisdiction under the Clayton Act, we remand to the district court for determination of the several issues concerning the existence of federal jurisdiction. On the representation of the parties that there is diversity jurisdiction over at least some of the state damages claims, we review the certification of the damages classes. We vacate that certification; the district court is free to reconsider the class certification orders on a more complete record.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Background</i></h2>\n<p>The extensive background of this case is recited in many thoughtful decisions of the district court. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litig.

(Motor Vehicles VIII</i>), 243 F.R.D. 17 (D.Me.2007) (memorandum order in support of class certification order). Before describing the class certification issues, we sketch the outline of the underlying case.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' claim is that from at least 2001 through 2003, the currency exchange rate differential between the strong United States dollar and the cheaper Canadian dollar created arbitrage opportunities<sup>[2]</sup> in the gray market<sup>[3]</sup> to sell lower-priced Canadian cars in the United States. These arbitrage opportunities arose from the difference between the price at which a broker could buy a vehicle in Canada (plus the costs of exporting the vehicle to the United States) and the price at which the broker could resell the vehicle, whether to a dealer or consumer, in the United States. These arbitrage opportunities were enhanced by liberal trade agreements and the harmonization of automotive safety and environmental standards between the two countries in the 1990s. As a result, an exporter could make most new cars sold in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> Canada physically indistinguishable from comparable models sold in the United States by replacing the speedometer and odometer with gauges that measured miles instead of kilometers. All of these circumstances converged in what plaintiffs refer to as a \"perfect storm\" of cross-border arbitrage opportunities.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs allege that individual automobile manufacturers engaged in business practices, both legal and illegal, designed to restrict the flow of Canadian cars into the United States. Manufacturers allegedly refused to honor warranties on Canadian cars in the United States and discouraged dealers from installing domestic gauges on Canadian cars; they mandated \"no export\" clauses in sales agreements between dealers and consumers and required Canadian dealers to conduct due diligence into whether potential customers were likely to export their cars out of Canada; and they withheld information about safety recalls from exporting customers. Manufacturers also allegedly imposed disciplinary measures on Canadian dealers who sold to exporting customers. When Canadian cars were discovered in the United States, automakers would impose a \"chargeback,\" a monetary penalty sometimes amounting to thousands of dollars, on the Canadian dealer who sold the car; manufacturers threatened to withhold inventory of desirable models from offending dealerships; and they threatened to terminate dealerships that sold to exporters.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs allege that these business practices had the effect of suppressing the supply of Canadian cars in the United States. This stifling of supply led to increases in two key prices in the domestic United States automobile market: the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (\"MSRP\") and the dealer invoice price. The MSRP represents the retail price presented to the public. The dealer invoice price represents the manufacturer-determined net wholesale price to dealers.<sup>[4]</sup> Both the MSRP and the list dealer invoice price are determined annually by manufacturers and apply nationally. Under plaintiffs' theory, these two prices in turn define the bargaining parameters for the price actually paid by consumers. Actual sales prices vary according to individual negotiations between dealers and consumers, but plaintiffs assume that negotiated prices fall within the range between the dealer invoice price and the MSRP.</p>\n<p>Defendants<sup>[5]</sup> take the position that the business practices described above amount to vertical restraints between manufacturers and their dealers that do not violate the antitrust laws. Plaintiffs, however, allege that defendants violated section 1 of the Sherman Act by conspiring to coordinate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> their anti-export business practices across the industry in response to increased arbitrage opportunities after 2000. Plaintiffs allege that defendants accomplished the illegal conspiracy over the course of several meetings and through dissemination of best practices and other information through the dealer associations. These illegal horizontal agreements allegedly enhanced the effectiveness of the extant legal vertical restraints. According to plaintiffs' theory, \"but for\" the illegal horizontal conspiracy and its suppression of inter-brand competition, American consumers would have paid lower prices and have thus suffered antitrust-type injury.</p>\n<p>For example, the plaintiffs allege that Ford's 2002 Windstar LX minivan had an MSRP of $16,448 (USD) in Canada and $22,340 (USD) in the United States  a difference of 26%. The MSRP for a 2002 Lexus SC430 was 13% lower in Canada than in the United States. Plaintiffs claim that if the car-makers had not conspired to impede arbitrageurs from exporting Canadian cars to the United States, the manufacturers could not maintain these pricing gaps and instead would have been forced to compete by lowering prices across the United States.</p>\n<p>To summarize, plaintiffs' theory of antitrust impact operates in two stages. In the first stage, the horizontal conspiracy allowed the manufacturers to maintain artificially inflated national MSRPs and dealer invoice prices within the United States. In the second stage, the higher official pricing resulted in higher purchase prices paid by individual consumers.</p>\n<p>Throughout the proceedings in the district court, the defendants have denied any conspiracy. They have also argued that even if such a conspiracy existed, it would not have impacted the domestic market in any case due to the effects of the entirely legal vertical restraints.<sup>[6]</sup> Defendants have also argued that contrary to plaintiffs' theory, there would have been no flood of Canadian cars into the United States given the number of new cars sold in Canada, the limited opportunities for arbitrage, and the small size and spottiness of the gray market. Defendants assert that even if there were some impact on MSRPs and dealer invoice prices in the American market, there was no widespread antitrust impact on consumers, and plaintiffs have no viable theory to show either causation or damages that would apply to the plaintiff classes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Nationwide Injunctive Relief Plaintiff Class</i></h2>\n<p>Defendants challenge the certification of the injunctive class on the basis that plaintiffs lack standing to sue for injunctive relief under the federal antitrust laws. Because standing is a threshold consideration, the resolution of which may render subsequent arguments irrelevant, we discuss it first.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> 490, 498-99, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs seek federal injunctive relief pursuant to section 16 of the Clayton Act on behalf of a nationwide class under Rule 23(b)(2) for alleged violations of section 1 of the Sherman Act. Section 16 makes available injunctive relief \"against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws.\" 15 U.S.C. § 26; <i>see also </i><i>Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc.,</i> 479 U.S. 104, 110-11, 107 S.Ct. 484, 93 L.Ed.2d 427 (1986). Plaintiffs allege that injunctive relief is necessary because the conspiracy is ongoing and will continue unless enjoined by the court.</p>\n<p>Specifically, plaintiffs seek an injunction that would require defendants to honor warranties in the United States on all new motor vehicles sold in Canada; enjoin the defendants from blacklisting Canadian exporters; enjoin the defendants from exchanging certain information with each other, including blacklists and methods for avoiding export sales; enjoin chargebacks to Canadian dealers; enjoin the tracking of Canadian cars' Vehicle Identification Numbers (\"VINs\"); enjoin American manufacturers from penalizing American dealers for buying or selling Canadian vehicles; enjoin the Canadian Automobile Dealers' Association (\"CADA\") and the National Automobile Dealers' Association (\"NADA\") from discouraging or acting to prevent Canadian exports; and enjoin the defendants from withholding safety recall information based on a vehicle's export status. <i>Motor Vehicles IV,</i> 2006 WL 623591, at *l-2.</p>\n<p>On March 10, 2006, the district court issued an order certifying a nationwide injunctive class under Rule 23(b)(2).<sup>[8]</sup> Id. at *1. In doing so, the court noted that a national injunction was the only relief available to members of the proposed class who reside in twenty-seven states because the court had previously dismissed a proposed nationwide class for damages under the federal antitrust laws as well as statelaw damages claims for all but twenty-three states and the District of Columbia. <i>Id.</i> at *7. The district court has, with the agreement of the parties, stayed determination of class notice issues pending this appeal.</p>\n<p>The district court addressed the scope of standing to seek injunctive relief under section 16 of the Clayton Act in the course of analyzing the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3). <i>Motor Vehicles IV,</i> 2006 WL 623591, at *3-4. Defendants had argued that some named plaintiffs did not have standing to sue for an injunction because not all named plaintiffs actually paid an overcharge due to the alleged conspiracy, and some actually paid less because of it. <i>Id.</i> at *3.</p>\n<p>The court correctly held that a plaintiff seeking relief under section 16 need not show actual antitrust damages but only a \"threatened loss or damage.\" 15 U.S.C. § 26; <i>see also </i><i>Cargill,</i> 479 U.S. at 111, 107 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> S.Ct. 484; <i>Ocean State Physicians Health Plan, Inc. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of R.I.,</i> 883 F.2d 1101, 1106 (1st Cir.1989). This in turn means that the requirements for standing for injunctive relief are less stringent than those under section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, for standing to pursue damages claims. <i>Cia Petrolera Caribe, Inc. v. Arco Caribbean, Inc.,</i> 754 F.2d 404, 407-08 (1st Cir.1985) (\"Congress empowered a broader range of plaintiffs to bring § 16 actions because the standards to be met are less exacting than those under § 4; under § 16, a plaintiff need show only a threat of injury rather than an accrued injury.\").</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs must demonstrate \"a significant threat of injury from an impending violation . . . or from a contemporary violation likely to continue or recur.\" <i>Mid-West Paper Prods. Co. v. Cont'l Group, Inc.,</i> 596 F.2d 573, 591 (3rd Cir.1979) (quoting <i>Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.,</i> 395 U.S. 100, 130, 89 S.Ct. 1562, 23 L.Ed.2d 129 (1969)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The threatened injury must be an injury for which the plaintiff would be entitled to compensation, if the injury actually occurred. <i>Cargill,</i> 479 U.S. at 110-13, 107 S.Ct. 484. There is no doubt that the types of injuries alleged here  consumers paying artificially inflated prices due to antitrust violations  are antitrust injuries. <i>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</i> 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979); see also Motor Vehicles IV, 2006 WL 623591, at *3 (\"Higher prices for consumers resulting from antitrust violations are antitrust injuries.\").</p>\n<p>The district court rejected the defendants' standing argument, reasoning that whether or not the named plaintiffs suffered an actual overcharge, \"[t]hey confront or confronted a threatened loss or damage resulting from restrictions on competition . . . [that] the antitrust laws were designed to prevent.\" <i>Id.</i> at *4. The district court relied on two propositions that are now called into question. First, the court reasoned that \"whether exchange rates during some periods [within the class period] <i>temporarily</i> made Canadian cars more expensive and therefore not price competitive, does not affect the standing of these plaintiffs to seek an injunction against, continuation of such a conspiracy.\"<sup>[9]</sup><i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Second, the court noted in an opinion now two years old that \"[t]here is no indication that exchange-related arbitrage opportunities have permanently ended.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>As the defendants point out on appeal, the standing issue emanates from Article III's requirement that there remain a live case or controversy throughout the course of a litigation. <i>Golden v. Zwickler,</i> 394 U.S. 103, 108-09, 89 S.Ct. 956, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969). If a named plaintiff fails to establish such a continuing controversy, she normally may not invoke the power of the federal courts to seek relief on her own behalf or that of other members of a putative class. <i>O'Shea v. Littleton,</i> 414 U.S. 488, 494, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974); <i>see also </i><i>Sosna v. Iowa,</i> 419 U.S. 393, 402, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42, L.Ed.2d 532 (1975) (\"There must not only be a named plaintiff who has . . . a case or controversy at the time the complaint is filed, and at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> the time the class action is certified by the District Court . . . but there must be a live controversy at the time this Court reviews the case.\"). Under certain circumstances, a court may find that the requisite controversy exists \"between a named defendant and a member of the class represented by the named plaintiff, even though the claim of the named plaintiff has become moot\" due to that plaintiffs individual circumstances. <i>Sosna,</i> 419 U.S. at 402, 95 S.Ct. 553.</p>\n<p>The defendants contend that even if the named plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief at some time in the past, circumstances have changed such that there is no longer a live controversy between named plaintiffs and the defendants to bolster plaintiffs' standing to seek injunctive relief. We agree.</p>\n<p>Section 16's requirement of \"threatened injury,\" 15 U.S.C. § 26, dovetails with Article III's requirement that in order to obtain forward-looking relief, a plaintiff must face a threat of injury that is both \"`real and immediate,' not `conjectural' or `hypothetical'\" <i>O'Shea,</i> 414 U.S. at 494, 94 S.Ct. 669 (quoting <i>Golden,</i> 394 U.S. at 109-10, 89 S.Ct. 956). \"Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.\" <i>Id.</i> at 495-96, 89 S.Ct. 956.</p>\n<p>As with the other elements of standing, it is plaintiffs who, by invoking federal jurisdiction, bear the burden of establishing the presence of a threat of injury. <i>McInnis-Misenor v. Me. Med. Ctr.,</i> 319 F.3d 63, 67 (1st Cir.2003) (citing <i>Bennett v. Spear,</i> 520 U.S. 154, 167-68, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997)). \"There must be some immediacy or imminence to the threatened injury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 68 (citing <i>City of Los Angeles v. Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983)).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have failed to establish the continuing presence of the requisite threatened injury. The \"perfect storm\" that allegedly precipitated massive arbitrage opportunities for selling Canadian cars in the United States ceased long ago. Plaintiffs' theory of antitrust violation posits that exceptional arbitrage opportunities arose early in this decade due to a combination of relaxed trade restrictions between the United States and Canada, physical harmonization of cars manufactured for the two markets, and a differential between the values of American and Canadian currencies. The last factor has varied since the beginning of the class period, and plaintiffs themselves measure windows of actual arbitrage opportunity in large part according to undulations in exchange rates.</p>\n<p>After the district court certified the injunctive class, it ordered the parties to make submissions regarding proposed end dates for the damages classes. Plaintiffs' expert submitted an affidavit indicating that arbitrage opportunities for Canadian cars significant enough to impact United States prices for new vehicles ended in May 2003. The district court accordingly adopted April 30, 2003 as the endpoint for the state damages classes. <i>Motor Vehicles VI,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 79. Plaintiffs have not made any effort since the district court's ruling to demonstrate whether or when prevailing conditions  primarily, exchange rates between Canada and the United States  might reasonably be expected once again to resemble those during the class period. This is for good reason, as the value of the United States dollar relative to the Canadian dollar in the years 1998-2003 hit an apex unseen in at least <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> the last half century.<sup>[10]</sup> In the nearly five years since April 2003, the time at which plaintiffs concede actual injury to the damages classes abated, the exchange rate has fallen in favor of the Canadian dollar.<sup>[11]</sup> In the circumstances of this case, that alone eliminates any realistic current threat.</p>\n<p>The speculative nature of the claim that exchange rates could one day create additional arbitrage opportunities is reinforced by a second contingency inherent in the plaintiffs' theory of threatened future harm. In order for antitrust injury to befall a class member, she must also intend to purchase a new car at a time when arbitrage opportunities are ripe for exploitation. The district court certified an injunctive class defined as \"[a]ll persons . . . who purchased or leased or intended to purchase or lease a new motor vehicle manufactured by a defendant from a United States dealer during the period from January 1, 2001, to March 10, 2006.\" The complaint names thirty-six individuals who bought or leased new cars in the United States during the class period. Nowhere, however, does the complaint make any allegation regarding a named plaintiffs intention to buy or lease another new vehicle within such a time frame as could be deemed imminent. The fact that the injunctive class has been restricted to a period of time covering 2001 to early 2006 underscores the speculative nature of the plaintiffs' hypothetical future injury.</p>\n<p><i>In McInnis-Misenor v. Maine Medical Center,</i> this court inquired whether the plaintiff faced an \"immedia[te] or imminent\" threat of injury that would support standing in federal court. 319 F.3d at 68. We held that standing was lacking where any possible injury to the plaintiff was \"contingent on several events which may or may not happen.\" <i>Id.</i> at 72. Here, there is nothing to suggest that any named plaintiff harbors an \"imminent\" intention to buy a new car in coincidence with another \"perfect storm\" of arbitrage-friendly market conditions.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs attempt to revive the controversy by arguing that the defendants' conspiracy to hinder cross-border sales is ongoing. Even if this were true, the argument ignores the point that the relevant question is whether plaintiffs suffer a realistic threat of injury stemming from those alleged antitrust violations. An antitrust violation and standing are distinct and independently necessary prerequisites for the relief sought by the injunctive class. <i>See II Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law</i> ¶ 335f, at 297 (2d ed.2000); <i>cf. </i><i>SAS of PR., Inc. v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> 48 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> The Rule 23(b)(2) class is vacated for lack of a live controversy between the parties such as would justify an injunctive remedy. The injunctive relief claim is dismissed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Jurisdiction over Remaining Plaintiff Classes</i></h2>\n<p>The claim for injunctive relief under the Clayton Act provided the federal jurisdictional spine of this case. That basis for federal jurisdiction is now gone, and the question of federal jurisdiction over the state-law damages claims presents itself. It may be that the district court could retain jurisdiction over the state damages claims on either of two theories, but we leave it to the district court to decide on remand whether there is jurisdiction.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>The parties and the district court have referred to diversity, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1332,<sup>[13]</sup> as a basis for maintaining the state damages classes in federal court. To this point in the proceedings, however, the state damages claims have been analyzed as within the court's supplemental jurisdiction based on the presence of the federal claim. <i>See, e.g., Motor Vehicles II,</i> 335 F.Supp.2d 126.<sup>[14]</sup> Whether the diversity basis is sound has not been tested.</p>\n<p>At oral argument, the defendants pointed out that proceeding on the basis of diversity jurisdiction would require analysis of each individual state-based class. Defendants also conceded that diversity could provide an independent basis for federal jurisdiction for at least some of the state-law damages classes. The district court has not had the opportunity to assess whether each state class satisfies the requirements of § 1332 and may do so on remand.</p>\n<p>The district court may, in the alternative, consider whether to exercise its discretion to continue exerting supplemental jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1367, over the state damages claims. <i>See </i><i>Rodríguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp.,</i> 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir.1995) (\"In an appropriate situation, a federal court may retain [supplemental] jurisdiction over state-law claims notwithstanding the early demise of all foundational federal claims.\"). In weighing this option, the district court should consider \"the totality of the attendant circumstances,\" including considerations of judicial economy, fairness to the parties, and the nature of the applicable state law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> On the assumption that there is some basis for federal jurisdiction over at least some remaining state class claims, we turn to the certification of the state damages classes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Standards of Review of Class Certification Decisions</i></h2>\n<p>We review class certification rulings, including those for damages classes, for abuse of discretion. <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 295. This standard has teeth:</p>\n<blockquote>An abuse occurs when a court, in making a discretionary ruling, relies upon an improper factor, omits consideration of a factor entitled to substantial weight, or mulls the correct mix of factors but makes a clear error of judgment in assaying them. An abuse of discretion also occurs if the court adopts an incorrect legal rule.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). Furthermore, a class certification appeal \"can pose pure issues of law reviewed <i>de novo.\" </i><i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 4. Review of mixed questions of law and fact varies from non-deferential review for law-dominated issues to deferential clear-error review for fact-dominated ones. <i>In re PolyMedica Corp. Sec. Litig. (PolyMedica</i>), 432 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <i>Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co.,</i> 63 F.3d 1129, 1132 (1st Cir. 1995)).</p>\n<p>Intertwined with the scope of our review on appeal is the question of how far a district court should go in testing legal and factual premises at the class certification stage. When such premises are disputed, the court may \"probe behind the pleadings,\" <i>Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon,</i> 457 U.S. 147, 160, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982), to \"formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out\" in order to assess whether the proposed class meets the legal requirements for certification, <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 298. In short, \"a court has the power to test disputed premises [at the certification stage] if and when the class action would be proper on one premise but not another.\" <i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 4-5. Here, the premises are challenged as to both steps of plaintiffs' theory.</p>\n<p>In performing this predictive function and in \"[e]xercising its broad discretion, . . . the district court must evaluate the plaintiffs evidence . . . critically without allowing the defendant to turn the classcertification proceeding into an <i>unwieldy</i> trial on the merits.\" <i>PolyMedica,</i> 432 F.3d at 17. However, as both we and other circuit courts have emphasized, weighing whether to certify a plaintiff class may inevitably overlap with some critical assessment regarding the merits of the case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Regents of the Univ. of Col. v. Credit Suisse First Boston (USA), Inc.,</i> 482 F.3d 372, 380 (5th Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___ 128 S.Ct. 1120, 169 L.Ed.2d 957 (2008). It would be contrary to the \"rigorous analysis of the prerequisites established by Rule 23 before certifying a class\" to put blinders on as to an issue simply because it implicates the merits of the case. <i>Smilow v. Sw. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,</i> 323 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir.2003). Our review of a Rule 23(f) appeal necessarily includes \"review [of] the merits of the district court's theory of liability insofar as they also concern issues relevant to class certification.\" <i>Credit Suisse,</i> 482 F.3d at 381.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>State Damages Classes</i></h2>\n<p>A. <i>Procedural History</i></p>\n<p>Applying <i>Illinois Brick v. Illinois,</i> 431 U.S. 720, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977), the district court dismissed the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> plaintiffs' federal antitrust damages claims in March 2004 because plaintiffs were indirect purchasers. <i>Motor Vehicles I,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d at 137. <i>Illinois Brick</i> embodies a policy judgment that the reach of damages for federal antitrust violations does not extend to indirect purchasers, even if they have suffered some impact in fact. See II Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>supra,</i> ¶ 395, at 554-55.</p>\n<p>After dismissal of the federal `damages claim, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint which added damages claims under common and statutory law for all fifty states and the District of Columbia. <i>Motor Vehicles III,</i> 350 F.Supp.2d at 168, 207. After considering for each disputed state <sup>[15]</sup> whether plaintiffs had pled facts sufficient to state a claim under that state's laws, the district court dismissed the state law damages claims for all but twenty-three states and the District of Columbia. <i>Id.</i> at 168. The propriety of that dismissal is not now before us. This appeal is from three orders that did certify state damages classes.</p>\n<p>Before discovery was completed, the plaintiffs moved on July 29, 2005, to certify six exemplar classes of state damages claims.<sup>[16]</sup> On May 12, 2006, the court preliminarily certified five of the six exemplar state damages classes under Rule 23(b)(3) and asked for additional materials regarding the date on which the class period should end. <i>Motor Vehicles IV,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 129.<sup>[17]</sup> On March 21, 2007, the court issued a supplemental order concluding that the class period for the state damages claims should end on April 30, 2003, and certifying fifteen additional state damages classes for a total of twenty. <i>Motor Vehicles VI,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 79, 84. On June 15, 2007, the court issued an order and explanatory memorandum under Rule 23(c)(1)(B) defining the class and class claims, issues, and defenses. <i>Motor Vehicles VII,</i> 243 F.R.D. 17; Motor Vehicles VIII, 243 F.R.D. 20.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Requirements for Class Certification</i></p>\n<p>To certify the statewide damages classes, the district court had to evaluate whether the four threshold requirements of Rule 23(a) were met, as well as whether Rule 23(b)(3)'s two additional prerequisites were satisfied. <i>Amchem,</i> 521 U.S. at 614, 117 S.Ct. 2231; <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 38. Rule 23(a) requires that (1) there be numerosity, (2) there be common questions of law or fact, (3) the class representative's claims be typical of the class, and (4) the representative's representation of the class be adequate. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). To certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), a judge must further find \"that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members\" (\"predominance\"), and that \"a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy\" (\"superiority\"). Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). In classes certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the Rules \"invite[] a close look at the case before it is accepted as a class action.\" <i>Amchem,</i> 521 U.S. at 615, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (quoting B. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> Kaplan, <i>Continuing Work of the Civil Committee: 1966 Amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (I),</i> 81 Harv. L.Rev. 356, 390 (1967)).</p>\n<p>The court held that numerosity was not disputed and that adequacy was established. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 130, 141. It also concluded that a class action was by far the superior method for proceeding. <i>Id.</i> at 148. The real dispute revolved around whether common evidence could be used to prove the impact of the alleged conspiracy on U.S. consumers (\"common impact\") and any resulting damages (\"common proof of damages\"). <i>Id.</i> at 129, 132.<sup>[18]</sup> The court noted it did not yet have enough evidence to determine the merits question of whether the plaintiff classes actually suffered antitrust or consumer protection injury. It repeatedly emphasized it would address that question later on a proper record  for example, at summary judgment.<sup>[19]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 131, 136, 139.</p>\n<p>As the district court noted, there is some overlap among the certification criteria of commonality, Rule 23(a)(2), typicality, Rule 23(a)(3), and predominance, Rule 23(b)(3). <i>Id.</i> at 130 n. 4 (\"[I]f the proof of impact is not common across the class, then not only is the named plaintiffs' claim of injury not typical, but the predominance assessment is also affected.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Amchem,</i> 521 U.S. at 623 n. 18, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (predominance and typicality are similar in some respects); 6 A. Conte &amp; H.B. Newberg, <i>Newberg on Class Actions</i> § 18:8, at 24 n. 2 (4th ed.2002). The questions in this case of common impact (antitrust-type causation) and common proof of damages are relevant to all three criteria.</p>\n<p>Rule 23(a)'s requirement of commonality is a low bar, and courts have generally given it a \"permissive application.\" 7A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 1763, at 221 (3d ed.2005). The district court did not have trouble finding sufficient commonality in this case. The court pointed to the common questions of whether there was a conspiracy; if so, whether it affected either dealer invoice prices or MSRPs; and whether there was any violation of state antitrust or consumer protection laws. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 130; <i>see also</i> 6 Conte &amp; Newberg, supra, § 18:5, at 14 &amp; n. 3 (gathering cases that hold that \"allegations concerning the existence, scope, and efficacy of an alleged conspiracy present questions adequately <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> common to class members to satisfy the commonality requirement\").</p>\n<p>\"[T]he predominance criterion is far more demanding,\" however, than the commonality requirement. <i>Amchem,</i> 521 U.S. at 624, 117 S.Ct. 2231. Under the predominance inquiry, \"a district court must formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate in a given case.\" <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 298. In antitrust class actions, common issues do not predominate if the fact of antitrust violation and the fact of antitrust impact cannot be established through common proof. <i>See </i><i>Blades v. Monsanto Co.,</i> 400 F.3d 562, 566 (8th Cir.2005). The district court did not find predominance and typicality as easily established as commonality. The court chose to analyze under the heading of typicality whether plaintiffs were asserting sufficiently common proof of impact, <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 130-40, and it considered under the heading of predominance whether any resulting damages would likewise be established by sufficiently common proof, <i>id.</i> at 142-45. In consideration of these issues, the district court relied on the submissions of the parties' experts.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Submissions of Expert Witnesses</i></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs relied primarily on their expert Professor Robert E. Hall of Stanford University and the Hoover Institute, who, along with the defense expert, assumed that plaintiffs' allegations of conspiracy were true. In his July 2005 report, Professor Hall noted that collectively the defendants' sales accounted for 89% of the U.S. market and 84% of the Canadian market. He concluded that \"if defendants were unable to impose export restraints or were less effective in imposing them, they would [have] lower[ed] U.S. [dealer] invoice prices and MSRPs for most, if not all, of their vehicles.\" Expert Report of Robert E. Hall, Ph.D. ¶ 51. Even though retail sales of cars are individually negotiated, Professor Hall opined that class members would have experienced common impact from the changed MSRPs and dealer invoice prices because a change in these prices would shift the entire negotiating range, benefiting (or harming) essentially all consumers.</p>\n<p>Professor Hall initially proposed two different approaches to establishing common evidence of damages to class members. The first approach would be to rely on statistical models (\"Nash equilibriums\") used in the auto industry to predict market outcomes. Under his second approach, a benchmark method, the U.S.Canadian market would be evaluated against a comparable market not affected by the challenged conduct. Both approaches, Professor Hall asserted, would account for \"heterogeneity across vehicles, dealers, consumers, and time, [and] they can be used to identify cars or time periods for which there are no damages.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 62. Professor Hall also asserted that data existed that would allow him to implement these models, though the most detailed data were in the hands of defendants.</p>\n<p>The defense expert,' Professor Joseph P. Kalt of Harvard University, filed his expert report on September 30, 2005. Even assuming a conspiracy, he disputed that there was any common impact on either the national manufacturer-to-dealer prices or the individual dealer-to-consumer sales. His critique focused on a description of the actual gray market for Canadian vehicles in the United States, which he asserted was spotty, erratic, and too insignificant to affect the national market, even absent any collusive activity. He also criticized Professor Hall for not distinguishing between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> the effects of the manufacturers' legal vertical restraints and those of the alleged horizontal conspiracy. As to damages, he disputed that there were any common methods of proof and asserted that Professor Hall's suggested approach of employing Nash equilibriums was just \"an empty phrase.\" Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt, Ph.D. 63-64.</p>\n<p>In reply to Professor Kalt's critique, Professor Hall submitted a rebuttal report on December 20, 2005. He took issue with Professor Kalt's conclusions regarding the gray market<sup>[20]</sup> and, applying regression analysis to Professor Kalt's data on arbitrage opportunity and export activity, concluded that \"a larger price gap [between Canadian and United States car prices] is associated with greater export activity and that this relationship is not the result of randomness.\" Rebuttal Report of Robert E. Hall, Ph.D. ¶ 25. Specifically, his regressions suggested that \"a $1,000. increase in the price gap for a given model [of car] is, on average, associated with an increase in exports of at least 33 percent.\" Id. ¶ 24. The minor increase in gray market sales in 2001-2002 despite the conceded greater arbitrage opportunities, then, did not indicate the lack of a conspiracy, but rather suggested an effective one.</p>\n<p>Professor Hall argued that a Nash equilibrium model could distinguish the effects of unilateral restraints from those of any horizontal conspiracy, and he also suggested that further discovery might reduce the need for. modeling by yielding direct evidence on the effectiveness of the unilateral and alleged horizontal constraints. He stated that he had offered preliminary mathematical formulas at his deposition to establish the viability of both this approach and the approach of his proposed damages model, and he included the preliminary damages model in his rebuttal report. Professor Hall again asserted his view that there were methods based on common evidence, such as the econometric model he was proposing, that could account for the \"major dimensions in which damages might vary among potential class members.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 50.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Typicality and Predominance</i></p>\n<p>On this evidence, the district court preliminarily certified five exemplar state classes. The court held that the presentation by Professor Hall, supported by extrinsic economic studies, sufficed for purposes of showing common proof of impact.<sup>[21]</sup> The court found \"unexceptionable\" the plaintiffs' theory that other things being equal, a restriction on the supply of lower-priced cars coming into the United States market will exert an upward pressure on domestic car prices. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 137. This pressure will apply both to the prices dealers pay to manufacturers and to the prices paid by consumers to dealers. While individual negotiations may determine the final price, the starting point for most negotiations is the MSRP, and the final purchase price for most consumers is between the dealer invoice price and the MSRP. <i>Id.</i> In effect, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> overall negotiating range would be elevated, resulting in higher consumer prices across the board. <i>Id.</i> at 138-39. The court accepted some of these contentions as adequate to demonstrate that the named plaintiffs' claims would be typical of the class, although the court was careful to note that it was not then deciding whether plaintiffs' proof of impact was sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 139.</p>\n<p>The court was also careful to note that the proffered common proof of impact might be insufficient under some states' laws. <i>Id.</i> at 132. The court sua sponte examined the laws of five of the exemplar states to determine what level of proof of consumer impact each state required and what inferences were acceptable to show impact.<sup>[22]</sup> The court concluded that there was a range. California, at one end, permitted \"an inference of antitrust impact, even as to indirect purchasers, from the existence of the conspiracy.\"<sup>[23]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 135; <i>see also id.</i> (\"In the consumer context, at least a portion of the illegal overcharge by a manufacturer will presumably be passed on by the independent distributors to consumer class members in the form of higher prices.\" (quoting <i>Global Minerals &amp; Metals Corp. v. Superior Court,</i> 113 Cal. App.4th 836, 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 28, 44-45 (2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Maine was at the other end of the spectrum, requiring evidence, not inference, of impact. While the Maine antitrust statute explicitly permits recovery for indirect injury, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1104, the Maine Law Court has not yet commented on what indirect purchasers must show to establish impact or causation. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 132. The district court turned to Maine superior court decisions, which the court summarized as holding that \"indirect purchasers in Maine must produce specific proof that they paid higher prices as a result of the conspiracy (in the face of the possibility that all such increases were absorbed at the retailer level).\" Id. at 134; <i>see also id.</i> (\"Because indirect purchasers must demonstrate that overcharges have been passed on to them, such claims present an entirely separate level of evidence and proof than that found in a direct purchaser claim.\" (quoting <i>Melnick v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> Nos. CV-99-709, CV-99-752, 2001 WL 1012261, at *6 (Me.Super.Ct. Aug. 24, 2001))). Likewise, the Maine consumer protection statute, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, §§ 205-A to 214, allows indirect purchasers to recover, but injury is not presumed. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 135 (citing <i>State v. Weinschenk,</i> 868 A.2d 200 (Me.2005)).</p>\n<p>The court also discussed the states that fell between those two poles. New Mexico, it concluded, seems to allow indirect purchasers to establish antitrust impact through correlation analysis. <i>See id.</i> at 136. Tennessee and Vermont have not yet fully addressed the question. <i>See id.</i> The court noted that in states like Maine where the passing on of an antitrust or consumer protection injury to indirect purchasers cannot be presumed, plaintiffs might have difficulty proving injury to individual consumers if their common proof can establish only an inference of injury. <i>See id.</i> at 139.</p>\n<p>Turning to the question of predominance under Rule 23(b)(3), the court found there were at least five common disputed issues <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> weighing in favor of class certification.<sup>[24]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 142. Defendants argued that the lack of common impact at both stages of plaintiffs' theory and the lack of common proof of damages defeat predominance. The court reiterated that it had found plaintiffs' proposal to prove impact through common proof preliminarily sufficient, and it pointed out that the existence of a common disputed issue weighs in favor of class, certification, not against it, <i>Id.</i> at 142 (citing <i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 4-5). The adequacy of plaintiffs' proof of common impact, and whether the impact even constitutes cognizable antitrust or consumer protection injury, \"are merits determinations that are common in each [state] class\" and would be resolved at trial. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The court also disagreed that the question of individual damages defeats the predominance of common questions. First, the court noted that \"[w]here, as here, common questions predominate regarding liability, then courts generally find the predominance requirement to be satisfied even if individual damages issues remain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 143 (quoting <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40). Second, the court stated that it would not determine at the class certification stage whether plaintiffs' method of proving damages was adequate. <i>Id.</i> at 144. The mere fact that there are differences among members of a class regarding their individual amounts of damages does not preclude class certification. <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40 (\"The individuation of damages in consumer class actions is rarely determinative under Rule 23(b)(3).\"); 7B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Mary Kay Kane, <i>supra,</i> § 1781, at 235. Often those variations can be determined according to a universal mathematical or formulaic calculation, obviating the need for evidentiary hearings on each individual claim. <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40. Plaintiffs proposed to use such an approach here. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 143-44. The district court, noted that it was \"not overwhelmed by the plaintiffs' offer of damage calculation models,\" but it \"conclude[d] that damages [were] not yet a ground to deny certification.\" <i>Id.</i> at 144-45; <i>see also id.</i> at 145 n. 63 (specifying some of the problems plaintiffs' damages models faced).</p>\n<p>Finally, the district court raised the question of the end date for the damages classes. <i>Id.</i> at 140. Another round of expert reports ensued, accompanied by briefing repeating many of the same arguments. The court focused on the choice of end date in its March 21, 2007 order; it commented that the defendants' additional critiques did not alter its views that a class should be certified.<sup>[25]</sup><i>Motor Vehicles VI,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 80-82. Over defendants' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> insistence that the court determine whether the \"alleged horizontal conspiracy actually impacted American car prices,\" the court refused to reexamine the issue  as well as the related issue of \"what vertical restraints the individual manufacturers maintained, their legality and their effect\"  at that time. <i>Id.</i> at 80-82 &amp; n. 5. On June 15, 2007, the court entered an order of class certification in compliance with Rule 23(c)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>B. <i>Defendants' Appeals from Certification of the Damages Classes</i></p>\n<p>In challenging the certification of the state damages classes, defendants primarily argue that the district court did not engage in a sufficiently searching inquiry into the relevant merits issues. It is a settled question that some inquiry into the merits at the class certification stage is not only permissible but appropriate to the extent that the merits overlap the Rule 23 criteria. <i>Falcon,</i> 457 U.S. at 160, 102 S.Ct. 2364; <i>PolyMedica,</i> 432 F.3d at 6; <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 297-98. It is less settled what degree of merits inquiry is <i>required</i> at the class certification stage, and the Supreme Court has not yet addressed the issue.</p>\n<p>Our sister circuits agree that when class criteria and merits overlap, the district court must conduct a searching inquiry regarding the Rule 23 criteria, but how they articulate the necessary degree of inquiry ranges along a spectrum which suggests substantial differences. The Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits coalesce around the more rigorous end of this spectrum, forbidding district courts from relying on plaintiffs' allegations of sufficiently common proof and requiring the courts to make specific findings that each Rule 23 criterion is met. <i>Miles v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. (In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec. Litig.</i>), 471 F.3d 24, 33, 41 (2d Cir.2006) [hereinafter <i>In re IPO</i>] (requiring a \"definitive assessment of Rule 23 requirements,\" including the resolution of relevant factual disputes); <i>Unger v. Amedisys Inc.,</i> 401 F.3d 316, 321-22 (5th Cir. 2005) (requiring courts to find facts favoring class certification through the use of \"rigorous, though preliminary, standards of proof); <i>Gariety v. Grant Thornton, LLP,</i> 368 F.3d 356, 366 (4th Cir.2004) (requiring that \"the factors spelled out in Rule 23 . . . be addressed through findings\"); <i>Szabo v. Bridgeport Machs., Inc.,</i> 249 F.3d 672, 675-76 (7th Cir.2001) (requiring \"whatever factual and legal inquiries are necessary under Rule 23\" to \"resolve the disputes before deciding whether to certify the class\"). These circuits' use of the term \"findings\" in this context should not be confused with binding findings on the merits. The judge's consideration of merits issues at the class certification stage pertains only to that stage; the ultimate factfinder, whether judge or jury, must still reach its own determination on these issues. <i>In re IPO,</i> 471 F.3d at 39; Gariety, 368 F.3d at 366.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the Third and Eighth Circuits sometimes require an inquiry into and preliminary resolution of disputes, but they do not require findings and do not hold that such inquiry will always be necessary. <i>Blades,</i> 400 F.3d at 567, 575 (holding that sometimes courts will be required to resolve factual disputes preliminarily at the class certification stage but voicing caution); <i>Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.,</i> 259 F.3d 154, 166 (3d Cir.2001) (\"A class certification decision requires a thorough examination of the factual and legal allegations.\"); <i>id.</i> at 168 (\"In reviewing a motion for class certification, a preliminary inquiry into the merits is sometimes necessary to determine whether the alleged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> claims can be properly resolved as a class action.\").</p>\n<p>This court has grappled with this issue as well. We have said in <i>Smilow</i> that \"a district court must conduct a rigorous analysis\" of Rule 23's prerequisites, 323 F.3d at 38, and in <i>Mowbray</i> that \"a district court must formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out,\" 208 F.3d at 298. <i>See also </i><i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 4-5 (noting that the common presumption at early stages of litigation that \"the complaint's allegations are necessarily controlling\" does not apply in class certification situations because \"class action machinery is expensive and in our view a court has the power to test disputed premises early on if and when the class action would be proper on one premise but not another\").</p>\n<p>In <i>PolyMedica,</i> a securities class action, we said that the court \"was entitled to look beyond the pleadings in its evaluation\" of both the question of class certification generally and the applicability of the fraud-onthe-market presumption specifically, even though those questions overlapped with the merits of the case. <i>PolyMedica,</i> 432 F.3d at 6. The fraud-on-the-market presumption in securities class actions allows plaintiffs to establish the necessary element of reliance through common proof. If the market is efficient, the theory goes, market prices will incorporate all publicly available information, including material misrepresentations, so that an investor who buys or sells stock in reliance on the integrity of the market price is in fact buying or selling stock in reliance on the material misrepresentations. <i>See id.</i> at 7-8. Because common issues would no longer predominate in a securities class action if plaintiffs could not at trial establish reliance through the common proof of the fraud-on-the-market presumption, courts at the class certification stage probe the factual basis of the fraud-on-the-market presumption to make sure it will be a viable form of proof in a given case.</p>\n<p>In both <i>PolyMedica</i> and its companion case, <i>Stuebler v. Xcelera.Com (In re Xcelera.com Sec. Litig.</i>), 430 F.3d 503 (1st Cir.2005), we, along with the district court, rigorously tested the evidence submitted by both sides to determine whether the fraud-on-the-market presumption was reasonably applicable, specifically whether the plaintiffs would be able to demonstrate that the market was efficient. At the class certification stage, we noted, plaintiffs needed to present \"basic facts\" that the fraud-on-the-market presumption could be invoked, even though its actual applicability was to be resolved at trial. <i>PolyMedica,</i> 432 F.3d at 19. Our review of the district court's determination of whether or not the fraud-on-the-market presumption could be invoked was based not on the level of detail in the district court's explanation, but on \"whether the evidence supports its determination to apply the presumption.\" <i>Xcelera,</i> 430 F.3d at 512. In <i>Xcelera,</i> for example, the district court actively evaluated the testimony of two competing experts and preliminarily credited the plaintiffs' expert, a determination this court upheld  after surveying the expert testimony ourselves  on clear error review. <i>Id.</i> at 512-16.</p>\n<p><i>PolyMedica</i> and <i>Xcelera</i> could be read, but we think not properly, as limiting this requirement that district courts probe into the viability of the premises of plaintiffs' theory of injury to cases employing only legal presumptions of injury. Under this circuit's approach, in our view, a searching inquiry is in order where there are not only disputed basic facts, but also a novel theory of legally cognizable injury. Plaintiffs cannot make their case without common proof of causation, and they can only prove causation through common means if their novel theory is viable; that viability <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> in turn depends on their ability to establish  whether through mathematical models or further data or other means  the key logical steps behind their theory. Such reliance on a novel theory to establish a primary element of a claim necessitates a more searching inquiry into whether plaintiffs will be able to prove the pivotal elements of their theory at trial. This is especially so when a case implicates the sort of factors that we have deemed important in the Rule 23(f) calculus, namely, when the granting of class status \"raises the stakes of litigation so substantially that the defendant likely will feel irresistible pressure to settle.\" <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 293.</p>\n<p>We do not need to resolve now whether \"findings\" regarding the class certification criteria are ever necessary, but we do hold that when a Rule 23 requirement relies on a novel or complex theory as to injury, as the predominance inquiry does in this case, the district court must engage in a searching inquiry into the viability of that theory and the existence of the facts necessary for the theory to succeed.</p>\n<p>Contrary to defendants' assertions, the district court did not believe itself limited by <i>Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin,</i> 417 U.S. 156, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974), to non-merits inquiries. Instead, the court attempted to meet its obligations under <i>PolyMedica, Mowbray,</i> and our other cases to conduct a rigorous analysis at the certification stage. <i>See Motor Vehicles V,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 81 n. 7. The court's ability to probe into the viability of plaintiffs' proffered theory and to formulate some predictions as to how key issues in this novel and complex case would develop was hampered, however, by the incomplete record at the time, as well as by the fact that plaintiffs' expert had not yet fully formulated all aspects of his analysis. The court pointed out that it was ruling on class certification before discovery was completed and was relying upon the plaintiffs' representation that they would fill in the gaps in their evidence with further discovery and further work. It repeatedly said that it was willing to take another look at these questions when the record was more complete.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>This court has had little occasion to discuss the timing of the issuance of class certification orders, much less of damages classes under Rule 23(b)(3). See <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 299 n. 7. Rule 23(c)(1)(A) says only that the court must act \"at an early practicable time.\" Rule 23(c)(1)(C) also provides that a class certification order may be altered or amended before final judgment.<sup>[27]</sup> A district court which has taken an initial look at the merits is not foreclosed from later entertaining, post-discovery, a summary judgment motion from defendants asserting that plaintiffs cannot establish the requisite antitrust and consumer protection impact through common means. See 3 Conte &amp; Newberg, <i>supra,</i> § 7:15, at 48-57. Indeed, it is not uncommon to defer final decision on certifications pending completion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> of relevant discovery. <i>Id.</i> § 7:16, at 57-59.</p>\n<p>When the decision on class certification is made before full class discovery has been completed, as here, it is necessarily more predictive. As the Eighth Circuit has noted, the decision may require revisiting upon completion of full discovery. <i>Blades,</i> 400 F.3d at 567; see <i>also </i><i>Gariety,</i> 368 F.3d at 368.</p>\n<p>In another case, this posture of certification being decided before completion of class discovery might not raise any concerns. In this case it does because of the novelty and complexity of the theories advanced and the gaps in the evidence proffered. The district court expressed multiple times its concern about the adequacy of several of plaintiffs' showings and expressed a willingness to revisit the question once it had a better record in front of it. We share those concerns.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' theory of impact on indirect purchasers is both novel and complex. Injury in price-fixing cases is sometimes not difficult to establish. Plaintiffs do not, however, advance such a price-fixing theory. Rather, the plaintiffs' theory is that the higher prices are the result of a \"butfor\" world. In step one of plaintiffs theory, but for the defendants' illegal stifling of competition, the manufacturers would have had to set dealer invoice prices and MSRPs lower to avoid losing sales to the lower-priced Canadian cars coming across the border for resale in the United States. In step two, the higher dealer invoice prices and MSRPs enabled by this stifling of competition resulted in injury to consumers in the form of higher retail prices.</p>\n<p>The first step of plaintiffs' theory requires demonstrating that the, defendants' actions did result in an increase in dealer invoice prices and MSRPs in the United States. This in turn depends on at least two factors. First, there would have had to be, in this but-for world, a flood of significantly lower-priced Canadian cars coming across the border for resale in the United States during times of arbitrage opportunities, enough cars to cause manufacturers to take steps to protect the American market from this competition by decreasing nationally set prices. As plaintiffs themselves note, without a very large number of cars poised, to cross the border, a nationwide impact on the automobile market of the sort required by plaintiffs' theory is implausible, and the theory collapses. In our view, plaintiffs' expert Professor Hall had not yet, at the time of class certification, fully answered such potentially relevant questions as how the size of the but-for influx of cars would be established or how large that influx would have to be to affect the national market sufficiently to raise effective dealer invoice prices and MSRPs.</p>\n<p>Second, the plaintiffs must be able to sort out the effects of any permissible vertical restraints from the effects of the alleged, impermissible horizontal conspiracy. This question was raised below but was not fully addressed. Professor Hall asserted in a purely conclusory manner that the effects could be separated out using the concept of Nash equilibriums. If plaintiffs do not have a viable, means for distinguishing between these two sets of effects, they cannot show that it was the horizontal conspiracy that caused the impact on the domestic national market upon which their theory depends.<sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> As for the second step of plaintiffs' theory, it must include some means of determining that each member of the class was in fact injured, even if the amount of each individual injury could be determined in a separate proceeding. Predominance is not defeated by individual damages questions as long as liability is still subject to common proof. <i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 6; <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40; 6 Conte &amp; Newberg, supra, § 18:27, at 91. This is because the class action can be limited to the question of liability, leaving damages for later individualized determinations. <i>See </i><i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 7; <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 41; 6 Conte &amp; Newberg, <i>supra,</i> § 18:53, at 179 &amp; n. 10, § 18:56, at 190-92.<sup>[29]</sup> Establishing liability, however, still requires showing that class members were injured at the consumer level. It is unclear to us how plaintiffs intend to make this connection.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs might intend to use their damages model to prove both fact of damages and the measure of those damages. If so, the district court would need enough information to evaluate preliminarily whether the proposed model will be able to establish, without need for individual determinations for the many millions of potential class members, which consumers were impacted by the alleged antitrust violation and which were not. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Blades,</i> 400 F.3d at 570 (affirming denial of class status where the actual prices paid by class members could not be determined via common proof because \"[t]he amount of premiums paid, if any, is relevant to a determination of impact . . . and is not merely an assessment of the amount of damages, which may be properly ascertained at a later time\"); <i>Newton,</i> 259 F.3d at 187-88 (affirming denial of class status where plaintiffs had not only provided no model formula for measuring damages, but more fundamentally had also not demonstrated the <i>fact</i> of damages). \"The ability to calculate the aggregate amount of damages,\" as plaintiffs propose to do here, \"does not absolve plaintiffs from the duty to prove each [class member] was harmed by the defendants' practice.\" <i>Newton,</i> 259 F.3d at 188.</p>\n<p>The district court, while expressing skepticism regarding plaintiffs' proposal for measuring damages, relied on this court's consideration in <i>Smilow</i> of an incomplete damages model. It noted that in Smilow, this court had accepted as sufficient a representation by plaintiffs' expert that he \"could fashion\" a computerized method of calculating class damages. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 144 (quoting <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40) (internal quotation marks omitted). The proposed computerized model in <i>Smilow</i> would draw from the defendant's records, which listed the consumers who were charged the allegedly illegal fees. <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40-41. That is, the model would have relied on data that clearly established which consumers suffered injury. Professor Hall similarly claimed that data in defendants' hands would provide the information he would need for his damages model; whether that data will be sufficient to establish consumer-level impact for each class member is a question that can now be answered with discovery completed.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> Plaintiffs seem to rely on an inference that any upward pressure on national pricing would necessarily raise the prices actually paid by individual consumers. There is intuitive appeal to this theory, but intuitive appeal is not enough. Even if it is fair to assume that hard bargainers will usually pay prices closer to the dealer invoice price and poor negotiators will usually pay prices closer to the MSRP, a minimal increase in national pricing would not necessarily mean that all consumers would pay more. Too many factors play into an individual negotiation to allow an assumption  at least without further theoretical development  that any price increase or decrease will always have the same magnitude of effect on the final price paid. Even if Professor Hall's proposed models could determine when MSRPs and dealer invoice prices were affected for which models and to what degree, it is a further question whether it can be presumed that all purchasers of those affected cars paid higher retail prices.</p>\n<p>Some courts have allowed a presumption of class-wide impact in price-fixing cases when \"the price structure in the industry is such that nationwide the conspiratorially affected prices at the wholesale level fluctuated within a range which, though different in different regions, was higher in all regions than the range which would have existed in all regions under competitive conditions.\" <i>Winoff Indus., Inc. v. Stone Container Corp. (In re Linderboard Antitrust Litig.</i>), 305 F.3d 145, 151 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting <i>Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp.,</i> 561 F.2d 434, 455 (3d.Cir.1977)). If effective dealer invoice prices in the real world were equal to or greater than the effective MSRPs in the but-for world  that is, if the entire negotiating range in the but-for world would have been below the entire negotiating range in the real world  it would be easier to presume that all consumers suffered impact. The district court discussed the <i>Bogosian</i> presumption in its May 12, 2006 order, <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 138 n. 35, but plaintiffs disclaim any intent to rely on the <i>Bogosian</i> model.</p>\n<p>It is true that the validity of plaintiffs' theory is a common disputed issue. <i>Cf. </i><i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 4-5. It will be for the fact finder to decide whether this theory is persuasive. At the class certification stage, however, the district court must still ensure that the plaintiffs' presentation of their case will be through means amenable to the class action mechanism. We are looking here not for hard factual proof, but for a more thorough explanation of <i>how</i> the pivotal evidence behind plaintiffs theory can be established. If there is no realistic means of proof, many resources will be wasted setting up a trial that plaintiffs cannot win.</p>\n<p>In sum, the district court's oft-expressed instinct that aspects of plaintiffs' theory remained to be developed dovetails with our own. At the time of class certification, more work remained to be done in the building of plaintiffs' damages model and the filling out of all steps of plaintiffs' theory of impact. Time has now passed; it is almost two years since the district court's May 12, 2006 order, and all discovery was scheduled to be completed by March 3, 2008. The plaintiffs should now have the evidence they need to put their best foot forward, and they have had additional time to work out their models and formulas. The district court should now have a complete record before it from which to test the viability of plaintiffs' novel theory for proving common impact.</p>\n<p>We thus vacate and remand the certification of the state damages classes so that the district court, which has handled this case admirably so far, may reconsider those class certification orders in light of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> this opinion and the more fully developed record.</p>\n<p>We reverse in part, vacate in part, remand in part, and order dismissal of the Clayton Act injunctive relief claim. All parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, (Concurring in part, Dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Although I concur with the majority regarding the injunctive class, I respectfully dissent from the discussion of the state damages classes.<sup>[30]</sup> In my view, the opinion erodes the discretion which we are required to afford to the district court in class certification proceedings. A district court's decision to certify a class is reviewed under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <i>See </i><i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 37 (\"Orders certifying or decertifying a class are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\") (citing <i>Califano v. Yamasaki,</i> 442 U.S. 682, 703, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979)); <i>see also </i><i>Blyden v. Mancusi</i> 186 F.3d 252, 269 (2d Cir.1999) (\"A district court's decision to certify a class is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and `[a] reviewing court must exercise even greater deference when the district court has certified a class than when it has declined to do so.' \"(citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>Rule 23 grants the district court broad discretion to determine whether a class should be certified. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23. Our review is, therefore, focused on whether the district court properly applied the criteria set out in Rule 23. <i>See </i><i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 295 (\"An abuse occurs when a court, in making a discretionary ruling, relies upon an improper factor, omits consideration of a factor entitled to substantial weight, or mulls the correct mix of factors but makes a clear error of judgment in assaying them.\"). Importantly, a district court remains free at a later stage to modify or even decertify a class if later evidence disproves the plaintiffs' assertions regarding, for example, the predominance of common issues. <i>See </i><i>Falcon,</i> 457 U.S. at 160, 102 S.Ct. 2364 (\"Even after a certification order is entered, the judge remains free to modify it in the light of subsequent developments in the litigation.\"); <i>In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig.,</i> 280 F.3d 124, 141 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>In this case, the district court addressed all of the Rule 23 requirements: numerosity of the class members; commonality of the questions of law or fact; typicality of the claims or defenses; adequacy of representation; predominance of common questions; and the superiority of the class action as an adjudicative vehicle. And, as required in this circuit, the district court \"conduct[ed] a rigorous analysis of the prerequisites established by Rule 23,\" <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 38, and \"formulate[d] some prediction as to how specific issues w[ould] play out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate,\" <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 298.</p>\n<p>The majority does not question the rigor with which the court conducted its analysis. Indeed, the opinion applauds the court's \"attempt[] to meet its obligations . . . to conduct a rigorous analysis at the certification stage.\" Slip op. at 26. Rather, the basis for the majority's remand on the certification of the damages classes is the insufficiency of evidence available to the district court. Although the opinion faults the timing of the certification (and, thus the incompleteness of the record), I am concerned that in vacating and remanding the certification order for reconsideration with additional evidence from the plaintiffs, the opinion stands for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> proposition that we now require a high level of fact-finding before certification.</p>\n<p>I agree with the district court that our case law does not \"mandat[e] a particular level of factfinding by the district judge at the certification stage.\" <i>Motor Vehicles VI,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 82 n. 7. On the contrary, in <i>PolyMedica,</i> we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote>The question of how much evidence . . . is necessary for a court to, accept the [theory of reliance] at the class certification stage is therefore one of degree. District courts must <i>draw these lines sensibly</i>. . . . We have no illusions that this line-drawing is easy. Knowing the high stakes in the class-certification decision, the parties will try to move the court in different directions, with plaintiffs arguing for less evidence . . . and defendants for more . . . the district court must evaluate the plaintiffs evidence . . . critically without allowing the defendant to turn the class certification proceeding into an <i>unwieldy trial on the merits.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>432 F.3d at 17 (emphasis added). The district court drew those lines sensibly in this case. We are not entitled to second-guess that decision in the absence of evidence that it engaged in an abuse of discretion. Our decision to vacate and remand the certification of the damages classes to allow the district court the benefit of full discovery, effectively overrides the district court's assessment of how much evidence it needed to certify the class. Under the banner of a \"novel and complex\" theory in a class certification proceeding, we now appear to require district courts to fully vet and test the underpinnings of a plaintiffs legal theory. <i>See</i> slip op. at ___ (\"[I]n our view, a searching inquiry is in order where there are not only disputed basic facts, but also a novel theory of legally cognizable injury.\").</p>\n<p>At issue in this case are questions regarding the plaintiffs' theory of impact. Although the district court admitted some concern about whether the plaintiffs' proof of impact would be \"sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment or for judgment as a matter of law at trial,\" <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 139, the district court properly remained focused on the certification requirements and concluded that \"the plaintiffs' proof does meet the commonality and typicality standard.\" <i>Id.</i> The majority even admits that these questions regarding the plaintiffs' theory of impact \"are themselves susceptible to common proof (the potential size of the gray market and the distinction between the effects of horizontal and vertical restraints).\" Slip op. at 28 n. 29. The opinion goes on, however, to conclude that a more searching inquiry into the <i>factual basis</i> of that theory is required here. I disagree.</p>\n<p>In this case, the questions regarding the viability of the plaintiffs' theory of impact are not limited to certification issues, but go to the merits of the plaintiffs' claim. I disagree with the majority's reading of <i>PolyMedica</i> and <i>Xcelera,</i> which they cite in support of their position that \"factual bases of theories of common proof are appropriately, although preliminarily, tested at the class certification stage.\" <i>Id. PolyMedica</i> and <i>Xcelera</i> were securities class actions in which the plaintiffs sought to use the fraud-on-the-market presumption to demonstrate market efficiency. Those class actions were brought under § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, which require that each plaintiff prove that he or she individually relied on the alleged misrepresentation. A requirement of individualized reliance \"would effectively preclude securities fraud class actions under Rule 23(b)(3) [because] [i]ndividual issues of reliance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> would necessarily overwhelm the common ones.\" <i>Xcelera,</i> 430 F.3d at 507. The applicability of the fraud-on-the-market theory is central to the appropriateness of the class action as a vehicle for litigation: under the theory, plaintiffs are no longer required to prove individualized reliance. <i>See </i><i>PolyMedica,</i> 432 F.3d at 18-19 (vacating and remanding the class certification after concluding that the district court had committed error in adopting the incorrect definition of \"market efficiency,\" one of the elements for invoking the fraud-on-the-market presumption). In this antitrust case, the majority points to no legal error committed by the district court in assessing the appropriateness of certification.</p>\n<p>In remanding the certification of the damages classes for reconsideration with the benefit of additional evidence, the majority conflates the dispute as to the viability of the plaintiffs' theory with the specific inquiries required at class certification. As we noted in <i>PolyMedica,</i> \"a court has the power to test disputed premises early on <i>if and when the class action would be proper on one premise but not another.\" </i><i>PolyMedica,</i> 432 F.3d at 6 (quoting Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 4-5) (emphasis added). Indeed, insofar as those premises are not preclusive of the class action as a vehicle, we have no basis for requiring a district court to inquire further into the merits of the case. While the plaintiffs' theory of antitrust impact is novel and complex, it, unlike the fraud-on-the-market theory, is not determinative of whether a class action is proper or not. Indeed, the identified uncertainties within the plaintiffs' theory challenge only the ability of the plaintiffs (as a group) to successfully prove their theory of impact. Slip op. at 26-28. In this case, an inquiry that tests each stage of the plaintiffs' theory is, in effect, an assessment of the case's merits. As such, we are putting the cart before the horse and turning the class certification stage into a motion for summary judgment proceeding  the appropriate juncture at which to fully vet the viability of the plaintiffs' theory. In so holding today, I fear that we are removing the underpinnings of the discretion we grant district courts to draw sensible lines and further blurring the distinction between the certification inquiry and a trial on the merits. I believe this course is erroneous and contrary to established precedent, and thus dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court observed that \"it is reasonable to infer that the proposed federal injunctive class numbers in the millions\"; the defendants have represented to the district court that the proposed class includes \"more than a hundred million American consumers.\" <i>In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litig. (Motor Vehicles IV</i>), No. MDL 1532, 2006 WL 623591, at *2 &amp; n. 19 (D.Me. Mar. 10, 2006).</p>\n<p>[2]  Arbitrage describes the practice of simultaneously buying and selling identical securities, currency, or other assets in different markets, \"with the hope of profiting from the price difference in those markets.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 112 (8th ed.2004).</p>\n<p>[3]  A gray market is one \"in which the seller uses legal but sometimes unethical methods to avoid a manufacturer's distribution chain and thereby sell goods (esp. imported goods) at prices lower than those envisioned by the manufacturer.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 989 (8th ed.2004).</p>\n<p>[4]  Plaintiffs distinguish between list and effective dealer invoice prices. The list dealer invoice price is determined annually for the national market by the manufacturers. Effective dealer invoice prices reflect dealer or regions-specific incentives provided by the manufacturers. Similarly, the effective MSRP takes into account direct manufacturer-to-consumer incentives, such as cash back offers. This distinction is crucial to plaintiffs' theory of antitrust impact.</p>\n<p>[5]  Defendants on appeal include Ford Motor Company, Ford Motor Company of Canada, Ltd., General Motors Corp., General Motors of Canada, Ltd., Honda Motor Co., Honda Canada, Inc., Nissan North America, Inc., Chrysler LLC, Chrysler Motors LLC, Chrysler Canada Inc., and Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. In addition, the plaintiffs named two automobile dealers' associations, the domestic National Automobile Dealers Association (\"NADA\") and the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (\"CADA\"). Two automakers originally named as defendants are no longer in the case: Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs, and plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed BMW of North America, LLC.</p>\n<p>[6]  The district court has not decided this issue, deeming it a merits inquiry that it would be premature to resolve at the class certification stage. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 131 n. 10.</p>\n<p>[7]  Plaintiffs object that defendants cannot raise a standing challenge to the Rule 23(b)(2) class on appeal because they failed to present the argument to the district court. For their part, defendants claim they previously raised the issue in oral argument. Either way, courts must be vigilant about compliance with standing requirements regardless of what the parties argue, <i>see </i><i>Pagán v. Calderón,</i> 448 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir.2006), and must remain so throughout the entire life cycle of a case. <i>See generally</i> II Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>Antitrust Law</i> ¶ 335b, at 289 (2d ed.2000). The issue has not been waived.</p>\n<p>[8]  The court found the injunctive relief class met the requirements of Rule 23(a)  numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy  then turned to the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); <i>Motor Vehicles IV,</i> 2006 WL 623591, at *2-6. Rule 23(b)(2) allows for class actions when \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2). The court held that the defendants fall within the language of Rule 23(b)(2) because they had acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class. <i>Motor Vehicles IV,</i> 2006 WL 623591, at *7. The court further held that the proposed class satisfied the rule's requirement that injunctive relief be \"appropriate . . . with respect to the class as a whole.\" <i>Id.</i> at *7-10.</p>\n<p>[9]  The district court noted the defendants' position that because the complained-of export restrictions operated to restrict the flow of American cars into Canada as well as vice versa, consumers buying, cars in the United States during periods when the value of the Canadian dollar and the prices of Canadian cars rose were actually protected from higher domestic prices. Plaintiffs' expert conceded that the defendants' two-way restrictions could protect American consumers in such a scenario. <i>Motor Vehicles TV,</i> 2006 WL 623591, at *3n. 23.</p>\n<p>[10]  We take judicial notice of these undisputed facts. Between 1950 and the present, it has generally cost between $0.96 and $1.40 Canadian dollar (\"CAD\") to purchase one United States dollar (\"USD\"). During that period, the exchange rate has risen significantly above $1.40 CAD to $1.00 USD only once for any length of time. This occurred between the years 1998 and 2003, when the rate ranged between $1.40 and $1.61 CAD to $1.00 USD. 5E <i>Historical Statistics of the United States</i> 5-572 to 5-574 (S. Carter et al. eds., 2006); Federal Reserve Statistical Release: Historical Rates for Canada, http:// www.federalreserve. gov/releases/h 10/hist/dat 00_ca.htm. This deviation corresponds with the period during which plaintiffs' alleged arbitrage opportunities occurred.</p>\n<p>[11]  The exchange rate on April 30, 2003 was $1.43 CAD to $1.00 USD, and as of publication of this opinion, the exchange rate has not once returned to that level. Instead, the relative value of the domestic dollar has been in more or less steady decline. On September 28, 2007, the value of the Canadian dollar surpassed that of the United States dollar. As of February 1, 2008, the exchange rate was $0.90 CAD to $1.00 USD. Federal Reserve Statistical Release: Historical Rates for Canada, http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h 10/hist/dat00_ca.htm.</p>\n<p>[12]  Although the defendants challenge plaintiffs' standing to maintain the injunctive class, neither side addressed to this court any of the jurisdictional issues that might arise in the event that we vacated the federal injunctive class. We do not purport to raise an exhaustive checklist of questions to address on remand, but advert to some salient issues.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (\"CAFA\"), Pub.L. 109-2, 119 Stat, at 4 (amending 28 U.S.C. § 1332) was enacted after the complaints in this action were filed. The existence of diversity jurisdiction must therefore, under the express terms of the CAFA, be determined under the pre-CAFA diversity statute. <i>See</i> CAFA.§ 9, 119 Stat. 14 (\"[CAFA] shall apply to any civil action commenced on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\").</p>\n<p>[14]  In its September 7, 2004 order addressing supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims, the district court in addition asserted pendent personal jurisdiction over certain Canadian defendants based on the personal jurisdiction created by the federal antitrust claim. <i>Motor Vehicles II,</i> 335 F.Supp.2d at 128; <i>see also </i><i>In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litig.,</i> 307 F.Supp.2d 145, 147-48 (D.Me.2004) (finding personal jurisdiction over certain Canadian defendants). To the extent that the district court relied on the existence of the federal claim, personal jurisdiction may yet be an issue on remand.</p>\n<p>[15]  The defendants did not move to dismiss all the state claims, and the plaintiffs consented to the dismissal of some of the state claims. <i>Motor Vehicles III,</i> 350 F.Supp.2d at 168, 175.</p>\n<p>[16]  The district court had requested, in a March 15, 2005 order, that each side designate three exemplar states. The plaintiffs selected Maine, Kansas, and Vermont, and the defendants chose California, New Mexico, and Tennessee.</p>\n<p>[17]  The Kansas class was not certified because plaintiffs conceded that the class representative had not in fact been injured by the alleged conspiracy and thus lacked standing. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 131.</p>\n<p>[18]  To establish an antitrust claim, plaintiffs typically must prove (1) a violation of the antitrust laws, (2) an injury they suffered as a result of that violation, and (3) an estimated measure of damages. <i>Sullivan v. Nat'l Football League,</i> 34 F.3d 1091, 1103 (1st Cir. 1994). For a class action to be appropriate, \"plaintiffs need to demonstrate that common issues prevail as to [both] the existence of a conspiracy and the fact of injury.\" <i>Blades v. Monsanto Co.,</i> 400 F.3d 562, 566 (8th Cir. 2005). If these two elements are established by common proof, the measure of damages can sometimes be left to individual proof, as we discuss further below.\n</p>\n<p>The element of injury in the antitrust context is often referred to as \"impact\" or \"fact of damage.\" <i>Alabama v. Blue Bird Body Co.,</i> 573 F.2d 309, 317 &amp; n. 18 (5th Cir.1978). It is the causal link between the antitrust violation and the damages sought by plaintiffs. <i>Sullivan,</i> 34 F.3d at 1103. It thus requires both injury-in-fact and a showing that the injury is the result of the antitrust activity. <i>Cordes &amp; Co. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc.,</i> 502 F.3d 91, 106 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[19]  The court reiterated in its March 21, 2007 order that it would not \"make a <i>final</i> determination of the existence of antitrust impact at the certification stage.\" <i>Motor Vehicles VI,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 80 (emphasis added). \"Whether an illegal agreement halting Canadian imports (or removing their threat) produced antitrust causation or retail purchase price impact remains to be proven at trial or demonstrated at summary judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 82 n. 5.</p>\n<p>[20]  Professor Kalt had described the contours of the gray market in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Professor Hall argued that the gray market in 2001 and 2002 would reflect the impact of the alleged horizontal conspiracy and that the relevant arbitrage opportunities were not present in 2000.</p>\n<p>[21]  For example, Professor Hall cited a study showing that dealers tend to pass on to consumers at least some pricing incentives given by manufacturers. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 137 (citing M. Busse et al., <i>$1000 Cash Back: Asymmetric Information in Auto Manufacturer Promotions</i> 45 (Nat'l Bureau of Econ. Res. Working Paper Series No. 10887, 2004)).</p>\n<p>[22]  The parties filed briefs on these issues of state substantive law before the March 21, 2007 order. The court found that the parties' briefing did not cause it to change its prior views.</p>\n<p>[23]  Defendants say this is not an accurate representation of California law, but do not press the point on appeal.</p>\n<p>[24]  Those issues were:\n</p>\n<p>(a) Was there a horizontal agreement to restrict supply?</p>\n<p>(b) Was it illegal under that particular state's laws?</p>\n<p>(c) . . . Did the illegal agreement have antitrust or consumer protection impact in that state as the plaintiffs propose to prove it?</p>\n<p>(d) If so, is that impact sufficient to confer standing under the particular state's laws?</p>\n<p>(e) How long did the conspiracy and its impact last?</p>\n<p><i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 142 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>[25]  In a footnote, the district court explained that it believed it had complied with the First Circuit requirement that the district court \"formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out,\" <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 298, that it conduct a \"rigorous analysis\" of the Rule 23 criteria, <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 38, and that it test the disputed premises \"early on,\" <i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 4. <i>Motor Vehicle VI,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 81 n. 7. The court noted that <i>PolyMedica</i> did not mandate a particular level of fact-finding by the district judge at the certification stage. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[26]  Defendants attempt to answer this problem by saying these statements demonstrate that the district court failed to inquire adequately into the record; that answer is a mismatch with the problem presented of an incomplete record and of incomplete work by the plaintiffs' expert.</p>\n<p>[27]  The 2003 amendments to Rule 23 deleted the provision allowing class certifications to be conditional. The advisory committee notes explain that \"[a] court that is not satisfied that the requirements of Rule 23 have been met should refuse certification until they have been met.\" This does not prevent a judge from modifying its certification if it becomes clear, as the case develops, that the class action vehicle is in fact inappropriate.</p>\n<p>[28]  While these are both questions that are themselves susceptible to common proof (the potential size of the gray market and the distinction between the effects of horizontal and vertical restraints), they go to the viability of a novel theory upon which plaintiffs rely to establish an element of their claim through common means. In that sense, these factual questions are akin to the question of market efficiency in securities class actions employing the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance. Cases like <i>PolyMedica</i> and <i>Xcelera</i> demonstrate that such factual bases of theories of common proof are appropriately, although preliminarily, tested at the class certification stage.</p>\n<p>[29]  The district court noted that \"some states permit consumers to recover the full purchase price once liability is proven,\" further simplifying the calculation of individual damages awards. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 143 n. 53.</p>\n<p>[30]  I agree that the case is properly remanded to the district court so that it can first establish whether there is jurisdiction under § 1332 or§ 1367.</p>\n\n</div>",

Before describing the class certification issues, we sketch the outline of the underlying case.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' claim is that from at least 2001 through 2003, the currency exchange rate differential between the strong United States dollar and the cheaper Canadian dollar created arbitrage opportunities<sup>[2]</sup> in the gray market<sup>[3]</sup> to sell lower-priced Canadian cars in the United States. These arbitrage opportunities arose from the difference between the price at which a broker could buy a vehicle in Canada (plus the costs of exporting the vehicle to the United States) and the price at which the broker could resell the vehicle, whether to a dealer or consumer, in the United States. These arbitrage opportunities were enhanced by liberal trade agreements and the harmonization of automotive safety and environmental standards between the two countries in the 1990s. As a result, an exporter could make most new cars sold in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> Canada physically indistinguishable from comparable models sold in the United States by replacing the speedometer and odometer with gauges that measured miles instead of kilometers. All of these circumstances converged in what plaintiffs refer to as a \"perfect storm\" of cross-border arbitrage opportunities.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs allege that individual automobile manufacturers engaged in business practices, both legal and illegal, designed to restrict the flow of Canadian cars into the United States. Manufacturers allegedly refused to honor warranties on Canadian cars in the United States and discouraged dealers from installing domestic gauges on Canadian cars; they mandated \"no export\" clauses in sales agreements between dealers and consumers and required Canadian dealers to conduct due diligence into whether potential customers were likely to export their cars out of Canada; and they withheld information about safety recalls from exporting customers. Manufacturers also allegedly imposed disciplinary measures on Canadian dealers who sold to exporting customers. When Canadian cars were discovered in the United States, automakers would impose a \"chargeback,\" a monetary penalty sometimes amounting to thousands of dollars, on the Canadian dealer who sold the car; manufacturers threatened to withhold inventory of desirable models from offending dealerships; and they threatened to terminate dealerships that sold to exporters.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs allege that these business practices had the effect of suppressing the supply of Canadian cars in the United States. This stifling of supply led to increases in two key prices in the domestic United States automobile market: the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (\"MSRP\") and the dealer invoice price. The MSRP represents the retail price presented to the public. The dealer invoice price represents the manufacturer-determined net wholesale price to dealers.<sup>[4]</sup> Both the MSRP and the list dealer invoice price are determined annually by manufacturers and apply nationally. Under plaintiffs' theory, these two prices in turn define the bargaining parameters for the price actually paid by consumers. Actual sales prices vary according to individual negotiations between dealers and consumers, but plaintiffs assume that negotiated prices fall within the range between the dealer invoice price and the MSRP.</p>\n<p>Defendants<sup>[5]</sup> take the position that the business practices described above amount to vertical restraints between manufacturers and their dealers that do not violate the antitrust laws. Plaintiffs, however, allege that defendants violated section 1 of the Sherman Act by conspiring to coordinate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> their anti-export business practices across the industry in response to increased arbitrage opportunities after 2000. Plaintiffs allege that defendants accomplished the illegal conspiracy over the course of several meetings and through dissemination of best practices and other information through the dealer associations. These illegal horizontal agreements allegedly enhanced the effectiveness of the extant legal vertical restraints. According to plaintiffs' theory, \"but for\" the illegal horizontal conspiracy and its suppression of inter-brand competition, American consumers would have paid lower prices and have thus suffered antitrust-type injury.</p>\n<p>For example, the plaintiffs allege that Ford's 2002 Windstar LX minivan had an MSRP of $16,448 (USD) in Canada and $22,340 (USD) in the United States  a difference of 26%. The MSRP for a 2002 Lexus SC430 was 13% lower in Canada than in the United States. Plaintiffs claim that if the car-makers had not conspired to impede arbitrageurs from exporting Canadian cars to the United States, the manufacturers could not maintain these pricing gaps and instead would have been forced to compete by lowering prices across the United States.</p>\n<p>To summarize, plaintiffs' theory of antitrust impact operates in two stages. In the first stage, the horizontal conspiracy allowed the manufacturers to maintain artificially inflated national MSRPs and dealer invoice prices within the United States. In the second stage, the higher official pricing resulted in higher purchase prices paid by individual consumers.</p>\n<p>Throughout the proceedings in the district court, the defendants have denied any conspiracy. They have also argued that even if such a conspiracy existed, it would not have impacted the domestic market in any case due to the effects of the entirely legal vertical restraints.<sup>[6]</sup> Defendants have also argued that contrary to plaintiffs' theory, there would have been no flood of Canadian cars into the United States given the number of new cars sold in Canada, the limited opportunities for arbitrage, and the small size and spottiness of the gray market. Defendants assert that even if there were some impact on MSRPs and dealer invoice prices in the American market, there was no widespread antitrust impact on consumers, and plaintiffs have no viable theory to show either causation or damages that would apply to the plaintiff classes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Nationwide Injunctive Relief Plaintiff Class</i></h2>\n<p>Defendants challenge the certification of the injunctive class on the basis that plaintiffs lack standing to sue for injunctive relief under the federal antitrust laws.

The \"perfect storm\" that allegedly precipitated massive arbitrage opportunities for selling Canadian cars in the United States ceased long ago. Plaintiffs' theory of antitrust violation posits that exceptional arbitrage opportunities arose early in this decade due to a combination of relaxed trade restrictions between the United States and Canada, physical harmonization of cars manufactured for the two markets, and a differential between the values of American and Canadian currencies. The last factor has varied since the beginning of the class period, and plaintiffs themselves measure windows of actual arbitrage opportunity in large part according to undulations in exchange rates.</p>\n<p>After the district court certified the injunctive class, it ordered the parties to make submissions regarding proposed end dates for the damages classes. Plaintiffs' expert submitted an affidavit indicating that arbitrage opportunities for Canadian cars significant enough to impact United States prices for new vehicles ended in May 2003. The district court accordingly adopted April 30, 2003 as the endpoint for the state damages classes. <i>Motor Vehicles VI,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 79. Plaintiffs have not made any effort since the district court's ruling to demonstrate whether or when prevailing conditions  primarily, exchange rates between Canada and the United States  might reasonably be expected once again to resemble those during the class period. This is for good reason, as the value of the United States dollar relative to the Canadian dollar in the years 1998-2003 hit an apex unseen in at least <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> the last half century.<sup>[10]</sup> In the nearly five years since April 2003, the time at which plaintiffs concede actual injury to the damages classes abated, the exchange rate has fallen in favor of the Canadian dollar.<sup>[11]</sup> In the circumstances of this case, that alone eliminates any realistic current threat.</p>\n<p>The speculative nature of the claim that exchange rates could one day create additional arbitrage opportunities is reinforced by a second contingency inherent in the plaintiffs' theory of threatened future harm. In order for antitrust injury to befall a class member, she must also intend to purchase a new car at a time when arbitrage opportunities are ripe for exploitation. The district court certified an injunctive class defined as \"[a]ll persons . . . who purchased or leased or intended to purchase or lease a new motor vehicle manufactured by a defendant from a United States dealer during the period from January 1, 2001, to March 10, 2006.\" The complaint names thirty-six individuals who bought or leased new cars in the United States during the class period. Nowhere, however, does the complaint make any allegation regarding a named plaintiffs intention to buy or lease another new vehicle within such a time frame as could be deemed imminent. The fact that the injunctive class has been restricted to a period of time covering 2001 to early 2006 underscores the speculative nature of the plaintiffs' hypothetical future injury.</p>\n<p><i>In McInnis-Misenor v. Maine Medical Center,</i> this court inquired whether the plaintiff faced an \"immedia[te] or imminent\" threat of injury that would support standing in federal court. 319 F.3d at 68. We held that standing was lacking where any possible injury to the plaintiff was \"contingent on several events which may or may not happen.\" <i>Id.</i> at 72. Here, there is nothing to suggest that any named plaintiff harbors an \"imminent\" intention to buy a new car in coincidence with another \"perfect storm\" of arbitrage-friendly market conditions.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs attempt to revive the controversy by arguing that the defendants' conspiracy to hinder cross-border sales is ongoing. Even if this were true, the argument ignores the point that the relevant question is whether plaintiffs suffer a realistic threat of injury stemming from those alleged antitrust violations. An antitrust violation and standing are distinct and independently necessary prerequisites for the relief sought by the injunctive class. <i>See II Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law</i> ¶ 335f, at 297 (2d ed.2000); <i>cf. </i><i>SAS of PR., Inc. v.

That basis for federal jurisdiction is now gone, and the question of federal jurisdiction over the state-law damages claims presents itself. It may be that the district court could retain jurisdiction over the state damages claims on either of two theories, but we leave it to the district court to decide on remand whether there is jurisdiction.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>The parties and the district court have referred to diversity, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1332,<sup>[13]</sup> as a basis for maintaining the state damages classes in federal court. To this point in the proceedings, however, the state damages claims have been analyzed as within the court's supplemental jurisdiction based on the presence of the federal claim. <i>See, e.g., Motor Vehicles II,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2519851\"><a href=\"/opinion/2519851/in-re-new-motor-vehicles-canadian-export-antitrust-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>.<sup>[14]</sup> Whether the diversity basis is sound has not been tested.</p>\n<p>At oral argument, the defendants pointed out that proceeding on the basis of diversity jurisdiction would require analysis of each individual state-based class. Defendants also conceded that diversity could provide an independent basis for federal jurisdiction for at least some of the state-law damages classes. The district court has not had the opportunity to assess whether each state class satisfies the requirements of § 1332 and may do so on remand.</p>\n<p>The district court may, in the alternative, consider whether to exercise its discretion to continue exerting supplemental jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1367, over the state damages claims. <i>See </i><i>Rodríguez v.

On June 15, 2007, the court issued an order and explanatory memorandum under Rule 23(c)(1)(B) defining the class and class claims, issues, and defenses. <i>Motor Vehicles VII,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></span>; Motor Vehicles VIII, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span>.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Requirements for Class Certification</i></p>\n<p>To certify the statewide damages classes, the district court had to evaluate whether the four threshold requirements of Rule 23(a) were met, as well as whether Rule 23(b)(3)'s two additional prerequisites were satisfied. <i>Amchem,</i> 521 U.S. at 614, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118142\"><a href=\"/opinion/118142/amchem-products-inc-v-windsor/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). To certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), a judge must further find \"that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members\" (\"predominance\"), and that \"a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy\" (\"superiority\"). Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). In classes certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the Rules \"invite[] a close look at the case before it is accepted as a class action.\" <i>Amchem,</i> 521 U.S. at 615, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118142\"><a href=\"/opinion/118142/amchem-products-inc-v-windsor/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It also concluded that a class action was by far the superior method for proceeding. <i>Id.</i> at 148. The real dispute revolved around whether common evidence could be used to prove the impact of the alleged conspiracy on U.S. consumers (\"common impact\") and any resulting damages (\"common proof of damages\"). <i>Id.</i> at 129, 132.<sup>[18]</sup> The court noted it did not yet have enough evidence to determine the merits question of whether the plaintiff classes actually suffered antitrust or consumer protection injury.

Newberg, <i>Newberg on Class Actions</i> § 18:8, at 24 n. 2 (4th ed.2002). The questions in this case of common impact (antitrust-type causation) and common proof of damages are relevant to all three criteria.</p>\n<p>Rule 23(a)'s requirement of commonality is a low bar, and courts have generally given it a \"permissive application.\" 7A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 1763, at 221 (3d ed.2005). The district court did not have trouble finding sufficient commonality in this case. The court pointed to the common questions of whether there was a conspiracy; if so, whether it affected either dealer invoice prices or MSRPs; and whether there was any violation of state antitrust or consumer protection laws. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 130; <i>see also</i> 6 Conte &amp; Newberg, supra, § 18:5, at 14 &amp; n. 3 (gathering cases that hold that \"allegations concerning the existence, scope, and efficacy of an alleged conspiracy present questions adequately <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> common to class members to satisfy the commonality requirement\").</p>\n<p>\"[T]he predominance criterion is far more demanding,\" however, than the commonality requirement. <i>Amchem,</i> 521 U.S. at 624, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118142\"><a href=\"/opinion/118142/amchem-products-inc-v-windsor/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under the predominance inquiry, \"a district court must formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate in a given case.\" <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 298. In antitrust class actions, common issues do not predominate if the fact of antitrust violation and the fact of antitrust impact cannot be established through common proof. <i>See </i><i>Blades v. Monsanto Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789495\"><a href=\"/opinion/789495/randy-blades-collin-cain-fredrick-l-samples-mark-a-jent-roger-rivest/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span>, 566 (8th Cir.2005). The district court did not find predominance and typicality as easily established as commonality. The court chose to analyze under the heading of typicality whether plaintiffs were asserting sufficiently common proof of impact, <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 130-40, and it considered under the heading of predominance whether any resulting damages would likewise be established by sufficiently common proof, <i>id.</i> at 142-45. In consideration of these issues, the district court relied on the submissions of the parties' experts.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Submissions of Expert Witnesses</i></p>\n<p>Plaintiffs relied primarily on their expert Professor Robert E. Hall of Stanford University and the Hoover Institute, who, along with the defense expert, assumed that plaintiffs' allegations of conspiracy were true. In his July 2005 report, Professor Hall noted that collectively the defendants' sales accounted for 89% of the U.S. market and 84% of the Canadian market. He concluded that \"if defendants were unable to impose export restraints or were less effective in imposing them, they would [have] lower[ed] U.S. [dealer] invoice prices and MSRPs for most, if not all, of their vehicles.\" Expert Report of Robert E. Hall, Ph.D. ¶ 51. Even though retail sales of cars are individually negotiated, Professor Hall opined that class members would have experienced common impact from the changed MSRPs and dealer invoice prices because a change in these prices would shift the entire negotiating range, benefiting (or harming) essentially all consumers.</p>\n<p>Professor Hall initially proposed two different approaches to establishing common evidence of damages to class members. The first approach would be to rely on statistical models (\"Nash equilibriums\") used in the auto industry to predict market outcomes. Under his second approach, a benchmark method, the U.S.Canadian market would be evaluated against a comparable market not affected by the challenged conduct. Both approaches, Professor Hall asserted, would account for \"heterogeneity across vehicles, dealers, consumers, and time, [and] they can be used to identify cars or time periods for which there are no damages.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 62. Professor Hall also asserted that data existed that would allow him to implement these models, though the most detailed data were in the hands of defendants.</p>\n<p>The defense expert,' Professor Joseph P. Kalt of Harvard University, filed his expert report on September 30, 2005. Even assuming a conspiracy, he disputed that there was any common impact on either the national manufacturer-to-dealer prices or the individual dealer-to-consumer sales. His critique focused on a description of the actual gray market for Canadian vehicles in the United States, which he asserted was spotty, erratic, and too insignificant to affect the national market, even absent any collusive activity. He also criticized Professor Hall for not distinguishing between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> the effects of the manufacturers' legal vertical restraints and those of the alleged horizontal conspiracy. As to damages, he disputed that there were any common methods of proof and asserted that Professor Hall's suggested approach of employing Nash equilibriums was just \"an empty phrase.\" Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt, Ph.D. 63-64.</p>\n<p>In reply to Professor Kalt's critique, Professor Hall submitted a rebuttal report on December 20, 2005. He took issue with Professor Kalt's conclusions regarding the gray market<sup>[20]</sup> and, applying regression analysis to Professor Kalt's data on arbitrage opportunity and export activity, concluded that \"a larger price gap [between Canadian and United States car prices] is associated with greater export activity and that this relationship is not the result of randomness.\" Rebuttal Report of Robert E. Hall, Ph.D. ¶ 25. Specifically, his regressions suggested that \"a $1,000. increase in the price gap for a given model [of car] is, on average, associated with an increase in exports of at least 33 percent.\" Id. ¶ 24. The minor increase in gray market sales in 2001-2002 despite the conceded greater arbitrage opportunities, then, did not indicate the lack of a conspiracy, but rather suggested an effective one.</p>\n<p>Professor Hall argued that a Nash equilibrium model could distinguish the effects of unilateral restraints from those of any horizontal conspiracy, and he also suggested that further discovery might reduce the need for. modeling by yielding direct evidence on the effectiveness of the unilateral and alleged horizontal constraints. He stated that he had offered preliminary mathematical formulas at his deposition to establish the viability of both this approach and the approach of his proposed damages model, and he included the preliminary damages model in his rebuttal report. Professor Hall again asserted his view that there were methods based on common evidence, such as the econometric model he was proposing, that could account for the \"major dimensions in which damages might vary among potential class members.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 50.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Typicality and Predominance</i></p>\n<p>On this evidence, the district court preliminarily certified five exemplar state classes. The court held that the presentation by Professor Hall, supported by extrinsic economic studies, sufficed for purposes of showing common proof of impact.<sup>[21]</sup> The court found \"unexceptionable\" the plaintiffs' theory that other things being equal, a restriction on the supply of lower-priced cars coming into the United States market will exert an upward pressure on domestic car prices. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 137. This pressure will apply both to the prices dealers pay to manufacturers and to the prices paid by consumers to dealers. While individual negotiations may determine the final price, the starting point for most negotiations is the MSRP, and the final purchase price for most consumers is between the dealer invoice price and the MSRP. <i>Id.</i> In effect, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> overall negotiating range would be elevated, resulting in higher consumer prices across the board. <i>Id.</i> at 138-39. The court accepted some of these contentions as adequate to demonstrate that the named plaintiffs' claims would be typical of the class, although the court was careful to note that it was not then deciding whether plaintiffs' proof of impact was sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 139.</p>\n<p>The court was also careful to note that the proffered common proof of impact might be insufficient under some states' laws. <i>Id.</i> at 132. The court sua sponte examined the laws of five of the exemplar states to determine what level of proof of consumer impact each state required and what inferences were acceptable to show impact.<sup>[22]</sup> The court concluded that there was a range. California, at one end, permitted \"an inference of antitrust impact, even as to indirect purchasers, from the existence of the conspiracy.\"<sup>[23]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 135; <i>see also id.</i> (\"In the consumer context, at least a portion of the illegal overcharge by a manufacturer will presumably be passed on by the independent distributors to consumer class members in the form of higher prices.\" (quoting <i>Global Minerals &amp; Metals Corp. v.

While the Maine antitrust statute explicitly permits recovery for indirect injury, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1104, the Maine Law Court has not yet commented on what indirect purchasers must show to establish impact or causation. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 132. The district court turned to Maine superior court decisions, which the court summarized as holding that \"indirect purchasers in Maine must produce specific proof that they paid higher prices as a result of the conspiracy (in the face of the possibility that all such increases were absorbed at the retailer level).\" Id. at 134; <i>see also id.</i> (\"Because indirect purchasers must demonstrate that overcharges have been passed on to them, such claims present an entirely separate level of evidence and proof than that found in a direct purchaser claim.\" (quoting <i>Melnick v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> Nos. CV-99-709, CV-99-752, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1012261</span></span>, at *6 (Me.Super.Ct. Aug. 24, 2001))). Likewise, the Maine consumer protection statute, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, §§ 205-A to 214, allows indirect purchasers to recover, but injury is not presumed. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 135 (citing <i>State v. Weinschenk,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></span> (Me.2005)).</p>\n<p>The court also discussed the states that fell between those two poles. New Mexico, it concluded, seems to allow indirect purchasers to establish antitrust impact through correlation analysis. <i>See id.</i> at 136. Tennessee and Vermont have not yet fully addressed the question. <i>See id.</i> The court noted that in states like Maine where the passing on of an antitrust or consumer protection injury to indirect purchasers cannot be presumed, plaintiffs might have difficulty proving injury to individual consumers if their common proof can establish only an inference of injury. <i>See id.</i> at 139.</p>\n<p>Turning to the question of predominance under Rule 23(b)(3), the court found there were at least five common disputed issues <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> weighing in favor of class certification.<sup>[24]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 142. Defendants argued that the lack of common impact at both stages of plaintiffs' theory and the lack of common proof of damages defeat predominance. The court reiterated that it had found plaintiffs' proposal to prove impact through common proof preliminarily sufficient, and it pointed out that the existence of a common disputed issue weighs in favor of class, certification, not against it, <i>Id.</i> at 142 (citing <i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 4-5). The adequacy of plaintiffs' proof of common impact, and whether the impact even constitutes cognizable antitrust or consumer protection injury, \"are merits determinations that are common in each [state] class\" and would be resolved at trial. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The court also disagreed that the question of individual damages defeats the predominance of common questions. First, the court noted that \"[w]here, as here, common questions predominate regarding liability, then courts generally find the predominance requirement to be satisfied even if individual damages issues remain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 143 (quoting <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40). Second, the court stated that it would not determine at the class certification stage whether plaintiffs' method of proving damages was adequate. <i>Id.</i> at 144. The mere fact that there are differences among members of a class regarding their individual amounts of damages does not preclude class certification. <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40 (\"The individuation of damages in consumer class actions is rarely determinative under Rule 23(b)(3).\"); 7B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Mary Kay Kane, <i>supra,</i> § 1781, at 235. Often those variations can be determined according to a universal mathematical or formulaic calculation, obviating the need for evidentiary hearings on each individual claim. <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40. Plaintiffs proposed to use such an approach here. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 143-44. The district court, noted that it was \"not overwhelmed by the plaintiffs' offer of damage calculation models,\" but it \"conclude[d] that damages [were] not yet a ground to deny certification.\" <i>Id.</i> at 144-45; <i>see also id.</i> at 145 n. 63 (specifying some of the problems plaintiffs' damages models faced).</p>\n<p>Finally, the district court raised the question of the end date for the damages classes. <i>Id.</i> at 140. Another round of expert reports ensued, accompanied by briefing repeating many of the same arguments. The court focused on the choice of end date in its March 21, 2007 order; it commented that the defendants' additional critiques did not alter its views that a class should be certified.<sup>[25]</sup><i>Motor Vehicles VI,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 80-82. Over defendants' <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> insistence that the court determine whether the \"alleged horizontal conspiracy actually impacted American car prices,\" the court refused to reexamine the issue  as well as the related issue of \"what vertical restraints the individual manufacturers maintained, their legality and their effect\"  at that time. <i>Id.</i> at 80-82 &amp; n. 5. On June 15, 2007, the court entered an order of class certification in compliance with Rule 23(c)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>B. <i>Defendants' Appeals from Certification of the Damages Classes</i></p>\n<p>In challenging the certification of the state damages classes, defendants primarily argue that the district court did not engage in a sufficiently searching inquiry into the relevant merits issues. It is a settled question that some inquiry into the merits at the class certification stage is not only permissible but appropriate to the extent that the merits overlap the Rule 23 criteria. <i>Falcon,</i> 457 U.S. at 160, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110737\"><a href=\"/opinion/110737/general-telephone-co-of-southwest-v-falcon/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is less settled what degree of merits inquiry is <i>required</i> at the class certification stage, and the Supreme Court has not yet addressed the issue.</p>\n<p>Our sister circuits agree that when class criteria and merits overlap, the district court must conduct a searching inquiry regarding the Rule 23 criteria, but how they articulate the necessary degree of inquiry ranges along a spectrum which suggests substantial differences. The Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits coalesce around the more rigorous end of this spectrum, forbidding district courts from relying on plaintiffs' allegations of sufficiently common proof and requiring the courts to make specific findings that each Rule 23 criterion is met. <i>Miles v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. (In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec.

These circuits' use of the term \"findings\" in this context should not be confused with binding findings on the merits. The judge's consideration of merits issues at the class certification stage pertains only to that stage; the ultimate factfinder, whether judge or jury, must still reach its own determination on these issues. <i>In re IPO,</i> 471 F.3d at 39; Gariety, 368 F.3d at 366.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the Third and Eighth Circuits sometimes require an inquiry into and preliminary resolution of disputes, but they do not require findings and do not hold that such inquiry will always be necessary. <i>Blades,</i> 400 F.3d at 567, 575 (holding that sometimes courts will be required to resolve factual disputes preliminarily at the class certification stage but voicing caution); <i>Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span>, 166 (3d Cir.2001) (\"A class certification decision requires a thorough examination of the factual and legal allegations.\"); <i>id.</i> at 168 (\"In reviewing a motion for class certification, a preliminary inquiry into the merits is sometimes necessary to determine whether the alleged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> claims can be properly resolved as a class action.\").</p>\n<p>This court has grappled with this issue as well. We have said in <i>Smilow</i> that \"a district court must conduct a rigorous analysis\" of Rule 23's prerequisites, 323 F.3d at 38, and in <i>Mowbray</i> that \"a district court must formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out,\" 208 F.3d at 298. <i>See also </i><i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 4-5 (noting that the common presumption at early stages of litigation that \"the complaint's allegations are necessarily controlling\" does not apply in class certification situations because \"class action machinery is expensive and in our view a court has the power to test disputed premises early on if and when the class action would be proper on one premise but not another\").</p>\n<p>In <i>PolyMedica,</i> a securities class action, we said that the court \"was entitled to look beyond the pleadings in its evaluation\" of both the question of class certification generally and the applicability of the fraud-onthe-market presumption specifically, even though those questions overlapped with the merits of the case. <i>PolyMedica,</i> 432 F.3d at 6. The fraud-on-the-market presumption in securities class actions allows plaintiffs to establish the necessary element of reliance through common proof. If the market is efficient, the theory goes, market prices will incorporate all publicly available information, including material misrepresentations, so that an investor who buys or sells stock in reliance on the integrity of the market price is in fact buying or selling stock in reliance on the material misrepresentations. <i>See id.</i> at 7-8. Because common issues would no longer predominate in a securities class action if plaintiffs could not at trial establish reliance through the common proof of the fraud-on-the-market presumption, courts at the class certification stage probe the factual basis of the fraud-on-the-market presumption to make sure it will be a viable form of proof in a given case.</p>\n<p>In both <i>PolyMedica</i> and its companion case, <i>Stuebler v. Xcelera.Com (In re Xcelera.com Sec. Litig.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201964\"><a href=\"/opinion/201964/stuebler-v-xceleracom/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2005), we, along with the district court, rigorously tested the evidence submitted by both sides to determine whether the fraud-on-the-market presumption was reasonably applicable, specifically whether the plaintiffs would be able to demonstrate that the market was efficient. At the class certification stage, we noted, plaintiffs needed to present \"basic facts\" that the fraud-on-the-market presumption could be invoked, even though its actual applicability was to be resolved at trial. <i>PolyMedica,</i> 432 F.3d at 19. Our review of the district court's determination of whether or not the fraud-on-the-market presumption could be invoked was based not on the level of detail in the district court's explanation, but on \"whether the evidence supports its determination to apply the presumption.\" <i>Xcelera,</i> 430 F.3d at 512. In <i>Xcelera,</i> for example, the district court actively evaluated the testimony of two competing experts and preliminarily credited the plaintiffs' expert, a determination this court upheld  after surveying the expert testimony ourselves  on clear error review. <i>Id.</i> at 512-16.</p>\n<p><i>PolyMedica</i> and <i>Xcelera</i> could be read, but we think not properly, as limiting this requirement that district courts probe into the viability of the premises of plaintiffs' theory of injury to cases employing only legal presumptions of injury. Under this circuit's approach, in our view, a searching inquiry is in order where there are not only disputed basic facts, but also a novel theory of legally cognizable injury. Plaintiffs cannot make their case without common proof of causation, and they can only prove causation through common means if their novel theory is viable; that viability <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> in turn depends on their ability to establish  whether through mathematical models or further data or other means  the key logical steps behind their theory. Such reliance on a novel theory to establish a primary element of a claim necessitates a more searching inquiry into whether plaintiffs will be able to prove the pivotal elements of their theory at trial. This is especially so when a case implicates the sort of factors that we have deemed important in the Rule 23(f) calculus, namely, when the granting of class status \"raises the stakes of litigation so substantially that the defendant likely will feel irresistible pressure to settle.\" <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 293.</p>\n<p>We do not need to resolve now whether \"findings\" regarding the class certification criteria are ever necessary, but we do hold that when a Rule 23 requirement relies on a novel or complex theory as to injury, as the predominance inquiry does in this case, the district court must engage in a searching inquiry into the viability of that theory and the existence of the facts necessary for the theory to succeed.</p>\n<p>Contrary to defendants' assertions, the district court did not believe itself limited by <i>Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109050\"><a href=\"/opinion/109050/eisen-v-carlisle-jacquelin/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109050\"><a href=\"/opinion/109050/eisen-v-carlisle-jacquelin/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Instead, the court attempted to meet its obligations under <i>PolyMedica, Mowbray,</i> and our other cases to conduct a rigorous analysis at the certification stage. <i>See Motor Vehicles V,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 81 n. 7. The court's ability to probe into the viability of plaintiffs' proffered theory and to formulate some predictions as to how key issues in this novel and complex case would develop was hampered, however, by the incomplete record at the time, as well as by the fact that plaintiffs' expert had not yet fully formulated all aspects of his analysis. The court pointed out that it was ruling on class certification before discovery was completed and was relying upon the plaintiffs' representation that they would fill in the gaps in their evidence with further discovery and further work. It repeatedly said that it was willing to take another look at these questions when the record was more complete.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>This court has had little occasion to discuss the timing of the issuance of class certification orders, much less of damages classes under Rule 23(b)(3). See <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 299 n. 7. Rule 23(c)(1)(A) says only that the court must act \"at an early practicable time.\" Rule 23(c)(1)(C) also provides that a class certification order may be altered or amended before final judgment.<sup>[27]</sup> A district court which has taken an initial look at the merits is not foreclosed from later entertaining, post-discovery, a summary judgment motion from defendants asserting that plaintiffs cannot establish the requisite antitrust and consumer protection impact through common means. See 3 Conte &amp; Newberg, <i>supra,</i> § 7:15, at 48-57. Indeed, it is not uncommon to defer final decision on certifications pending completion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> of relevant discovery. <i>Id.</i> § 7:16, at 57-59.</p>\n<p>When the decision on class certification is made before full class discovery has been completed, as here, it is necessarily more predictive. As the Eighth Circuit has noted, the decision may require revisiting upon completion of full discovery. <i>Blades,</i> 400 F.3d at 567; see <i>also </i><i>Gariety,</i> 368 F.3d at 368.</p>\n<p>In another case, this posture of certification being decided before completion of class discovery might not raise any concerns. In this case it does because of the novelty and complexity of the theories advanced and the gaps in the evidence proffered. The district court expressed multiple times its concern about the adequacy of several of plaintiffs' showings and expressed a willingness to revisit the question once it had a better record in front of it. We share those concerns.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' theory of impact on indirect purchasers is both novel and complex. Injury in price-fixing cases is sometimes not difficult to establish. Plaintiffs do not, however, advance such a price-fixing theory. Rather, the plaintiffs' theory is that the higher prices are the result of a \"butfor\" world. In step one of plaintiffs theory, but for the defendants' illegal stifling of competition, the manufacturers would have had to set dealer invoice prices and MSRPs lower to avoid losing sales to the lower-priced Canadian cars coming across the border for resale in the United States. In step two, the higher dealer invoice prices and MSRPs enabled by this stifling of competition resulted in injury to consumers in the form of higher retail prices.</p>\n<p>The first step of plaintiffs' theory requires demonstrating that the, defendants' actions did result in an increase in dealer invoice prices and MSRPs in the United States. This in turn depends on at least two factors. First, there would have had to be, in this but-for world, a flood of significantly lower-priced Canadian cars coming across the border for resale in the United States during times of arbitrage opportunities, enough cars to cause manufacturers to take steps to protect the American market from this competition by decreasing nationally set prices. As plaintiffs themselves note, without a very large number of cars poised, to cross the border, a nationwide impact on the automobile market of the sort required by plaintiffs' theory is implausible, and the theory collapses. In our view, plaintiffs' expert Professor Hall had not yet, at the time of class certification, fully answered such potentially relevant questions as how the size of the but-for influx of cars would be established or how large that influx would have to be to affect the national market sufficiently to raise effective dealer invoice prices and MSRPs.</p>\n<p>Second, the plaintiffs must be able to sort out the effects of any permissible vertical restraints from the effects of the alleged, impermissible horizontal conspiracy. This question was raised below but was not fully addressed. Professor Hall asserted in a purely conclusory manner that the effects could be separated out using the concept of Nash equilibriums. If plaintiffs do not have a viable, means for distinguishing between these two sets of effects, they cannot show that it was the horizontal conspiracy that caused the impact on the domestic national market upon which their theory depends.<sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> As for the second step of plaintiffs' theory, it must include some means of determining that each member of the class was in fact injured, even if the amount of each individual injury could be determined in a separate proceeding. Predominance is not defeated by individual damages questions as long as liability is still subject to common proof. <i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 6; <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40; 6 Conte &amp; Newberg, supra, § 18:27, at 91. This is because the class action can be limited to the question of liability, leaving damages for later individualized determinations. <i>See </i><i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 7; <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 41; 6 Conte &amp; Newberg, <i>supra,</i> § 18:53, at 179 &amp; n. 10, § 18:56, at 190-92.<sup>[29]</sup> Establishing liability, however, still requires showing that class members were injured at the consumer level. It is unclear to us how plaintiffs intend to make this connection.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs might intend to use their damages model to prove both fact of damages and the measure of those damages. If so, the district court would need enough information to evaluate preliminarily whether the proposed model will be able to establish, without need for individual determinations for the many millions of potential class members, which consumers were impacted by the alleged antitrust violation and which were not. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Blades,</i> 400 F.3d at 570 (affirming denial of class status where the actual prices paid by class members could not be determined via common proof because \"[t]he amount of premiums paid, if any, is relevant to a determination of impact . . . and is not merely an assessment of the amount of damages, which may be properly ascertained at a later time\"); <i>Newton,</i> 259 F.3d at 187-88 (affirming denial of class status where plaintiffs had not only provided no model formula for measuring damages, but more fundamentally had also not demonstrated the <i>fact</i> of damages). \"The ability to calculate the aggregate amount of damages,\" as plaintiffs propose to do here, \"does not absolve plaintiffs from the duty to prove each [class member] was harmed by the defendants' practice.\" <i>Newton,</i> 259 F.3d at 188.</p>\n<p>The district court, while expressing skepticism regarding plaintiffs' proposal for measuring damages, relied on this court's consideration in <i>Smilow</i> of an incomplete damages model. It noted that in Smilow, this court had accepted as sufficient a representation by plaintiffs' expert that he \"could fashion\" a computerized method of calculating class damages. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 144 (quoting <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40) (internal quotation marks omitted). The proposed computerized model in <i>Smilow</i> would draw from the defendant's records, which listed the consumers who were charged the allegedly illegal fees. <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40-41. That is, the model would have relied on data that clearly established which consumers suffered injury. Professor Hall similarly claimed that data in defendants' hands would provide the information he would need for his damages model; whether that data will be sufficient to establish consumer-level impact for each class member is a question that can now be answered with discovery completed.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> Plaintiffs seem to rely on an inference that any upward pressure on national pricing would necessarily raise the prices actually paid by individual consumers. There is intuitive appeal to this theory, but intuitive appeal is not enough. Even if it is fair to assume that hard bargainers will usually pay prices closer to the dealer invoice price and poor negotiators will usually pay prices closer to the MSRP, a minimal increase in national pricing would not necessarily mean that all consumers would pay more. Too many factors play into an individual negotiation to allow an assumption  at least without further theoretical development  that any price increase or decrease will always have the same magnitude of effect on the final price paid. Even if Professor Hall's proposed models could determine when MSRPs and dealer invoice prices were affected for which models and to what degree, it is a further question whether it can be presumed that all purchasers of those affected cars paid higher retail prices.</p>\n<p>Some courts have allowed a presumption of class-wide impact in price-fixing cases when \"the price structure in the industry is such that nationwide the conspiratorially affected prices at the wholesale level fluctuated within a range which, though different in different regions, was higher in all regions than the range which would have existed in all regions under competitive conditions.\" <i>Winoff Indus., Inc. v. Stone Container Corp. (In re Linderboard Antitrust Litig.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779270\"><a href=\"/opinion/779270/in-re-linerboard-antitrust-litigation-winoff-industries-inc-v-stone/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 151 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting <i>Bogosian v.

If effective dealer invoice prices in the real world were equal to or greater than the effective MSRPs in the but-for world  that is, if the entire negotiating range in the but-for world would have been below the entire negotiating range in the real world  it would be easier to presume that all consumers suffered impact. The district court discussed the <i>Bogosian</i> presumption in its May 12, 2006 order, <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 138 n. 35, but plaintiffs disclaim any intent to rely on the <i>Bogosian</i> model.</p>\n<p>It is true that the validity of plaintiffs' theory is a common disputed issue. <i>Cf. </i><i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 4-5. It will be for the fact finder to decide whether this theory is persuasive. At the class certification stage, however, the district court must still ensure that the plaintiffs' presentation of their case will be through means amenable to the class action mechanism. We are looking here not for hard factual proof, but for a more thorough explanation of <i>how</i> the pivotal evidence behind plaintiffs theory can be established. If there is no realistic means of proof, many resources will be wasted setting up a trial that plaintiffs cannot win.</p>\n<p>In sum, the district court's oft-expressed instinct that aspects of plaintiffs' theory remained to be developed dovetails with our own. At the time of class certification, more work remained to be done in the building of plaintiffs' damages model and the filling out of all steps of plaintiffs' theory of impact. Time has now passed; it is almost two years since the district court's May 12, 2006 order, and all discovery was scheduled to be completed by March 3, 2008. The plaintiffs should now have the evidence they need to put their best foot forward, and they have had additional time to work out their models and formulas. The district court should now have a complete record before it from which to test the viability of plaintiffs' novel theory for proving common impact.</p>\n<p>We thus vacate and remand the certification of the state damages classes so that the district court, which has handled this case admirably so far, may reconsider those class certification orders in light of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> this opinion and the more fully developed record.</p>\n<p>We reverse in part, vacate in part, remand in part, and order dismissal of the Clayton Act injunctive relief claim. All parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, (Concurring in part, Dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Although I concur with the majority regarding the injunctive class, I respectfully dissent from the discussion of the state damages classes.<sup>[30]</sup> In my view, the opinion erodes the discretion which we are required to afford to the district court in class certification proceedings. A district court's decision to certify a class is reviewed under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <i>See </i><i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 37 (\"Orders certifying or decertifying a class are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\") (citing <i>Califano v.

Fed.R.Civ.P. 23. Our review is, therefore, focused on whether the district court properly applied the criteria set out in Rule 23. <i>See </i><i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 295 (\"An abuse occurs when a court, in making a discretionary ruling, relies upon an improper factor, omits consideration of a factor entitled to substantial weight, or mulls the correct mix of factors but makes a clear error of judgment in assaying them.\"). Importantly, a district court remains free at a later stage to modify or even decertify a class if later evidence disproves the plaintiffs' assertions regarding, for example, the predominance of common issues. <i>See </i><i>Falcon,</i> 457 U.S. at 160, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110737\"><a href=\"/opinion/110737/general-telephone-co-of-southwest-v-falcon/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And, as required in this circuit, the district court \"conduct[ed] a rigorous analysis of the prerequisites established by Rule 23,\" <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 38, and \"formulate[d] some prediction as to how specific issues w[ould] play out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate,\" <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 298.</p>\n<p>The majority does not question the rigor with which the court conducted its analysis. Indeed, the opinion applauds the court's \"attempt[] to meet its obligations . . . to conduct a rigorous analysis at the certification stage.\" Slip op. at 26. Rather, the basis for the majority's remand on the certification of the damages classes is the insufficiency of evidence available to the district court. Although the opinion faults the timing of the certification (and, thus the incompleteness of the record), I am concerned that in vacating and remanding the certification order for reconsideration with additional evidence from the plaintiffs, the opinion stands for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> proposition that we now require a high level of fact-finding before certification.</p>\n<p>I agree with the district court that our case law does not \"mandat[e] a particular level of factfinding by the district judge at the certification stage.\" <i>Motor Vehicles VI,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 82 n. 7. On the contrary, in <i>PolyMedica,</i> we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote>The question of how much evidence . . . is necessary for a court to, accept the [theory of reliance] at the class certification stage is therefore one of degree. District courts must <i>draw these lines sensibly</i>. . . . We have no illusions that this line-drawing is easy. Knowing the high stakes in the class-certification decision, the parties will try to move the court in different directions, with plaintiffs arguing for less evidence . . . and defendants for more . . . the district court must evaluate the plaintiffs evidence . . . critically without allowing the defendant to turn the class certification proceeding into an <i>unwieldy trial on the merits.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>432 F.3d at 17 (emphasis added). The district court drew those lines sensibly in this case. We are not entitled to second-guess that decision in the absence of evidence that it engaged in an abuse of discretion. Our decision to vacate and remand the certification of the damages classes to allow the district court the benefit of full discovery, effectively overrides the district court's assessment of how much evidence it needed to certify the class. Under the banner of a \"novel and complex\" theory in a class certification proceeding, we now appear to require district courts to fully vet and test the underpinnings of a plaintiffs legal theory. <i>See</i> slip op. at ___ (\"[I]n our view, a searching inquiry is in order where there are not only disputed basic facts, but also a novel theory of legally cognizable injury.\").</p>\n<p>At issue in this case are questions regarding the plaintiffs' theory of impact. Although the district court admitted some concern about whether the plaintiffs' proof of impact would be \"sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment or for judgment as a matter of law at trial,\" <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 139, the district court properly remained focused on the certification requirements and concluded that \"the plaintiffs' proof does meet the commonality and typicality standard.\" <i>Id.</i> The majority even admits that these questions regarding the plaintiffs' theory of impact \"are themselves susceptible to common proof (the potential size of the gray market and the distinction between the effects of horizontal and vertical restraints).\" Slip op. at 28 n. 29. The opinion goes on, however, to conclude that a more searching inquiry into the <i>factual basis</i> of that theory is required here. I disagree.</p>\n<p>In this case, the questions regarding the viability of the plaintiffs' theory of impact are not limited to certification issues, but go to the merits of the plaintiffs' claim. I disagree with the majority's reading of <i>PolyMedica</i> and <i>Xcelera,</i> which they cite in support of their position that \"factual bases of theories of common proof are appropriately, although preliminarily, tested at the class certification stage.\" <i>Id. PolyMedica</i> and <i>Xcelera</i> were securities class actions in which the plaintiffs sought to use the fraud-on-the-market presumption to demonstrate market efficiency. Those class actions were brought under § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, which require that each plaintiff prove that he or she individually relied on the alleged misrepresentation. A requirement of individualized reliance \"would effectively preclude securities fraud class actions under Rule 23(b)(3) [because] [i]ndividual issues of reliance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> would necessarily overwhelm the common ones.\" <i>Xcelera,</i> 430 F.3d at 507. The applicability of the fraud-on-the-market theory is central to the appropriateness of the class action as a vehicle for litigation: under the theory, plaintiffs are no longer required to prove individualized reliance. <i>See </i><i>PolyMedica,</i> 432 F.3d at 18-19 (vacating and remanding the class certification after concluding that the district court had committed error in adopting the incorrect definition of \"market efficiency,\" one of the elements for invoking the fraud-on-the-market presumption). In this antitrust case, the majority points to no legal error committed by the district court in assessing the appropriateness of certification.</p>\n<p>In remanding the certification of the damages classes for reconsideration with the benefit of additional evidence, the majority conflates the dispute as to the viability of the plaintiffs' theory with the specific inquiries required at class certification. As we noted in <i>PolyMedica,</i> \"a court has the power to test disputed premises early on <i>if and when the class action would be proper on one premise but not another.\" </i><i>PolyMedica,</i> 432 F.3d at 6 (quoting Tardiff, 365 F.3d at 4-5) (emphasis added). Indeed, insofar as those premises are not preclusive of the class action as a vehicle, we have no basis for requiring a district court to inquire further into the merits of the case. While the plaintiffs' theory of antitrust impact is novel and complex, it, unlike the fraud-on-the-market theory, is not determinative of whether a class action is proper or not. Indeed, the identified uncertainties within the plaintiffs' theory challenge only the ability of the plaintiffs (as a group) to successfully prove their theory of impact. Slip op. at 26-28. In this case, an inquiry that tests each stage of the plaintiffs' theory is, in effect, an assessment of the case's merits. As such, we are putting the cart before the horse and turning the class certification stage into a motion for summary judgment proceeding  the appropriate juncture at which to fully vet the viability of the plaintiffs' theory. In so holding today, I fear that we are removing the underpinnings of the discretion we grant district courts to draw sensible lines and further blurring the distinction between the certification inquiry and a trial on the merits. I believe this course is erroneous and contrary to established precedent, and thus dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court observed that \"it is reasonable to infer that the proposed federal injunctive class numbers in the millions\"; the defendants have represented to the district court that the proposed class includes \"more than a hundred million American consumers.\" <i>In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litig. (Motor Vehicles IV</i>), No. MDL 1532, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">623591</span></span>, at *2 &amp; n. 19 (D.Me. Mar. 10, 2006).</p>\n<p>[2]  Arbitrage describes the practice of simultaneously buying and selling identical securities, currency, or other assets in different markets, \"with the hope of profiting from the price difference in those markets.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 112 (8th ed.2004).</p>\n<p>[3]  A gray market is one \"in which the seller uses legal but sometimes unethical methods to avoid a manufacturer's distribution chain and thereby sell goods (esp. imported goods) at prices lower than those envisioned by the manufacturer.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 989 (8th ed.2004).</p>\n<p>[4]  Plaintiffs distinguish between list and effective dealer invoice prices. The list dealer invoice price is determined annually for the national market by the manufacturers. Effective dealer invoice prices reflect dealer or regions-specific incentives provided by the manufacturers. Similarly, the effective MSRP takes into account direct manufacturer-to-consumer incentives, such as cash back offers. This distinction is crucial to plaintiffs' theory of antitrust impact.</p>\n<p>[5]  Defendants on appeal include Ford Motor Company, Ford Motor Company of Canada, Ltd., General Motors Corp., General Motors of Canada, Ltd., Honda Motor Co., Honda Canada, Inc., Nissan North America, Inc., Chrysler LLC, Chrysler Motors LLC, Chrysler Canada Inc., and Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. In addition, the plaintiffs named two automobile dealers' associations, the domestic National Automobile Dealers Association (\"NADA\") and the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (\"CADA\"). Two automakers originally named as defendants are no longer in the case: Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs, and plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed BMW of North America, LLC.</p>\n<p>[6]  The district court has not decided this issue, deeming it a merits inquiry that it would be premature to resolve at the class certification stage. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 131 n. 10.</p>\n<p>[7]  Plaintiffs object that defendants cannot raise a standing challenge to the Rule 23(b)(2) class on appeal because they failed to present the argument to the district court. For their part, defendants claim they previously raised the issue in oral argument. Either way, courts must be vigilant about compliance with standing requirements regardless of what the parties argue, <i>see </i><i>Pagán v. Calderón,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202216\"><a href=\"/opinion/202216/pagan-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2006), and must remain so throughout the entire life cycle of a case. <i>See generally</i> II Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <i>Antitrust Law</i> ¶ 335b, at 289 (2d ed.2000). The issue has not been waived.</p>\n<p>[8]  The court found the injunctive relief class met the requirements of Rule 23(a)  numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy  then turned to the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); <i>Motor Vehicles IV,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">623591</span></span>, at *2-6. Rule 23(b)(2) allows for class actions when \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2). The court held that the defendants fall within the language of Rule 23(b)(2) because they had acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class. <i>Motor Vehicles IV,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">623591</span></span>, at *7. The court further held that the proposed class satisfied the rule's requirement that injunctive relief be \"appropriate . . . with respect to the class as a whole.\" <i>Id.</i> at *7-10.</p>\n<p>[9]  The district court noted the defendants' position that because the complained-of export restrictions operated to restrict the flow of American cars into Canada as well as vice versa, consumers buying, cars in the United States during periods when the value of the Canadian dollar and the prices of Canadian cars rose were actually protected from higher domestic prices. Plaintiffs' expert conceded that the defendants' two-way restrictions could protect American consumers in such a scenario. <i>Motor Vehicles TV,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">623591</span></span>, at *3n. 23.</p>\n<p>[10]  We take judicial notice of these undisputed facts. Between 1950 and the present, it has generally cost between $0.96 and $1.40 Canadian dollar (\"CAD\") to purchase one United States dollar (\"USD\"). During that period, the exchange rate has risen significantly above $1.40 CAD to $1.00 USD only once for any length of time. This occurred between the years 1998 and 2003, when the rate ranged between $1.40 and $1.61 CAD to $1.00 USD. 5E <i>Historical Statistics of the United States</i> 5-572 to 5-574 (S. Carter et al. eds., 2006); Federal Reserve Statistical Release: Historical Rates for Canada, http:// www.federalreserve. gov/releases/h 10/hist/dat 00_ca.htm. This deviation corresponds with the period during which plaintiffs' alleged arbitrage opportunities occurred.</p>\n<p>[11]  The exchange rate on April 30, 2003 was $1.43 CAD to $1.00 USD, and as of publication of this opinion, the exchange rate has not once returned to that level. Instead, the relative value of the domestic dollar has been in more or less steady decline. On September 28, 2007, the value of the Canadian dollar surpassed that of the United States dollar. As of February 1, 2008, the exchange rate was $0.90 CAD to $1.00 USD. Federal Reserve Statistical Release: Historical Rates for Canada, http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h 10/hist/dat00_ca.htm.</p>\n<p>[12]  Although the defendants challenge plaintiffs' standing to maintain the injunctive class, neither side addressed to this court any of the jurisdictional issues that might arise in the event that we vacated the federal injunctive class. We do not purport to raise an exhaustive checklist of questions to address on remand, but advert to some salient issues.</p>\n<p>[13]  The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (\"CAFA\"), Pub.L. 109-2, 119 Stat, at 4 (amending 28 U.S.C. § 1332) was enacted after the complaints in this action were filed. The existence of diversity jurisdiction must therefore, under the express terms of the CAFA, be determined under the pre-CAFA diversity statute. <i>See</i> CAFA.§ 9, 119 Stat. 14 (\"[CAFA] shall apply to any civil action commenced on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\").</p>\n<p>[14]  In its September 7, 2004 order addressing supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims, the district court in addition asserted pendent personal jurisdiction over certain Canadian defendants based on the personal jurisdiction created by the federal antitrust claim. <i>Motor Vehicles II,</i> 335 F.Supp.2d at 128; <i>see also </i><i>In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2438996\"><a href=\"/opinion/2438996/in-re-new-motor-vehicles-canadian-export/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 147-48 (D.Me.2004) (finding personal jurisdiction over certain Canadian defendants). To the extent that the district court relied on the existence of the federal claim, personal jurisdiction may yet be an issue on remand.</p>\n<p>[15]  The defendants did not move to dismiss all the state claims, and the plaintiffs consented to the dismissal of some of the state claims. <i>Motor Vehicles III,</i> 350 F.Supp.2d at 168, 175.</p>\n<p>[16]  The district court had requested, in a March 15, 2005 order, that each side designate three exemplar states. The plaintiffs selected Maine, Kansas, and Vermont, and the defendants chose California, New Mexico, and Tennessee.</p>\n<p>[17]  The Kansas class was not certified because plaintiffs conceded that the class representative had not in fact been injured by the alleged conspiracy and thus lacked standing. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 131.</p>\n<p>[18]  To establish an antitrust claim, plaintiffs typically must prove (1) a violation of the antitrust laws, (2) an injury they suffered as a result of that violation, and (3) an estimated measure of damages. <i>Sullivan v. Nat'l Football League,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677790\"><a href=\"/opinion/677790/william-h-sullivan-ii-v-national-football-league-members-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1091</span></a></span>, 1103 (1st Cir. 1994). For a class action to be appropriate, \"plaintiffs need to demonstrate that common issues prevail as to [both] the existence of a conspiracy and the fact of injury.\" <i>Blades v. Monsanto Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789495\"><a href=\"/opinion/789495/randy-blades-collin-cain-fredrick-l-samples-mark-a-jent-roger-rivest/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span>, 566 (8th Cir. 2005). If these two elements are established by common proof, the measure of damages can sometimes be left to individual proof, as we discuss further below.\n</p>\n<p>The element of injury in the antitrust context is often referred to as \"impact\" or \"fact of damage.\" <i>Alabama v. Blue Bird Body Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"354255\"><a href=\"/opinion/354255/the-state-of-alabama-dr-wayne-teague-as-superintendent-of-education-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span>, 317 &amp; n. 18 (5th Cir.1978). It is the causal link between the antitrust violation and the damages sought by plaintiffs. <i>Sullivan,</i> 34 F.3d at 1103. It thus requires both injury-in-fact and a showing that the injury is the result of the antitrust activity. <i>Cordes &amp; Co. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1235519\"><a href=\"/opinion/1235519/cordes-co-financial-services-v-ag-edwards-sons/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 106 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[19]  The court reiterated in its March 21, 2007 order that it would not \"make a <i>final</i> determination of the existence of antitrust impact at the certification stage.\" <i>Motor Vehicles VI,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 80 (emphasis added). \"Whether an illegal agreement halting Canadian imports (or removing their threat) produced antitrust causation or retail purchase price impact remains to be proven at trial or demonstrated at summary judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 82 n. 5.</p>\n<p>[20]  Professor Kalt had described the contours of the gray market in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Professor Hall argued that the gray market in 2001 and 2002 would reflect the impact of the alleged horizontal conspiracy and that the relevant arbitrage opportunities were not present in 2000.</p>\n<p>[21]  For example, Professor Hall cited a study showing that dealers tend to pass on to consumers at least some pricing incentives given by manufacturers. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 137 (citing M. Busse et al., <i>$1000 Cash Back: Asymmetric Information in Auto Manufacturer Promotions</i> 45 (Nat'l Bureau of Econ. Res. Working Paper Series No. 10887, 2004)).</p>\n<p>[22]  The parties filed briefs on these issues of state substantive law before the March 21, 2007 order. The court found that the parties' briefing did not cause it to change its prior views.</p>\n<p>[23]  Defendants say this is not an accurate representation of California law, but do not press the point on appeal.</p>\n<p>[24]  Those issues were:\n</p>\n<p>(a) Was there a horizontal agreement to restrict supply?</p>\n<p>(b) Was it illegal under that particular state's laws?</p>\n<p>(c) . . . Did the illegal agreement have antitrust or consumer protection impact in that state as the plaintiffs propose to prove it?</p>\n<p>(d) If so, is that impact sufficient to confer standing under the particular state's laws?</p>\n<p>(e) How long did the conspiracy and its impact last?</p>\n<p><i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 142 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>[25]  In a footnote, the district court explained that it believed it had complied with the First Circuit requirement that the district court \"formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out,\" <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 298, that it conduct a \"rigorous analysis\" of the Rule 23 criteria, <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 38, and that it test the disputed premises \"early on,\" <i>Tardiff,</i> 365 F.3d at 4. <i>Motor Vehicle VI,</i> 241 F.R.D. at 81 n. 7. The court noted that <i>PolyMedica</i> did not mandate a particular level of fact-finding by the district judge at the certification stage. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[26]  Defendants attempt to answer this problem by saying these statements demonstrate that the district court failed to inquire adequately into the record; that answer is a mismatch with the problem presented of an incomplete record and of incomplete work by the plaintiffs' expert.</p>\n<p>[27]  The 2003 amendments to Rule 23 deleted the provision allowing class certifications to be conditional. The advisory committee notes explain that \"[a] court that is not satisfied that the requirements of Rule 23 have been met should refuse certification until they have been met.\" This does not prevent a judge from modifying its certification if it becomes clear, as the case develops, that the class action vehicle is in fact inappropriate.</p>\n<p>[28]  While these are both questions that are themselves susceptible to common proof (the potential size of the gray market and the distinction between the effects of horizontal and vertical restraints), they go to the viability of a novel theory upon which plaintiffs rely to establish an element of their claim through common means. In that sense, these factual questions are akin to the question of market efficiency in securities class actions employing the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance. Cases like <i>PolyMedica</i> and <i>Xcelera</i> demonstrate that such factual bases of theories of common proof are appropriately, although preliminarily, tested at the class certification stage.</p>\n<p>[29]  The district court noted that \"some states permit consumers to recover the full purchase price once liability is proven,\" further simplifying the calculation of individual damages awards. <i>Motor Vehicles V,</i> 235 F.R.D. at 143 n. 53.</p>\n<p>[30]  I agree that the case is properly remanded to the district court so that it can first establish whether there is jurisdiction under § 1332 or§ 1367.</p>\n\n</div>",
