Petitioner Lin Un,1 a Cambodian\n\ncitizen, seeks review of a final order of removal issued by the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily affirming a decision\n\nof an Immigration Judge (IJ) denying four claims for relief.              Two\n\nof those claims are not before us: petitioner concedes that his\n\nasylum request was untimely and he has not addressed in his brief\n\nthe IJ's denial of voluntary departure.             Petitioner challenges\n\ndenial of his application for withholding of removal and also\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\n      We conclude that we lack appellate jurisdiction to address the\n\nCAT issue because it was not raised in petitioner's Notice of\n\nAppeal to the BIA.       Our review of the full record persuades us,\n\nhowever, that we must remand the case for further consideration of\n\nthe   removal    issue   because   the   IJ   failed   to   address   whether\n\npetitioner was subject to past persecution, which would have\n\nentitled him to the regulatory presumption of a future threat to\n\nhis life or freedom.      See 8 C.F.R § 1208.16(b)(1).\n\n                          I. Factual Background\n\n      Petitioner entered the United States on a visitor's visa in\n\nJanuary 1997, leaving his wife and three children in Cambodia.             He\n\noverstayed      his   authorized    time,     and   the     Immigration   and\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       Although the record identifies petitioner as \"Lin\" Un, the\ncorrect spelling of his first name is \"Len.\"\n\n                                    -2-\n\fNaturalization Service (INS) initiated the removal proceedings that\n\neventually resulted in the BIA order currently under review.2\n\n     Un's reason for leaving Cambodia arose out of his employment\n\nas a Guard Shift Supervisor at the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh.\n\nAccording         to   his   employment       contract,      contained   in    the\n\nadministrative record, he was one of three shift supervisors of a\n\ngroup       of   350   security   employees,    with   the    responsibility    of\n\nsafeguarding U.S. government property and personnel in the Embassy\n\ncompound and residential areas.\n\n     Petitioner told of two occasions when he was visited by men he\n\nthought were from the Cambodian Ministry of the Interior.                      The\n\nfirst visit occurred in August 1996.               The men asked for secret\n\ninformation about the Embassy, specifically, information about the\n\nrooms in the building with bullet-proof walls and the number of new\n\nstaff coming to work there.          He did not provide that information.\n\n     Subsequently, on December 16, 1996, he was visited by two men,\n\nat least one of whom was in uniform, and he described the threat he\n\nreceived as follows:\n\n     They told me that they will kill me with a gun, and they\n     asked me to think about that, to think, to think what\n     their request is and they don't ask for the, the answer\n     on that specific day at all.    They asked me to think\n\n\n\n        2\n       On March 1, 2003, after the inception of this case but\nbefore the BIA's order, the INS ceased to exist as an independent\nagency.   Many of its duties were transferred to U.S. Citizenship\nand Immigration Services, a bureau of the newly created Department\nof Homeland Security.\n\n                                        -3-\n\f     about it.   And if I refused it, they said that I will be\n     killed.\n\nPetitioner testified that he told the men that Embassy policy\n\nbarred him from revealing such information to an outsider.              One of\n\nthe men then told him to \"sleep with it\" and he would \"let you know\n\nsoon.\"   Some time later, a friend of petitioner, whom he believed,\n\ntold him that he must go into hiding because they were \"looking to\n\nkill you.\"\n\n     Petitioner's wife, though at home on these occasions, was\n\nexcluded from the conversations to protect her from any reprisals.\n\nPetitioner did not inform his superior in the Embassy about the\n\nattempts to enlist him as a spy, thinking that rumors might surface\n\nand someone in his family might be hurt.           Nor did petitioner, in\n\napplying for a visa, mention the incidents.\n\n     Petitioner produced a letter from his wife, dated September 4,\n\n2000.    She   wrote    that,   even    after   almost   four   years   since\n\npetitioner left for the United States, \"they\" often come, yell at\n\nher, and threaten her, causing her and her children to sleep at\n\nfriends' houses. She reported that four men armed with pistols had\n\ncome several days earlier and asked if her husband was at home or\n\n\"hiding at work, at the American Embassy,\" and then searched every\n\nroom in the house.     She also wrote that the children did not attend\n\nschool regularly, since she and they were running away from home\n\nfrequently.\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f                         II. The Agency's Decision\n\n      The IJ, who had patiently conducted several hearings in this\n\ncase, rendered an oral decision on March 19, 2003.                  She noted with\n\napparent skepticism the fact that petitioner's passport was issued\n\nfive days before he was threatened for the second time.                      Referring\n\nto a letter submitted by his Embassy supervisor, the IJ rejected\n\nthe employer's conclusions concerning petitioner's motivation for\n\ncoming to the United States and observed that petitioner had not\n\nmentioned any threats.      Nonetheless, although she made no general\n\nfinding of credibility, the IJ gave petitioner the benefit of the\n\ndoubt and assumed that he had testified truthfully about the\n\nthreats.    She    concluded,      however,      that    even     if    petitioner's\n\ntestimony   were      entirely    true,    \"he    has     failed       to    establish\n\nobjectively that it is more likely than not he would be harmed at\n\nthis time if [he] returns to Cambodia.\"                  She reasoned that his\n\nemployment with the Embassy had ended in January 1997 and he had\n\nnot indicated that anyone would harm him at this time.\n\n      Without   any    additional    findings,         the   IJ    concluded      that\n\npetitioner had also \"not established that the government would\n\ndetain him and subject him to torture.\"                He was thus not eligible\n\nfor   protection   under    the   CAT     and    was    subject    to       removal   to\n\nCambodia.   Finally, noting that petitioner had failed to tell his\n\nattorney or the court of an earlier application for asylum, the IJ\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fdeemed petitioner to be a person unlikely to comply with any order\n\nand therefore denied voluntary departure.\n\n     The BIA affirmed without opinion on July 7, 2004.\n\n                           III. Discussion\n\n     Petitioner's key argument is that the IJ (and the BIA) failed\n\nto address one of the two avenues open to an applicant for proving\n\nentitlement   to   withholding   of   removal,   i.e.,   whether   he   had\n\nsuffered past persecution on account of one of five proscribed\n\ngrounds (here, membership in a particular social group, U.S.\n\nEmbassy employees).    Under 8 C.F.R § 1208.16(b)(1)(I), captioned\n\n\"Past threat to life or freedom,\" if such past persecution has been\n\ndetermined, \"it shall be presumed that the applicant's life or\n\nfreedom would be threatened in the future . . . .\"\n\n     Once such a presumption is created, the task falls upon the\n\ngovernment to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nfundamental changes have occurred that have removed any threat to\n\nan applicant's life or freedom or that relocation to another part\n\nof the proposed country of removal would be safer and reasonable.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R § 1208.16(b)(1)(ii).      Instead, as we have noted, the IJ\n\nimposed the burden on petitioner to demonstrate that he was more\n\nlikely than not to be harmed if returned to Cambodia.\n\n     The government responds to these challenges by saying, first,\n\nthat \"the immigration judge's decision, when taken as a whole,\n\nindicated that petitioner did not establish past persecution in\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\forder to effectuate the regulatory presumption of a future threat\n\nto his life or freedom.\"          This is followed by the statement that\n\n\"[s]ubstantial evidence supports that finding.\"                       This kind of\n\nargumentation is misleading.           There is no issue here regarding the\n\ncustomary deference we owe to a finder of fact because there is no\n\nfinding.     The IJ's decision permits no interpretation other than\n\nthat \"past persecution\" and its possible basis for a presumption\n\nwere simply not addressed.\n\n      As we have made clear, we expect an agency to make findings,\n\nimplicitly     if   not   explicitly,        on    all   grounds     necessary      for\n\ndecision.      Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nAlthough we were dealing with a petitioner's request for asylum in\n\nEl   Moraghy   v.     Ashcroft,   331       F.3d   195     (1st    Cir.    2003),   the\n\nprocedural issue was identical in that the IJ had not addressed\n\nwhether El Moraghy had suffered past persecution.                    We said:\n\n      The absence of reasoned discussion of past persecution\n      undercuts any meaningful review of the IJ's fear of\n      future prosecution finding, because we do not know\n      whether El Moraghy should have had the benefit of the\n      regulatory presumption of fear of persecution based on\n      prior events.\n\nId. at 204-05.        Indeed, as we observed in Hernandez-Barrera v.\n\nAshcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 25 (1st Cir. 2004), the failure to address\n\npast persecution in effect precludes \"meaningful review\" of both\n\npetitioner's    entitlement       to    a    presumption      of    fear    of   future\n\npersecution     and    the   IJ's      finding      that     petitioner      had    not\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\festablished that it was more likely than not that he would be\n\nharmed on return to Cambodia.\n\n       We could, of course, affirm if, even accepting petitioner's\n\ntestimony as true, we nonetheless were compelled to hold either\n\nthat    the   facts   did   not   demonstrate   past   persecution    or   that\n\nevidence of changed circumstances overcomes the presumption of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n       Unfortunately, however, as in El Moraghy, \"[w]e cannot say the\n\nevidence compels a conclusion either way,\" 331 F.3d at 205. First,\n\nthe evidence pointing to past persecution is that petitioner was\n\nvisited at his home by agents of the Ministry of the Interior, who\n\nrequested inside information about the Embassy.              The 2001 State\n\nDepartment Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Cambodia\n\nreported that, while nominally the National Police of the Ministry\n\nof the Interior are under civilian control, they and other security\n\nforces \"answer to persons within the CPP (Cambodian People's\n\nParty)\" and members of the security forces have committed numerous\n\nhuman    rights   abuses.         Allegations   of   politically     motivated\n\nkillings had increased.\n\n       Petitioner's    initial     confrontation     with   the   agents   was\n\nfollowed several months later by another visit and threat that\n\npetitioner would be killed if he refused to cooperate.             A credible\n\nfriend who worked in the Ministry confirmed that the agents were\n\nplanning to kill him.       Even after petitioner left the country, the\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fMinistry agents persisted in calling on his wife, and on at least\n\none occasion, they searched his home and interrogated his family at\n\ngunpoint.\n\n       These facts present an explicit death threat with perhaps one\n\nor more implicit ones.         Making the same assumption of truthfulness\n\nas the IJ for the purpose of this analysis, our question is whether\n\nthe asserted death threats could be sufficient to establish past\n\npersecution.\n\n       It seems to us that credible verbal death threats may fall\n\nwithin the meaning of \"persecution.\"                 We have indicated that a\n\nthreat to life could amount to persecution.                See Aguilar-Solis v.\n\nINS, 168 F.3d 565, 570 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"[P]ersecution encompasses\n\nmore than threats to life or freedom . . . .\").                   And at least one\n\ncircuit has specifically so pronounced.              In Andriasian v. INS, 180\n\nF.3d 1033, 1042 (9th Cir. 1999), the court stated: \"[T]he warning\n\nthat       the   Andriasians   would   be   killed    if   they    did   not   leave\n\nAzerbaijan immediately . . . would by itself be sufficient to\n\nestablish past persecution.\"3          See also Miljkovic v. Ashcroft, 376\n\nF.3d 754, 756 (7th Cir. 2004)(\"When discrimination reaches the\n\nlevel of physical violence or threats of violence, it becomes\n\npersecution.\").         The government offers no case authority to the\n\n\n\n       3\n       The court in Andriasian noted that the warning \"was made all\nthe more credible by the fact that the Azeri thugs who issued the\nthreat had just murdered Mr. Andriasian's neighbor in cold blood.\"\n180 F.3d at 1042.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fcontrary.          We thus conclude that a finding that petitioner has\n\nsuffered no past persecution is not compelled by this record;\n\nassessing the credibility and significance of the evidence in the\n\ncontext of the entire record is a task for the IJ in the first\n\ninstance.          Cf. Bocova v. Gonzáles, No. 04-2175, slip op. at 8 (1st\n\nCir.        June   24,     2005)   (noting    that   the    BIA   determines     whether\n\npersecution has occurred \"on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis\").\n\n       A conclusion of harmless error alternatively would be possible\n\nif the record compelled a finding that any presumption of future\n\nthreats was rebutted by \"a fundamental change in circumstances such\n\nthat [petitioner's] life or freedom would not be threatened.\"                            8\n\nC.F.R        §   1208.16(b)(1)(A).          The   government      has   not    made    this\n\nargument, addressing only the converse issue (which assumes that\n\npetitioner          bore    the    burden    of   proof)    of    whether     there     was\n\nsubstantial evidence supporting the IJ's finding that petitioner\n\nfailed to establish the likelihood of harm if returned to Cambodia.\n\nWe   therefore           conclude   that     we   must     remand   this      matter    for\n\nconsideration of the issue of past persecution.4\n\n       Petitioner's second claimed basis for relief is that the IJ\n\nand BIA erred in finding him ineligible for relief under the\n\nConvention Against Torture.                  But, as the government points out,\n\n\n        4\n       Should the IJ determine that threats rising to the level of\npersecution were made, the question remains whether petitioner has\nshown that the threats were made \"on account of\" one of the\nprotected grounds. See, e.g., Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398\nF.3d 120, 124 (1st Cir. 2005); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1).\n\n                                             -10-\n\fthis issue was not raised before the BIA.                   Although petitioner's\n\nNotice of Appeal indicated that a brief would be filed with the\n\nBoard, none was forthcoming.                 And, though the Notice of Appeal\n\nlisted nine reasons or grounds, none mentioned the CAT.                                In\n\nAthehortua-Vanegas v. INS, 876 F.2d 238, 240-41 (1st Cir. 1989), we\n\nrecognized      the    limits     to    our     authority,    saying,         \"[b]ecause\n\nexhaustion is statutorily mandated, the requirement [of exhaustion\n\nof administrative remedies] is jurisdictional.\" In that case as in\n\nthe one before us, there was no brief filed.                      In that case the\n\nissue    in   the     Notice    of     Appeal    was   phrased    only        in   \"gauzy\n\ngenerality;\" in this one, the CAT issue was not phrased in any\n\nterms.\n\n     Although       petitioner       might    argue    that   this      was    a   simple\n\noversight and that the IJ had clearly dealt with the issue, we see\n\nno way of assuming jurisdiction simply because it would appear that\n\nthe BIA could not have overlooked the missing issue.                    As we said in\n\nAthehortua-Vanegas, \"[a]t the very least, a grievant must tell the\n\nBoard what aspects of the IJ's decision he contends were wrong, and\n\nwhy,\" id. at 241.         We have consistently taken this position.                  See,\n\ne.g., Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nRavindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 761 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n     The petition for review is granted, the order of removal is\n\nvacated,      and   the    case   is     remanded      to   the   BIA    for       further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f",

According to his employment contract, contained in the administrative record, he was one of three shift supervisors of a group of 350 security employees, with the responsibility of safeguarding U.S. government property and personnel in the Embassy compound and residential areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner told of two occasions when he was visited by men he thought were from the Cambodian Ministry of the Interior. The first visit occurred in August 1996. The men asked for secret information about the Embassy, specifically, information about the rooms in the building with bullet-proof walls and the number of new staff coming to work there. He did not provide that information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, on December 16, 1996, he was visited by two men, at least one of whom was in uniform, and he described the threat he received as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They told me that they will kill me with a gun, and they asked me to think about that, to think, to think what their request is and they don't ask for the, the answer on that specific day at all.

One of the men then told him to \"sleep with it\" and he would \"let you know soon.\" Some time later, a friend of petitioner, whom he believed, told him that he must go into hiding because they were \"looking to kill you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's wife, though at home on these occasions, was excluded from the conversations to protect her from any reprisals.

She reported that four men armed with pistols had come several days earlier and asked if her husband was at home or \"hiding at work, at the American Embassy,\" and then searched every room in the house. She also wrote that the children did not attend school regularly, since she and they were running away from home frequently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>The Agency's Decision</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ, who had patiently conducted several hearings in this case, rendered an oral decision on March 19, 2003. She noted with apparent skepticism the fact that petitioner's passport was issued five days before he was threatened for the second time. Referring to a letter submitted by his Embassy supervisor, the IJ rejected the employer's conclusions concerning petitioner's motivation for coming to the United States and observed that petitioner had not mentioned any threats. Nonetheless, although she made no general finding of credibility, the IJ gave petitioner the benefit of the doubt and assumed that he had testified truthfully about the threats. She concluded, however, that even if petitioner's testimony were entirely true, \"he has failed to establish objectively that it is more likely than not he would be harmed at this time if [he] returns to Cambodia.\" She reasoned that his employment with the Embassy had ended in January 1997 and he had not indicated that anyone would harm him at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without any additional findings, the IJ concluded that petitioner had also \"not established that the government would detain him and subject him to torture.\" He was thus not eligible for protection under the CAT and was subject to removal to Cambodia. Finally, noting that petitioner had failed to tell his attorney or the court of an earlier application for asylum, the IJ deemed petitioner to be a person unlikely to comply with any order and therefore denied voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA affirmed without opinion on July 7, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's key argument is that the IJ (and the BIA) failed to address one of the two avenues open to an applicant for proving entitlement to withholding of removal, i.e., whether he had suffered past persecution on account of one of five proscribed grounds (here, membership in a particular social group, U.S. Embassy employees). Under 8 C.F.R &#167; 1208.16(b)(1)(i), captioned \"Past threat to life or freedom,\" if such past persecution has been determined, \"it shall be presumed that the applicant's life or freedom would be threatened in the future....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once such a presumption is created, the task falls upon the government to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that fundamental changes have occurred that have removed any threat to an applicant's life or freedom or that relocation to another part of the proposed country of removal would be safer and reasonable. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R &#167; 1208.16(b)(1)(ii). Instead, as we have noted, the IJ imposed the burden on petitioner to demonstrate that he was more likely than not to be harmed if returned to Cambodia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds to these challenges by saying, first, that \"the immigration judge's decision, when taken as a whole, indicated that petitioner did not establish past persecution in order to effectuate the regulatory presumption of a future threat to his life or freedom.\" This is followed by the statement that \"[s]ubstantial evidence supports that finding.\" This kind of argumentation is misleading. There is no issue here regarding the customary deference we owe to a finder of fact because there is no finding. The IJ's decision permits no interpretation other than that \"past persecution\" and its possible basis for a presumption were simply not addressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have made clear, we expect an agency to make findings, implicitly if not explicitly, on all grounds necessary, for decision. <i>Gailius v. INS,</i> 147 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir.1998). Although we were dealing with a petitioner's request for asylum in <i>El Moraghy v. Ashcroft,</i> 331 F.3d 195 (1st Cir.2003), the procedural issue was identical in that the IJ had not addressed whether El Moraghy had suffered past persecution. We said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of reasoned discussion of past persecution undercuts any meaningful review of the IJ's fear of future prosecution finding, because we do not know whether El Moraghy should have had the benefit of the regulatory presumption of fear of persecution based on prior events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 204-05. Indeed, as we observed in <i>Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft,</i> 373 F.3d 9, 25 (1st Cir.2004), the failure to address past persecution in effect precludes \"meaningful review\" of both petitioner's entitlement to a presumption of fear of future persecution and the IJ's finding that petitioner had not established that it was more likely than not that he would be harmed on return to Cambodia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We could, of course, affirm if, even accepting petitioner's testimony as true, we nonetheless were compelled to hold either that the facts did not demonstrate past persecution or that evidence of changed circumstances overcomes the presumption of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, however, as in <i>El Moraghy,</i> \"[w]e cannot say the evidence compels a conclusion either way,\" 331 F.3d at 205. First, the evidence pointing to past persecution is that petitioner was visited at his home by agents of the Ministry of the Interior, who requested inside information about the Embassy. The 2001 State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Cambodia reported that, while nominally the National Police of the Ministry of the Interior are under civilian control, they and other security forces \"answer to persons within the CPP (Cambodian People's Party)\" and members of the security forces have committed numerous human rights abuses. Allegations of politically motivated killings had increased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's initial confrontation with the agents was followed several months later by another visit and threat that petitioner would be killed if he refused to cooperate. A credible friend who worked in the Ministry confirmed that the agents were planning to kill him. Even after petitioner left the country, the Ministry agents persisted in calling on his wife, and on at least one occasion, they searched his home and interrogated his family at gunpoint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These facts present an explicit death threat with perhaps one or more implicit ones. Making the same assumption of truthfulness as the IJ for the purpose of this analysis, our question is whether the asserted death threats could be sufficient to establish past persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to us that credible verbal death threats may fall within the meaning of \"persecution.\" We have indicated that a threat to life could amount to persecution. <i>See Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 570 (1st Cir.1999) (\"[P]ersecution encompasses more than threats to life or freedom....\"). And at least one circuit has specifically so pronounced. In <i>Andriasian v. INS,</i> 180 F.3d 1033, 1042 (9th Cir.1999), the court stated: \"[T]he warning that the Andriasians would be killed if they did not leave Azerbaijan immediately... would by itself be sufficient to establish past persecution.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See also Miljkovic v. Ashcroft,</i> 376 F.3d 754, 756 (7th Cir.2004) (\"When discrimination reaches the level of physical violence or threats of violence, it becomes persecution.\"). The government offers no case authority to the contrary. We thus conclude that a finding that petitioner has suffered no past persecution is not compelled by this record; assessing the credibility and significance of the evidence in the context of the entire record is a task for the IJ in the first instance. <i>Cf. Bocova v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that the BIA determines whether persecution has occurred \"on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A conclusion of harmless error alternatively would be possible if the record compelled a finding that any presumption of future threats was rebutted by \"a fundamental change in circumstances such that [petitioner's] life or freedom would not be threatened.\" 8 C.F.R &#167; 1208.16(b)(1)(A). The government has not made this argument, addressing only the converse issue (which assumes that petitioner bore the burden of proof) of whether there was substantial evidence supporting the IJ's finding that petitioner failed to establish the likelihood of harm if returned to Cambodia. We therefore conclude that we must remand this matter for consideration of the issue of past persecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's second claimed basis for relief is that the IJ and BIA erred in finding him ineligible for relief under the Convention Against Torture. But, as the government points out, this issue was not raised before the BIA. Although petitioner's Notice of Appeal indicated that a brief would be filed with the Board, none was forthcoming. And, though the Notice of Appeal listed nine reasons or grounds, none mentioned the CAT. In <i>Athehortua-Vanegas v. INS,</i> 876 F.2d 238, 240-41 (1st Cir.1989), we recognized the limits to our authority, saying, \"[b]ecause exhaustion is statutorily mandated, the requirement [of exhaustion of administrative remedies] is jurisdictional.\" In that case as in the one before us, there was no brief filed. In that case the issue in the Notice of Appeal was phrased only in \"gauzy generality;\" in this one, the CAT issue was not phrased in any terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although petitioner might argue that this was a simple oversight and that the IJ had clearly dealt with the issue, we see no way of assuming jurisdiction simply because it would appear that the BIA could not have overlooked the missing issue. As we said in <i>Athehortua-Vanegas,</i> \"[a]t the very least, a grievant must tell the Board what aspects of the IJ's decision he contends were wrong, and why,\" <i>id.</i> at 241. We have consistently taken this position. <i>See, e.g., Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Ravindran v.

Instead, as we have noted, the IJ imposed the burden on petitioner to demonstrate that he was more likely than not to be harmed if returned to Cambodia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds to these challenges by saying, first, that \"the immigration judge's decision, when taken as a whole, indicated that petitioner did not establish past persecution in order to effectuate the regulatory presumption of a future threat to his life or freedom.\" This is followed by the statement that \"[s]ubstantial evidence supports that finding.\" This kind of argumentation is misleading. There is no issue here regarding the customary deference we owe to a finder of fact because there is no finding. The IJ's decision permits no interpretation other than that \"past persecution\" and its possible basis for a presumption were simply not addressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have made clear, we expect an agency to make findings, implicitly if not explicitly, on all grounds necessary, for decision. <i>Gailius v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198026\"><a href=\"/opinion/198026/ins-v-gailius/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1998). Although we were dealing with a petitioner's request for asylum in <i>El Moraghy v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200506\"><a href=\"/opinion/200506/el-moraghy-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003), the procedural issue was identical in that the IJ had not addressed whether El Moraghy had suffered past persecution. We said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of reasoned discussion of past persecution undercuts any meaningful review of the IJ's fear of future prosecution finding, because we do not know whether El Moraghy should have had the benefit of the regulatory presumption of fear of persecution based on prior events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 204-05. Indeed, as we observed in <i>Hernandez-Barrera v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786695\"><a href=\"/opinion/786695/fidel-angel-hernandez-barrera-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2004), the failure to address past persecution in effect precludes \"meaningful review\" of both petitioner's entitlement to a presumption of fear of future persecution and the IJ's finding that petitioner had not established that it was more likely than not that he would be harmed on return to Cambodia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We could, of course, affirm if, even accepting petitioner's testimony as true, we nonetheless were compelled to hold either that the facts did not demonstrate past persecution or that evidence of changed circumstances overcomes the presumption of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, however, as in <i>El Moraghy,</i> \"[w]e cannot say the evidence compels a conclusion either way,\" 331 F.3d at 205. First, the evidence pointing to past persecution is that petitioner was visited at his home by agents of the Ministry of the Interior, who requested inside information about the Embassy. The 2001 State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Cambodia reported that, while nominally the National Police of the Ministry of the Interior are under civilian control, they and other security forces \"answer to persons within the CPP (Cambodian People's Party)\" and members of the security forces have committed numerous human rights abuses. Allegations of politically motivated killings had increased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's initial confrontation with the agents was followed several months later by another visit and threat that petitioner would be killed if he refused to cooperate. A credible friend who worked in the Ministry confirmed that the agents were planning to kill him. Even after petitioner left the country, the Ministry agents persisted in calling on his wife, and on at least one occasion, they searched his home and interrogated his family at gunpoint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These facts present an explicit death threat with perhaps one or more implicit ones. Making the same assumption of truthfulness as the IJ for the purpose of this analysis, our question is whether the asserted death threats could be sufficient to establish past persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to us that credible verbal death threats may fall within the meaning of \"persecution.\" We have indicated that a threat to life could amount to persecution. <i>See Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 570 (1st Cir.1999) (\"[P]ersecution encompasses more than threats to life or freedom....\"). And at least one circuit has specifically so pronounced. In <i>Andriasian v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1033</span></span>, 1042 (9th Cir.1999), the court stated: \"[T]he warning that the Andriasians would be killed if they did not leave Azerbaijan immediately... would by itself be sufficient to establish past persecution.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See also Miljkovic v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787048\"><a href=\"/opinion/787048/dragan-miljkovic-and-divna-miljkovic-v-john-d-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 756 (7th Cir.2004) (\"When discrimination reaches the level of physical violence or threats of violence, it becomes persecution.\"). The government offers no case authority to the contrary. We thus conclude that a finding that petitioner has suffered no past persecution is not compelled by this record; assessing the credibility and significance of the evidence in the context of the entire record is a task for the IJ in the first instance. <i>Cf. Bocova v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that the BIA determines whether persecution has occurred \"on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A conclusion of harmless error alternatively would be possible if the record compelled a finding that any presumption of future threats was rebutted by \"a fundamental change in circumstances such that [petitioner's] life or freedom would not be threatened.\" 8 C.F.R &#167; 1208.16(b)(1)(A). The government has not made this argument, addressing only the converse issue (which assumes that petitioner bore the burden of proof) of whether there was substantial evidence supporting the IJ's finding that petitioner failed to establish the likelihood of harm if returned to Cambodia. We therefore conclude that we must remand this matter for consideration of the issue of past persecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's second claimed basis for relief is that the IJ and BIA erred in finding him ineligible for relief under the Convention Against Torture. But, as the government points out, this issue was not raised before the BIA. Although petitioner's Notice of Appeal indicated that a brief would be filed with the Board, none was forthcoming. And, though the Notice of Appeal listed nine reasons or grounds, none mentioned the CAT. In <i>Athehortua-Vanegas v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524261\"><a href=\"/opinion/524261/luis-n-athehortua-vanegas-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 240-41 (1st Cir.1989), we recognized the limits to our authority, saying, \"[b]ecause exhaustion is statutorily mandated, the requirement [of exhaustion of administrative remedies] is jurisdictional.\" In that case as in the one before us, there was no brief filed. In that case the issue in the Notice of Appeal was phrased only in \"gauzy generality;\" in this one, the CAT issue was not phrased in any terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although petitioner might argue that this was a simple oversight and that the IJ had clearly dealt with the issue, we see no way of assuming jurisdiction simply because it would appear that the BIA could not have overlooked the missing issue. As we said in <i>Athehortua-Vanegas,</i> \"[a]t the very least, a grievant must tell the Board what aspects of the IJ's decision he contends were wrong, and why,\" <i>id.</i> at 241. We have consistently taken this position. <i>See, e.g., Makhoul v.
