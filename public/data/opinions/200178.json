George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n           Campbell and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert A. George for appellant.\n     James Francis Lang, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        October 25, 2002\n\f           CAMPBELL,      Senior     Circuit    Judge.          The    petitioner-\n\nappellant, Fred Awon (\"Awon\") was convicted of arson and mail fraud\n\narising from the orchestration, on two occasions, of the arson of\n\na building and the submission of insurance claims.                       Following\n\nconviction, Awon moved for a new trial and to vacate his sentence\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2000), citing newly discovered\n\nevidence and a lack of federal jurisdiction.               The newly discovered\n\nevidence contained in five, allegedly exculpatory affidavits.                   The\n\ndistrict court, after holding an evidentiary hearing, denied both\n\nmotions    and,   upon    Awon's     request,     issued    a     certificate    of\n\nappealability under 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c).                 Finding no error, we\n\naffirm.\n\nI.          Background\n\n            Awon and his father owned rental income property located\n\nat 106-108 Ames Street (the \"Ames Street property\") in Brockton,\n\nMassachusetts, that consisted of unimproved rental space on the\n\nfirst floor and two apartments on the second floor.                    On September\n\n16, 1994, the Brockton Fire Department extinguished a fire in the\n\nvacant first floor space before significant damage occurred.                    The\n\nAwons filed a claim with their insurance company for the damage\n\nfrom this fire and were paid in settlement $4,171 for the damage.\n\nIn the early morning hours of January 18, 1995, another fire at the\n\nbuilding   resulted      in   the   destruction    not     only   of    the   Awon's\n\nbuilding but of three adjacent buildings as well.                 The Awons again\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffiled a   claim   with   their   insurance   company   and   negotiated   a\n\nsettlement of $85,000 for the loss of the building and demolition\n\nexpenses, and $6,176 for lost rental income.\n\n          Investigation of the two fires resulted in an eight count\n\nindictment charging Awon and two co-defendants, James St. Louis and\n\nJoaquim Neves (\"Joaquim\") with arson and mail fraud.          In Counts I\n\nthrough IV, Awon and James St. Louis were charged with arson, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) (2000) (Count I), mail fraud in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (Counts II and III), and use of a\n\nfire to commit a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) (Count\n\nIV). Those four counts related to the September 16, 1994, fire and\n\nthe subsequent filing of an insurance claim. Awon, James St. Louis\n\nand Joaquim were charged in Counts V through VIII with four\n\ncorresponding offenses, arson (Count V), mail fraud (Counts VI and\n\nVII) and use of fire to commit a felony (Count VIII).          The latter\n\nfour counts pertained to the January 18, 1995, fire and the filing\n\nof the second insurance claim.       Prior to trial, Joaquim pleaded\n\nguilty to Counts V, VI, and VII (Count VIII was dismissed) and,\n\npursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government, testified\n\nat trial as a witness against his two co-defendants, Awon and James\n\nSt. Louis.\n\nA.        The Trial\n\n          Joaquim, testifying pursuant to a plea agreement, stated\n\nat trial that, in the summer of 1994, Anse St. Louis had asked him,\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fpurportedly on Awon's behalf, if he would burn the Ames Street\n\nproperty.     Although initially hesitant, he agreed to commit the\n\narson and solicited the help of James St. Louis.    Joaquim further\n\ntestified that he had several conversations directly with Awon\n\nabout the arson and the promised pay-off.    According to Joaquim's\n\ntestimony, Awon agreed to pay him $5,000 for committing the arson.\n\nJust prior to the first fire, however, Joaquim was detained by the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") which had begun\n\ndeportation proceedings against him.\n\n            Jorge Neves (\"Jorge\"), Joaquim's brother, testified at\n\ntrial that while Joaquim was in INS custody, James St. Louis sought\n\nJorge's help to burn the Ames Street property.      Jorge said that\n\nJames St. Louis promised that they would be paid by Awon for the\n\narson.   Jorge testified, however, that he never spoke directly to\n\nAwon regarding the fire or payment.    Jorge further testified that,\n\non September 16, 1994, he and James St. Louis spread gasoline\n\naround the first floor of the building, ignited it, and fled in\n\nJames St. Louis' car.   The fire was quickly extinguished.   Because\n\n\"nothing happened,\" Jorge testified that he was never paid for the\n\narson.   As the result of his cooperation and testimony, Jorge was\n\nnot prosecuted for his involvement in setting the September 16,\n\n1994, fire.\n\n            Joaquim testified that, after his own release from INS\n\ncustody in November, 1994, he was again approached by Anse St.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fLouis, on behalf of Awon, with the request that he burn the Ames\n\nStreet   property.      Joaquim    said     he   agreed    and   that   he   again\n\nsolicited James St. Louis to help him.                According to Joaquim,\n\nJoaquim was to receive a cash payment for his involvement while\n\nJames St. Louis had directly negotiated with Awon for the receipt\n\nof a used Ford Taurus from Awon's car dealership.                On January 18,\n\n1995, Joaquim and James St. Louis drove to the Ames Street property\n\nin the car of Joaquim's girlfriend, Sandy Casamiro, and set the\n\nbuilding on fire.      The two men returned to Joaquim's house, placed\n\ntheir soiled clothes in a bag, awakened Casamiro, and had her drive\n\nthem to a nearby dumpster to discard their clothing.                    Casamiro\n\ncorroborated Joaquim's testimony about the late night excursion to\n\ndiscard the clothing worn at the time of the arson.               The next day,\n\naccording to the records of Awon's used car dealership, Awon\n\ntransferred a Ford Taurus to James St. Louis for $2,000.                 Joaquim\n\ntestified that, a week later, he received $2,100 in cash from Awon.\n\n             Testifying on behalf of Awon, Anse St. Louis said that he\n\nnever spoke with Awon or Joaquim about the burning of the Ames\n\nStreet property.       Awon's parents testified that they were the\n\nowners and actual parties in interest with respect to the building\n\nand   that    Awon's   involvement     was       limited   to    responding     to\n\nmaintenance    requests   and     showing    the   building      to   prospective\n\ntenants.     In essence, it was their testimony that Awon had no\n\nfinancial stake in the property.           Awon testified that he believed\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fthat Joaquim had set the fire in retaliation for Awon's refusal to\n\npost bail for Joaquim when he was in INS custody and in reaction to\n\nan argument between the two men prior to the second fire.\n\n           The jury found Awon guilty of all counts.           James St.\n\nLouis was acquitted of the first four counts, those related to the\n\nSeptember 16, 1994, fire, and found guilty of the remaining four\n\ncounts.    Awon was sentenced to a 153-month term of imprisonment,\n\nwhich    represented   a   downward   departure   from   the   applicable\n\nguideline sentencing range of 198 to 217 months.          Awon was also\n\nordered to pay restitution to the Scottsdale Insurance Company in\n\nthe amount of $95,788.36.      This court affirmed his conviction on\n\nFebruary 2, 1998.      United States v. Awon, 135 F.3d 96 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\nB.         Post-conviction Proceedings\n\n           On February 1, 1999, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, Awon\n\nfiled a Motion to Set Aside, Vacate, or Correct Sentence and, in an\n\nessentially duplicative pleading, he filed a motion for a new\n\ntrial.    In the two motions, Awon pursued identical claims:         (1)\n\nthat newly-discovered evidence warranted a new trial; and (2) that\n\nwith respect to Count V of the indictment the government's evidence\n\nat trial was insufficient to satisfy the federal jurisdictional\n\nelement of 18 U.S.C. § 841(i) (2000).1\n\n\n     1\n      18 U.S.C. § 841(i) makes arson of a building \"used in\ninterstate or foreign commerce or in an activity affecting\ninterstate or foreign commerce\" a federal offense.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          The       newly-discovered     evidence     was   set    out    in   five\n\naffidavits.     In their affidavits, Jorge Neves and Joaquim Neves\n\nrecanted their trial testimony implicating Awon in the fires.\n\nJoaquim averred that he had falsified his testimony in the hopes of\n\ngaining   favor      with    law   enforcement      officials     and    avoiding\n\ndeportation.      Jorge disavowed any statement he made on the stand\n\nimplicating    Awon    and    stated    he    had   fingered    Awon     to    avoid\n\nprosecution.        James St. Louis, who did not testify at trial,\n\naverred that he was solely responsible for the planning of the\n\nsecond fire and that Awon played no part in the arson.                    Roberto\n\nNeves, the brother of Jorge and Joaquim Neves, stated that he and\n\nhis family were threatened by the police that if Joaquim did not\n\nimplicate Awon, their sister's children would be taken away and\n\nRoberto would be jailed.           Roberto also reported that Joaquim had\n\nconfessed to Roberto that he, Joaquim, had lied about Awon's\n\ninvolvement    to    \"save   himself\"    and    receive     a   lower    sentence.\n\nRoberto did not testify at trial.            Finally, Awon submitted his own\n\naffidavit denying any involvement in the planning or execution of\n\nthe fire and averring that James St. Louis had confessed to him\n\nthat he and Joaquim had set the January 18, 1995, fire.\n\n          The district court held an evidentiary hearing on Awon's\n\ntwo motions.    Through counsel, Joaquim notified the court that he\n\nwithdrew his affidavit and recanted the statements he had made\n\ntherein. Thereafter, at the hearing, the government called Joaquim\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fto testify.           During his testimony at the evidentiary hearing,\n\nJoaquim described a four and one-half hour meeting with Awon's\n\nattorney that only ended when Joaquim agreed to sign the hand-\n\nwritten affidavit compiled by Awon's attorney. Joaquim stated that\n\nAwon's attorney informed him that he would not submit the affidavit\n\nto the court until Joaquim had signed and returned a typed copy of\n\nthe affidavit.          When Joaquim received the typed copy he discarded\n\nit   and      assumed    the    matter   was       closed.          He   reported    being\n\n\"surprised\" when he discovered that Awon's attorney had filed the\n\nhandwritten copy.         Awon himself did not testify at the hearing on\n\nhis two motions nor did James St. Louis or Jorge testify concerning\n\nthe facts they had averred in their affidavits.                          Roberto, having\n\nbeen       deported,    was    unavailable        to    testify.         Although    Awon's\n\nattorney was available to testify,2 he did not take the stand to\n\ncounter       Joaquim's       description    of        the    events     leading    to   the\n\nsubmission       of    Joaquim's    affidavit.               Awon   presented   no    other\n\ntestimony or documentary evidence to support his motions.\n\n               The government submitted an affidavit of Emanuel Gomes,\n\nthe investigating officer from the Brockton Police Department.\n\nGomes averred that he had neither threatened the Neves family nor\n\nhad he made promises regarding Joaquim's or Jorge's cooperation in\n\nthe investigation.             In addition, the government submitted two\n\n\n       2\n      Anticipating that he might testify, Awon's attorney had\nobtained separate counsel to represent Awon at the evidentiary\nhearing.\n\n                                            -8-\n\freports compiled by Special Agent Thomas Wlodyka (\"Wlodyka\") of the\n\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.3     Wlodyka had interviewed\n\nboth Joaquim and Jorge following the submission of their affidavits\n\nin support of Awon's post-conviction motions.         Wlodyka reported\n\nthat the brothers recanted their affidavits.        Jorge stated that\n\nAwon's attorney presented him with an affidavit to sign; that\n\nAwon's attorney told Jorge that the statement was \"basically what\n\nyou said at the trial;\" and that he did not review it prior to\n\nsigning it. Joaquim's statement to Wlodyka was consistent with his\n\ntestimony at the evidentiary hearing.     Both men informed Wlodyka\n\ntheir trial testimony was truthful.\n\n          Following the evidentiary hearing, the district court\n\ndenied both motions.    The court did not consider Roberto Neves's\n\naffidavit to be \"newly discovered.\"      According to the district\n\ncourt, the fact that defense counsel failed to interview Roberto\n\nNeves prior to trial did not support a finding that his testimony\n\nwas unknown   or   unavailable.    Further,   it   found   that   Jorge's\n\naffidavit did not support a new trial because the portion of his\n\ntrial testimony recanted in the affidavit was not critical to the\n\nprosecution's case.    Thus, even if it were omitted it was unlikely\n\nto result in a different outcome for Awon.     As to James St. Louis'\n\n\n     3\n      It is unclear from the record whether the district court\nconsidered these unsworn reports in rendering its decision.\nAlthough the district court never explicitly ruled on the matter,\nthe government acknowledges that the court was initially hesitant\nto do so.\n\n                                  -9-\n\faffidavit, which was viewed with \"great skepticism,\" the court\n\nfound it incredible on its face.         The district court acknowledged\n\nthat Joaquim's affidavit was the most supportive of a new trial.\n\nAt trial, Joaquim had provided the most damning testimony against\n\nAwon.   In the end, however, it found Joaquim's testimony at trial,\n\nand   his   testimony    at    the   evidentiary   hearing   recanting   his\n\naffidavit, credible.          Finally, without discussion, the district\n\ncourt   stated   that    it     considered   Awon's   argument   that    the\n\ngovernment's evidence was insufficient to meet the jurisdictional\n\nelement of 18 U.S.C. § 841(i) \"unpersuasive.\"\n\n            The district court's order denying the two motions was\n\nfiled on July 10, 2000.         Awon filed a notice of appeal on August\n\n11, 2000.     This court held the appeal in abeyance pending the\n\nissuance of a certificate of appealability for an appeal of the\n\ndenial of a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 as required by 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2253(c)(2).    On January 3, 2001, the district court ordered a\n\ncertificate of appealability.\n\nII.         Discussion\n\nA.          Motion for a New Trial\n\n            Awon failed to file a timely appeal from the denial of\n\nhis motion for a new trial.           Consequently, that appeal must be\n\ndismissed.    United States v. Rapopart, 159 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (stating that compliance with time limits set forth in Fed.\n\nR. App. P. 4(b) is mandatory and jurisdictional).\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f          The new trial motion, brought pursuant to Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 33, was denied on July 10, 2000, the day the district court also\n\ndenied Awon's motion to vacate sentence, brought pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255.   Although Awon cited the same grounds for both\n\nmotions, they are subject to different time limitations for the\n\nfiling of a notice of appeal.   Unless the district court grants an\n\nextension of time, which it did not do here, a party must appeal\n\nwithin ten days from the denial of a motion for a new trial made\n\npursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nFed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1,\n\n11 (1st Cir. 1989).   Awon filed his notice of appeal well out of\n\ntime, on August 11, 2000, thirty days after the court's order\n\ndenying the new trial motion.\n\nB.        Motion to Vacate Sentence\n\n          The only appeal properly before us is from the denial of\n\nAwon's motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nThe issues, as identified in the certificate of appealability, are\n\nwhether to vacate Awon's sentence because of the alleged newly\n\ndiscovered evidence in the five affidavits and whether the district\n\ncourt lacked jurisdiction under the federal arson statute.   Bui v.\n\nDiPaolo, 170 F.3d 232, 236 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S.\n\n1086 (2000).\n\n          On an appeal from the denial of a § 2255 motion, we\n\nreview the district court's legal determinations de novo and the\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fcourt's factual findings for clear error.                  Familia-Consoro v.\n\nUnited States, 160 F.3d 761, 764-65 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n1.        Newly Discovered Evidence\n\n          Awon    contends     that      the   purported    newly   discovered\n\nevidence establishes his actual innocence.           Assuming arguendo that\n\nAwon's claims of actual innocence based on the evidence in question\n\ncan establish some legally cognizable basis for a motion under\n\nsection 2255, the evidence proffered by Awon falls far short of\n\ndemonstrating his innocence.\n\n          We quickly eliminate Awon's and Roberto's affidavits\n\nbecause they     do   not   meet   the    standard   for   \"newly   discovered\n\nevidence.\"     United States v. Desir, 273 F.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   This court has held that a defendant seeking a new trial\n\nbased on newly discovered evidence must prove four elements:               (1)\n\nthe newly discovered evidence was unknown or unavailable at the\n\ntime of trial; (2) the defendant was duly diligent in trying to\n\ndiscover it; (3) the evidence was material; and (4) the evidence\n\nwas such that it would probably result in an acquittal upon\n\nretrial. Id. Awon failed to prove that the information was either\n\nunknown or unavailable at the time of trial.\n\n             The \"new\" information in Awon's affidavit, James St.\n\nLouis's confession to Awon that he was solely responsible for the\n\nsecond fire, was plainly available at the time of trial.                United\n\nStates v. Levy-Cordero, 156 F.3d 244, 248 (1st Cir. 1998).              In the\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\faffidavit itself Awon asserts that on the day after that fire James\n\nSt. Louis had confessed committing the arson to him.                 Why Awon did\n\nnot reveal the confession at trial but instead suggested that\n\nJoaquim had set the second fire is best known to him.                     In any\n\nevent, the concealed confession of his co-defendant cannot be\n\ndeemed \"newly discovered.\"\n\n            Roberto's testimony was also available at the time of\n\ntrial.   Awon argues that he had no reason to suspect that Roberto\n\nhad information germane to his defense and thus cannot be penalized\n\nfor   failing   to   unearth    and   present    Roberto's      testimony.       A\n\ndefendant, however, must have been duly diligent in attempting to\n\nprocure exculpatory evidence prior to trial.                United States v.\n\nConley, 249 F.3d 38, 44 (1st Cir. 2001).          Simply because it may not\n\nhave occurred to Awon and his counsel that Roberto had information\n\nregarding the crime that does not mean they were duly diligent on\n\nthe facts of this case.        Roberto was known to Awon as the brother\n\nof Joaquim and Jorge, the government's primary witnesses, both of\n\nwhom were implicated in the crime.           Roberto and   his sister, Helena\n\nNeves, were interviewed by the police during the investigation.\n\nIndeed, it was Helena Neves, who was dating James St. Louis, who\n\ncontacted the police and informed them that St. Louis and Jorge\n\nwere involved in the arson. Moreover, the credibility of Roberto's\n\naffidavit   was   severely     undermined,      insofar    as   it    related   to\n\nconversations with Joaquim, by Joaquim's later repudiation of his\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fown affidavit and testimony at the evidentiary hearing. Similarly,\n\nRoberto's averments that he and his family were threatened by the\n\npolice were neutralized by the affidavits of Detective Thomas Enos\n\nand Special Agent Thomas Wlodyka.             Enos and Wlodyka, the officers\n\nprimarily responsible for investigating the arson, denied that they\n\nhad threatened Roberto, or his family, with adverse consequences if\n\nthey did not implicate Awon.\n\n                On the other hand, James St. Louis's averments in his\n\naffidavit may indeed be deemed \"newly discovered.\"                    United States\n\nv. Montilla-Rivera, 115 F.3d 1060, 1066 (1st Cir. 1997) (concluding\n\nthat, in the context of a Rule 33 motion, a co-defendant's post-\n\ntrial willingness to testify may be \"newly discovered\" if he had\n\ninvoked 5th Amendment privilege at trial).                 But like the district\n\ncourt,     we    view   James   St.   Louis's       affidavit    as    lacking    in\n\ncredibility for reasons apparent on its face and from the record.\n\nId.   The trial court described James St. Louis's affidavit as\n\nincredible on its face.         St. Louis averred that he had conceived,\n\nplanned,    and     committed   the   arson    on    his   own   based    upon   his\n\nunverified hope that Awon, who had complained about the Ames Street\n\nproperty, would \"take care of\" him in the future.                        He further\n\nstated that, although unemployed at the time and notoriously short\n\non cash, he had paid Awon $2,000 for the car and paid Joaquim\n\n$2,100 for his part in the arson.         By the time of his affidavit St.\n\nLouis had nothing to lose by exonerating Awon.               He had already been\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fconvicted and sentenced.              He was in a position to say whatever he\n\nthought might help Awon, \"even to the point of pinning all the\n\nguilt on [himself], knowing [he was] safe\" from any increased\n\npunishment for the transaction.               United States v. Montilla-Rivera,\n\n171   F.3d    37,     41   (1st   Cir.    1999)    (quoting        United    States    v.\n\nReyes-Alvarado, 963 F.2d 1184, 1188 (9th Cir. 1992)).                        We accept\n\nthe court's finding that St. Louis's affidavit was not credible.\n\n              Finally, the affidavits of Jorge and Joaquim Neves were\n\ndiscredited by Joaquim's additional testimony at the evidentiary\n\nhearing      repudiating        his     own    affidavit      as     well    as      other\n\nconsiderations.            A   repudiated      recantation    is     not    substantive\n\nevidence, and can be used at a new trial only to cross-examine the\n\nwitness.      United States v. Glantz, 884 F.2d 1483, 1486 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).       The affidavits alone cannot serve to establish Awon's\n\ninnocence nor, given that they were later repudiated, are they a\n\ncredible      basis    for     expecting       Jorge   and    Joaquim       to    testify\n\ndifferently at a new trial than previously.\n\n              The   district      court    supportably       found    that       Joaquim's\n\ntestimony at the trial, and at the evidentiary hearing recanting\n\nhis affidavit, was credible.                  As noted, we review the district\n\ncourt's factual determinations for clear error.                      Our deference is\n\neven greater where, as here, the factual findings are based on\n\ncredibility determinations. United States v. Rostoff, 164 F.3d 63,\n\n71 (1st Cir. 1999).            In such cases, \"error is seldom considered\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\f'clear' unless the credibility assessments were based on testimony\n\nwhich was     inherently   implausible,     internally     inconsistent,   or\n\ncritically impeached.\"      Keller v. United States, 38 F.3d 16, 25\n\n(1st Cir. 1994). Joaquim's description of the events leading up to\n\nthe submission of his affidavit was plausible and unrefuted.               We\n\nfind no error.\n\n            Respecting Jorge, the district court found that Jorge's\n\nrecantation of his trial testimony, even if believed, would not\n\nresult in Awon's acquittal.4        Jorge had testified at trial that\n\nJames St. Louis had told him that Awon would pay them in cash if\n\nthey burned down the Ames Street property.           Jorge never spoke to\n\nAwon directly and because the first fire was unsuccessful Jorge\n\nnever received payment.     The district court concluded that Jorge's\n\nsecond hand account of Awon's involvement had a negligible impact\n\non the outcome.     The district court's conclusion is supported by\n\nthe record.     Jorge's testimony focused almost exclusively on James\n\nSt.   Louis's    involvement   in   the    first   fire.     His   testimony\n\nimplicated Awon only tangentially.         Moreover, given that James St.\n\nLouis was acquitted of the charges related to the first fire, it is\n\nunclear if Jorge's testimony had any impact on the trial's outcome.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      The district court did not refer to the two unsworn reports\nof Agent Wlodyka which had been submitted with the government's\nopposition to Awon's motions in which Wlodyka stated that Jorge had\nrecanted his affidavit filed with Awon's motion.\n\n                                    -16-\n\f              Awon's claim that his sentence should be vacated and the\n\ncase remanded to the district court for a new trial is meritless.\n\n2.            Jurisdiction\n\n              Awon also argues that the district court erred when it\n\nrefused to vacate his conviction for the second fire (Count V).\n\nAccording to Awon the government failed to adduce sufficient\n\nevidence to establish that the building was \"used in interstate or\n\nforeign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce\" as required by the statute.         18 U.S.C. § 844(i).     As a\n\nresult, Awon contends, the district court lacked subject matter\n\njurisdiction and his conviction as to Count V should be vacated.5\n\n              Before we can reach the merits of Awon's argument, we\n\nmust       first   address   the   government's   contention   that   Awon\n\nprocedurally defaulted his claim by failing to raise it on direct\n\nappeal.       Awon concedes that he did not appeal concerning the\n\n\n\n       5\n      We note at the start that, even if Awon's assertion were\nmeritorious, vacating his conviction on Count V would not affect\nhis sentence. Awon received a total term of imprisonment of 153\nmonths.   For his conviction under Count V, the district court\nimposed a 33 month term of imprisonment to be served concurrently\nwith the 33 month sentence he received for his conviction under\nCount I. Thus, vacating his conviction and sentence pursuant to\nCount V would not lower his current sentence. In addition, his\nconviction for mail fraud pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (Counts VI,\nand VII) and his conviction for use of fire to commit a felony\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 844(h)(1) and (2) (Count VIII) were not\ndependent upon his conviction of arson pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §\n844(i). As a result, if his conviction under Count V is vacated,\nhis conviction under the remaining counts and his subsequent\nsentence is unaffected. Thus, regardless of the outcome of our\nanalysis, Awon's 153 month sentence will remain intact.\n\n                                     -17-\n\fcourt's jurisdiction but claims that subject matter jurisdiction\n\ncan be noticed at any time.\n\n          Contrary to Awon's assertion, this case does not involve\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction and therefore had to be raised on\n\ndirect appeal.   The district court had subject matter jurisdiction\n\nin this case by virtue of the fact that Awon was charged with an\n\noffense against the United States.       18 U.S.C. § 3231.6    The\n\ninterstate commerce aspect of this case arises as an element of the\n\nsection 844(i) offense.    The statute requires the government to\n\nprove, inter alia, that the property involved in the arson was\n\n\"used in interstate or foreign commerce or in an activity affecting\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce.\"   If that element is not satisfied\n\nthen Awon is not guilty; but the court is not by the failure of\n\nproof on that element deprived of judicial jurisdiction.       See\n\nUnited States v. DiSanto, 86 F.3d 1238, 1246 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(upholding section 844(i) as constitutional after Lopez); accord\n\nUnited States v. Tush, 287 F.3d 1294, 1296 (10th Cir. 2002),\n\npetition for cert. filed (Aug. 12, 2002) (No. 02-5940) (\"The\n\ninterstate commerce element of § 844(i) 'is not jurisdictional in\n\nthe sense that it affects a court's subject matter jurisdiction,\n\ni.e., a court's constitutional or statutory power to adjudicate a\n\n\n     6\n       18 U.S.C. § 3231 provides:\n     The district court of the United States shall have\n     original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the\n     States, of all offenses against the laws of the United\n     States.\n\n                               -18-\n\fcase.'\"); United States v. Carr, 271 F.3d 172, 178 (4th Cir. 2001)\n\n(same); United States v. Beck, 250 F.3d 1163, 1165 (8th Cir.\n\n2001)(same).\n\n             Awon, on appeal, attempts to argue that his procedural\n\ndefault should be excused because he is \"actually innocent\" because\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to show that the interstate commerce\n\nelement had been met under Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848\n\n(2000).7 We reject Awon's actual innocence argument, which suffers\n\nfrom a number of problems.       First, his petition under § 2255 makes\n\nno   claim   at   all   of   actual   innocence;   the   government,   with\n\njustification, says the claim is forfeit.          Even if it had not been\n\nforfeit, it is doomed. The assertion of actual innocence to excuse\n\n\n      7\n      We note that Awon had ample opportunity to address the\nsufficiency of the evidence regarding the building's connection\nwith interstate commerce. In fact, prior to trial, Awon filed a\nmotion to dismiss the arson counts arguing that the Ames Street\nproperty did not have a sufficient connection with interstate\ncommerce as required by 18 U.S.C. § 844(i). In his pretrial motion\nhe initiated a peremptory strike at the government's evidence. The\ndistrict court denied the motion.     The question of whether the\nproperty was used in interstate commerce was presented to the jury\nas an element of the offense. The district court instructed the\njury that the government had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt,\nthat the property \"was used in or affected interstate or foreign\ncommerce\" and defined those terms commensurate with the applicable\ncase law. Awon did not appeal from the district court's denial of\nhis motion to dismiss, neither did he object to nor appeal from the\njury instructions nor appeal from his conviction under Count V. He\nonly raised the issue again on February 1, 1999, when he filed his\nmotion for a new trial and his motion pursuant to § 2255. In its\ndecision denying these motions, the district court stated, without\ndiscussion, that Awon's argument concerning the jurisdiction of the\ncourt was \"unconvincing.\" Awon v. United States, Civil Action No.\n99-10207-GAO, slip op. at 7 n.3 (D. Mass. July 1, 2000) (citing\nJones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848 (2000)).\n\n                                      -19-\n\fa procedural default does not permit a reviewing court to simply\n\ndive into defaulted questions of the sufficiency of evidence.\n\n           The actual innocence exception is quite narrow and seldom\n\nused.   Simpson v. Matesanz, 175 F.3d 200, 210 (1st Cir. 1999).            It\n\nis reserved for the extraordinary cases of \"fundamentally unjust\n\nincarceration.\"    Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 320-21 (1995).\n\n           Even if we hypothesized that this question was correctly\n\ncharacterized     as   one   of   factual   innocence     and   not    legal\n\ninsufficiency, see Sawyer v. Whitley, 503 U.S. 333, 339 (1992),\n\nthis had none of the hallmarks of the usual actual innocence claim.\n\nThere is no credible argument that the so-called new evidence\n\naffects the interstate commerce nexus, so this is not a situation\n\nof an actual innocence claim predicated on new evidence.              Schlup,\n\n513 U.S. at 324.       Nor is this a death case in which there is a\n\nconstitutional    violation   which   has   probably    resulted      in   the\n\nimposition of a death sentence of one who is actually innocent.\n\nDugger v. Adams, 489 U.S. 401, 411 n.6 (1989).         And even if we were\n\nto consider the claim of insufficiency, it is frivolous under\n\nRussell v. United States, 471 U.S. 858 (1985) and United States v.\n\nMedeiros, 897 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nIII.       Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons state above, the decision of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f",

Following conviction, Awon moved for a new trial and to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 (2000), citing newly discovered evidence and a lack of federal jurisdiction. The newly discovered evidence contained in five, allegedly exculpatory affidavits. The district court, after holding an evidentiary hearing, denied both motions and, upon Awon's request, issued a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awon and his father owned rental income property located at 106-108 Ames Street (the \"Ames Street property\") in Brockton, Massachusetts, that consisted of unimproved rental space on the first floor and two apartments on the second floor. On September 16, 1994, the Brockton Fire Department extinguished a fire in the vacant first floor space before significant damage occurred. The Awons filed a claim with their insurance company for the damage from this fire and were paid in settlement $4,171 for the damage. In the early morning hours of January 18, 1995, another fire at the building resulted in the destruction not only of the Awon's building but of three adjacent buildings as well. The Awons again filed a claim with their insurance company and negotiated a settlement of $85,000 for the loss of the building and demolition expenses, and $6,176 for lost rental income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Investigation of the two fires resulted in an eight count indictment charging Awon and two co-defendants, James St. Louis and Joaquim Neves (\"Joaquim\") with arson and mail fraud. In Counts I through IV, Awon and James St. Louis were charged with arson, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i) (2000) (Count I), mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (Counts II and III), and use of a fire to commit a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h) (Count IV). Those four counts related to the September 16, 1994, fire and the subsequent filing of an insurance claim. Awon, James St. Louis and Joaquim were charged in Counts V through VIII with four corresponding offenses, arson (Count V), mail fraud (Counts VI and VII) and use of fire to commit a felony (Count VIII). The latter four counts pertained to the January 18, 1995, fire and the filing of the second insurance claim. Prior to trial, Joaquim pleaded guilty to Counts V, VI, and VII (Count VIII was dismissed) and, pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government, testified at trial as a witness against his two co-defendants, Awon and James St. Louis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joaquim, testifying pursuant to a plea agreement, stated at trial that, in the summer of 1994, Anse St. Louis had asked him, purportedly on Awon's behalf, if he would burn the Ames Street property. Although initially hesitant, he agreed to commit the arson and solicited the help of James St. Louis. Joaquim further testified that he had several conversations directly with Awon about the arson and the promised pay-off. According to Joaquim's testimony, Awon agreed to pay him $5,000 for committing the arson. Just prior to the first fire, however, Joaquim was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") which had begun deportation proceedings against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jorge Neves (\"Jorge\"), Joaquim's brother, testified at trial that while Joaquim was in INS custody, James St. Louis sought Jorge's help to burn the Ames Street property. Jorge said that James St. Louis promised that they would be paid by Awon for the arson. Jorge testified, however, that he never spoke directly to Awon regarding the fire or payment. Jorge further testified that, on September 16, 1994, he and James St. Louis spread gasoline around the first floor of the building, ignited it, and fled in James St. Louis' car. The fire was quickly extinguished. Because \"nothing happened,\" Jorge testified that he was never paid for the arson. As the result of his cooperation and testimony, Jorge was not prosecuted for his involvement in setting the September 16, 1994, fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joaquim testified that, after his own release from INS custody in November, 1994, he was again approached by Anse St. Louis, on behalf of Awon, with the request that he burn the Ames Street property. Joaquim said he agreed and that he again solicited James St. Louis to help him. According to Joaquim, Joaquim was to receive a cash payment for his involvement while James St. Louis had directly negotiated with Awon for the receipt of a used Ford Taurus from Awon's car dealership. On January 18, 1995, Joaquim and James St. Louis drove to the Ames Street property in the car of Joaquim's girlfriend, Sandy Casamiro, and set the building on fire. The two men returned to Joaquim's house, placed their soiled clothes in a bag, awakened Casamiro, and had her drive them to a nearby dumpster to discard their clothing. Casamiro corroborated Joaquim's testimony about the late night excursion to discard the clothing worn at the time of the arson. The next day, according to the records of Awon's used car dealership, Awon transferred a Ford Taurus to James St. Louis for $2,000. Joaquim testified that, a week later, he received $2,100 in cash from Awon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testifying on behalf of Awon, Anse St. Louis said that he never spoke with Awon or Joaquim about the burning of the Ames Street property. Awon's parents testified that they were the owners and actual parties in interest with respect to the building and that Awon's involvement was limited to responding to maintenance requests and showing the building to prospective tenants. In essence, it was their testimony that Awon had no financial stake in the property. Awon testified that he believed that Joaquim had set the fire in retaliation for Awon's refusal to post bail for Joaquim when he was in INS custody and in reaction to an argument between the two men prior to the second fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found Awon guilty of all counts. James St. Louis was acquitted of the first four counts, those related to the September 16, 1994, fire, and found guilty of the remaining four counts. Awon was sentenced to a 153-month term of imprisonment, which represented a downward departure from the applicable guideline sentencing range of 198 to 217 months. Awon was also ordered to pay restitution to the Scottsdale Insurance Company in the amount of $95,788.36. This court affirmed his conviction on February 2, 1998. <i>United States v. Awon,</i> 135 F.3d 96 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Post-conviction Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 1, 1999, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, Awon filed a Motion to Set Aside, Vacate, or Correct Sentence and, in an essentially duplicative pleading, he filed a motion for a new trial. In the two motions, Awon pursued identical claims: (1) that newly-discovered evidence warranted a new trial; and (2) that with respect to Count V of the indictment the government's evidence at trial was insufficient to satisfy the federal jurisdictional element of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 841(i) (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The newly-discovered evidence was set out in five affidavits. In their affidavits, Jorge Neves and Joaquim Neves recanted their trial testimony implicating Awon in the fires. Joaquim averred that he had falsified his testimony in the hopes of gaining favor with law enforcement officials and avoiding deportation. Jorge disavowed any statement he made on the stand implicating Awon and stated he had fingered Awon to avoid prosecution. James St. Louis, who did not testify at trial, averred that he was solely responsible for the planning of the second fire and that Awon played no part in the arson. Roberto Neves, the brother of Jorge and Joaquim Neves, stated that he and his family were threatened by the police that if Joaquim did not implicate Awon, their sister's children would be taken away and Roberto would be jailed. Roberto also reported that Joaquim had confessed to Roberto that he, Joaquim, had lied about Awon's involvement to \"save himself\" and receive a lower sentence. Roberto did not testify at trial. Finally, Awon submitted his own affidavit denying any involvement in the planning or execution of the fire and averring that James St. Louis had confessed to him that he and Joaquim had set the January 18, 1995, fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held an evidentiary hearing on Awon's two motions. Through counsel, Joaquim notified the court that he withdrew his affidavit and recanted the statements he had made therein. Thereafter, at the hearing, the government called Joaquim to testify. During his testimony at the evidentiary hearing, Joaquim described a four and one-half hour meeting with Awon's attorney that only ended when Joaquim agreed to sign the hand-written affidavit compiled by Awon's attorney. Joaquim stated that Awon's attorney informed him that he would not submit the affidavit to the court until Joaquim had signed and returned a typed copy of the affidavit. When Joaquim received the typed copy he discarded it and assumed the matter was closed. He reported being \"surprised\" when he discovered that Awon's attorney had filed the handwritten copy. Awon himself did not testify at the hearing on his two motions nor did James St. Louis or Jorge testify concerning the facts they had averred in their affidavits. Roberto, having been deported, was unavailable to testify. Although Awon's attorney was available to testify,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> he did not take the stand to counter Joaquim's description of the events leading to the submission of Joaquim's affidavit. Awon presented no other testimony or documentary evidence to support his motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government submitted an affidavit of Emanuel Gomes, the investigating officer from the Brockton Police Department. Gomes averred that he had neither threatened the Neves family nor had he made promises regarding Joaquim's or Jorge's cooperation in the investigation. In addition, the government submitted two reports compiled by Special Agent Thomas Wlodyka (\"Wlodyka\") of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Wlodyka had interviewed both Joaquim and Jorge following the submission of their affidavits in support of Awon's post-conviction motions. Wlodyka reported that the brothers recanted their affidavits. Jorge stated that Awon's attorney presented him with an affidavit to sign; that Awon's attorney told Jorge that the statement was \"basically what you said at the trial;\" and that he did not review it prior to signing it. Joaquim's statement to Wlodyka was consistent with his testimony at the evidentiary hearing. Both men informed Wlodyka their trial testimony was truthful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the evidentiary hearing, the district court denied both motions. The court did not consider Roberto Neves's affidavit to be \"newly discovered.\" According to the district court, the fact that defense counsel failed to interview Roberto Neves prior to trial did not support a finding that his testimony was unknown or unavailable. Further, it found that Jorge's affidavit did not support a new trial because the portion of his trial testimony recanted in the affidavit was not critical to the prosecution's case. Thus, even if it were omitted it was unlikely to result in a different outcome for Awon. As to James St. Louis' affidavit, which was viewed with \"great skepticism,\" the court found it incredible on its face. The district court acknowledged that Joaquim's affidavit was the most supportive of a new trial. At trial, Joaquim had provided the most damning testimony against Awon. In the end, however, it found Joaquim's testimony at trial, and his testimony at the evidentiary hearing recanting his affidavit, credible. Finally, without discussion, the district court stated that it considered Awon's argument that the government's evidence was insufficient to meet the jurisdictional element of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 841(i) \"unpersuasive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order denying the two motions was filed on July 10, 2000. Awon filed a notice of appeal on August 11, 2000. This court held the appeal in abeyance pending the issuance of a certificate of appealability for an appeal of the denial of a motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 as required by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(2). On January 3, 2001, the district court ordered a certificate of appealability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion for a New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awon failed to file a timely appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial. Consequently, that appeal must be dismissed. <i>United States v. Rapoport,</i> 159 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1998) (stating that compliance with time limits set forth in Fed.R.App.P. 4(b) is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new trial motion, brought pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, was denied on July 10, 2000, the day the district court also denied Awon's motion to vacate sentence, brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. Although Awon cited the same grounds for both motions, they are subject to different time limitations for the filing of a notice of appeal. Unless the district court grants an extension of time, which it did not do here, a party must appeal within ten days from the denial of a motion for a new trial made pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(1)(A); <i>United States v. Serrano,</i> 870 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir.1989). Awon filed his notice of appeal well out of time, on August 11, 2000, thirty days after the court's order denying the new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Motion to Vacate Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only appeal properly before us is from the denial of Awon's motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. The issues, as identified in the certificate of appealability, are whether to vacate Awon's sentence because of the alleged newly discovered evidence in the five affidavits and whether the district court lacked jurisdiction under the federal arson statute. <i>Bui v. DiPaolo,</i> 170 F.3d 232, 236 (1st Cir.1999), <i>cert. denied,</i> 529 U.S. 1086, 120 S.Ct. 1717, 146 L.Ed.2d 640 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On an appeal from the denial of a &#167; 2255 motion, we review the district court's legal determinations <i>de novo</i> and the court's factual findings for clear error. <i>Familia-Consoro v. United States,</i> 160 F.3d 761, 764-65 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Newly Discovered Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awon contends that the purported newly discovered evidence establishes his actual innocence. Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Awon's claims of actual innocence based on the evidence in question can establish some legally cognizable basis for a motion under section 2255, the evidence proffered by Awon falls far short of demonstrating his innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We quickly eliminate Awon's and Roberto's affidavits because they do not meet the standard for \"newly discovered evidence.\" <i>United States v. Desir,</i> 273 F.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir.2001). This court has held that a defendant seeking a new trial based on newly discovered evidence must prove four elements: (1) the newly discovered evidence was unknown or unavailable at the time of trial; (2) the defendant was duly diligent in trying to discover it; (3) the evidence was material; and (4) the evidence was such that it would probably result in an acquittal upon retrial. <i>Id.</i> Awon failed to prove that the information was either unknown or unavailable at the time of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"new\" information in Awon's affidavit, James St. Louis's confession to Awon that he was solely responsible for the second fire, was plainly available at the time of trial. <i>United States v. Levy-Cordero,</i> 156 F.3d 244, 248 (1st Cir.1998). In the affidavit itself Awon asserts that on the day after that fire James St. Louis had confessed committing the arson to him. Why Awon did not reveal the confession at trial but instead suggested that Joaquim had set the second fire is best known to him. In any event, the concealed confession of his co-defendant cannot be deemed \"newly discovered.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberto's testimony was also available at the time of trial. Awon argues that he had no reason to suspect that Roberto had information germane to his defense and thus cannot be penalized for failing to unearth and present Roberto's testimony. A defendant, however, must have been duly diligent in attempting to procure exculpatory evidence prior to trial. <i>United States v. Conley,</i> 249 F.3d 38, 44 (1st Cir.2001). Simply because it may not have occurred to Awon and his counsel that Roberto had information regarding the crime that does not mean they were duly diligent on the facts of this case. Roberto was known to Awon as the brother of Joaquim and Jorge, the government's primary witnesses, both of whom were implicated in the crime. Roberto and his sister, Helena Neves, were interviewed by the police during the investigation. Indeed, it was Helena Neves, who was dating James St. Louis, who contacted the police and informed them that St. Louis and Jorge were involved in the arson. Moreover, the credibility of Roberto's affidavit was severely undermined, insofar as it related to conversations with Joaquim, by Joaquim's later repudiation of his own affidavit and testimony at the evidentiary hearing. Similarly, Roberto's averments that he and his family were threatened by the police were neutralized by the affidavits of Detective Thomas Enos and Special Agent Thomas Wlodyka. Enos and Wlodyka, the officers primarily responsible for investigating the arson, denied that they had threatened Roberto, or his family, with adverse consequences if they did not implicate Awon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, James St. Louis's averments in his affidavit may indeed be deemed \"newly discovered.\" <i>United States v. Montilla-Rivera,</i> 115 F.3d 1060, 1066 (1st Cir.1997) (concluding that, in the context of a Rule 33 motion, a co-defendant's post-trial willingness to testify may be \"newly discovered\" if he had invoked 5th Amendment privilege at trial). But like the district court, we view James St. Louis's affidavit as lacking in credibility for reasons apparent on its face and from the record. <i>Id.</i> The trial court described James St. Louis's affidavit as incredible on its face. St. Louis averred that he had conceived, planned, and committed the arson on his own based upon his unverified hope that Awon, who had complained about the Ames Street property, would \"take care of\" him in the future. He further stated that, although unemployed at the time and notoriously short on cash, he had paid Awon $2,000 for the car <i>and</i> paid Joaquim $2,100 for his part in the arson. By the time of his affidavit St. Louis had nothing to lose by exonerating Awon. He had already been convicted and sentenced. He was in a position to say whatever he thought might help Awon, \"even to the point of pinning all the guilt on [himself], knowing [he was] safe\" from any increased punishment for the transaction. <i>United States v. Montilla-Rivera,</i> 171 F.3d 37, 41 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>United States v. Reyes-Alvarado,</i> 963 F.2d 1184, 1188 (9th Cir.1992)). We accept the court's finding that St. Louis's affidavit was not credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the affidavits of Jorge and Joaquim Neves were discredited by Joaquim's additional testimony at the evidentiary hearing repudiating his own affidavit as well as other considerations. A repudiated recantation is not substantive evidence, and can be used at a new trial only to cross-examine the witness. <i>United States v. Glantz,</i> 884 F.2d 1483, 1486 (1st Cir.1989). The affidavits alone cannot serve to establish Awon's innocence nor, given that they were later repudiated, are they a credible basis for expecting Jorge and Joaquim to testify differently at a new trial than previously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court supportably found that Joaquim's testimony at the trial, and at the evidentiary hearing recanting his affidavit, was credible. As noted, we review the district court's factual determinations for clear error. Our deference is even greater where, as here, the factual findings are based on credibility determinations. <i>United States v. Rostoff,</i> 164 F.3d 63, 71 (1st Cir.1999). In such cases, \"error is seldom considered `clear' unless the credibility assessments were based on testimony which was inherently implausible, internally inconsistent, or critically impeached.\" <i>Keller v. United States,</i> 38 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir.1994). Joaquim's description of the events leading up to the submission of his affidavit was plausible and unrefuted. We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respecting Jorge, the district court found that Jorge's recantation of his trial testimony, even if believed, would not result in Awon's acquittal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Jorge had testified at trial that James St. Louis had told him that Awon would pay them in cash if they burned down the Ames Street property. Jorge never spoke to Awon directly and because the first fire was unsuccessful Jorge never received payment. The district court concluded that Jorge's second hand account of Awon's involvement had a negligible impact on the outcome. The district court's conclusion is supported by the record. Jorge's testimony focused almost exclusively on James St. Louis's involvement in the first fire. His testimony implicated Awon only tangentially. Moreover, given that James St. Louis was acquitted of the charges related to the first fire, it is unclear if Jorge's testimony had any impact on the trial's outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awon's claim that his sentence should be vacated and the case remanded to the district court for a new trial is meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awon also argues that the district court erred when it refused to vacate his conviction for the second fire (Count V). According to Awon the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence to establish that the building was \"used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce\" as required by the statute. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i). As a result, Awon contends, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and his conviction as to Count V should be vacated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we can reach the merits of Awon's argument, we must first address the government's contention that Awon procedurally defaulted his claim by failing to raise it on direct appeal. Awon concedes that he did not appeal concerning the court's jurisdiction but claims that subject matter jurisdiction can be noticed at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Awon's assertion, this case does not involve subject matter jurisdiction and therefore had to be raised on direct appeal. The district court had subject matter jurisdiction in this case by virtue of the fact that Awon was charged with an offense against the United States. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The interstate commerce aspect of this case arises as an element of the section 844(i) offense. The statute requires the government to prove, <i>inter alia,</i> that the property involved in the arson was \"used in interstate or foreign commerce or in an activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.\" If that element is not satisfied then Awon is not guilty; but the court is not by the failure of proof on that element deprived of judicial jurisdiction. <i>See United States v. DiSanto,</i> 86 F.3d 1238, 1246 (1st Cir.1996) (upholding section 844(i) as constitutional after <i>Lopez</i>); <i>accord United States v. Tush,</i> 287 F.3d 1294, 1296 (10th Cir.2002), <i>petition for cert. filed</i> (Aug. 12, 2002) (No. 02-5940) (\"The interstate commerce element of &#167; 844(i) `is not jurisdictional in the sense that it affects a court's subject matter jurisdiction, i.e., a court's constitutional or statutory power to adjudicate a case.'\"); <i>United States v. Carr,</i> 271 F.3d 172, 178 (4th Cir.2001) (same); <i>United States v. Beck,</i> 250 F.3d 1163, 1165 (8th Cir.2001) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awon, on appeal, attempts to argue that his procedural default should be excused because he is \"actually innocent\" because the evidence was insufficient to show that the interstate commerce element had been met under <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We reject Awon's actual innocence argument, which suffers from a number of problems. First, his petition under &#167; 2255 makes no claim at all of actual innocence; the government, with justification, says the claim is forfeit. Even if it had not been forfeit, it is doomed. The assertion of actual innocence to excuse a procedural default does not permit a reviewing court to simply dive into defaulted questions of the sufficiency of evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The actual innocence exception is quite narrow and seldom used. <i>Simpson v. Matesanz,</i> 175 F.3d 200, 210 (1st Cir.1999). It is reserved for the extraordinary cases of \"fundamentally unjust incarceration.\" <i>Schlup v. Delo,</i> 513 U.S. 298, 320-21, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we hypothesized that this question was correctly characterized as one of factual innocence and not legal insufficiency, <i>see Sawyer v. Whitley,</i> 505 U.S. 333, 339, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992), this had none of the hallmarks of the usual actual innocence claim. There is no credible argument that the so-called new evidence affects the interstate commerce nexus, so this is not a situation of an actual innocence claim predicated on new evidence. <i>Schlup,</i> 513 U.S. at 324, 115 S.Ct. 851. Nor is this a death case in which there is a constitutional violation which has probably resulted in the imposition of a death sentence of one who is actually innocent. <i>Dugger v. Adams,</i> 489 U.S. 401, 411 n. 6, 109 S.Ct. 1211, 103 L.Ed.2d 435 (1989). And even if we were to consider the claim of insufficiency, it is frivolous under <i>Russell v. United States,</i> 471 U.S. 858, 105 S.Ct. 2455, 85 L.Ed.2d 829 (1985) and <i>United States v. Medeiros,</i> 897 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons state above, the decision of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 841(i) makes arson of a building \"used in interstate or foreign commerce or in an activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce\" a federal offense</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Anticipating that he might testify, Awon's attorney had obtained separate counsel to represent Awon at the evidentiary hearing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> It is unclear from the record whether the district court considered these unsworn reports in rendering its decision. Although the district court never explicitly ruled on the matter, the government acknowledges that the court was initially hesitant to do so</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court did not refer to the two unsworn reports of Agent Wlodyka which had been submitted with the government's opposition to Awon's motions in which Wlodyka stated that Jorge had recanted his affidavit filed with Awon's motion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note at the start that, even if Awon's assertion were meritorious, vacating his conviction on Count V would not affect his sentence. Awon received a total term of imprisonment of 153 months. For his conviction under Count V, the district court imposed a 33 month term of imprisonment to be served concurrently with the 33 month sentence he received for his conviction under Count I. Thus, vacating his conviction and sentence pursuant to Count V would not lower his current sentence. In addition, his conviction for mail fraud pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (Counts VI, and VII) and his conviction for use of fire to commit a felony pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h)(1) and (2) (Count VIII) were not dependent upon his conviction of arson pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i). As a result, if his conviction under Count V is vacated, his conviction under the remaining counts and his subsequent sentence is unaffected. Thus, regardless of the outcome of our analysis, Awon's 153 month sentence will remain intact</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231 provides:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The district court of the United States shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United States.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We note that Awon had ample opportunity to address the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the building's connection with interstate commerce. In fact, prior to trial, Awon filed a motion to dismiss the arson counts arguing that the Ames Street property did not have a sufficient connection with interstate commerce as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i). In his pretrial motion he initiated a peremptory strike at the government's evidence. The district court denied the motion. The question of whether the property was used in interstate commerce was presented to the jury as an element of the offense. The district court instructed the jury that the government had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the property \"was used in or affected interstate or foreign commerce\" and defined those terms commensurate with the applicable case law. Awon did not appeal from the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss, neither did he object to nor appeal from the jury instructions nor appeal from his conviction under Count V. He only raised the issue again on February 1, 1999, when he filed his motion for a new trial and his motion pursuant to &#167; 2255. In its decision denying these motions, the district court stated, without discussion, that Awon's argument concerning the jurisdiction of the court was \"unconvincing.\"<i>Awon v.

Following conviction, Awon moved for a new trial and to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 (2000), citing newly discovered evidence and a lack of federal jurisdiction. The newly discovered evidence contained in five, allegedly exculpatory affidavits. The district court, after holding an evidentiary hearing, denied both motions and, upon Awon's request, issued a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awon and his father owned rental income property located at 106-108 Ames Street (the \"Ames Street property\") in Brockton, Massachusetts, that consisted of unimproved rental space on the first floor and two apartments on the second floor. On September 16, 1994, the Brockton Fire Department extinguished a fire in the vacant first floor space before significant damage occurred. The Awons filed a claim with their insurance company for the damage from this fire and were paid in settlement $4,171 for the damage. In the early morning hours of January 18, 1995, another fire at the building resulted in the destruction not only of the Awon's building but of three adjacent buildings as well. The Awons again filed a claim with their insurance company and negotiated a settlement of $85,000 for the loss of the building and demolition expenses, and $6,176 for lost rental income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Investigation of the two fires resulted in an eight count indictment charging Awon and two co-defendants, James St. Louis and Joaquim Neves (\"Joaquim\") with arson and mail fraud. In Counts I through IV, Awon and James St. Louis were charged with arson, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i) (2000) (Count I), mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (Counts II and III), and use of a fire to commit a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h) (Count IV). Those four counts related to the September 16, 1994, fire and the subsequent filing of an insurance claim. Awon, James St. Louis and Joaquim were charged in Counts V through VIII with four corresponding offenses, arson (Count V), mail fraud (Counts VI and VII) and use of fire to commit a felony (Count VIII). The latter four counts pertained to the January 18, 1995, fire and the filing of the second insurance claim. Prior to trial, Joaquim pleaded guilty to Counts V, VI, and VII (Count VIII was dismissed) and, pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government, testified at trial as a witness against his two co-defendants, Awon and James St. Louis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joaquim, testifying pursuant to a plea agreement, stated at trial that, in the summer of 1994, Anse St. Louis had asked him, purportedly on Awon's behalf, if he would burn the Ames Street property. Although initially hesitant, he agreed to commit the arson and solicited the help of James St. Louis. Joaquim further testified that he had several conversations directly with Awon about the arson and the promised pay-off. According to Joaquim's testimony, Awon agreed to pay him $5,000 for committing the arson. Just prior to the first fire, however, Joaquim was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") which had begun deportation proceedings against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jorge Neves (\"Jorge\"), Joaquim's brother, testified at trial that while Joaquim was in INS custody, James St. Louis sought Jorge's help to burn the Ames Street property. Jorge said that James St. Louis promised that they would be paid by Awon for the arson. Jorge testified, however, that he never spoke directly to Awon regarding the fire or payment. Jorge further testified that, on September 16, 1994, he and James St. Louis spread gasoline around the first floor of the building, ignited it, and fled in James St. Louis' car. The fire was quickly extinguished. Because \"nothing happened,\" Jorge testified that he was never paid for the arson. As the result of his cooperation and testimony, Jorge was not prosecuted for his involvement in setting the September 16, 1994, fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joaquim testified that, after his own release from INS custody in November, 1994, he was again approached by Anse St. Louis, on behalf of Awon, with the request that he burn the Ames Street property. Joaquim said he agreed and that he again solicited James St. Louis to help him. According to Joaquim, Joaquim was to receive a cash payment for his involvement while James St. Louis had directly negotiated with Awon for the receipt of a used Ford Taurus from Awon's car dealership. On January 18, 1995, Joaquim and James St. Louis drove to the Ames Street property in the car of Joaquim's girlfriend, Sandy Casamiro, and set the building on fire. The two men returned to Joaquim's house, placed their soiled clothes in a bag, awakened Casamiro, and had her drive them to a nearby dumpster to discard their clothing. Casamiro corroborated Joaquim's testimony about the late night excursion to discard the clothing worn at the time of the arson. The next day, according to the records of Awon's used car dealership, Awon transferred a Ford Taurus to James St. Louis for $2,000. Joaquim testified that, a week later, he received $2,100 in cash from Awon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testifying on behalf of Awon, Anse St. Louis said that he never spoke with Awon or Joaquim about the burning of the Ames Street property. Awon's parents testified that they were the owners and actual parties in interest with respect to the building and that Awon's involvement was limited to responding to maintenance requests and showing the building to prospective tenants. In essence, it was their testimony that Awon had no financial stake in the property. Awon testified that he believed that Joaquim had set the fire in retaliation for Awon's refusal to post bail for Joaquim when he was in INS custody and in reaction to an argument between the two men prior to the second fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found Awon guilty of all counts. James St. Louis was acquitted of the first four counts, those related to the September 16, 1994, fire, and found guilty of the remaining four counts. Awon was sentenced to a 153-month term of imprisonment, which represented a downward departure from the applicable guideline sentencing range of 198 to 217 months. Awon was also ordered to pay restitution to the Scottsdale Insurance Company in the amount of $95,788.36. This court affirmed his conviction on February 2, 1998. <i>United States v. Awon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751217\"><a href=\"/opinion/751217/united-states-v-fred-awon/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Post-conviction Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 1, 1999, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, Awon filed a Motion to Set Aside, Vacate, or Correct Sentence and, in an essentially duplicative pleading, he filed a motion for a new trial. In the two motions, Awon pursued identical claims: (1) that newly-discovered evidence warranted a new trial; and (2) that with respect to Count V of the indictment the government's evidence at trial was insufficient to satisfy the federal jurisdictional element of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 841(i) (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The newly-discovered evidence was set out in five affidavits. In their affidavits, Jorge Neves and Joaquim Neves recanted their trial testimony implicating Awon in the fires. Joaquim averred that he had falsified his testimony in the hopes of gaining favor with law enforcement officials and avoiding deportation. Jorge disavowed any statement he made on the stand implicating Awon and stated he had fingered Awon to avoid prosecution. James St. Louis, who did not testify at trial, averred that he was solely responsible for the planning of the second fire and that Awon played no part in the arson. Roberto Neves, the brother of Jorge and Joaquim Neves, stated that he and his family were threatened by the police that if Joaquim did not implicate Awon, their sister's children would be taken away and Roberto would be jailed. Roberto also reported that Joaquim had confessed to Roberto that he, Joaquim, had lied about Awon's involvement to \"save himself\" and receive a lower sentence. Roberto did not testify at trial. Finally, Awon submitted his own affidavit denying any involvement in the planning or execution of the fire and averring that James St. Louis had confessed to him that he and Joaquim had set the January 18, 1995, fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held an evidentiary hearing on Awon's two motions. Through counsel, Joaquim notified the court that he withdrew his affidavit and recanted the statements he had made therein. Thereafter, at the hearing, the government called Joaquim to testify. During his testimony at the evidentiary hearing, Joaquim described a four and one-half hour meeting with Awon's attorney that only ended when Joaquim agreed to sign the hand-written affidavit compiled by Awon's attorney. Joaquim stated that Awon's attorney informed him that he would not submit the affidavit to the court until Joaquim had signed and returned a typed copy of the affidavit. When Joaquim received the typed copy he discarded it and assumed the matter was closed. He reported being \"surprised\" when he discovered that Awon's attorney had filed the handwritten copy. Awon himself did not testify at the hearing on his two motions nor did James St. Louis or Jorge testify concerning the facts they had averred in their affidavits. Roberto, having been deported, was unavailable to testify. Although Awon's attorney was available to testify,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> he did not take the stand to counter Joaquim's description of the events leading to the submission of Joaquim's affidavit. Awon presented no other testimony or documentary evidence to support his motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government submitted an affidavit of Emanuel Gomes, the investigating officer from the Brockton Police Department. Gomes averred that he had neither threatened the Neves family nor had he made promises regarding Joaquim's or Jorge's cooperation in the investigation. In addition, the government submitted two reports compiled by Special Agent Thomas Wlodyka (\"Wlodyka\") of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Wlodyka had interviewed both Joaquim and Jorge following the submission of their affidavits in support of Awon's post-conviction motions. Wlodyka reported that the brothers recanted their affidavits. Jorge stated that Awon's attorney presented him with an affidavit to sign; that Awon's attorney told Jorge that the statement was \"basically what you said at the trial;\" and that he did not review it prior to signing it. Joaquim's statement to Wlodyka was consistent with his testimony at the evidentiary hearing. Both men informed Wlodyka their trial testimony was truthful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the evidentiary hearing, the district court denied both motions. The court did not consider Roberto Neves's affidavit to be \"newly discovered.\" According to the district court, the fact that defense counsel failed to interview Roberto Neves prior to trial did not support a finding that his testimony was unknown or unavailable. Further, it found that Jorge's affidavit did not support a new trial because the portion of his trial testimony recanted in the affidavit was not critical to the prosecution's case. Thus, even if it were omitted it was unlikely to result in a different outcome for Awon. As to James St. Louis' affidavit, which was viewed with \"great skepticism,\" the court found it incredible on its face. The district court acknowledged that Joaquim's affidavit was the most supportive of a new trial. At trial, Joaquim had provided the most damning testimony against Awon. In the end, however, it found Joaquim's testimony at trial, and his testimony at the evidentiary hearing recanting his affidavit, credible. Finally, without discussion, the district court stated that it considered Awon's argument that the government's evidence was insufficient to meet the jurisdictional element of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 841(i) \"unpersuasive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order denying the two motions was filed on July 10, 2000. Awon filed a notice of appeal on August 11, 2000. This court held the appeal in abeyance pending the issuance of a certificate of appealability for an appeal of the denial of a motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 as required by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(2). On January 3, 2001, the district court ordered a certificate of appealability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion for a New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awon failed to file a timely appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial. Consequently, that appeal must be dismissed. <i>United States v.

Although Awon cited the same grounds for both motions, they are subject to different time limitations for the filing of a notice of appeal. Unless the district court grants an extension of time, which it did not do here, a party must appeal within ten days from the denial of a motion for a new trial made pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

Newly Discovered Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awon contends that the purported newly discovered evidence establishes his actual innocence. Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Awon's claims of actual innocence based on the evidence in question can establish some legally cognizable basis for a motion under section 2255, the evidence proffered by Awon falls far short of demonstrating his innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We quickly eliminate Awon's and Roberto's affidavits because they do not meet the standard for \"newly discovered evidence.\" <i>United States v. Desir,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199719\"><a href=\"/opinion/199719/united-states-v-desir/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.2001). This court has held that a defendant seeking a new trial based on newly discovered evidence must prove four elements: (1) the newly discovered evidence was unknown or unavailable at the time of trial; (2) the defendant was duly diligent in trying to discover it; (3) the evidence was material; and (4) the evidence was such that it would probably result in an acquittal upon retrial. <i>Id.</i> Awon failed to prove that the information was either unknown or unavailable at the time of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"new\" information in Awon's affidavit, James St. Louis's confession to Awon that he was solely responsible for the second fire, was plainly available at the time of trial. <i>United States v. Levy-Cordero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758015\"><a href=\"/opinion/758015/united-states-v-victor-levy-cordero/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 248 (1st Cir.1998). In the affidavit itself Awon asserts that on the day after that fire James St. Louis had confessed committing the arson to him. Why Awon did not reveal the confession at trial but instead suggested that Joaquim had set the second fire is best known to him. In any event, the concealed confession of his co-defendant cannot be deemed \"newly discovered.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roberto's testimony was also available at the time of trial. Awon argues that he had no reason to suspect that Roberto had information germane to his defense and thus cannot be penalized for failing to unearth and present Roberto's testimony. A defendant, however, must have been duly diligent in attempting to procure exculpatory evidence prior to trial. <i>United States v. Conley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199406\"><a href=\"/opinion/199406/united-states-v-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2001). Simply because it may not have occurred to Awon and his counsel that Roberto had information regarding the crime that does not mean they were duly diligent on the facts of this case. Roberto was known to Awon as the brother of Joaquim and Jorge, the government's primary witnesses, both of whom were implicated in the crime. Roberto and his sister, Helena Neves, were interviewed by the police during the investigation. Indeed, it was Helena Neves, who was dating James St. Louis, who contacted the police and informed them that St. Louis and Jorge were involved in the arson. Moreover, the credibility of Roberto's affidavit was severely undermined, insofar as it related to conversations with Joaquim, by Joaquim's later repudiation of his own affidavit and testimony at the evidentiary hearing. Similarly, Roberto's averments that he and his family were threatened by the police were neutralized by the affidavits of Detective Thomas Enos and Special Agent Thomas Wlodyka. Enos and Wlodyka, the officers primarily responsible for investigating the arson, denied that they had threatened Roberto, or his family, with adverse consequences if they did not implicate Awon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, James St. Louis's averments in his affidavit may indeed be deemed \"newly discovered.\" <i>United States v.

But like the district court, we view James St. Louis's affidavit as lacking in credibility for reasons apparent on its face and from the record. <i>Id.</i> The trial court described James St. Louis's affidavit as incredible on its face. St. Louis averred that he had conceived, planned, and committed the arson on his own based upon his unverified hope that Awon, who had complained about the Ames Street property, would \"take care of\" him in the future. He further stated that, although unemployed at the time and notoriously short on cash, he had paid Awon $2,000 for the car <i>and</i> paid Joaquim $2,100 for his part in the arson. By the time of his affidavit St. Louis had nothing to lose by exonerating Awon. He had already been convicted and sentenced. He was in a position to say whatever he thought might help Awon, \"even to the point of pinning all the guilt on [himself], knowing [he was] safe\" from any increased punishment for the transaction. <i>United States v.

The affidavits alone cannot serve to establish Awon's innocence nor, given that they were later repudiated, are they a credible basis for expecting Jorge and Joaquim to testify differently at a new trial than previously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court supportably found that Joaquim's testimony at the trial, and at the evidentiary hearing recanting his affidavit, was credible. As noted, we review the district court's factual determinations for clear error. Our deference is even greater where, as here, the factual findings are based on credibility determinations. <i>United States v. Rostoff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198276\"><a href=\"/opinion/198276/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 71 (1st Cir.1999).

Joaquim's description of the events leading up to the submission of his affidavit was plausible and unrefuted. We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respecting Jorge, the district court found that Jorge's recantation of his trial testimony, even if believed, would not result in Awon's acquittal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Jorge had testified at trial that James St. Louis had told him that Awon would pay them in cash if they burned down the Ames Street property. Jorge never spoke to Awon directly and because the first fire was unsuccessful Jorge never received payment. The district court concluded that Jorge's second hand account of Awon's involvement had a negligible impact on the outcome. The district court's conclusion is supported by the record. Jorge's testimony focused almost exclusively on James St. Louis's involvement in the first fire. His testimony implicated Awon only tangentially. Moreover, given that James St. Louis was acquitted of the charges related to the first fire, it is unclear if Jorge's testimony had any impact on the trial's outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awon's claim that his sentence should be vacated and the case remanded to the district court for a new trial is meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awon also argues that the district court erred when it refused to vacate his conviction for the second fire (Count V). According to Awon the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence to establish that the building was \"used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce\" as required by the statute. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i). As a result, Awon contends, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and his conviction as to Count V should be vacated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we can reach the merits of Awon's argument, we must first address the government's contention that Awon procedurally defaulted his claim by failing to raise it on direct appeal. Awon concedes that he did not appeal concerning the court's jurisdiction but claims that subject matter jurisdiction can be noticed at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Awon's assertion, this case does not involve subject matter jurisdiction and therefore had to be raised on direct appeal. The district court had subject matter jurisdiction in this case by virtue of the fact that Awon was charged with an offense against the United States. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The interstate commerce aspect of this case arises as an element of the section 844(i) offense. The statute requires the government to prove, <i>inter alia,</i> that the property involved in the arson was \"used in interstate or foreign commerce or in an activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.\" If that element is not satisfied then Awon is not guilty; but the court is not by the failure of proof on that element deprived of judicial jurisdiction. <i>See United States v.

Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons state above, the decision of the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 841(i) makes arson of a building \"used in interstate or foreign commerce or in an activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce\" a federal offense</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Anticipating that he might testify, Awon's attorney had obtained separate counsel to represent Awon at the evidentiary hearing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> It is unclear from the record whether the district court considered these unsworn reports in rendering its decision. Although the district court never explicitly ruled on the matter, the government acknowledges that the court was initially hesitant to do so</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court did not refer to the two unsworn reports of Agent Wlodyka which had been submitted with the government's opposition to Awon's motions in which Wlodyka stated that Jorge had recanted his affidavit filed with Awon's motion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note at the start that, even if Awon's assertion were meritorious, vacating his conviction on Count V would not affect his sentence. Awon received a total term of imprisonment of 153 months. For his conviction under Count V, the district court imposed a 33 month term of imprisonment to be served concurrently with the 33 month sentence he received for his conviction under Count I. Thus, vacating his conviction and sentence pursuant to Count V would not lower his current sentence. In addition, his conviction for mail fraud pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (Counts VI, and VII) and his conviction for use of fire to commit a felony pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h)(1) and (2) (Count VIII) were not dependent upon his conviction of arson pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i). As a result, if his conviction under Count V is vacated, his conviction under the remaining counts and his subsequent sentence is unaffected. Thus, regardless of the outcome of our analysis, Awon's 153 month sentence will remain intact</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231 provides:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The district court of the United States shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United States.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We note that Awon had ample opportunity to address the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the building's connection with interstate commerce. In fact, prior to trial, Awon filed a motion to dismiss the arson counts arguing that the Ames Street property did not have a sufficient connection with interstate commerce as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i). In his pretrial motion he initiated a peremptory strike at the government's evidence. The district court denied the motion. The question of whether the property was used in interstate commerce was presented to the jury as an element of the offense. The district court instructed the jury that the government had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the property \"was used in or affected interstate or foreign commerce\" and defined those terms commensurate with the applicable case law. Awon did not appeal from the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss, neither did he object to nor appeal from the jury instructions nor appeal from his conviction under Count V. He only raised the issue again on February 1, 1999, when he filed his motion for a new trial and his motion pursuant to &#167; 2255. In its decision denying these motions, the district court stated, without discussion, that Awon's argument concerning the jurisdiction of the court was \"unconvincing.\"<i>Awon v.
