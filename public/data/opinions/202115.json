Plaintiffs-appellants\n\nPhilip L. Tropeano, Peter Tropeano, and Carolyn Patten appeal from\n\nthe dismissal of their complaint and denial of their motion for\n\nsummary judgment against defendants-appellees Charlene Dorman,\n\nBianca Dorman, Lydia Dorman, Todd Dorman, T&N Realty Trust and\n\nCaptain Parker Arms Partnership, in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.\n\n                     I.    Background and Facts\n\n           The undisputed facts of the case are as follows. On\n\nJanuary 8, 1964, Alfred Tropeano, Louis Tropeano, Joseph Tropeano,\n\nPhilip Tropeano and Wilbur Nylander created the Captain Parker Arms\n\nPartnership (the \"Partnership\") by means of a two-page Agreement\n\n(the \"Partnership Agreement\").     The partners agreed therein to\n\n\"become and remain partners in the business of acquiring the title\n\n[to a specific piece of land in Lexington] . . . to construct\n\napartments on said land, for the term of thirty years from the date\n\nhereof.\"   A nominal trust, T&N Realty Trust (the \"Trust\"), was\n\ncreated to hold the real estate for the partners' benefit.     The\n\nPartnership Agreement provided that \"[a]ll applicable provisions\n\nand sections of [Massachusetts] General Laws Chapter 108A [enacting\n\nthe Uniform Partnership Act] are herein incorporated by reference\n\nand made a part hereof.\"\n\n           Sometime after the formation of the Partnership and the\n\nTrust, Joseph Tropeano died.       His death caused the remaining\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fpartners   to   execute   an   agreement      modifying   the   Partnership\n\nAgreement (the \"Modification\").             The Modification provided in\n\nrelevant part as follows:\n\n                                *   *   *\n\n     WHEREAS, Joseph C. Tropeano is now deceased.\n\n     NOW, THEREFORE, this Modification and affirmation of the\n     Partnership by the surviving partners Alfred P. Tropeano,\n     Wilbur C. Nylander, Louis Tropeano and Philip Tropeano\n     agree:\n\n     1. Co-Partners.    That the partnership agreement dated\n     January 8, 1964, was not dissolved or terminated by the\n     surviving partners when Joseph C. Tropeano died, has been\n     and is in full force with exception of Joseph's interest.\n\n     2. Rights of Deceased Former Partner. The 15% interest\n     of the late Joseph C. Tropeano is to be paid or\n     distributed as provided in his will allowed for probate.\n\n     3.   Death of an Existing Partner.     The death of an\n     existing partner shall not terminate the Partnership and\n     his interest will be held by the persons or entities set\n     forth on the deceased partner's schedule attached and\n     made a part hereof which bears his signature and they\n     shall have all the rights of the deceased partner. Said\n     person or entities shall be to those set forth in 5\n     hereunder.\n          Upon the death of a partner, the partners herein\n     agree and so instruct the Trustees to execute whatever\n     documents may be necessary to permit said representative\n     to borrow money to pay estate taxes.\n          If there is sufficient cash held by the Trustees,\n     the partners agree that the Trustees may loan monies to\n     the representative of the deceased partner who have or\n     will file Federal and State Estate Tax forms bearing\n     interest at the then prime interest rate of Shawmut\n     Boston plus 1%.   Said loan shall be paid back to the\n     Trust or deducted from the distributive share of said\n     deceased partner.\n\n     4. Termination. The partnership can be terminated by a\n     vote of not less than 60% interest of 100% and upon such\n     vote the partners shall so notify the Trustees to\n\n                                    -3-\n\fliquidate the assets and distribute the net principal and\naccumulated income as provided by number 8 hereunder.\n\n5.    Partner's Rights to Assign or Sell to Certain\nIndividuals. Any partner shall have the right to assign\nor to sell any portion of his interest to his wife or his\nchildren or grandchildren, without the consent of the\nother partners, who may take title in their own name or\na separate entity in which they will be the sole\nbeneficiary.\n\n6. Partner's Right to Assign or Sell to Others. Prior\nto any assignment or sale of any partner's interest or\nthose having his interest to those than the aforesaid,\nthe assigning or selling partner shall offer the same in\nwriting with a certified copy of the terms offered to him\nby the proposed assignee or purchaser.      The partners\nshall have thirty (30) business days to accept or reject\nthe offer.     If they do not accept the offer, the\nassignment or sale to the third party shall only be made\nwith the consent of the other partners and those claiming\nthrough them which consent will not be unreasonably\nwithheld.\n\n7. Voting Minors Interest. If any holder of an interest\nin the partnership is a minor, his interest during\nminority shall be voted by his father and if no father,\nby his mother and if no mother, by his legal guardian.\n\n8. Distribution on Termination. In the event of      the\ndissolution and termination of the partnership,      the\nTrustees shall be instructed to proceed to           the\nliquidation of the partnership and the proceeds of   the\nliquidation shall be applied and distributed in      the\nfollowing order of priority:\n\n            (a) Debts. To the payment of the debts and\nliabilities of the partnership . . . .\n            (b) Reserves.     To the setting up of any\nreserves which the partners may deem reasonably necessary\nfor any contingent or unforeseen liabilities or\nobligations of the partnership . . . .\n            (c) Partner loans. To the repayment of any\nloans or advances that may have been made by any of the\npartners to the partnership . . . .\n            (d) Balance. Any balance remaining shall be\ndistributed among all partners as follows according to\ntheir percentage holding . . . .\n\n                          -4-\n\f     Except as herein modified, the said partnership is hereby\n     affirmed, dated this 11th day of March, 1987.\n\n\nThe Modification thus specified three ways for the partners, while\n\nalive, either to terminate and liquidate the Partnership or else to\n\ntransfer individual interests to others.             Termination leading to\n\nliquidation could be accomplished by a 60% percent interest vote.\n\nA partner could, as of right, assign or sell any section of his\n\ninterest to specified family members but could not assign or sell\n\nto any others except with the consent of the other partners after\n\nfirst offering them refusal rights.          Several partners thereafter\n\ntransferred   their    interests    to    family    members,   as   permitted,\n\nincluding many of the current parties.              Since the Modification,\n\nthere have been no further revisions to the Partnership Agreement,\n\nand through the bringing of the present lawsuit in November 2003,\n\nthe Partnership has continued to operate even though the 30-year\n\nterm specified in the Partnership Agreement came to an end on\n\nJanuary 8, 1994.      As the district court found, \"Not only did the\n\nPartnership    continue   to     manage    its     rental   property   without\n\ninterruption after the 30-year term expired, but many of the\n\nplaintiffs    and   defendants     acceded   to     their   interest   in   the\n\nPartnership through assignments made after the expiration date\n\npursuant to ¶ 5 of the Modification.\"\n\n          On August 21, 2003, Philip, Peter and Carolyn Tropeano,\n\nholding collectively a 42.86% interest in the Partnership, served\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fwritten notice on the defendants that they intended to retire,\n\neffective October 1, 2003, according to the provisions of Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 108A, § 42.         The notice stated that \"[p]ursuant to\n\nthe provisions of M.G.L. Ch. 108A, Sec. 29, the change in our\n\nrelationship effected by our retirement from the partnership is to\n\nbe treated as dissolution of the partnership.                 Pursuant to the\n\nprovisions of Chapter 108A, Section 42, as retiring partners we\n\nwish to have the value of our interests ascertained as of the date\n\nof dissolution (that is, October 1, 2003).\" The notice stated that\n\nthe retiring partners understood that a complete termination of the\n\nPartnership required a 60% vote of the partners but that after the\n\nleaving partners retired, the remaining members could also continue\n\non as the sole partners.       The letter stated:\n\n      We recognize that in order to terminate the partnership,\n      a vote of 60% of the partners is required . . . . If you\n      wish to terminate the partnership, we would participate\n      in that vote in the affirmative.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought to be paid their respective interests of the\n\nvalue of the Partnership's assets.           They valued their collective\n\ninterest in the Partnership's assets (totaling $18.8 million) at an\n\nappraised value of $6,600,000.\n\n           The defendants responded that the plaintiffs were not\n\nentitled   to   withdraw    and    receive       from   the   Partnership    the\n\nliquidation value of their respective interests in the Partnership.\n\nThe   defendants,   however,      offered   to    purchase    the   plaintiffs'\n\nminority   interest   for   $2,750,000       under      paragraph   6   of   the\n\n                                     -6-\n\fModification. In a letter to plaintiffs' then-counsel from counsel\n\nfor defendant Charlene Dorman, the defendants explained their\n\noffer, saying:\n\n      on   your  client's management     watch,   the   partner\n      distributions to your clients have averaged $174,119 over\n      the last four years per Kennedy & Kennedy's financial\n      statements. If a yield of 6.4% on Mrs. Dorman's offer of\n      $2,750,000 was achieved (a very reasonable figure) your\n      clients would be in an identical pre-tax position having\n      converted their illiquid minority interest to cash.\n\nAfter efforts to compromise failed, plaintiffs brought this action\n\nin the district court in November of 2003.\n\n            In their initial complaint, the plaintiffs asserted a\n\nright to retire from the Partnership pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 108A, § 42 and to secure the partnership accounting outlined in\n\nthat provision.    Defendants moved to dismiss, and plaintiffs filed\n\nan opposition, to which defendants replied.            The defendants also\n\nsuccessfully moved to disqualify the plaintiffs' counsel, who had\n\npreviously represented the Partnership.\n\n            After obtaining new counsel, the plaintiffs filed an\n\namended complaint.        Besides the relief originally sought, the\n\namended complaint requested, inter alia, declaratory judgments that\n\n(1)   the   Partnership   was   a   partnership   at   will   and   therefore\n\nterminable by any partner, at any time, for any reason; (2) the\n\nplaintiffs had lawfully terminated the Partnership; and (3) the\n\nplaintiffs' termination of the Partnership required the winding up\n\nof the Partnership's business, the liquidation of the Partnership's\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fassets, and the distribution of the liquidation proceeds to the\n\npartners according to their respective partnership interests.\n\n          The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' amended\n\ncomplaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.         The\n\nplaintiffs filed a consolidated pleading opposing the motion to\n\ndismiss and cross-moving for summary judgment and for declaratory\n\njudgments on the three above-mentioned points on which they sought\n\ndeclarations. Defendants opposed the plaintiffs' cross-motion, and\n\nthe plaintiffs filed a reply brief.   The district court heard oral\n\nargument on December 2, 2004.\n\n          The plaintiffs argued to the district court that the\n\nexpress Partnership had terminated on January 8, 1994 when the 30-\n\nyear term of the Agreement had expired. Thereafter, they said, the\n\nPartnership became a partnership at will by operation of law under\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, § 23(1), which states:\n\n     When a partnership for a fixed term or particular\n     undertaking is continued after the termination of such\n     term or particular undertaking without any express\n     agreement, the rights and duties of the partners remain\n     the same as they were at such termination, so far as is\n     consistent with a partnership at will.\n\nUnder the plaintiffs' theory, any restrictions expressed in the\n\nModification to the Partnership Agreement could not affect their\n\nability to retire from, and in effect dissolve, the Partnership,\n\nsince once the partnership became one at will, any partner could\n\nterminate the partnership at any time for any reason.   See, e.g.,\n\nMeehan v. Shaughnessy, 404 Mass. 419, 428 (1989).       Plaintiffs\n\n                                -8-\n\fargued that when a partner in a partnership at will retires, his or\n\nher withdrawal triggers an accounting pursuant to the terms of the\n\nUniform Partnership Act (\"UPA\") as codified in Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n108A, § 42.\n\n           The    defendants        disagreed.           In    their   view,   the\n\nModification supplanted the 30-year term with an agreement to\n\ncontinue the Partnership, unless or until a 60% liquidation vote\n\nwas achieved.      The defendants asserted that the Modification\n\nsubstituted a new structure for that under the old Agreement:\n\nrather than being subject to a fixed term of thirty years, the\n\nproperty would be maintained indefinitely under the Agreement until\n\na   dissolution   occurred     by    a    60%    vote.        Alternatively,   the\n\ndefendants    argued   that   even       if    the   Partnership   had   become   a\n\npartnership at will, no accounting was called for under § 42 as the\n\naccounting provision did not come into effect if the parties had\n\notherwise agreed to a different course of action.                      Thus, § 42\n\nprovides that\n\n      [w]hen any partner retires or dies, and the business is\n      continued   .    .   .   without   any    settlement   of\n      accounts . . . unless otherwise agreed, he or his legal\n      representative as against such persons or partnership may\n      have the value of his interest at the date of dissolution\n      ascertained, and shall receive as an ordinary creditor an\n      amount equal to the value of his interest in the\n      dissolved partnership with interest . . . (emphasis\n      supplied).\n\nHere, defendants argued, the partners had, in the Modification,\n\nagreed otherwise by limiting a partner's withdrawal or retirement\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fto the three options described therein (i.e., termination by 60%\n\nvote; assignment to a family member; or third-party sale subject to\n\nthe partners' consent).      Any other interpretation, the defendants\n\nsaid, would render meaningless the restrictions agreed to in the\n\nModification, including the 60% termination requirement.\n\n           In response, plaintiffs insisted that defendants were\n\nwrong to assert that the partners' rights upon retirement, as\n\nconferred in § 42, were lessened or eliminated by something said in\n\nthe Modification.        They argued that there is no provision that\n\n\"otherwise agrees\" as to how a retiring partner's share is to be\n\nvalued.   No formula is set forth in the Modification for valuing a\n\nretiring partner's interest. Accordingly, the accounting described\n\nin § 42 must be utilized.\n\n           The district court ruled against defendants' contention\n\nthat the Modification had substituted for the 30-year term an\n\nagreement to continue the Partnership until terminated by a 60%\n\nvote.   It agreed with plaintiffs that nothing in the Modification\n\neliminated the original 30-year term, hence, after January 8, 1994,\n\nthe Partnership became one at will by operation of § 23(1) of Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 108A. Nonetheless, the court found for defendants on\n\nthe ultimate issue, finding the partners had \"otherwise agreed\" to\n\na method of valuation such as defendants proposed.                 Because the\n\nparties   had   agreed    upon   an   alternative   means,   the    method   of\n\nvaluation called for in § 42 of the UPA did not apply, the\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fplaintiffs being restricted, in these circumstances, to terminating\n\nand   valuing    their    interest     pursuant      to   paragraph   6     of   the\n\nModification.\n\n            While     thus   holding    for    the    defendants,     the     court\n\nobserved as an aside that the \"easy thing for the court to do would\n\nbe to pronounce an ambiguity in the intent of the original partners\n\nin    crafting      the   Modification        and    proceed   to     a     trial.\"\n\nNevertheless, the court found no such ambiguity, hence made no such\n\npronouncement. As a further reason for avoiding a trial, the court\n\nnoted there was no disinterested person alive who could testify as\n\nto the partners' intent in modifying the agreement.                       The court\n\ngranted the motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiffs' cross-\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n                               II.     Discussion\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n            We review de novo the district court's denial of the\n\ncross-motion for partial summary judgment and the granting of the\n\nmotion to dismiss.        Centro Medico Del Turbo, Inc. v. Feliciano De\n\nMelecio, 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            The question of whether a contract is ambiguous is one\n\nfor the courts.      ITT Corp. v. LTX Corp., 929 F.2d 1258, 1261 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).      All of the contract's terms should be construed\n\ntogether to find a coherent whole.             As such, a court may look to\n\nrelated provisions of a contract to cast light on the meaning of\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fdisputed language.        Nadherny v. Roseland Property Co., Inc., 390\n\nF.3d 44, 49 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             The     intent          of      contracting        parties       is\n\n\"generally . . . deemed a material issue of fact\" precluding\n\nsummary dismissal.        Blanchard v. Peerless Ins. Co., 958 F.2d 483,\n\n488 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nB.    Analysis\n\n             The question now on appeal is whether, under Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 108A, § 42, each of the plaintiffs is entitled to receive\n\nthe   full   value   of   his   or   her   shares    in   the   Partnership   as\n\ndetermined upon liquidation, or rather must accept the much-reduced\n\nvalue offered by the remaining partners purportedly under their\n\npowers to approve sales to third parties under paragraph 6, supra,\n\nof the Modification. The plaintiffs-appellants make two arguments.\n\nFirst, they argue that the Partnership became a partnership at will\n\nafter the expiration of the 30-year term; that as partners at will\n\nthey enjoyed an absolute right to dissolve the Partnership; and\n\nthat nothing in the Modification constitutes an agreement otherwise\n\nfor the valuing of their partnership shares upon retirement.\n\nSecond, and alternatively, they argue that at the very least, the\n\nModification is ambiguous and thus its meaning leaves a question of\n\nfact open to be decided by a jury.                  We agree with the first\n\nargument and therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f           i.    Nature of the Partnership\n\n           Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, which the partners expressly\n\nreferenced in the Partnership Agreement and which enacts the UPA,\n\ngoverns the formation, conduct, and liquidation of partnerships in\n\nMassachusetts.    Under ch. 108A, § 29, a \"change in the relation of\n\nthe partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in the\n\ncarrying on . . . of the business\" results in the dissolution of the\n\npartnership.     Dissolution may occur by the express will of any\n\npartner at any time, even in contravention of the agreement between\n\nthe partners, where the circumstances do not otherwise permit\n\ndissolution.     Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 108A, § 31(b)(2).             Where,\n\nhowever, a partnership agreement provides that the partnership is\n\nto   continue   indefinitely   or   without   the   specification    of   a\n\nparticular undertaking, and the partnership is therefore \"at will,\"\n\na partner has the right to dissolve the partnership, and the\n\ndissolution opted for by the partner occurs \"[w]ithout violation of\n\nthe agreement between the partners.\"       Id. at § 31(1).   The statute\n\nfurther provides that:\n\n      When a dissolution is caused in any way, except in\n      contravention of the partnership agreement, each partner,\n      as against his co-partners and all persons claiming\n      through them in respect of their interests in the\n      partnership, unless otherwise agreed, may have the\n      partnership   property    applied   to   discharge    its\n      liabilities, and the surplus applied to pay in cash the\n      net amount owing to the respective partners.\n\nId. at § 38(1) (emphasis supplied).\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f             From the foregoing we glean the following:   if a partner\n\nwithdraws from a partnership at will, thus causing its dissolution,\n\nthe dissolution is not regarded in law as contravening the agreement\n\nbetween the partners, even if the terms of that agreement provide\n\notherwise.    Thereupon, the partner is entitled under § 38(1) to his\n\nfull share of the partnership net assets unless otherwise agreed.\n\nThis contrasts with the situation in which a partner withdraws from\n\na term or other partnership not at will, where the partnership\n\nagreement similarly disallows or restricts withdrawal.         In the\n\nlatter case (unless there are other factors), the restrictive terms\n\nof the partnership agreement may be dispositive.\n\n             Clearly, therefore, it is of considerable importance\n\nwhether the Partnership here was or was not at will when plaintiffs\n\nwithdrew.1    If it was at will, withdrawal was lawful, and the\n\nwithdrawing partners were entitled to their net shares unless some\n\nother method of distribution could be found to have been otherwise\n\nagreed to.     But if the Partnership was not at will, plaintiffs'\n\nright to withdraw from the enterprise was arguably barred altogether\n\n\n\n     1\n      A more simplistic view of the difference between a\npartnership at will and one for a term can be drawn from Black's\nLaw Dictionary, which describes a \"partnership at will\" as \"a\npartnership that any partner may dissolve at any time without\nthereby incurring liability\" and a \"partnership for a term\" as \"a\npartnership that exists for a specified duration or until a\nspecified event occurs.    Such a partnership can be prematurely\ndissolved by any partner, but that partner may be held liable for\nbreach of the partnership agreement.\" Black's Law Dictionary, 1153\n(8th ed. 2004).\n\n                                 -14-\n\f(although    we need not finally decide) by paragraph 4 of the\n\nModification, which required a 60% vote for termination, resulting\n\nin a significantly stronger argument for limiting plaintiffs to the\n\ndistribution being proposed by defendants under paragraph 6.\n\n             It is, therefore, of importance to determine initially\n\nwhether the Partnership was \"at will\" when the plaintiffs sought to\n\nwithdraw.      We    turn   first   to   that   issue,   answering   in   the\n\naffirmative.\n\n             ii. Whether when Plaintiffs Retired, the Partnership was\n\"At Will.\"\n\n             The plaintiffs argue, and the district court so found,\n\nthat when the partners continued to operate the Partnership after\n\nthe expiration of the original 30-year term on January 8, 1994, it\n\nceased to be a partnership for a fixed term and became a partnership\n\nat will.     They base this assertion on the language in Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 108A, § 23(1) that,\n\n     [w]hen a partnership for a fixed term or particular\n     undertaking is continued after the termination of such\n     term or particular undertaking without any express\n     agreement, the rights and duties of the partners remain\n     the same as they were at such termination, so far as is\n     consistent with a partnership at will.\n\nThe district court adopted plaintiffs' analysis, and we agree.            The\n\n30-year term was expressly provided for in the original agreement\n\nand was not mentioned, much less stricken or modified, in the\n\nModification.       The Modification states at the end that, \"[e]xcept\n\nas herein modified, the said Partnership is hereby affirmed.\"             The\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fModification further states that its purpose is to continue the\n\noriginal    agreement    in    \"full    force   with   exception     of   Joseph\n\n[Tropeano's] interest.\"        Defendants would nonetheless have us hold\n\nthat the Modification sub silentio struck out the 30-year term.\n\nThey argue that paragraph 4 of the Modification, stating in part\n\nthat, \"[t]he partnership can be terminated\" by a 60% interest vote\n\nimplicitly eliminated the 30-year term provision contained in the\n\noriginal Agreement, and substituted an agreement to continue the\n\nPartnership indefinitely unless or until a 60% liquidation vote was\n\nachieved.\n\n             Like the district court, however, we believe defendants'\n\ncontention     exceeds   any    reasonable      reading   of   the    relevant\n\ninstruments.     To adopt it would necessitate revising the plain\n\nlanguage of both the Partnership Agreement and the Modification\n\nitself.      When the Modification was executed, seven years yet\n\nremained of the 30-year term.           Seven years was not such a brief\n\nremaining period as to make it unreasonable for the parties to have\n\nleft intact the original 30-year term.            It would have been easy\n\nenough for them to have executed an extension any time prior to\n\nJanuary 8, 1994, in order to continue the term partnership and avoid\n\nthe at-will consequences of § 23(1). Had the parties intended, when\n\nthey executed the Modification, to eliminate the 30-year term\n\nprovision, leaving the Partnership to continue until terminated by\n\na 60% vote, as defendants suggest, one would expect them to have so\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fstated in the Modification, given the express affirmance therein of\n\nthe original partnership, \"[e]xcept as herein modified.\"                      We thus\n\naffirm    the    district    court's    conclusion       that    the    30-year    term\n\nprovision forming part of the original Partnership Agreement was not\n\ndeleted by the Modification.\n\n             Defendants argue in the alternative that, even if the 30-\n\nyear term provision remained and the 30 years expired, the 60%\n\nprovision made the partnership venture a \"particular undertaking,\"\n\nso as to keep the Partnership from becoming one at will under §\n\n23(1) when the 30 years was up.           We disagree.          The defendants rely\n\non Girard Bank v. Haley, 460 Pa. 237, 244, 332 A.2d 443, 447 (1975),\n\nto support their argument that the 60% termination provision turned\n\nthe Partnership into a \"particular undertaking,\" noting that the\n\nPennsylvania      Supreme     Court     had    ruled      that     \"a     'particular\n\nundertaking' under the statute must be capable of accomplishment at\n\nsome     time,    although     the     exact   time      may      be     unknown   and\n\nunascertainable at the date of the agreement.\"                     Id.     The Girard\n\ncourt,    however,    immediately      went    on   to    undermine       defendants'\n\nargument, writing of the partnership agreement at issue in that case\n\nthat\n\n       [t]he agreement contains no provision fixing a definite\n       term, and the sole 'undertaking' to which it refers is\n       that of maintaining and leasing real property. Leasing\n       property, like many other trades or businesses, involves\n       entering into a business relationship which may continue\n       indefinitely; there is nothing 'particular' about it.\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fId. at 244. Business activities which may continue indefinitely are\n\nnot   \"particular\"   in   nature   and    do   not   constitute    particular\n\nundertakings.     Miami Subs Corp. v. Murray Family Trust, 142 N.H.\n\n501, 509, 703 A.2d 1366, 1371 (1997).          The defendants rely also on\n\nOsborne v. Workman, 621 S.W.2d 478, 273 Ark. 538 (1981), for the\n\nprinciple that a partnership agreement which provided that it could\n\nonly be \"dissolved mutually or by law\" was not terminable at will\n\nby an individual partner (though the plaintiff was permitted to\n\nwithdraw   from   the   partnership      and   receive   the   value    of   his\n\npartnership interest as specified in the agreement).              Id. at 479.\n\nThe analogy is tenuous at best.          The Osborne court focused on the\n\nspecific nature of the partnership, a coalition of medical doctors\n\nwhich had provided expressly for the valuation of a withdrawing\n\npartner's share, and emphasized the idea that partnerships among\n\nprofessionals often require agreements that promote continuity and\n\nlongevity.    Here, the partnership is not one of professionals, and\n\nthere is no provision expressly for the valuation of a withdrawing\n\npartner's interest.\n\n             Defendants   emphasize   that     the   Agreement    as   modified\n\ndefines not just the particular undertaking of the management of a\n\nreal estate property but also the particular undertaking that the\n\npartnership would terminate when 60% of the partnership voted to do\n\nso.   As already noted above, however, the Modification explicitly\n\nstated both that the Partnership was affirmed by the Modification\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fand that the original Agreement was to be continued in full force\n\nand effect, indicating that the 30-year term was very much alive and\n\nwell through the Modification.    The 60% provision -- which states\n\nmerely that the Partnership \"can\" be terminated by a 60% interest\n\nvote, not that this alone will allow its termination -- does not\n\nreplace that term either as a time limitation or a particular\n\nundertaking under the terms of Mass. Gen. Laws § 23.\n\n           Hence, the Partnership was an \"at will\" partnership when\n\nplaintiffs announced their decision to retire.     As such, it was\n\nsubject to the provisions of Massachusetts law relative to such\n\npartnerships, including the absolute right of one or more of the\n\npartners to retire and dissolve the partnership at will. Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 108A, § 31(1), supra.    Meehan, 404 Mass. at 428.\n\n           iii.   Whether the Partners \"Otherwise Agreed.\"\n\n           The district court concluded that, notwithstanding the\n\nPartnership's at will status, it remained subject to the special\n\nrequirements agreed to in the Modification, i.e., that the valuation\n\nof the share of a partner opting out with less than the 60% vote\n\nrequired for dissolution be determined under the third-party sale\n\nprovision of paragraph 6 of the Modification (sale or assignment to\n\na close family member under paragraph 5 not being involved).\n\nParagraph 6 does not, however, address the Partnership's purchase\n\nor valuation of a retiring partner's share but rather merely gives\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fit refusal and veto rights over the sale of a partner's share to a\n\nthird party.\n\n           Under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, § 42,\n\n     [w]hen any partner retires or dies, and the business is\n     continued   .    .   .   without   any    settlement   of\n     accounts . . . unless otherwise agreed, he or his legal\n     representative as against such persons or partnership may\n     have the value of his interest at the date of dissolution\n     ascertained, and shall receive as an ordinary creditor an\n     amount equal to the value of his interest in the\n     dissolved partnership with interest . . . . (emphasis\n     supplied).\n\nDefendants, like the district court, focus on the \"unless otherwise\n\nagreed\" language, asserting that the parties here \"otherwise agreed\"\n\non a way other than that outlined in § 42 for establishing the value\n\nof a retiring partner's share.        According to defendants, only\n\ndissolution pursuant to the 60% vote in clause 4 would allow a\n\ndistribution at the full valuation provided in section 42.       In\n\nsupport of their position, defendants cite to case law.          See\n\nDiranian v. Diranian, 773 N.E.2d 462, 466, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 605,\n\n609-10 (2002) (\"Partners may use a written partnership agreement to\n\nprovide for different distributions from those required pursuant to\n\nthe statutory provisions of G.L. c. 108A, §§ 29-43, in the event of\n\na dissolution.\"); Devlin v. Rockey, 295 F.2d 266, 268 (7th Cir.\n\n1961) (\"It is implicit in Section 42 of the [Uniform Partnership\n\nAct], in the use of the words 'unless otherwise agreed,' that\n\npartners may provide by agreement the amounts to be paid to retiring\n\npartners by the surviving partnership.\").\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f            But while we have no doubt that, even where there exists,\n\nas here, a partnership at will, apt language in the original\n\nagreement   may    still   control    the   character     and   amount     of   the\n\ndistribution      upon   dissolution,    we    do   not   believe    the    cited\n\nparagraphs in the Modification, in particular paragraph 6, reflect\n\nan agreement that falls within the \"otherwise agreed\" proviso of §\n\n42.   Paragraph 6 deals with a partner's limited right, while the\n\nPartnership continues, to assign or sell his interest to others than\n\nthe family members cited in paragraph 5.              The partner must first\n\noffer the interest to the remaining partners at presumably the same\n\nprice, and if they do not accept the offer, the assignment or sale\n\nto the third party shall be made only with the partners' consent,\n\nwhich will not be unreasonably withheld.            Nowhere in paragraph 6 is\n\nit suggested that that procedure is to be followed in the event an\n\nat-will   partner    retires,   thus    effecting     a   dissolution      of   the\n\nPartnership as a matter of law.         The only paragraph pertaining to\n\nshare valuation upon dissolution and termination of the Partnership\n\nis paragraph 8, which calls for pro-rata distribution to all\n\npartners.\n\n            Defendants     argue     that     paragraph    4,   providing       for\n\ntermination of the Partnership by 60% or more of the partners, does\n\nnot necessarily rule out termination by other means.                This may be\n\nso.   But the absence of any other express avenue to terminate,\n\ncoupled with the very limited options for sale or assignment of\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fshares in paragraphs 5 and 6,2 suggest that, except for dissolution\n\nof the Partnership by a super-majority vote, no other means to\n\nwithdraw    or   to   dissolve      were    actively   contemplated     when   the\n\nModification was drafted.           No right is mentioned for individual\n\npartners to opt out and sell their shares back to the remaining\n\npartners,   nor    is   a   means    of    valuation   provided   for   such   an\n\noccurrence.      To hold that paragraph 6, which gives partners a very\n\nconstricted right, subject to partnership first refusal and veto,\n\nto offer their shares to third parties, should now be read as the\n\nagreed means to value the shares of partners retiring as of right\n\nunder the at will provisions of the UPA, reads more into paragraph\n\n6 than is there.\n\n            This is not to say that had plaintiffs sought to retire\n\nduring the 30-year term of the partnership, paragraphs 4, 5, and 6\n\nmight not have limited the valuation of their shares as now claimed.\n\nLiability in the form of reduced or even no value under paragraph\n\n6 might, arguably, be imposed for what paragraph 4 suggests would\n\nbe the premature withdrawal by partners absent the 60% vote.               Once,\n\nhowever, the term expired and the Partnership became a partnership\n\nat will, it is considerably harder to argue that paragraph 6 can\n\n\n     2\n      Paragraph 3 of the Modification, providing for disposition of\nPartnership assets upon the death of a partner, set out a fourth\nway of disposal, albeit one presently irrelevant. It is noteworthy\nthat the death provision is written so as to preclude termination\nof the Partnership.    Rather the designees of the deceased will\ncontinue to hold his or her shares as members of the ongoing\npartnership.\n\n                                          -22-\n\freasonably be read to serve the purpose defendants now contend.\n\nWhile perhaps a suitable vehicle to sharply curtail partnership\n\nwithdrawal during the term of the Partnership, it is not worded as\n\na yardstick to value the shares of retiring at-will partners, who\n\nare now legally entitled both to withdraw and to dissolve the\n\npartnership.\n\n             In     the    latter     situation,      the   provisions    of   the\n\nModification seem capable of only two interpretations, neither of\n\nwhich helps defendants.             The first is that paragraph 6, by its\n\nterms, is simply irrelevant to the valuing of a retiring partner's\n\ninterest here.           Paragraph 6 nowhere mentions the retirement or\n\nwithdrawal     of    a    partner,    much     less   the   dissolution   of   the\n\nPartnership.      It provides a method for a partner to sell or assign\n\nhis interest to persons other than the close relatives listed in\n\nsection 5: to do so, the partner must first offer his interest to\n\nthe remaining partners at an equivalent price, and even if they\n\nrefuse to purchase it, they may veto the sale or assignment to\n\nanother, although in so doing they must act reasonably.                    On its\n\nface, paragraph 6 was not written so as to determine the value for\n\npurchase by the remaining partners of the interest of a partner\n\nretiring as of right.           Thus we believe it cannot reasonably be\n\ninterpreted as coming within the \"otherwise agreed\" language of §\n\n42.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\f          Alternatively, one can, with greater confidence perhaps,\n\nread paragraph 8 of the Partnership Agreement as providing an\n\nexpress basis for valuing the plaintiffs' shares where plaintiffs'\n\naction   has    the   legal   effect    of   lawfully   dissolving   the\n\nPartnership.3   That paragraph says in part,\n\n\n     Distribution on Termination.      In the event of the\n     dissolution and termination of the partnership, the\n     Trustees shall be instructed to         proceed to the\n     liquidation of the partnership and the proceeds of the\n     liquidation shall be applied and distributed in the\n     following order of priority . . .\n                      *    *    *\n     (d) Balance . . . to be distributed among all\n     partners   .  .   .  according   to   their   percentage\n     holding . . .\n\n\nParagraph 8 deals specifically with distribution on termination.\n\nIts method of valuation, however, appears substantially the same as\n\nthat outlined in § 42. While arguably intended to be used following\n\ntermination by 60% vote under paragraph 4, it is not so limited by\n\nits own terms and is on its face the most relevant provision in the\n\nModification for distribution where, as here, dissolution of the\n\n\n     3\n      Defendants make much of the fact that in the letter from\ntheir former counsel, plaintiffs initially distinguished their\nplans to retire from an attempt to terminate the partnership, which\nformer counsel at one point seemed to acknowledge required the 60%\nvote of the partners. This statement had no binding effect on the\nplaintiffs, who, after they acquired new counsel, filed an amended\ncomplaint expressly seeking a declaration that they could terminate\nthe partnership as of right.       To the extent that the former\ncounsel's letter can be interpreted to acknowledge that termination\ncould be brought about only upon a 60% vote, it simply reflected an\nunrelied-upon misapprehension of the law. Meehan, 404 Mass. at\n428.\n\n                                 -24-\n\fpartnership at will can be and was effectuated as a matter of legal\n\nright.\n\n           Hence, given that the plaintiffs, as a matter of law, are\n\nentitled to retire and force the dissolution of the partnership at\n\nwill notwithstanding their     non-compliance with the 60% voting\n\nrequirement of paragraph 4, we do not believe that paragraph 6,\n\nwhich is part of the same restricted regime imposed by paragraphs\n\n3, 4, and 5, can reasonably be regarded as the partners' agreement\n\nfor   valuing   plaintiffs'   interests   in   these   very   different\n\ncircumstances. Only by vastly stretching its language can paragraph\n\n6 be read to govern the valuation of partners' interests in an at-\n\nwill retirement situation such as the present one.       We are unable\n\nto find that it reflects an express agreement to value plaintiffs'\n\nshares differently from the accounting called for in § 42.4\n\n\n      4\n      Section 23(1) of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A reinforces our\nposition in this regard. It provides that, after termination of a\nfixed-term partnership, as here, \"the rights and duties of the\npartners remain the same as they were upon such termination, so far\nas is consistent with a partnership at will\" (emphasis added).\nParagraphs 4 (super-majority can vote to dissolve) and 6 (sale of\npartner's interest to third party subject to partners' first\nrefusal and veto), if applied to the valuation of an at-will\npartner's retirement share, may well be provisions that would not\nbe consistent with a partnership at will, hence contrary to §\n23(1). A partner at will is legally entitled to retire without the\nvote of his partners and, except as otherwise agreed, to receive\nfull value for his interest. It thus might seem questionable--\nalthough we do not decide--whether a provision like paragraph 6,\ntailored to the concept that a partner is not free to retire except\nfollowing a super-majority vote, can properly be imposed to value\na retiring at-will partner's share.      Given, however, that the\nlanguage of paragraph 6 does not in any event aptly apply to\nvaluation of a partner's interest in the present situation, we need\n\n                                 -25-\n\f             The defendants cite a number of cases to support the\n\nproposition that the terms of a partnership agreement may trump the\n\nvaluation provisions of the UPA.                    We do not dispute that, on\n\nappropriate facts, that is so.                But all of the cited cases, save\n\none, which we discuss below, involved agreements where there were\n\nprovisions specifically governing how the partnership interest of\n\na deceased or withdrawing partner was to be valued, which is not the\n\ncase here.        See Devlin, 295 F.2d at 267 (article providing for\n\nwithdrawal of partners and division of earnings); Robbins v. Salem\n\nRadiology, 764 A.2d 885, 888, 145 N.H. 415, 418 (2000) (article\n\nlimiting any departing partner's interest to the accumulated and\n\nundistributed fees of the partnership); Wood v.

Id. at 277.   It is\n\neasily distinguished from the instant case because of the unique\n\nfacts in Balafas and because we are dealing here with a written\n\nagreement, not an implied oral partnership.     The court in Balafas\n\nimplied a contract in fact from the absence of a written partnership\n\nagreement involving two immigrant brothers who were not familiar\n\nwith partnership law and, the court found, considered their property\n\nto be joint between the two of them.      Here we are dealing with a\n\nwritten partnership agreement which specifies a valuation provision\n\nfor dissolution comparable to that in § 42 but did not demonstrate\n\nan \"otherwise agreement\" for withdrawal or retirement.\n\n\n\n\n                               -27-\n\f           iv. Whether the Intent of the Parties in the Agreement\nis a Triable Issue of Fact\n\n             As we have agreed with the plaintiffs' first argument on\n\nappeal, we need not reach their claim in the alternative that the\n\nModification was ambiguous and thus that we should reverse so that\n\na jury could rule on the factual issue of the parties' intent\n\nregarding the issue of partners' withdrawal. We note briefly,\n\nhowever, our agreement with the district court that the Modification\n\nwas not ambiguous.\n\n             As noted above, the intent of contracting parties is\n\n\"generally [] deemed a material issue of fact\" precluding summary\n\ndismissal.      Blanchard, 958 F.2d 488.      See also Boston Five Cents\n\nSav. Bank v. Department of Housing & Urban Dev., 768 F.2d 5, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 1985) (\"an argument between parties about the meaning of a\n\ncontract is typically an argument about a 'material fact,' namely\n\nthe   factual     meaning   of   the     contract\").   Only   in   limited\n\ncircumstances is it appropriate for a court to choose one meaning\n\nof a disputed agreement over another.          Such limited circumstances\n\noccur only where \"no 'reasonable person' could differ about what the\n\ncontract means, either because the language is unambiguous or the\n\nsupporting evidence is sufficiently one-sided.\"         Boston Five Cents\n\nSav. Bank, 768 F.2d at 8.         On the other hand, \"the words of a\n\ncontract may be so clear themselves that reasonable people could not\n\ndiffer over their meaning.\"       Id.\n\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\f             The    Modification     clearly    expressed   the   will   of   the\n\npartners to continue the Partnership after the death of one of the\n\nfounding partners and, as part of that affirmation of the continued\n\nPartnership, expressly delineated the ways in which the Partnership\n\nand individual Partnership interests could be terminated but failed\n\nto provide a valuation provision for either dissolution prior to the\n\n60%   vote   of    the   partnership   or     withdrawal.    Without     such   a\n\nprovision, the UPA valuation provisions dictate the value of the\n\nwithdrawing partners' shares.          The Modification is not ambiguous,\n\nand there is no occasion for a jury to resolve its meaning.\n\n                              III.     Conclusion\n\n             The district court's judgment is therefore reversed, and\n\nthe case remanded for further disposition in accordance herewith.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\f",

Background and Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undisputed facts of the case are as follows. On January 8, 1964, Alfred Tropeano, Louis Tropeano, Joseph Tropeano, Philip Tropeano and Wilbur Nylander created the Captain Parker Arms Partnership (the \"Partnership\") by means of a two-page Agreement (the \"Partnership Agreement\"). The partners agreed therein to \"become and remain partners in the business of acquiring the title [to a specific piece of land in Lexington] . . . to construct apartments on said land, for the term of thirty years from the date hereof.\" A nominal trust, T &amp; N Realty Trust (the \"Trust\"), was created to hold the real estate for the partners' benefit. The Partnership Agreement provided that \"[a]ll applicable provisions and sections of [Massachusetts] General Laws Chapter 108A [enacting the Uniform Partnership Act] are herein incorporated by reference and made a part hereof.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime after the formation of the Partnership and the Trust, Joseph Tropeano died. His death caused the remaining partners to execute an agreement modifying the Partnership Agreement (the \"Modification\"). The Modification provided in relevant part as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, Joseph C. Tropeano is now deceased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NOW, THEREFORE, this Modification and affirmation of the Partnership by the surviving partners Alfred P. Tropeano, Wilbur C. Nylander, Louis Tropeano and Philip Tropeano agree:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Co-Partners. That the partnership agreement dated January 8, 1964, was not dissolved or terminated by the surviving partners when Joseph C. Tropeano died, has been and is in full force with exception of Joseph's interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Rights of Deceased Former Partner. The 15% interest of the late Joseph C. Tropeano is to be paid or distributed as provided in his will allowed for probate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Death of an Existing Partner. The death of an existing partner shall not terminate the Partnership and his interest will be held by the persons or entities set forth on the deceased partner's schedule attached and made a part hereof which bears his signature and they shall have all the rights of the deceased partner. Said person or entities shall be to those set forth in 5 hereunder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the death of a partner, the partners herein agree and so instruct the Trustees to execute whatever documents may be necessary to permit said representative to borrow money to pay estate taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there is sufficient cash held by the Trustees, the partners agree that the Trustees may loan monies to the representative of the deceased partner who have or will file Federal and State Estate Tax forms bearing interest at the then prime interest rate of Shawmut Boston plus 1%. Said loan shall be paid back to the Trust or deducted from the distributive share of said deceased partner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Termination. The partnership can be terminated by a vote of not less than 60% interest of 100% and upon such vote the partners shall so notify the Trustees to liquidate the assets and distribute the net principal and accumulated income as provided by number 8 hereunder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. Partner's Rights to Assign or Sell to Certain Individuals. Any partner shall have the right to assign or to sell any portion of his interest to his wife or his children or grandchildren, without the consent of the other partners, who may take title in their own name or a separate entity in which they will be the sole beneficiary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. Partner's Right to Assign or Sell to Others. Prior to any assignment or sale of any partner's interest or those having his interest to those than the aforesaid, the assigning or selling partner shall offer the same in writing with a certified copy of the terms offered to him by the proposed assignee or purchaser. The partners shall have thirty (30) business days to accept or reject the offer. If they do not accept the offer, the assignment or sale to the third party shall only be made with the consent of the other partners and those claiming through them which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. Voting Minors Interest. If any holder of an interest in the partnership is a minor, his interest during minority shall be voted by his father and if no father, by his mother and if no mother, by his legal guardian.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. Distribution on Termination. In the event of the dissolution and termination of the partnership, the Trustees shall be instructed to proceed to the liquidation of the partnership and the proceeds of the liquidation shall be applied and distributed in the following order of priority:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Debts. To the payment of the debts and liabilities of the partnership. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Reserves. To the setting up of any reserves which the partners may deem reasonably necessary for any contingent or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the partnership . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) Partner loans. To the repayment of any loans or advances that may have been made by any of the partners to the partnership. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) Balance. Any balance remaining shall be distributed among all partners as follows according to their percentage holding. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except as herein modified, the said partnership is hereby affirmed, dated this 11th day of March, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Modification thus specified three ways for the partners, while alive, either to terminate and liquidate the Partnership or else to transfer individual interests to others. Termination leading to liquidation could be accomplished by a 60% percent interest vote. A partner could, as of right, assign or sell any section of his interest to specified family members but could not assign or sell to any others except with the consent of the other partners after first offering them refusal rights. Several partners thereafter transferred their interests to family members, as permitted, including many of the current parties. Since the Modification, there have been no further revisions to the Partnership Agreement, and through the bringing of the present lawsuit in November 2003, the Partnership has continued to operate even though the 30-year term specified in the Partnership Agreement came to an end on January 8, 1994. As the district court found, \"Not only did the Partnership continue to manage its rental property without interruption after the 30-year term expired, but many of the plaintiffs and defendants acceded to their interest in the Partnership through assignments made after the expiration date pursuant to &#182; 5 of the Modification.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 21, 2003, Philip, Peter and Carolyn Tropeano, holding collectively a 42.86% interest in the Partnership, served written notice on the defendants that they intended to retire, effective October 1, 2003, according to the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 42. The notice stated that \"[p]ursuant to the provisions of M.G.L. Ch. 108A, Sec. 29, the change in our relationship effected by our retirement from the partnership is to be treated as dissolution of the partnership. Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 108A, Section 42, as retiring partners we wish to have the value of our interests ascertained as of the date of dissolution (that is, October 1, 2003).\" The notice stated that the retiring partners understood that a complete termination of the Partnership required a 60% vote of the partners but that after the leaving partners retired, the remaining members could also continue on as the sole partners. The letter stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that in order to terminate the partnership, a vote of 60% of the partners is required. . . . If you wish to terminate the partnership, we would participate in that vote in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs sought to be paid their respective interests of the value of the Partnership's assets. They valued their collective interest in the Partnership's assets (totaling $18.8 million) at an appraised value of $6,600,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants responded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to withdraw and receive from the Partnership the liquidation value of their respective interests in the Partnership. The defendants, however, offered to purchase the plaintiffs' minority interest for $2,750,000 under paragraph 6 of the Modification. In a letter to plaintiffs' then-counsel from counsel for defendant Charlene Dorman, the defendants explained their offer, saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">on your client's management watch, the partner distributions to your clients have averaged $174,119 over the last four years per Kennedy &amp; Kennedy's financial statements. If a yield of 6.4% on Mrs. Dorman's offer of $2,750,000 was achieved (a very reasonable figure) your clients would be in an identical pre-tax position having converted their illiquid minority interest to cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After efforts to compromise failed, plaintiffs brought this action in the district court in November of 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their initial complaint, the plaintiffs asserted a right to retire from the Partnership pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 42 and to secure the partnership accounting outlined in that provision. Defendants moved to dismiss, and plaintiffs filed an opposition, to which defendants replied. The defendants also successfully moved to disqualify the plaintiffs' counsel, who had previously represented the Partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After obtaining new counsel, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. Besides the relief originally sought, the amended complaint requested, inter alia, declaratory judgments that (1) the Partnership was a partnership at will and therefore terminable by any partner, at any time, for any reason; (2) the plaintiffs had lawfully terminated the Partnership; and (3) the plaintiffs' termination of the Partnership required the winding up of the Partnership's business, the liquidation of the Partnership's assets, and the distribution of the liquidation proceeds to the partners according to their respective partnership interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' amended complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated pleading opposing the motion to dismiss and cross-moving for summary judgment and for declaratory judgments on the three above-mentioned points on which they sought declarations. Defendants opposed the plaintiffs' cross-motion, and the plaintiffs filed a reply brief. The district court heard oral argument on December 2, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argued to the district court that the express Partnership had terminated on January 8, 1994 when the 30-year term of the Agreement had expired. Thereafter, they said, the Partnership became a partnership at will by operation of law under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 23(1), which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a partnership for a fixed term or particular undertaking is continued after the termination of such term or particular undertaking without any express agreement, the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were at such termination, so far as is consistent with a partnership at will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the plaintiffs' theory, any restrictions expressed in the Modification to the Partnership Agreement could not affect their ability to retire from, and in effect dissolve, the Partnership, since once the partnership became one at will, any partner could terminate the partnership at any time for any reason. <i>See, e.g., Meehan v. Shaughnessy,</i> 404 Mass. 419, 428, 535 N.E.2d 1255 (1989). Plaintiffs argued that when a partner in a partnership at will retires, his or her withdrawal triggers an accounting pursuant to the terms of the Uniform Partnership Act (\"UPA\") as codified in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants disagreed. In their view, the Modification supplanted the 30-year term with an agreement to continue the Partnership, unless or until a 60% liquidation vote was achieved. The defendants asserted that the Modification substituted a new structure for that under the old Agreement: rather than being subject to a fixed term of thirty years, the property would be maintained indefinitely under the Agreement until a dissolution occurred by a 60% vote. Alternatively, the defendants argued that even if the Partnership had become a partnership at will, no accounting was called for under &#167; 42 as the accounting provision did not come into effect if the parties had otherwise agreed to a different course of action. Thus, &#167; 42 provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]hen any partner retires or dies, and the business is continued . . . without any settlement of accounts . . . <i>unless otherwise agreed,</i> he or his legal representative as against such persons or partnership may have the value of his interest at the date of dissolution ascertained, and shall receive as an ordinary creditor an amount equal to the value of his interest in the dissolved partnership with interest . . . (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, defendants argued, the partners had, in the Modification, agreed otherwise by limiting a partner's withdrawal or retirement to the three options described therein (i.e., termination by 60% vote; assignment to a family member; or third-party sale subject to the partners' consent). Any other interpretation, the defendants said, would render meaningless the restrictions agreed to in the Modification, including the 60% termination requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, plaintiffs insisted that defendants were wrong to assert that the partners' rights upon retirement, as conferred in &#167; 42, were lessened or eliminated by something said in the Modification. They argued that there is no provision that \"otherwise agrees\" as to how a retiring partner's share is to be valued. No formula is set forth in the Modification for valuing a retiring partner's interest. Accordingly, the accounting described in &#167; 42 must be utilized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled against defendants' contention that the Modification had substituted for the 30-year term an agreement to continue the Partnership until terminated by a 60% vote. It agreed with plaintiffs that nothing in the Modification eliminated the original 30-year term, hence, after January 8, 1994, the Partnership became one at will by operation of &#167; 23(1) of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A. Nonetheless, the court found for defendants on the ultimate issue, finding the partners had \"otherwise agreed\" to a method of valuation such as defendants proposed. Because the parties had agreed upon an alternative means, the method of valuation called for in &#167; 42 of the UPA did not apply, the plaintiffs being restricted, in these circumstances, to terminating and valuing their interest pursuant to paragraph 6 of the Modification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While thus holding for the defendants, the court observed as an aside that the \"easy thing for the court to do would be to pronounce an ambiguity in the intent of the original partners in crafting the Modification and proceed to a trial.\" Nevertheless, the court found no such ambiguity, hence made no such pronouncement. As a further reason for avoiding a trial, the court noted there was no disinterested person alive who could testify as to the partners' intent in modifying the agreement. The court granted the motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's denial of the cross-motion for partial summary judgment and the granting of the motion to dismiss. <i>Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> 406 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of whether a contract is ambiguous is one for the courts. <i>ITT Corp. v. LTX Corp.,</i> 926 F.2d 1258, 1261 (1st Cir.1991). All of the contract's terms should be construed together to find a coherent whole. As such, a court may look to related provisions of a contract to cast light on the meaning of disputed language. <i>Nadherny v.

Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question now on appeal is whether, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 42, each of the plaintiffs is entitled to receive the full value of his or her shares in the Partnership as determined upon liquidation, or rather must accept the much-reduced value offered by the remaining partners purportedly under their powers to approve sales to third parties under paragraph 6, <i>supra,</i> of the Modification. The plaintiffs-appellants make two arguments. First, they argue that the Partnership became a partnership at will after the expiration of the 30-year term; that as partners at will they enjoyed an absolute right to dissolve the Partnership; and that nothing in the Modification constitutes an agreement otherwise for the valuing of their partnership shares upon retirement. Second, and alternatively, they argue that at the very least, the Modification is ambiguous and thus its meaning leaves a question of fact open to be decided by a jury. We agree with the first argument and therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. Nature of the Partnership</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, which the partners expressly referenced in the Partnership Agreement and which enacts the UPA, governs the formation, conduct, and liquidation of partnerships in Massachusetts. Under ch. 108A, &#167; 29, a \"change in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in the carrying on . . . of the business\" results in the dissolution of the partnership. Dissolution may occur by the express will of any partner at any time, even in contravention of the agreement between the partners, where the circumstances do not otherwise permit dissolution. Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 108A, &#167; 31(b)(2). Where, however, a partnership agreement provides that the partnership is to continue indefinitely or without the specification of a particular undertaking, and the partnership is therefore \"at will,\" a partner has the right to dissolve the partnership, and the dissolution opted for by the partner occurs \"[w]ithout violation of the agreement between the partners.\" <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 31(1). The statute further provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a dissolution is caused in any way, except in contravention of the partnership agreement, each partner, as against his co-partners and all persons claiming through them in respect of their interests in the partnership, <i>unless otherwise agreed,</i> may have the partnership property applied to discharge its liabilities, and the surplus applied to pay in cash the net amount owing to the respective partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at &#167; 38(1) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the foregoing we glean the following: if a partner withdraws from a partnership at will, thus causing its dissolution, the dissolution is not regarded in law as contravening the agreement between the partners, even if the terms of that agreement provide otherwise. Thereupon, the partner is entitled under &#167; 38(1) to his full share of the partnership net assets <i>unless otherwise agreed.</i> This contrasts with the situation in which a partner withdraws from a term or other partnership <i>not</i> at will, where the partnership agreement similarly disallows or restricts withdrawal. In the latter case (unless there are other factors), the restrictive terms of the partnership agreement may be dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, therefore, it is of considerable importance whether the Partnership here was or was not at will when plaintiffs withdrew.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> If it was at will, withdrawal was lawful, and the withdrawing partners were entitled to their net shares unless some other method of distribution could be found to have been otherwise agreed to. But if the Partnership was <i>not</i> at will, plaintiffs' right to withdraw from the enterprise was arguably barred altogether (although we need not finally decide) by paragraph 4 of the Modification, which required a 60% vote for termination, resulting in a significantly stronger argument for limiting plaintiffs to the distribution being proposed by defendants under paragraph 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, therefore, of importance to determine initially whether the Partnership was \"at will\" when the plaintiffs sought to withdraw. We turn first to that issue, answering in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. Whether when Plaintiffs Retired, the Partnership was \"At Will.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue, and the district court so found, that when the partners continued to operate the Partnership after the expiration of the original 30-year term on January 8, 1994, it ceased to be a partnership for a fixed term and became a partnership at will. They base this assertion on the language in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 23(1) that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]hen a partnership for a fixed term or particular undertaking is continued after the termination of such term or particular undertaking without any express agreement, the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were at such termination, so far as is consistent with a partnership at will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted plaintiffs' analysis, and we agree. The 30-year term was expressly provided for in the original agreement and was not mentioned, much less stricken or modified, in the Modification. The Modification states at the end that, \"[e]xcept as herein modified, the said Partnership is hereby affirmed.\" The Modification further states that its purpose is to continue the original agreement in \"full force with exception of Joseph [Tropeano's] interest.\" Defendants would nonetheless have us hold that the Modification sub silentio struck out the 30-year term. They argue that paragraph 4 of the Modification, stating in part that, \"[t]he partnership can be terminated\" by a 60% interest vote implicitly eliminated the 30-year term provision contained in the original Agreement, and substituted an agreement to continue the Partnership indefinitely unless or until a 60% liquidation vote was achieved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, however, we believe defendants' contention exceeds any reasonable reading of the relevant instruments. To adopt it would necessitate revising the plain language of both the Partnership Agreement and the Modification itself. When the Modification was executed, seven years yet remained of the 30-year term. Seven years was not such a brief remaining period as to make it unreasonable for the parties to have left intact the original 30-year term. It would have been easy enough for them to have executed an extension any time prior to January 8, 1994, in order to continue the term partnership and avoid the at-will consequences of &#167; 23(1). Had the parties intended, when they executed the Modification, to eliminate the 30-year term provision, leaving the Partnership to continue until terminated by a 60% vote, as defendants suggest, one would expect them to have so stated in the Modification, given the express affirmance therein of the original partnership, \"[e]xcept as herein modified.\" We thus affirm the district court's conclusion that the 30-year term provision forming part of the original Partnership Agreement was not deleted by the Modification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue in the alternative that, even if the 30-year term provision remained and the 30 years expired, the 60% provision made the partnership venture a \"particular undertaking,\" so as to keep the Partnership from becoming one at will under &#167; 23(1) when the 30 years was up. We disagree. The defendants rely on <i>Girard Bank v. Haley,</i> 460 Pa. 237, 244, 332 A.2d 443, 447 (1975), to support their argument that the 60% termination provision turned the Partnership into a \"particular undertaking,\" noting that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had ruled that \"a `particular undertaking' under the statute must be capable of accomplishment at some time, although the exact time may be unknown and unascertainable at the date of the agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> The <i>Girard</i> court, however, immediately went on to undermine defendants' argument, writing of the partnership agreement at issue in that case that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he agreement contains no provision fixing a definite term, and the sole `undertaking' to which it refers is that of maintaining and leasing real property. Leasing property, like many other trades or businesses, involves entering into a business relationship which may continue indefinitely; there is nothing `particular' about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 244, 332 A.2d 443. Business activities which may continue indefinitely are not \"particular\" in nature and do not constitute particular undertakings. <i>Miami Subs Corp. v. Murray Family Trust,</i> 142 N.H. 501, 509, 703 A.2d 1366, 1371 (1997). The defendants rely also on <i>Osborne v. Workman,</i> 621 S.W.2d 478, 273 Ark. 538 (1981), for the principle that a partnership agreement which provided that it could only be \"dissolved mutually or by law\" was not terminable at will by an individual partner (though the plaintiff was permitted to withdraw from the partnership and receive the value of his partnership interest as specified in the agreement). <i>Id.</i> at 479. The analogy is tenuous at best. The <i>Osborne</i> court focused on the specific nature of the partnership, a coalition of medical doctors which had provided expressly for the valuation of a withdrawing partner's share, and emphasized the idea that partnerships among professionals often require agreements that promote continuity and longevity. Here, the partnership is not one of professionals, and there is no provision expressly for the valuation of a withdrawing partner's interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants emphasize that the Agreement as modified defines not just the particular undertaking of the management of a real estate property but also the particular undertaking that the partnership would terminate when 60% of the partnership voted to do so. As already noted above, however, the Modification explicitly stated both that the Partnership was affirmed by the Modification and that the original Agreement was to be continued in full force and effect, indicating that the 30-year term was very much alive and well through the Modification. The 60% provision &#8212; which states merely that the Partnership \"can\" be terminated by a 60% interest vote, not that this alone will allow its termination &#8212; does not replace that term either as a time limitation or a particular undertaking under the terms of Mass. Gen. Laws &#167; 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, the Partnership was an \"at will\" partnership when plaintiffs announced their decision to retire. As such, it was subject to the provisions of Massachusetts law relative to such partnerships, including the absolute right of one or more of the partners to retire and dissolve the partnership at will. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 31(1), <i>supra. Meehan,</i> 404 Mass. at 428, 535 N.E.2d 1255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii. Whether the Partners \"Otherwise Agreed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that, notwithstanding the Partnership's at will status, it remained subject to the special requirements agreed to in the Modification, i.e., that the valuation of the share of a partner opting out with less than the 60% vote required for dissolution be determined under the third-party sale provision of paragraph 6 of the Modification (sale or assignment to a close family member under paragraph 5 not being involved). Paragraph 6 does not, however, address the Partnership's purchase or valuation of a retiring partner's share but rather merely gives it refusal and veto rights over the sale of a partner's share to a third party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 42, [w]hen any partner retires or dies, and the business is continued . . . without any settlement of accounts . . . <i>unless otherwise agreed,</i> he or his legal representative as against such persons or partnership may have the value of his interest at the date of dissolution ascertained, and shall receive as an ordinary creditor an amount equal to the value of his interest in the dissolved partnership with interest . . . . (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants, like the district court, focus on the \"unless otherwise agreed\" language, asserting that the parties here \"otherwise agreed\" on a way other than that outlined in &#167; 42 for establishing the value of a retiring partner's share. According to defendants, only dissolution pursuant to the 60% vote in clause 4 would allow a distribution at the full valuation provided in section 42. In support of their position, defendants cite to case law. <i>See Diranian v. Diranian,</i> 773 N.E.2d 462, 466, 55 Mass. App.Ct. 605, 609-10 (2002) (\"Partners may use a written partnership agreement to provide for different distributions from those required pursuant to the statutory provisions of G.L. c. 108A, &#167;&#167; 29-43, in the event of a dissolution.\"); <i>Devlin v. Rockey,</i> 295 F.2d 266, 268 (7th Cir.1961) (\"It is implicit in Section 42 of the [Uniform Partnership Act], in the use of the words `unless otherwise agreed,' that partners may provide by agreement the amounts to be paid to retiring partners by the surviving partnership.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But while we have no doubt that, even where there exists, as here, a partnership at will, apt language in the original agreement may still control the character and amount of the distribution upon dissolution, we do not believe the cited paragraphs in the Modification, in particular paragraph 6, reflect an agreement that falls within the \"otherwise agreed\" proviso of &#167; 42. Paragraph 6 deals with a partner's limited right, while the Partnership continues, to assign or sell his interest to others than the family members cited in paragraph 5. The partner must first offer the interest to the remaining partners at presumably the same price, and if they do not accept the offer, the assignment or sale to the third party shall be made only with the partners' consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Nowhere in paragraph 6 is it suggested that that procedure is to be followed in the event an at-will partner retires, thus effecting a dissolution of the Partnership as a matter of law. The only paragraph pertaining to share valuation upon dissolution and termination of the Partnership is paragraph 8, which calls for pro-rata distribution to all partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that paragraph 4, providing for termination of the Partnership by 60% or more of the partners, does not necessarily rule out termination by other means. This may be so. But the absence of any other express avenue to terminate, coupled with the very limited options for sale or assignment of shares in paragraphs 5 and 6,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> suggest that, except for dissolution of the Partnership by a super-majority vote, no other means to withdraw or to dissolve were actively contemplated when the Modification was drafted. No right is mentioned for individual partners to opt out and sell their shares back to the remaining partners, nor is a means of valuation provided for such an occurrence. To hold that paragraph 6, which gives partners a very constricted right, subject to partnership first refusal and veto, to offer their shares to third parties, should now be read as the agreed means to value the shares of partners retiring as of right under the at will provisions of the UPA, reads more into paragraph 6 than is there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that had plaintiffs sought to retire during the 30-year term of the partnership, paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 might not have limited the valuation of their shares as now claimed. Liability in the form of reduced or even no value under paragraph 6 might, arguably, be imposed for what paragraph 4 suggests would be the premature withdrawal by partners absent the 60% vote. Once, however, the term expired and the Partnership became a partnership at will, it is considerably harder to argue that paragraph 6 can reasonably be read to serve the purpose defendants now contend. While perhaps a suitable vehicle to sharply curtail partnership withdrawal during the term of the Partnership, it is not worded as a yardstick to value the shares of retiring at-will partners, who are now legally entitled both to withdraw and to dissolve the partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the latter situation, the provisions of the Modification seem capable of only two interpretations, neither of which helps defendants. The first is that paragraph 6, by its terms, is simply irrelevant to the valuing of a retiring partner's interest here. Paragraph 6 nowhere mentions the retirement or withdrawal of a partner, much less the dissolution of the Partnership. It provides a method for a partner to sell or assign his interest to persons other than the close relatives listed in section 5: to do so, the partner must first offer his interest to the remaining partners at an equivalent price, and even if they refuse to purchase it, they may veto the sale or assignment to another, although in so doing they must act reasonably. On its face, paragraph 6 was not written so as to determine the value for purchase by the remaining partners of the interest of a partner retiring as of right. Thus we believe it cannot reasonably be interpreted as coming within the \"otherwise agreed\" language of &#167; 42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, one can, with greater confidence perhaps, read paragraph 8 of the Partnership Agreement as providing an express basis for valuing the plaintiffs' shares where plaintiffs' action has the legal effect of lawfully dissolving the Partnership.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> That paragraph says in part,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Distribution on Termination. In the event of the dissolution and termination of the partnership, the Trustees shall be instructed to proceed to the liquidation of the partnership and the proceeds of the liquidation shall be applied and distributed in the following order of priority. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) Balance . . . to be distributed among all partners . . . according to their percentage holding . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 8 deals specifically with distribution on termination. Its method of valuation, however, appears substantially the same as that outlined in &#167; 42. While arguably intended to be used following termination by 60% vote under paragraph 4, it is not so limited by its own terms and is on its face the most relevant provision in the Modification for distribution where, as here, dissolution of the partnership at will can be and was effectuated as a matter of legal right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, given that the plaintiffs, as a matter of law, are entitled to retire and force the dissolution of the partnership at will notwithstanding their non-compliance with the 60% voting requirement of paragraph 4, we do not believe that paragraph 6, which is part of the same restricted regime imposed by paragraphs 3, 4, and 5, can reasonably be regarded as the partners' agreement for valuing plaintiffs' interests in these very different circumstances. Only by vastly stretching its language can paragraph 6 be read to govern the valuation of partners' interests in an at-will retirement situation such as the present one. We are unable to find that it reflects an express agreement to value plaintiffs' shares differently from the accounting called for in &#167; 42.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants cite a number of cases to support the proposition that the terms of a partnership agreement may trump the valuation provisions of the UPA. We do not dispute that, on appropriate facts, that is so. But all of the cited cases, save one, which we discuss below, involved agreements where there were provisions specifically governing how the partnership interest of a deceased or withdrawing partner was to be valued, which is not the case here. <i>See Devlin,</i> 295 F.2d at 267 (article providing for withdrawal of partners and division of earnings); <i>Robbins v. Salem Radiology,</i> 764 A.2d 885, 888, 145 N.H. 415, 418 (2000) (article limiting any departing partner's interest to the accumulated and undistributed fees of the partnership); <i>Wood v. Gunther,</i> 201 P.2d 874, 876, 89 Cal.App.2d 718, 721-22 (1949) (agreement explicitly stated that \"[s]hould any of the partners desire to sell his interest in the partnership or to withdraw from the partnership,. . . he shall do so only upon the following terms. . . .\"); <i>In re Eddy's Estate,</i> 49 N.E.2d 628, 290 N.Y. 677 (1941) (agreement contained specific formula for setting price at which surviving partner could buy interest of deceased partner); <i>Heath v. Spitzmiller,</i> 663 S.W.2d 351, 354-55 (Mo.App. S.D.1983) (agreement provided that withdrawing partner was entitled to his share of partnership assets, valued \"by multiplying the billings to clients for the twelve months preceding the date of withdrawal times 150% and adding it to the fair market value of the partnership's `equipment' and `Capital Investment'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also cite <i>Balafas v. Balafas,</i> 117 N.W.2d 20, 263 Minn. 267 (1962), where the court held that the UPA provisions did not preclude an agreement between partners to dispose of partnership assets in a manner contrary to the UPA provisions which would have been controlling in the absence of the agreement. That case involved the court's implying an \"otherwise agreement\" into an oral partnership agreement on the basis of extrinsic evidence demonstrating that two brothers in a partnership had clearly intended to have the share of the first deceased partner become the property of the surviving partner. <i>Id.</i> at 277, 117 N.W.2d 20. It is easily distinguished from the instant case because of the unique facts in <i>Balafas</i> and because we are dealing here with a written agreement, not an implied oral partnership. The court in <i>Balafas</i> implied a contract in fact from the absence of a written partnership agreement involving two immigrant brothers who were not familiar with partnership law and, the court found, considered their property to be joint between the two of them. Here we are dealing with a written partnership agreement which specifies a valuation provision for dissolution comparable to that in &#167; 42 but did not demonstrate an \"otherwise agreement\" for withdrawal or retirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iv.

Only in limited circumstances is it appropriate for a court to choose one meaning of a disputed agreement over another. Such limited circumstances occur only where \"no `reasonable person' could differ about what the contract means, either because the language is unambiguous or the supporting evidence is sufficiently one-sided.\" <i>Boston Five Cents Sav.

Without such a provision, the UPA valuation provisions dictate the value of the withdrawing partners' shares.

Such a partnership can be prematurely dissolved by any partner, but that partner may be held liable for breach of the partnership agreement.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary,</i> 1153 (8th ed.2004).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Paragraph 3 of the Modification, providing for disposition of Partnership assets upon the death of a partner, set out a fourth way of disposal, albeit one presently irrelevant. It is noteworthy that the death provision is written so as to preclude termination of the Partnership. Rather the designees of the deceased will continue to hold his or her shares as members of the ongoing partnership</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Defendants make much of the fact that in the letter from their former counsel, plaintiffs initially distinguished their plans to retire from an attempt to terminate the partnership, which former counsel at one point seemed to acknowledge required the 60% vote of the partners. This statement had no binding effect on the plaintiffs, who, after they acquired new counsel, filed an amended complaint expressly seeking a declaration that they could terminate the partnership as of right. To the extent that the former counsel's letter can be interpreted to acknowledge that termination could be brought about only upon a 60% vote, it simply reflected an unrelied-upon misapprehension of the law<i>Meehan,</i> 404 Mass. at 428, 535 N.E.2d 1255.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Section 23(1) of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A reinforces our position in this regard. It provides that, after termination of a fixed-term partnership, as here, \"the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were upon such termination,<i>so far as is consistent with a partnership at will</i>\" (emphasis added). Paragraphs 4 (super-majority can vote to dissolve) and 6 (sale of partner's interest to third party subject to partners' first refusal and veto), if applied to the valuation of an at-will partner's retirement share, may well be provisions that would <i>not</i> be consistent with a partnership at will, hence contrary to &#167; 23(1). A partner at will is legally entitled to retire without the vote of his partners and, except as otherwise agreed, to receive full value for his interest. It thus might seem questionable&#8212;although we do not decide&#8212;whether a provision like paragraph 6, tailored to the concept that a partner is not free to retire except following a super-majority vote, can properly be imposed to value a retiring at-will partner's share. Given, however, that the language of paragraph 6 does not in any event aptly apply to valuation of a partner's interest in the present situation, we need not decide the legality of such a provision were it expressly applicable.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Background and Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undisputed facts of the case are as follows. On January 8, 1964, Alfred Tropeano, Louis Tropeano, Joseph Tropeano, Philip Tropeano and Wilbur Nylander created the Captain Parker Arms Partnership (the \"Partnership\") by means of a two-page Agreement (the \"Partnership Agreement\"). The partners agreed therein to \"become and remain partners in the business of acquiring the title [to a specific piece of land in Lexington] . . . to construct apartments on said land, for the term of thirty years from the date hereof.\" A nominal trust, T &amp; N Realty Trust (the \"Trust\"), was created to hold the real estate for the partners' benefit. The Partnership Agreement provided that \"[a]ll applicable provisions and sections of [Massachusetts] General Laws Chapter 108A [enacting the Uniform Partnership Act] are herein incorporated by reference and made a part hereof.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime after the formation of the Partnership and the Trust, Joseph Tropeano died. His death caused the remaining partners to execute an agreement modifying the Partnership Agreement (the \"Modification\"). The Modification provided in relevant part as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, Joseph C. Tropeano is now deceased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NOW, THEREFORE, this Modification and affirmation of the Partnership by the surviving partners Alfred P. Tropeano, Wilbur C. Nylander, Louis Tropeano and Philip Tropeano agree:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Co-Partners. That the partnership agreement dated January 8, 1964, was not dissolved or terminated by the surviving partners when Joseph C. Tropeano died, has been and is in full force with exception of Joseph's interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Rights of Deceased Former Partner. The 15% interest of the late Joseph C. Tropeano is to be paid or distributed as provided in his will allowed for probate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Death of an Existing Partner. The death of an existing partner shall not terminate the Partnership and his interest will be held by the persons or entities set forth on the deceased partner's schedule attached and made a part hereof which bears his signature and they shall have all the rights of the deceased partner. Said person or entities shall be to those set forth in 5 hereunder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the death of a partner, the partners herein agree and so instruct the Trustees to execute whatever documents may be necessary to permit said representative to borrow money to pay estate taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there is sufficient cash held by the Trustees, the partners agree that the Trustees may loan monies to the representative of the deceased partner who have or will file Federal and State Estate Tax forms bearing interest at the then prime interest rate of Shawmut Boston plus 1%. Said loan shall be paid back to the Trust or deducted from the distributive share of said deceased partner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Termination. The partnership can be terminated by a vote of not less than 60% interest of 100% and upon such vote the partners shall so notify the Trustees to liquidate the assets and distribute the net principal and accumulated income as provided by number 8 hereunder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. Partner's Rights to Assign or Sell to Certain Individuals. Any partner shall have the right to assign or to sell any portion of his interest to his wife or his children or grandchildren, without the consent of the other partners, who may take title in their own name or a separate entity in which they will be the sole beneficiary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. Partner's Right to Assign or Sell to Others. Prior to any assignment or sale of any partner's interest or those having his interest to those than the aforesaid, the assigning or selling partner shall offer the same in writing with a certified copy of the terms offered to him by the proposed assignee or purchaser. The partners shall have thirty (30) business days to accept or reject the offer. If they do not accept the offer, the assignment or sale to the third party shall only be made with the consent of the other partners and those claiming through them which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. Voting Minors Interest. If any holder of an interest in the partnership is a minor, his interest during minority shall be voted by his father and if no father, by his mother and if no mother, by his legal guardian.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. Distribution on Termination. In the event of the dissolution and termination of the partnership, the Trustees shall be instructed to proceed to the liquidation of the partnership and the proceeds of the liquidation shall be applied and distributed in the following order of priority:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Debts. To the payment of the debts and liabilities of the partnership. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Reserves. To the setting up of any reserves which the partners may deem reasonably necessary for any contingent or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the partnership . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) Partner loans. To the repayment of any loans or advances that may have been made by any of the partners to the partnership. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) Balance. Any balance remaining shall be distributed among all partners as follows according to their percentage holding. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except as herein modified, the said partnership is hereby affirmed, dated this 11th day of March, 1987.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Modification thus specified three ways for the partners, while alive, either to terminate and liquidate the Partnership or else to transfer individual interests to others. Termination leading to liquidation could be accomplished by a 60% percent interest vote. A partner could, as of right, assign or sell any section of his interest to specified family members but could not assign or sell to any others except with the consent of the other partners after first offering them refusal rights. Several partners thereafter transferred their interests to family members, as permitted, including many of the current parties. Since the Modification, there have been no further revisions to the Partnership Agreement, and through the bringing of the present lawsuit in November 2003, the Partnership has continued to operate even though the 30-year term specified in the Partnership Agreement came to an end on January 8, 1994. As the district court found, \"Not only did the Partnership continue to manage its rental property without interruption after the 30-year term expired, but many of the plaintiffs and defendants acceded to their interest in the Partnership through assignments made after the expiration date pursuant to &#182; 5 of the Modification.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 21, 2003, Philip, Peter and Carolyn Tropeano, holding collectively a 42.86% interest in the Partnership, served written notice on the defendants that they intended to retire, effective October 1, 2003, according to the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 42. The notice stated that \"[p]ursuant to the provisions of M.G.L. Ch. 108A, Sec. 29, the change in our relationship effected by our retirement from the partnership is to be treated as dissolution of the partnership. Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 108A, Section 42, as retiring partners we wish to have the value of our interests ascertained as of the date of dissolution (that is, October 1, 2003).\" The notice stated that the retiring partners understood that a complete termination of the Partnership required a 60% vote of the partners but that after the leaving partners retired, the remaining members could also continue on as the sole partners. The letter stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that in order to terminate the partnership, a vote of 60% of the partners is required. . . . If you wish to terminate the partnership, we would participate in that vote in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs sought to be paid their respective interests of the value of the Partnership's assets. They valued their collective interest in the Partnership's assets (totaling $18.8 million) at an appraised value of $6,600,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants responded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to withdraw and receive from the Partnership the liquidation value of their respective interests in the Partnership. The defendants, however, offered to purchase the plaintiffs' minority interest for $2,750,000 under paragraph 6 of the Modification. In a letter to plaintiffs' then-counsel from counsel for defendant Charlene Dorman, the defendants explained their offer, saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">on your client's management watch, the partner distributions to your clients have averaged $174,119 over the last four years per Kennedy &amp; Kennedy's financial statements. If a yield of 6.4% on Mrs. Dorman's offer of $2,750,000 was achieved (a very reasonable figure) your clients would be in an identical pre-tax position having converted their illiquid minority interest to cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After efforts to compromise failed, plaintiffs brought this action in the district court in November of 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their initial complaint, the plaintiffs asserted a right to retire from the Partnership pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 42 and to secure the partnership accounting outlined in that provision. Defendants moved to dismiss, and plaintiffs filed an opposition, to which defendants replied. The defendants also successfully moved to disqualify the plaintiffs' counsel, who had previously represented the Partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After obtaining new counsel, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. Besides the relief originally sought, the amended complaint requested, inter alia, declaratory judgments that (1) the Partnership was a partnership at will and therefore terminable by any partner, at any time, for any reason; (2) the plaintiffs had lawfully terminated the Partnership; and (3) the plaintiffs' termination of the Partnership required the winding up of the Partnership's business, the liquidation of the Partnership's assets, and the distribution of the liquidation proceeds to the partners according to their respective partnership interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' amended complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated pleading opposing the motion to dismiss and cross-moving for summary judgment and for declaratory judgments on the three above-mentioned points on which they sought declarations. Defendants opposed the plaintiffs' cross-motion, and the plaintiffs filed a reply brief. The district court heard oral argument on December 2, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argued to the district court that the express Partnership had terminated on January 8, 1994 when the 30-year term of the Agreement had expired. Thereafter, they said, the Partnership became a partnership at will by operation of law under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 23(1), which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a partnership for a fixed term or particular undertaking is continued after the termination of such term or particular undertaking without any express agreement, the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were at such termination, so far as is consistent with a partnership at will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the plaintiffs' theory, any restrictions expressed in the Modification to the Partnership Agreement could not affect their ability to retire from, and in effect dissolve, the Partnership, since once the partnership became one at will, any partner could terminate the partnership at any time for any reason. <i>See, e.g., Meehan v. Shaughnessy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2222297\"><a href=\"/opinion/2222297/meehan-v-shaughnessy-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, 428, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2222297\"><a href=\"/opinion/2222297/meehan-v-shaughnessy-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span> (1989). Plaintiffs argued that when a partner in a partnership at will retires, his or her withdrawal triggers an accounting pursuant to the terms of the Uniform Partnership Act (\"UPA\") as codified in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants disagreed. In their view, the Modification supplanted the 30-year term with an agreement to continue the Partnership, unless or until a 60% liquidation vote was achieved. The defendants asserted that the Modification substituted a new structure for that under the old Agreement: rather than being subject to a fixed term of thirty years, the property would be maintained indefinitely under the Agreement until a dissolution occurred by a 60% vote. Alternatively, the defendants argued that even if the Partnership had become a partnership at will, no accounting was called for under &#167; 42 as the accounting provision did not come into effect if the parties had otherwise agreed to a different course of action. Thus, &#167; 42 provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]hen any partner retires or dies, and the business is continued . . . without any settlement of accounts . . . <i>unless otherwise agreed,</i> he or his legal representative as against such persons or partnership may have the value of his interest at the date of dissolution ascertained, and shall receive as an ordinary creditor an amount equal to the value of his interest in the dissolved partnership with interest . . . (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, defendants argued, the partners had, in the Modification, agreed otherwise by limiting a partner's withdrawal or retirement to the three options described therein (i.e., termination by 60% vote; assignment to a family member; or third-party sale subject to the partners' consent). Any other interpretation, the defendants said, would render meaningless the restrictions agreed to in the Modification, including the 60% termination requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, plaintiffs insisted that defendants were wrong to assert that the partners' rights upon retirement, as conferred in &#167; 42, were lessened or eliminated by something said in the Modification. They argued that there is no provision that \"otherwise agrees\" as to how a retiring partner's share is to be valued. No formula is set forth in the Modification for valuing a retiring partner's interest. Accordingly, the accounting described in &#167; 42 must be utilized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled against defendants' contention that the Modification had substituted for the 30-year term an agreement to continue the Partnership until terminated by a 60% vote. It agreed with plaintiffs that nothing in the Modification eliminated the original 30-year term, hence, after January 8, 1994, the Partnership became one at will by operation of &#167; 23(1) of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A. Nonetheless, the court found for defendants on the ultimate issue, finding the partners had \"otherwise agreed\" to a method of valuation such as defendants proposed. Because the parties had agreed upon an alternative means, the method of valuation called for in &#167; 42 of the UPA did not apply, the plaintiffs being restricted, in these circumstances, to terminating and valuing their interest pursuant to paragraph 6 of the Modification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While thus holding for the defendants, the court observed as an aside that the \"easy thing for the court to do would be to pronounce an ambiguity in the intent of the original partners in crafting the Modification and proceed to a trial.\" Nevertheless, the court found no such ambiguity, hence made no such pronouncement. As a further reason for avoiding a trial, the court noted there was no disinterested person alive who could testify as to the partners' intent in modifying the agreement. The court granted the motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question now on appeal is whether, under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 42, each of the plaintiffs is entitled to receive the full value of his or her shares in the Partnership as determined upon liquidation, or rather must accept the much-reduced value offered by the remaining partners purportedly under their powers to approve sales to third parties under paragraph 6, <i>supra,</i> of the Modification. The plaintiffs-appellants make two arguments. First, they argue that the Partnership became a partnership at will after the expiration of the 30-year term; that as partners at will they enjoyed an absolute right to dissolve the Partnership; and that nothing in the Modification constitutes an agreement otherwise for the valuing of their partnership shares upon retirement. Second, and alternatively, they argue that at the very least, the Modification is ambiguous and thus its meaning leaves a question of fact open to be decided by a jury. We agree with the first argument and therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. Nature of the Partnership</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, which the partners expressly referenced in the Partnership Agreement and which enacts the UPA, governs the formation, conduct, and liquidation of partnerships in Massachusetts. Under ch. 108A, &#167; 29, a \"change in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in the carrying on . . . of the business\" results in the dissolution of the partnership. Dissolution may occur by the express will of any partner at any time, even in contravention of the agreement between the partners, where the circumstances do not otherwise permit dissolution. Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 108A, &#167; 31(b)(2). Where, however, a partnership agreement provides that the partnership is to continue indefinitely or without the specification of a particular undertaking, and the partnership is therefore \"at will,\" a partner has the right to dissolve the partnership, and the dissolution opted for by the partner occurs \"[w]ithout violation of the agreement between the partners.\" <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 31(1). The statute further provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a dissolution is caused in any way, except in contravention of the partnership agreement, each partner, as against his co-partners and all persons claiming through them in respect of their interests in the partnership, <i>unless otherwise agreed,</i> may have the partnership property applied to discharge its liabilities, and the surplus applied to pay in cash the net amount owing to the respective partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at &#167; 38(1) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the foregoing we glean the following: if a partner withdraws from a partnership at will, thus causing its dissolution, the dissolution is not regarded in law as contravening the agreement between the partners, even if the terms of that agreement provide otherwise. Thereupon, the partner is entitled under &#167; 38(1) to his full share of the partnership net assets <i>unless otherwise agreed.</i> This contrasts with the situation in which a partner withdraws from a term or other partnership <i>not</i> at will, where the partnership agreement similarly disallows or restricts withdrawal. In the latter case (unless there are other factors), the restrictive terms of the partnership agreement may be dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, therefore, it is of considerable importance whether the Partnership here was or was not at will when plaintiffs withdrew.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> If it was at will, withdrawal was lawful, and the withdrawing partners were entitled to their net shares unless some other method of distribution could be found to have been otherwise agreed to. But if the Partnership was <i>not</i> at will, plaintiffs' right to withdraw from the enterprise was arguably barred altogether (although we need not finally decide) by paragraph 4 of the Modification, which required a 60% vote for termination, resulting in a significantly stronger argument for limiting plaintiffs to the distribution being proposed by defendants under paragraph 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, therefore, of importance to determine initially whether the Partnership was \"at will\" when the plaintiffs sought to withdraw. We turn first to that issue, answering in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. Whether when Plaintiffs Retired, the Partnership was \"At Will.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue, and the district court so found, that when the partners continued to operate the Partnership after the expiration of the original 30-year term on January 8, 1994, it ceased to be a partnership for a fixed term and became a partnership at will. They base this assertion on the language in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 23(1) that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]hen a partnership for a fixed term or particular undertaking is continued after the termination of such term or particular undertaking without any express agreement, the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were at such termination, so far as is consistent with a partnership at will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted plaintiffs' analysis, and we agree. The 30-year term was expressly provided for in the original agreement and was not mentioned, much less stricken or modified, in the Modification. The Modification states at the end that, \"[e]xcept as herein modified, the said Partnership is hereby affirmed.\" The Modification further states that its purpose is to continue the original agreement in \"full force with exception of Joseph [Tropeano's] interest.\" Defendants would nonetheless have us hold that the Modification sub silentio struck out the 30-year term. They argue that paragraph 4 of the Modification, stating in part that, \"[t]he partnership can be terminated\" by a 60% interest vote implicitly eliminated the 30-year term provision contained in the original Agreement, and substituted an agreement to continue the Partnership indefinitely unless or until a 60% liquidation vote was achieved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, however, we believe defendants' contention exceeds any reasonable reading of the relevant instruments. To adopt it would necessitate revising the plain language of both the Partnership Agreement and the Modification itself. When the Modification was executed, seven years yet remained of the 30-year term. Seven years was not such a brief remaining period as to make it unreasonable for the parties to have left intact the original 30-year term. It would have been easy enough for them to have executed an extension any time prior to January 8, 1994, in order to continue the term partnership and avoid the at-will consequences of &#167; 23(1). Had the parties intended, when they executed the Modification, to eliminate the 30-year term provision, leaving the Partnership to continue until terminated by a 60% vote, as defendants suggest, one would expect them to have so stated in the Modification, given the express affirmance therein of the original partnership, \"[e]xcept as herein modified.\" We thus affirm the district court's conclusion that the 30-year term provision forming part of the original Partnership Agreement was not deleted by the Modification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue in the alternative that, even if the 30-year term provision remained and the 30 years expired, the 60% provision made the partnership venture a \"particular undertaking,\" so as to keep the Partnership from becoming one at will under &#167; 23(1) when the 30 years was up. We disagree. The defendants rely on <i>Girard Bank v. Haley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2096543\"><a href=\"/opinion/2096543/girard-bank-v-haley/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span>, 244, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2096543\"><a href=\"/opinion/2096543/girard-bank-v-haley/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 447 (1975), to support their argument that the 60% termination provision turned the Partnership into a \"particular undertaking,\" noting that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had ruled that \"a `particular undertaking' under the statute must be capable of accomplishment at some time, although the exact time may be unknown and unascertainable at the date of the agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> The <i>Girard</i> court, however, immediately went on to undermine defendants' argument, writing of the partnership agreement at issue in that case that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he agreement contains no provision fixing a definite term, and the sole `undertaking' to which it refers is that of maintaining and leasing real property.

Business activities which may continue indefinitely are not \"particular\" in nature and do not constitute particular undertakings. <i>Miami Subs Corp. v.

The defendants rely also on <i>Osborne v. Workman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></span> (1981), for the principle that a partnership agreement which provided that it could only be \"dissolved mutually or by law\" was not terminable at will by an individual partner (though the plaintiff was permitted to withdraw from the partnership and receive the value of his partnership interest as specified in the agreement). <i>Id.</i> at 479. The analogy is tenuous at best. The <i>Osborne</i> court focused on the specific nature of the partnership, a coalition of medical doctors which had provided expressly for the valuation of a withdrawing partner's share, and emphasized the idea that partnerships among professionals often require agreements that promote continuity and longevity. Here, the partnership is not one of professionals, and there is no provision expressly for the valuation of a withdrawing partner's interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants emphasize that the Agreement as modified defines not just the particular undertaking of the management of a real estate property but also the particular undertaking that the partnership would terminate when 60% of the partnership voted to do so. As already noted above, however, the Modification explicitly stated both that the Partnership was affirmed by the Modification and that the original Agreement was to be continued in full force and effect, indicating that the 30-year term was very much alive and well through the Modification. The 60% provision &#8212; which states merely that the Partnership \"can\" be terminated by a 60% interest vote, not that this alone will allow its termination &#8212; does not replace that term either as a time limitation or a particular undertaking under the terms of Mass. Gen. Laws &#167; 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, the Partnership was an \"at will\" partnership when plaintiffs announced their decision to retire. As such, it was subject to the provisions of Massachusetts law relative to such partnerships, including the absolute right of one or more of the partners to retire and dissolve the partnership at will. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, &#167; 31(1), <i>supra. Meehan,</i> 404 Mass. at 428, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2222297\"><a href=\"/opinion/2222297/meehan-v-shaughnessy-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii.

Paragraph 6 does not, however, address the Partnership's purchase or valuation of a retiring partner's share but rather merely gives it refusal and veto rights over the sale of a partner's share to a third party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Mass.

According to defendants, only dissolution pursuant to the 60% vote in clause 4 would allow a distribution at the full valuation provided in section 42. In support of their position, defendants cite to case law. <i>See Diranian v. Diranian,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">773</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></span>, 466, 55 Mass. App.Ct. 605, 609-10 (2002) (\"Partners may use a written partnership agreement to provide for different distributions from those required pursuant to the statutory provisions of G.L. c. 108A, &#167;&#167; 29-43, in the event of a dissolution.\"); <i>Devlin v. Rockey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"255179\"><a href=\"/opinion/255179/thomas-c-devlin-md-and-i-l-schweitzer-md-v-lawrence-f-rockey/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 268 (7th Cir.1961) (\"It is implicit in Section 42 of the [Uniform Partnership Act], in the use of the words `unless otherwise agreed,' that partners may provide by agreement the amounts to be paid to retiring partners by the surviving partnership.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But while we have no doubt that, even where there exists, as here, a partnership at will, apt language in the original agreement may still control the character and amount of the distribution upon dissolution, we do not believe the cited paragraphs in the Modification, in particular paragraph 6, reflect an agreement that falls within the \"otherwise agreed\" proviso of &#167; 42. Paragraph 6 deals with a partner's limited right, while the Partnership continues, to assign or sell his interest to others than the family members cited in paragraph 5. The partner must first offer the interest to the remaining partners at presumably the same price, and if they do not accept the offer, the assignment or sale to the third party shall be made only with the partners' consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Nowhere in paragraph 6 is it suggested that that procedure is to be followed in the event an at-will partner retires, thus effecting a dissolution of the Partnership as a matter of law. The only paragraph pertaining to share valuation upon dissolution and termination of the Partnership is paragraph 8, which calls for pro-rata distribution to all partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that paragraph 4, providing for termination of the Partnership by 60% or more of the partners, does not necessarily rule out termination by other means. This may be so. But the absence of any other express avenue to terminate, coupled with the very limited options for sale or assignment of shares in paragraphs 5 and 6,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> suggest that, except for dissolution of the Partnership by a super-majority vote, no other means to withdraw or to dissolve were actively contemplated when the Modification was drafted. No right is mentioned for individual partners to opt out and sell their shares back to the remaining partners, nor is a means of valuation provided for such an occurrence. To hold that paragraph 6, which gives partners a very constricted right, subject to partnership first refusal and veto, to offer their shares to third parties, should now be read as the agreed means to value the shares of partners retiring as of right under the at will provisions of the UPA, reads more into paragraph 6 than is there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that had plaintiffs sought to retire during the 30-year term of the partnership, paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 might not have limited the valuation of their shares as now claimed. Liability in the form of reduced or even no value under paragraph 6 might, arguably, be imposed for what paragraph 4 suggests would be the premature withdrawal by partners absent the 60% vote. Once, however, the term expired and the Partnership became a partnership at will, it is considerably harder to argue that paragraph 6 can reasonably be read to serve the purpose defendants now contend. While perhaps a suitable vehicle to sharply curtail partnership withdrawal during the term of the Partnership, it is not worded as a yardstick to value the shares of retiring at-will partners, who are now legally entitled both to withdraw and to dissolve the partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the latter situation, the provisions of the Modification seem capable of only two interpretations, neither of which helps defendants. The first is that paragraph 6, by its terms, is simply irrelevant to the valuing of a retiring partner's interest here. Paragraph 6 nowhere mentions the retirement or withdrawal of a partner, much less the dissolution of the Partnership. It provides a method for a partner to sell or assign his interest to persons other than the close relatives listed in section 5: to do so, the partner must first offer his interest to the remaining partners at an equivalent price, and even if they refuse to purchase it, they may veto the sale or assignment to another, although in so doing they must act reasonably. On its face, paragraph 6 was not written so as to determine the value for purchase by the remaining partners of the interest of a partner retiring as of right. Thus we believe it cannot reasonably be interpreted as coming within the \"otherwise agreed\" language of &#167; 42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, one can, with greater confidence perhaps, read paragraph 8 of the Partnership Agreement as providing an express basis for valuing the plaintiffs' shares where plaintiffs' action has the legal effect of lawfully dissolving the Partnership.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> That paragraph says in part,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Distribution on Termination. In the event of the dissolution and termination of the partnership, the Trustees shall be instructed to proceed to the liquidation of the partnership and the proceeds of the liquidation shall be applied and distributed in the following order of priority. . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) Balance . . . to be distributed among all partners . . . according to their percentage holding . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 8 deals specifically with distribution on termination. Its method of valuation, however, appears substantially the same as that outlined in &#167; 42. While arguably intended to be used following termination by 60% vote under paragraph 4, it is not so limited by its own terms and is on its face the most relevant provision in the Modification for distribution where, as here, dissolution of the partnership at will can be and was effectuated as a matter of legal right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, given that the plaintiffs, as a matter of law, are entitled to retire and force the dissolution of the partnership at will notwithstanding their non-compliance with the 60% voting requirement of paragraph 4, we do not believe that paragraph 6, which is part of the same restricted regime imposed by paragraphs 3, 4, and 5, can reasonably be regarded as the partners' agreement for valuing plaintiffs' interests in these very different circumstances. Only by vastly stretching its language can paragraph 6 be read to govern the valuation of partners' interests in an at-will retirement situation such as the present one. We are unable to find that it reflects an express agreement to value plaintiffs' shares differently from the accounting called for in &#167; 42.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants cite a number of cases to support the proposition that the terms of a partnership agreement may trump the valuation provisions of the UPA. We do not dispute that, on appropriate facts, that is so. But all of the cited cases, save one, which we discuss below, involved agreements where there were provisions specifically governing how the partnership interest of a deceased or withdrawing partner was to be valued, which is not the case here. <i>See Devlin,</i> 295 F.2d at 267 (article providing for withdrawal of partners and division of earnings); <i>Robbins v.

It is easily distinguished from the instant case because of the unique facts in <i>Balafas</i> and because we are dealing here with a written agreement, not an implied oral partnership. The court in <i>Balafas</i> implied a contract in fact from the absence of a written partnership agreement involving two immigrant brothers who were not familiar with partnership law and, the court found, considered their property to be joint between the two of them.

We note briefly, however, our agreement with the district court that the Modification was not ambiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the intent of contracting parties is \"generally [] deemed a material issue of fact\" precluding summary dismissal. <i>Blanchard,</i> 958 F.2d at 488. <i>See also Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Dev.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"455854\"><a href=\"/opinion/455854/the-boston-five-cents-savings-bank-v-secretary-of-the-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">768</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1985) (\"an argument between parties about the meaning of a contract is typically an argument about a `material fact,' namely the factual meaning of the contract\"). Only in limited circumstances is it appropriate for a court to choose one meaning of a disputed agreement over another. Such limited circumstances occur only where \"no `reasonable person' could differ about what the contract means, either because the language is unambiguous or the supporting evidence is sufficiently one-sided.\" <i>Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank,</i> 768 F.2d at 8. On the other hand, \"the words of a contract may be so clear themselves that reasonable people could not differ over their meaning.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Modification clearly expressed the will of the partners to continue the Partnership after the death of one of the founding partners and, as part of that affirmation of the continued Partnership, expressly delineated the ways in which the Partnership and individual Partnership interests could be terminated but failed to provide a valuation provision for either dissolution prior to the 60% vote of the partnership or withdrawal. Without such a provision, the UPA valuation provisions dictate the value of the withdrawing partners' shares. The Modification is not ambiguous, and there is no occasion for a jury to resolve its meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment is therefore <i>reversed,</i> and the case remanded for further disposition in accordance herewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A more simplistic view of the difference between a partnership at will and one for a term can be drawn from<i>Black's Law Dictionary,</i> which describes a \"partnership at will\" as \"a partnership that any partner may dissolve at any time without thereby incurring liability\" and a \"partnership for a term\" as \"a partnership that exists for a specified duration or until a specified event occurs. Such a partnership can be prematurely dissolved by any partner, but that partner may be held liable for breach of the partnership agreement.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary,</i> 1153 (8th ed.2004).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Paragraph 3 of the Modification, providing for disposition of Partnership assets upon the death of a partner, set out a fourth way of disposal, albeit one presently irrelevant. It is noteworthy that the death provision is written so as to preclude termination of the Partnership. Rather the designees of the deceased will continue to hold his or her shares as members of the ongoing partnership</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Defendants make much of the fact that in the letter from their former counsel, plaintiffs initially distinguished their plans to retire from an attempt to terminate the partnership, which former counsel at one point seemed to acknowledge required the 60% vote of the partners. This statement had no binding effect on the plaintiffs, who, after they acquired new counsel, filed an amended complaint expressly seeking a declaration that they could terminate the partnership as of right. To the extent that the former counsel's letter can be interpreted to acknowledge that termination could be brought about only upon a 60% vote, it simply reflected an unrelied-upon misapprehension of the law<i>Meehan,</i> 404 Mass. at 428, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2222297\"><a href=\"/opinion/2222297/meehan-v-shaughnessy-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Section 23(1) of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A reinforces our position in this regard. It provides that, after termination of a fixed-term partnership, as here, \"the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were upon such termination,<i>so far as is consistent with a partnership at will</i>\" (emphasis added). Paragraphs 4 (super-majority can vote to dissolve) and 6 (sale of partner's interest to third party subject to partners' first refusal and veto), if applied to the valuation of an at-will partner's retirement share, may well be provisions that would <i>not</i> be consistent with a partnership at will, hence contrary to &#167; 23(1). A partner at will is legally entitled to retire without the vote of his partners and, except as otherwise agreed, to receive full value for his interest. It thus might seem questionable&#8212;although we do not decide&#8212;whether a provision like paragraph 6, tailored to the concept that a partner is not free to retire except following a super-majority vote, can properly be imposed to value a retiring at-will partner's share. Given, however, that the language of paragraph 6 does not in any event aptly apply to valuation of a partner's interest in the present situation, we need not decide the legality of such a provision were it expressly applicable.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
