Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nGreg Mack, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, and Siu P. Wong, Department of Justice, Civil Division,\nOffice of Immigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                                August 22, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            Per Curiam.   Saul Ramirez, a citizen of Guatemala, was\n\nborn in 1967 in the region of Jalapa, Guatemala.           His father was a\n\nmilitary commissioner in San Pedro Pinola performing duties on\n\nbehalf of the army.        According to Ramirez, this resulted in\n\nguerrillas targeting the family; specifically, he says that in the\n\nearly and mid-1980s, his uncle and then a cousin were murdered\n\nallegedly by guerrillas; his father received death threats; and\n\nguerrillas sprayed his house with bullets, killing a neighbor.\n\n            Shortly after this last killing in 1987, Ramirez traveled\n\nto the United States, entering illegally.              In 1996, Ramirez was\n\nconvicted of several crimes, including assault and battery by a\n\ndangerous weapon.    In 2003, he was ordered removed under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), and then sought withholding of removal on\n\ngrounds of threatened political persecution, id. § 1231(b)(3), and\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture, see 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c).\n\nFollowing   a   hearing   in   2004,   relief    was    denied   and,     after\n\nexhausting his remedies before the Board of Immigration Appeals,\n\nRamirez sought review in this court.\n\n            Because the Board affirmed summarily, we review the\n\ndecision of the Immigration Judge directly, Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396\n\nF.3d 463, 465-66 (1st Cir. 2005), and in matters such as this,\n\n\"administrative     findings   of   fact   are   conclusive      unless    any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fcontrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Estrada-Canales v. Gonzales,\n\n437 F.3d 208, 215 (1st Cir. 2006) (substantial evidence standard).\n\n           The IJ, without questioning Ramirez' credibility, found\n\nthat   Ramirez    had   established    neither       past   persecution     nor   a\n\nreasonable basis for fear of future persecution.                   We bypass the\n\nformer finding, which depends importantly on how far the threats to\n\nhis father and the violence against other family members (two\n\ndeaths and the attack on the house) can be regarded as creating a\n\nthreat to Ramirez himself that would be classed as political\n\npersecution.\n\n           Even if past persecution were assumed to have occurred in\n\nthe 1980s, this would do no more than create a presumption of\n\nfuture persecution that the government could overcome by showing\n\nthat at the present time no objective basis exists for such a\n\nthreat.    8     C.F.R.   §    1208.16(b)(1).        The    IJ   found   that   the\n\ngovernment had so proved, relying both upon facts pertinent to\n\nRamirez and upon the State Department's 2001 Country Report on\n\nHuman Rights Practices for Guatemala.            We agree that substantial\n\nevidence clearly supports the IJ's determination.\n\n           According to the country report, peace accords were\n\nsigned in 1996 between the government and the guerrillas; a party\n\nbased on the former guerrilla movement won seats in the legislature\n\nin 1999; and although progress is halting, the country report says\n\nthat   there     were     no   indications      of    politically        motivated\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdisappearances or guerrilla violence in the period reported upon.\n\nSimilar    conclusions       were    reached       in     other   cases   involving\n\nGuatemala.       See Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 35-36\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 125\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); Quevedo v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n                 Ramirez's father and mother still live in San Pedro\n\nPinola,    and    his   brother     and    sister       still   live   elsewhere   in\n\nGuatemala, all apparently unmolested.               See Aguilar-Solis v. INS,\n\n168 F.3d 565, 573 (1st Cir. 1999).              Ramirez could not say when his\n\nfather    last    received   a    threat    from    the     guerrillas;    the   last\n\nincident he cites in his testimony occurred in 1987.                       Although\n\nRamirez alleged that two men were recently killed in his village by\n\nguerrillas, he knew nothing about the circumstances of their deaths\n\nbeyond the village gossip shared with him by his mother (which did\n\nnot suggest any specific targeting of Ramirez's family).\n\n            In sum, the IJ agreed that some level of politically\n\nmotivated violence continues in Guatemala but found no objective\n\nbasis for believing that Ramirez was a target, and the record\n\nsupports that determination. As to Ramirez' alternative ground for\n\nrelief, the IJ found \"absolutely no evidence\" that Ramirez would be\n\nsubjected to torture if he were to return to Guatemala.                            The\n\npetition for review must be denied.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f",
