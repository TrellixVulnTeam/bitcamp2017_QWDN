Young, District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges,\n\n                   and Schwarzer,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Anne E. Gowen for appellant.\n     Maura D. McLaughlin, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\nBureau with whom, Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief\nfor appellees.\n\n\n                            October 29, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n     Of the      Northern     District      of    California,     sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            Schwarzer, District Judge.              Eric Williams appeals the\n\ndenial of his petition for habeas corpus.                        In his petition,\n\nWilliams claimed that his constitutionally guaranteed due process\n\nrights   were   violated     by    the    admission    of    a   letter    allegedly\n\nauthored by him, and by the prosecutor’s use and interpretation of\n\nportions of the letter.           The district court denied his petition.\n\nEven applying a standard more favorable to the petitioner than the\n\none adopted by the district court, we agree that admission of the\n\nletter was proper and affirm the judgment below.\n\n                    I.    Factual and Procedural History\n\n            We detail only those facts necessary to resolve Williams’\n\nclaim.   Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1), we presume the factual\n\nfindings of the state court to be correct.\n\n            Williams was charged in connection with a series of\n\nincidents    that    occurred       on    August     9,     1999,     in   Brockton,\n\nMassachusetts.       That    evening,      a     fistfight    broke    out   between\n\nWilliams and several other individuals. He was accused of punching\n\nTiffany Clark in the face.         Later that evening, there was a second\n\nfight, in which Williams was accused of striking Linda Burrell\n\ntwice, one time with a gun.         Subsequently, a man who police alleged\n\nwas Williams fired a gun into the ground near Burrell and her\n\nfriend, Daniel Silva.         Clark did not testify at trial about the\n\nfirst incident.          Burrell positively identified Williams as her\n\nattacker in the second incident, but she could not clearly identify\n\n\n                                         - 2 -\n\fWilliams as the shooter in the third incident.                Other prosecution\n\nwitnesses who identified Williams as the shooter were problematic,\n\none suffering from limited perception of the incident and the other\n\nsuffering from credibility issues.\n\n            Williams was convicted of four of the six assault and\n\nbattery and weapons related charges in Massachusetts Superior Court\n\nfor Plymouth County.           One of the prosecution’s key pieces of\n\nevidence was a letter allegedly authored by Williams while he was\n\nincarcerated awaiting trial.           The letter was addressed to a friend\n\nof Williams’, but was returned to the correctional facility because\n\nthe   addressee     was   unknown.       In    compliance      with   established\n\npolicies, jail authorities treated the letter as incoming mail, and\n\nopened it because of safety concerns raised by gang symbols on the\n\noutside of the envelope.\n\n            The letter was written largely in slang and contained\n\nnumerous    references    to    drug    use    and   gang    membership.        More\n\nimportantly, it asked the recipient to intimidate Tanya Ross, a\n\nwitness expected to testify for the prosecution, and to try to\n\ninfluence a co-defendant not to accept a plea bargain.                     Defense\n\ncounsel moved to exclude the letter.            The trial court admitted it,\n\nreasoning    that    although    the     letter      was    prejudicial    to   the\n\ndefendant, it was also highly probative of consciousness of guilt.\n\nThe judge ordered that portions of the letter relating to gang\n\nmembership and some mentions of drug use be redacted.\n\n\n                                       - 3 -\n\f           The redacted letter was read to the jury twice during the\n\ncourse of the trial.    The prosecutor displayed an enlargement of\n\nthe two-page letter during his closing argument and referenced\n\npassages several times.      Additionally, the prosecutor suggested\n\nthat the jury should interpret a phrase in the letter – “blaze for\n\nme” – to mean “shoot for me”.\n\n           The jury convicted Williams of assault and battery and\n\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon on Burrell, unlawful\n\npossession of a firearm, and unlawful discharge of a firearm.        He\n\nwas acquitted of the two other charges, assault and battery on\n\nClark and assault with intent to murder Silva.       Williams’ motion\n\nfor a new trial was denied, and he was sentenced to nine to ten\n\nyears in prison.\n\n           The   Massachusetts   Appeals   Court   affirmed   Williams’\n\nconviction and the denial of his motion for new trial.        He filed a\n\nmotion for further appellate review with the Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial Court, which was denied without opinion.       Williams then\n\nfiled a petition for habeas corpus in the district court, claiming\n\nthat the admission of the letter was so prejudicial that it\n\nviolated his constitutionally guaranteed due process rights.        The\n\npetition was denied, and this timely appeal followed.\n\n                       II.   Standard of Review\n\n           We review the district court’s denial of habeas corpus de\n\nnovo.   Norton v. Spencer, 351 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\f           The standard of review applied by federal courts in a\n\nhabeas    corpus    case    depends     on     whether    the    petitioner’s\n\nconstitutional claim was adjudicated by the state court. Under the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”), 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254, if the state court decided Williams’ constitutional claim,\n\nhe is entitled to habeas relief only if the proceeding 1) “resulted\n\nin a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established federal law, as determined by\n\nthe Supreme Court of the United States,” or 2) “resulted in a\n\ndecision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the\n\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the state court\n\nproceedings.” 28 U.S.C. §      2254(d).\n\n           If, however, the petitioner’s federal constitutional\n\nclaim was raised in the state courts but remained unresolved, we\n\napply a de novo standard.       Lynch v. Ficco, 438 F.3d 35, 44 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).     Under this standard, Williams’ petition should be\n\ngranted   if   he   can   demonstrate   that    the   erroneously   admitted\n\nevidence so infused the proceeding with inflammatory prejudice that\n\nit rendered a fair trial impossible.         Petrillo v. O’Neil, 428 F.3d\n\n41, 44 n.2 (1st. Cir. 2005).\n\n           The Commonwealth contends that Williams’ federal claim\n\nwas   effectively    adjudicated   by    the    state    court   because   the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court applied prejudicial error analysis, a\n\nstandard that was at least as favorable to Williams as the federal\n\n\n                                   - 5 -\n\fstandard.      McCambridge   v.    Hall,    303    F.3d   24,   35   (1st   Cir.\n\n2002)(holding that if a state case explicitly states that the state\n\nstandard is more favorable to the defendant than the federal\n\nstandard, the federal claim is considered adjudicated below when\n\nthe state standard is applied).\n\n            The Appeals Court found that admission of the letter and\n\nthe   prosecutor’s    statements    about    the    letter   was     not   error.\n\nCommonwealth v. Williams, No. 02-P-640, 2005 WL 955049, at *2-3\n\n(Mass.App.Ct. April 26, 2005).        The Commonwealth argues that the\n\ncourt     applied    prejudicial    error     analysis,      which     examines\n\nerroneously admitted evidence to be “sure that the error did not\n\ninfluence the jury, or had but very slight effect.”                Commonwealth\n\nv. Alphas, 430 Mass. 8, 13-14 n.7 (1999),(quoting Commonwealth v.\n\nFlebotte, 417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994)).             Finding that admission of\n\nthe letter was not error, the court did not proceed to the second\n\nprong of the analysis to determine if the error influenced the\n\njury.\n\n            The petitioner contends that the state courts did not\n\naddress his federal claim, and that he is entitled to de novo\n\nreview.    He argues that the court did not mention his federal due\n\nprocess claim in its analysis of the admissibility of the letter,\n\nand that the court’s statements summarily rejecting the alleged\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 6 -\n\fevidentiary error did not adequately address the issue.1\n\n          The Appeals Court’s discussion of the admission of the\n\nletter and the prosecutor’s statements about it are indeed brief\n\nand do not explicitly discuss the petitioner’s federal claim.\n\nAdditionally, it is unclear what standard the court applied in\n\nevaluating Williams’ claims. In finding that the admission of the\n\nletter was not error, however, the court likely applied a standard\n\nmore favorable than the federal standard.     Nonetheless, because\n\npetitioner’s claim fails even under the more favorable de novo\n\nstandard articulated in Petrillo, we apply this standard without\n\ndeciding whether de novo review is in fact required.   428 F.3d at\n\n44 n.2.\n\n                         III. Discussion\n\n          In Petrillo, we held that for an evidentiary error to\n\ndeprive a defendant of his constitutionally guaranteed due process\n\nrights and provide a basis for habeas relief, the “error must so\n\ninfuse the trial with inflammatory prejudice that it renders a fair\n\n\n     1\n      In discussing the admission of the letter, the Appeals Court\nstated:\n     Further, we see no merit to the defendant’s claim that\n     the letter was inadmissible in that its contents\n     portrayed him in a poor light, suggested an additional\n     uncharged crime, and were unduly exacerbated by the\n     prosecutor’s use of a blow up copy of the letter during\n     closing argument.    See and contrast Commonwealth v.\n     Hoppin, 387 Mass. 25, 30, 438 N.E.2d 820 (1982). See\n     also Commonwealth v. Helfant, 398 Mass. 214, 224-225, 496\n     N.E.2d 433 (1986); Commonwealth v. Babbitt, 430 Mass.\n     700, 704 (2000).\n  Williams, 2005 WL 955049, at *2-3.\n\n                              - 7 -\n\ftrial impossible.”    428 F.3d at 44 n.2.     In this case, unlike in\n\nPetrillo, the Appeals Court found that the admission of the letter\n\nas well as the prosecutor’s use of an enlargement of the letter and\n\nhis comments about it did not constitute error.       Williams, 2005 WL\n\n955049, at *2-3.   As the district court notes, the trial court made\n\na careful and detailed ruling in admitting the letter.           The court\n\nreasoned that although prejudice to Williams was necessarily a\n\nbyproduct of admission, the high probative value of the letter\n\noutweighed any prejudice.      Additionally, the trial court took\n\nnumerous steps to decrease potential prejudice to Williams.           The\n\ncourt redacted the letter to remove several gang and drug use\n\nreferences.    The   court   also   offered   to   provide   a   limiting\n\ninstruction to the jury on consciousness of guilt, which Williams’\n\ntrial counsel declined, viewing it as a “double edged sword.”\n\nAdditionally, as the Appeals Court notes, even if the prosecutor’s\n\nbrief statement interpreting the phrase “blaze for me” to mean\n\n“shoot for me” in the letter was incorrect, the judge instructed\n\nthe jury that closing arguments are not evidence in the case.\n\nWilliams, 2005 WL 955049, at *2.    Therefore, because the admission\n\nof the letter was not error, petitioner necessarily fails to meet\n\nthe high bar set in Petrillo to demonstrate that an error amounted\n\nto a violation of constitutionally protected due process rights.\n\n          Even if we were to assume that the admission and use of\n\nthe letter was error, however, Williams’ habeas petition would\n\n\n                                - 8 -\n\fstill fail.    As discussed above, Williams was charged with six\n\ncounts of assault and battery and weapons related charges against\n\nthree different individuals.         He was convicted of the assault on\n\nLinda Burrell, where Burrell was able to provide a clear positive\n\nidentification, and acquitted for the alleged assault on Clark and\n\nSilva, in which either no identification was provided, or the\n\nidentification was less reliable.            This careful evaluation of the\n\nevidence supporting each of the charges indicates that the jury\n\nacted in a rational and deliberative manner, and was not so\n\ninflamed by prejudice that they were not able to fulfill their\n\nneutral fact finding role.      Therefore, even assuming that Williams\n\nis entitled to de novo review, and that the admission and use of\n\nthe letter was error, he has still not demonstrated that it was an\n\nerror of constitutional magnitude that deprived him of due process\n\nand entitles him to habeas relief.        Fortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39,\n\n48 (1st Cir. 2001) (“the Supreme Court adopted a different test for\n\nhabeas more favorable to the prosecution, namely, that the error\n\n(constitutional     or   not)   is   harmless     if   it   did    not    have   a\n\nsubstantial   and   injurious    effect      or   influence   on    the   jury’s\n\nverdict.”).\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 9 -\n\f",

Under the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”), 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254, if the state court decided Williams’ constitutional claim,\n\nhe is entitled to habeas relief only if the proceeding 1) “resulted\n\nin a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established federal law, as determined by\n\nthe Supreme Court of the United States,” or 2) “resulted in a\n\ndecision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the\n\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the state court\n\nproceedings.” 28 U.S.C. §      2254(d).\n\n           If, however, the petitioner’s federal constitutional\n\nclaim was raised in the state courts but remained unresolved, we\n\napply a de novo standard.

April 26, 2005).        The Commonwealth argues that the\n\ncourt     applied    prejudicial    error     analysis,      which     examines\n\nerroneously admitted evidence to be “sure that the error did not\n\ninfluence the jury, or had but very slight effect.”                Commonwealth\n\nv.

Finding that admission of\n\nthe letter was not error, the court did not proceed to the second\n\nprong of the analysis to determine if the error influenced the\n\njury.\n\n            The petitioner contends that the state courts did not\n\naddress his federal claim, and that he is entitled to de novo\n\nreview.    He argues that the court did not mention his federal due\n\nprocess claim in its analysis of the admissibility of the letter,\n\nand that the court’s statements summarily rejecting the alleged\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 6 -\n\fevidentiary error did not adequately address the issue.1\n\n          The Appeals Court’s discussion of the admission of the\n\nletter and the prosecutor’s statements about it are indeed brief\n\nand do not explicitly discuss the petitioner’s federal claim.\n\nAdditionally, it is unclear what standard the court applied in\n\nevaluating Williams’ claims. In finding that the admission of the\n\nletter was not error, however, the court likely applied a standard\n\nmore favorable than the federal standard.     Nonetheless, because\n\npetitioner’s claim fails even under the more favorable de novo\n\nstandard articulated in Petrillo, we apply this standard without\n\ndeciding whether de novo review is in fact required.   428 F.3d at\n\n44 n.2.\n\n                         III.

In this case, unlike in\n\nPetrillo, the Appeals Court found that the admission of the letter\n\nas well as the prosecutor’s use of an enlargement of the letter and\n\nhis comments about it did not constitute error.

As the district court notes, the trial court made\n\na careful and detailed ruling in admitting the letter.           The court\n\nreasoned that although prejudice to Williams was necessarily a\n\nbyproduct of admission, the high probative value of the letter\n\noutweighed any prejudice.      Additionally, the trial court took\n\nnumerous steps to decrease potential prejudice to Williams.           The\n\ncourt redacted the letter to remove several gang and drug use\n\nreferences.    The   court   also   offered   to   provide   a   limiting\n\ninstruction to the jury on consciousness of guilt, which Williams’\n\ntrial counsel declined, viewing it as a “double edged sword.”\n\nAdditionally, as the Appeals Court notes, even if the prosecutor’s\n\nbrief statement interpreting the phrase “blaze for me” to mean\n\n“shoot for me” in the letter was incorrect, the judge instructed\n\nthe jury that closing arguments are not evidence in the case.\n\nWilliams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">955049</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2.    Therefore, because the admission\n\nof the letter was not error, petitioner necessarily fails to meet\n\nthe high bar set in Petrillo to demonstrate that an error amounted\n\nto a violation of constitutionally protected due process rights.\n\n          Even if we were to assume that the admission and use of\n\nthe letter was error, however, Williams’ habeas petition would\n\n\n                                - 8 -\n\fstill fail.    As discussed above, Williams was charged with six\n\ncounts of assault and battery and weapons related charges against\n\nthree different individuals.         He was convicted of the assault on\n\nLinda Burrell, where Burrell was able to provide a clear positive\n\nidentification, and acquitted for the alleged assault on Clark and\n\nSilva, in which either no identification was provided, or the\n\nidentification was less reliable.            This careful evaluation of the\n\nevidence supporting each of the charges indicates that the jury\n\nacted in a rational and deliberative manner, and was not so\n\ninflamed by prejudice that they were not able to fulfill their\n\nneutral fact finding role.      Therefore, even assuming that Williams\n\nis entitled to de novo review, and that the admission and use of\n\nthe letter was error, he has still not demonstrated that it was an\n\nerror of constitutional magnitude that deprived him of due process\n\nand entitles him to habeas relief.
