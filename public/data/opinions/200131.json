Brian Dasey (\"Dasey\") was\n\nemployed as a state trooper by the Massachusetts Department of\n\nState Police (\"MSP\" or \"State Police\").         Before his probationary\n\nperiod    expired,    he   was   discharged    for   making   a   material\n\nmisstatement in his employment application.           Dasey filed suit,\n\nasserting violations of the Massachusetts right-of-privacy law,\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, § 1B; the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983; and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 12, § 11H.    The district court granted summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the defendants on all counts, and Dasey filed a timely\nappeal.   We affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n           The critical facts are not contested.        After completing\nhis training at the State Police Academy, Dasey was enlisted as a\n\nuniformed member of the State Police on August 27, 1999.            During\nthe initial application process to become a state trooper, Dasey\naffirmatively represented that he did not use illegal drugs and,\n\nduring the preceding five-year period, had not \"used, possessed,\nsupplied or manufactured any illegal drugs.\"           On September 14,\n1999, while Dasey was still serving in a probationary status,1 MSP\n\nDeputy Superintendent Glenn Anderson was given a videotape that had\nbeen seized by state troopers while executing a search warrant in\n\n\n     1\n      Rule 7.1.3 of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts State Police\nRules and Regulations (\"MSP Rules\") provides: \"During the first\ntwelve months following a member's initial enlistment, members\nshall be retained on a probationary status.            During the\nprobationary period, the Colonel/Superintendent may, as allowed by\nlaw, discharge any member.\"\n\n                                    -2-\n\fan unrelated homicide investigation.         The videotape showed Dasey\n\nand others apparently smoking marijuana.\n\n          After reviewing the videotape, Anderson and appellees\nJohn DiFava, Joseph McLaughlin, and Paul L. Regan, all senior State\n\nPolice officers, concluded that Dasey had been caught on videotape\n\nusing an illegal drug and, therefore, had necessarily made a false\nmaterial statement     when   he   denied   prior     drug   use   during   the\n\napplication process.    Anderson summoned Dasey to MSP headquarters,\n\nwhere he was met by an attorney provided by the troopers' union,\n\nthe State Police Association of Massachusetts (\"SPAM\").             Dasey and\n\nthe union attorney then met with Anderson.\n\n          Anderson     told    Dasey      that   he    had    evidence      (or\n\ninformation)2 that Dasey had used an illegal drug and had falsely\ndenied doing so during the employment application process.               Dasey\n\nwas offered an opportunity to resign in lieu of discharge.3                  He\n\nrefused and was thereupon dismissed.         Dasey was awarded a general\ndischarge, executed by DiFava in his capacity as Colonel and\n\nSuperintendent, which read, in its entirety, as follows:                    \"In\n\n     2\n        Anderson does not recall whether he disclosed the\nvideotape's existence to Dasey and his union attorney at the\ninitial meeting, but he did play the videotape for the union\nattorney after Dasey was formally discharged.\n     3\n       Four different types of discharge are available to members\nof the State Police: (1) an \"honorable discharge,\" which may be\ngiven upon retirement; (2) an \"ordinary discharge,\" which may be\ngiven to a trooper who resigns at his or her own request, under\nhonorable conditions; (3) a \"general discharge,\" which shall be\ngiven to a trooper who does not qualify for either an honorable or\nan ordinary discharge; and (4) a \"dishonorable discharge,\" which\nmay be given to a trooper who is dismissed pursuant to an\nadministrative hearing, or after having waived the right to such a\nhearing.\n\n                                    -3-\n\faccordance with the Rules and Regulations governing the Department\n\nof State Police, the below named officer is hereby given a GENERAL\n\nDISCHARGE    effective    as   of       the    close   of    business     on   Tuesday,\nSeptember 14, 1999.\"\n\n                                          II.\n\n            Dasey's amended complaint contained six counts.                     Counts\nI, II, and III asserted claims for invasion of privacy, brought\n\nunder Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, § 1B, against various defendants.\n\nCount IV described a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, based upon\n\nalleged violations of Dasey's federal constitutional rights to\n\nprivacy and due process, as well as deprivation of a property right\n\nin continued employment allegedly established by Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 268, § 13B.          The due process claim in Count IV alleged\ndeprivation of both a property interest in continued employment and\n\na reputation-based liberty interest.                   Dasey contended that his\n\nproperty interest in continued employment entitled him to a pre-\ntermination hearing, while his liberty interest entitled him to a\n\npost-termination name-clearing hearing.                 Count V asserted a second\n\n§   1983   claim,   involving       a    due    process      violation    related     to\n\ndeprivation    of   a   property        interest,      and   Count   VI    asserted    a\n\nviolation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.                     Because Dasey's\n\namended complaint dropped the MSP as a defendant, and names the\n\nremaining defendants only in their individual capacities, neither\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment nor principles of sovereign immunity present\n\nany obstacles to Dasey's claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f           The district court granted defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment as to Counts I, II, III, and the invasion of privacy claim\n\nin Count IV.     The court ruled that Dasey failed to allege that\ndefendants disclosed any facts that would qualify as \"private\" for\n\npurposes of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, § 1B, an essential element of\n\nthe cause of action, and, alternatively, that Dasey failed to show\nthat defendants acted unreasonably in reviewing the videotape, or\n\nin taking action against him based on its content.               The district\n\ncourt also granted defendants' motion for summary judgment as to\n\nCounts V and VI, and the due process claim in Count IV, on grounds\n\nthat   Dasey,    as    a   probationary    trooper,     had   no    reasonable\n\nexpectation     that   his   employment    would      continue     and,   as   a\n\nconsequence, had no constitutionally protected property interest in\nhis job, or concomitant due process rights, at the time he was\n\ndischarged.     The district court did not directly address Dasey's\n\nclaim that he was entitled to a name-clearing hearing to protect a\nreputation-based liberty interest.\n\n                                    III.\n\n           We review the district court's ruling on summary judgment\n\nde novo.   Pure Distribs., Inc. v. Baker, 285 F.3d 150, 154 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (citation omitted).       We may affirm the entry of summary\n\njudgment \"on any ground revealed by the record.\" Houlton Citizens'\n\nCoalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate when the record reveals \"no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"        Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fWhen ruling    upon    a   party's   motion      for   summary      judgment,   the\n\ndistrict court must \"scrutinize the summary judgment record 'in the\n\nlight most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment,\nindulging   all   reasonable      inferences     in    that    party's   favor.'\"\n\nNavarro v. Pfizer Corp., 261 F.3d 90, 94 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting\n\nGriggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n            This appeal presents three basic issues; two are rather\n\nstraightforward, and one is slightly more complicated.                   We begin\n\nwith the less complicated matters -- Dasey's privacy and liberty-\n\ninterest claims -- and end with his asserted right to a pre-\n\ntermination hearing.\n\n                             A.   Privacy Interest\n\n            Massachusetts recognizes an actionable right of privacy.\nThe applicable statute provides that \"[a] person shall have a right\n\nagainst unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his\nprivacy.\"    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, § 1B.              Section 1B protects\npeople from \"disclosure of facts . . . that are of a highly\n\npersonal or intimate nature when there exists no legitimate,\ncountervailing interest.\"         Bratt v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 392\n\nMass. 508, 467 N.E.2d 126, 133-34 (1984) (citations omitted); see\n\nalso French v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 2 F. Supp. 2d 128, 131\n(D. Mass.    1998)    (\"To    constitute    an    invasion     of    privacy,   the\ninvasion must be both unreasonable and serious or substantial.\")\n\n(citation omitted).        Massachusetts does not recognize a cause of\naction for false light invasion of privacy.                   Canney v. City of\n\nChelsea, 925 F. Supp. 58, 70 (D. Mass. 1996) (citing ELM Med. Lab.,\n\n                                      -6-\n\fInc. v. RKO Gen., Inc., 403 Mass. 779, 532 N.E.2d 675, 681 (1989)).\n\nRather, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, § 1B is typically invoked to\n\nremedy \"the gathering and dissemination of information which the\nplaintiffs contended was private.\"        Schlesinger v. Merrill Lynch,\n\nPierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 409 Mass. 514, 567 N.E.2d 912, 914\n\nn.4 (1991) (citations omitted).\n          As the district court correctly decided, Counts I, II,\n\nand III of the complaint fail, as a matter of law.          Neither the\n\ncomplaint nor Dasey's objection to summary judgment identified any\n\nfacts at all, and certainly no highly personal or intimate facts,\n\nabout Dasey that were either gathered or disseminated by any\n\ndefendant.\n\n          As for the personal or intimate nature of the allegedly\nprivate   facts   disclosed   in    the    videotape,   French   plainly\n\nestablishes that activity in the presence of others who owe no duty\n\nof confidentiality -- a category which includes the subject matter\nof the videotape -- is hardly \"private.\"      See French, 2 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 131.   Likewise, the \"gathering and dissemination\" element has\n\nnot been met.     Dasey neither alleged, nor produced any evidence\n\nthat suggested, that any defendant made or distributed the tape; he\n\nonly alleged that defendants watched it.4\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       Dasey argues that summary judgment should not have been\nentered against him without first affording him an opportunity to\nengage in discovery. But he cannot show how discovery would have\nmade any difference in establishing the private nature of the facts\ndisclosed -- i.e., the activity captured on tape. The content of\nthe tape is undisputed.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f              Even if Dasey had been able to satisfy the \"gathering and\n\ndissemination\" and \"private facts\" elements of his claim under\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, § 1B, that still would not have been\nenough   to    survive     summary    judgment.          To    be     actionable,    the\n\ngathering      and    dissemination       of    private       facts    must   also    be\n\nunreasonable. When determining the reasonableness of an intrusion,\nan \"employer's legitimate interest in determining the employees'\n\neffectiveness        in   their    jobs   should    be    balanced       against     the\n\nseriousness of the intrusion on the employees' privacy.\"                      O'Connor\n\nv. Police Comm'r of Boston, 408 Mass. 324, 557 N.E.2d 1146, 1150\n\n(1990) (quoting Bratt, 467 N.E.2d at 135) (holding that police\n\ndepartment's \"compelling interest in determining whether cadets\n\nwere using drugs\" outweighed cadets' privacy interest in avoiding\nunannounced     urinalysis        tests   for   which     sample       collection    was\n\nmonitored by police personnel). Here, defendants' modest intrusion\n\ninto Dasey's privacy (if reviewing the seized videotape evidence\nconstituted an intrusion at all) was entirely reasonable in light\n\nof their compelling interest in verifying the truthfulness of his\n\nprior assurances regarding illegal drug use.5\n\n     5\n       As stated earlier, Dasey does not allege that any defendant\nactively pried into his personal life. Instead, his privacy claims\nappear to rest upon a contention that defendants somehow owed him\na duty to look away when his image appeared on the seized\nvideotape. Furthermore, because Dasey does not allege that the\nvideotape was created in aid of a grand jury investigation, his\nargument that grand jury secrecy rules somehow were violated also\nfails; his reliance on In re Doe Grand Jury Investigation, 415\nMass. 727, 615 N.E.2d 567 (1993) is, therefore, misplaced. See\nalso WBZ-TV4 v. Dist. Att'y for the Suffolk Dist., 408 Mass. 595,\n562 N.E.2d 817, 821 (1990) (\"the videotape has the characteristics\nof material especially prepared for the grand jury which, when\nreceived by them, should ordinarily be protected by the rule of\n\n                                          -8-\n\f            In sum, Dasey's privacy claims fail in three ways. Given\n\nthe allegations in his complaint, the factual assertions in his\n\nobjection    to    summary    judgment,         and    his    failure       to    identify\npertinent    information     that     might       have    been     developed       through\n\ndiscovery, this case involves: (1) no \"private\" facts of any sort;\n\n(2)   no    acts    constituting          \"gathering         or    dissemination\"        by\ndefendants; and (3) no unreasonable conduct on defendants' part.\n\nAccordingly, the district court's entry of judgment in favor of\n\ndefendants on Dasey's state-law privacy claims (Counts I, II, and\n\nIII) is affirmed.\n\n            In Count IV Dasey asserted a claim based upon his federal\n\nconstitutional right to privacy.                  However, we are aware of no\n\nconstitutional principle that would bar defendants from, as Dasey\nputs it, \"using information concerning [his] private life as the\n\nbasis for terminating [his] employment.\"                  Because that allegation\n\nis the sole basis upon which Dasey rests his federal constitutional\nprivacy claim, the district court's entry of judgment as to that\n\naspect of Count IV is affirmed as well.\n\n                             B.   Liberty Interest\n\n            Dasey   included      a   §    1983       claim   in    Count    IV    of   the\n\ncomplaint, in which he asserted the deprivation of a reputation-\nbased liberty interest, occasioned by defendants' refusal to grant\nhim a post-termination name-clearing hearing.                      In their motion for\n\nsummary     judgment,   defendants          specifically           addressed       Dasey's\n\n\n\ngrand jury secrecy\").\n\n                                          -9-\n\fliberty-interest claim.      Dasey, however, did not respond, not even\n\nto the extent of arguing, as he does now on appeal, that summary\n\njudgment would be inappropriate due to the limitations placed on\ndiscovery.     Given his failure to press the issue in the district\n\ncourt, defendants say he has forfeited it.         We need not dwell on\n\nwhether Dasey has or has not forfeited the issue, however, because\nwe affirm the district court's entry of judgment based upon Dasey's\n\nfailure to plead a cognizable § 1983 claim arising from the\n\ndeprivation of a liberty interest.\n\n             A public employer's action may deprive an employee of a\n\nconstitutionally       protected   liberty   interest   in   his    or   her\n\nreputation under circumstances first identified in Paul v. Davis,\n\n424 U.S. 693, 710-12 (1976).       This court\n          interpreted [Paul's] requirements in Beitzell\n          v. Jeffrey, 643 F.2d 870 (1st Cir. 1981),\n          stating   that   \"the   Fourteenth   Amendment\n          procedurally protects reputation only where\n          (1) government action threatens it, (2) with\n          unusually serious harm, (3) as evidenced by\n          the fact that employment (or some other right\n          or status) is affected.\" Id. at 878 (footnote\n          and citations omitted).        Moreover, the\n          municipality terminating the employee must\n          also be responsible for the dissemination of\n          defamatory charges, in a formal setting (and\n          not merely as the result of unauthorized\n          \"leaks\"), and thereby significantly have\n          interfered with the employee's ability to find\n          future employment. Id. at 879.\n\nSilva v. Worden, 130 F.3d 26, 32-33 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that\n\nunder   both     the    federal    constitution   and   more       favorable\n\nMassachusetts state law, directed verdict for defendant employer\n\nwas appropriate when plaintiff produced no evidence that defendant\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fdisseminated    information         about    the    reasons    for   plaintiff's\n\ntermination).\n\n           Here,     Dasey    has    not    alleged    any     communication    by\ndefendants of the charges against him, other than statements made\n\ndirectly to him at MSP headquarters on September 14, 1999.                     His\n\ngeneral discharge does not recite the grounds for dismissal, and\nnothing he presented to the district court suggests any other\n\ndisclosures by defendants.           Absent dissemination -- the means by\n\nwhich an employee's reputation might be threatened with serious\n\nharm -- a terminated public employee has no constitutional right to\n\na name-clearing hearing.          Because Dasey did not allege, or present\n\nany evidence of, conduct by defendants that, if proven, would\n\nconstitute a deprivation of any constitutionally protected liberty\ninterest, the district court's entry of judgment in favor of\n\ndefendants on that aspect of Count IV is affirmed.\n\n                             C.   Property Interest\n\n           What remains, then, is Dasey's claim that he was denied\n\ndue process when he was summarily discharged by Colonel DiFava, the\nMSP Superintendent.      The issue before us is whether the district\ncourt   erred   in   deciding       that    Dasey   had   no    constitutionally\n\nprotected property interest in his continued employment, and,\ntherefore, was afforded all the process due him as a probationary\nemployee when the Superintendent summarily discharged him after\n\nconcluding he had made a material misstatement of fact related to\nprior drug use.\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f            Dasey contends that, notwithstanding his probationary\n\nstatus, he was entitled to a pre-termination hearing because: (1)\n\nthe statute granting the right to a pre-termination hearing to\ntroopers who have completed the one-year probationary period, Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 22C, § 13, does not expressly preclude extension of\n\nthat right to probationary troopers; (2) Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 150E\nrequires the MSP, as a public employer, to bargain with SPAM over\n\nworking conditions, including employee discipline; and (3) the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") negotiated by the MSP and\n\nSPAM includes a bargained-for extension of the right to a pre-\n\ntermination hearing to all troopers, probationary and veteran\n\nalike, a provision that overrides the MSP rule subjecting first-\n\nyear troopers to summary discharge. He further argues that even if\nhe was not entitled to a pre-termination hearing under the CBA, he\n\nstill had a reasonable expectation of continued employment (and\n\nthus   a   protected    property   interest   and   the   right   to   a   pre-\ntermination hearing) based upon the customs and practices of the\n\nMSP.   Finally he says that the district court's resolution of that\n\ndisputed fact-bound issue (i.e., whether a custom or practice of\n\ngranting     hearings     to   probationary     troopers     existed)       was\n\ninappropriate on summary judgment.\n\n            To prevail on his § 1983 claim Dasey must establish that\n\ndefendants deprived him of a constitutional right, in this case,\n\nhis property interest in continued employment, without due process.\n\n                   It is well established that a public\n            employee has a constitutionally protected\n            property interest in his continued employment\n            when he reasonably expects that his employment\n\n                                    -12-\n\f            will continue.    Cummings v. South Portland\n            Hous. Auth., 985 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1993).\n            An employee who can only be dismissed for\n            cause has such an expectation. Id. An at-\n            will employee, however, has no reasonable\n            expectation of continued employment.      Id.\n            Whether   an   employment   contract   allows\n            dismissal only for cause is a matter of state\n            law. Id.\n\nKing v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965, 969 (1st Cir. 1997).\nFurthermore, \"an employer's unilateral declarations, promises, or\n\nconduct regarding conditions of continued employment might in some\n\ncircumstances create a 'legitimate claim of entitlement to job\n\ntenure.'\"    Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 55\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 602\n\n(1972)) (holding that written assurances in letter of engagement\n\nwere   insufficient   to   contravene   a   \"comprehensive   network   of\nstatutory and regulatory directives governing the terms of . . .\n\nemployment\").\n\n            The terms of Dasey's employment are not set out in any\nsingle document, but are found in three places:         (1) Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 22C; (2) MSP Rules; and (3) the CBA.      Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n22C, § 13 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n            Any uniformed member of the state police who\n            has served for one year or more and against\n            whom charges have been preferred shall be\n            tried by a board to be appointed by the\n            colonel or, at the request of the officer, may\n            be tried by a board consisting of the colonel.\n\nThe MSP Rules, promulgated by the Colonel/Superintendent, under the\n\nauthority of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, § 10, contain two provisions\n\nrelating to a trooper's right to a pre-termination hearing.        Rule\n\n6.5.1 mirrors Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, § 13, in providing that \"[a]\n\n                                 -13-\n\fmember who has served for one year or more and has been formally\n\ncharged in accordance with Department Rules and Regulations shall\n\nbe   tried    by   a   State   Police   Trial   Board   appointed   by   the\nColonel/Superintendent.\"        In contrast, Rule 7.1.3, quoted above,\n\nexplicitly provides that a uniformed member of the State Police who\n\nhas served for less than one year is on probationary status, and\n\nmay be discharged by the Superintendent without any pre-termination\n\nhearing.\n\n             As noted, the third source describing terms of Dasey's\n\nemployment is the CBA, which provides, in part, as follows:\n\n             Except as otherwise limited by an express\n             provision of this Agreement, the Employer\n             shall have the right to exercise complete\n             control and discretion over its organization\n             and technology, including but not limited to,\n             the determination of the standards of services\n             to be provided and standards of productivity\n             and   performance    of    its     employees;   the\n             establishment and/or revision of personnel\n             evaluation programs; the determination of the\n             methods, means and personnel by which its\n             operations    are    to     be     conducted;   the\n             determination     of    the     content    of   job\n             classifications; the appointment, promotion,\n             assignment,    direction       and    transfer   of\n             personnel;    the     suspension[,]       demotion,\n             discharge, or any other appropriate action\n             against its employees with just cause; the\n             relief from duty of its employees because of\n             lack of work or for other legitimate reasons;\n             the establishment of reasonable work rules;\n             and the taking of all necessary actions to\n             carry out its mission in emergencies.\n\n(emphasis supplied).      The quoted language is found in a section of\nthe CBA entitled \"Article 2 -- Managerial Rights/Productivity.\"\n\n             As between the CBA and MSP Rules, the parties agree that\n\nin case of conflict, the CBA controls.          Indeed, Article 3 of the\n\n                                    -14-\n\fCBA confirms that \"[i]f this Agreement contains a conflict between\n\nmatters covered by this Agreement and the Rules and Regulations of\n\nthe Massachusetts Department of State Police the terms of this\nAgreement shall prevail.\" Similarly, the MSP Rules are prefaced by\n\na notice stating that \"[t]he Massachusetts State Police Rules and\n\nRegulations do NOT supersede any contractual agreements between the\n\nCommonwealth and the members of the State Police, law, or Executive\n\nOrder as   promulgated       by    the    Governor   of   the     Commonwealth   of\n\nMassachusetts.\"\n\n           At   the   time    of    his    discharge,     Dasey    was   not   \"[a]n\n\nemployee who [could] only [have been] dismissed for cause.\"                    King,\n\n116 F.3d at 969.      Plainly, neither Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, § 13\n\nnor the MSP Rules grant probationary employees like Dasey any right\nto be discharged only \"for cause.\"              If Dasey had such a right, it\n\ncould have arisen only from the cryptic phrase, \"with just cause,\"\n\nfound in Article 2 of the CBA.\n           The CBA is a contract, subject to construction under\n\nMassachusetts law, which provides as follows:\n\n           If a contract . . . is unambiguous, its\n           interpretation is a question of law that is\n           appropriate for a judge to decide on summary\n           judgment. Where, however, the contract . . .\n           has terms that are ambiguous, uncertain, or\n           equivocal in meaning, the intent of the\n           parties is a question of fact to be determined\n           at trial.\n\nSeaco Ins. Co. v. Barbosa, 435 Mass. 772, 761 N.E.2d 946, 951\n\n(2002) (citations omitted).               Contractual language is ambiguous\n\n\"only if it is susceptible of more than one meaning and reasonably\n\nintelligent persons would differ as to which meaning is the proper\n\n                                         -15-\n\fone.\"   Citation Ins. Co. v. Gomez, 426 Mass. 379, 688 N.E.2d 951,\n\n953 (1998) (citations omitted).            Mere disagreement between the\n\nparties as to the meaning of a disputed contractual provision is,\nof course, not enough to support a claim of ambiguity.                See id.\n\n(quoting Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Offices Unlimited, Inc., 419\n\nMass. 462, 645 N.E.2d 1165, 1168 (1995)).\n           Article   2   of   the   CBA     does    not    purport   to   grant\n\nprobationary employees the right to be discharged \"only for just\n\ncause,\" and, despite Dasey's energetic effort to tease such a right\n\nout of Article 2, that provision cannot be fairly characterized as\n\nambiguous.   Article 2 must be construed in the context of the\n\nagreement as a whole, as well as in the context of the broader\n\ncomprehensive regulatory and statutory scheme of which it is a\npart.   See USM Corp. v. Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc., 28 Mass. App.\n\nCt. 108, 546 N.E.2d 888, 893 (1989) (\"The object of the court is to\n\nconstrue the contract as a whole, in a reasonable and practical\nway, consistent with its language, background, and purpose.\")\n\n(citations omitted).\n           As noted above, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, § 13 expressly\n\nlimits the right to a pre-termination hearing to troopers with one\n\nyear or more of service, and Rule 7.1.3 expressly provides that\n\nfirst-year probationary troopers are subject to discharge at the\n\ndiscretion   of   the    Superintendent.           Given   the   detailed   and\n\ncomprehensive statutory and regulatory provisions regarding the\n\navailability of pre-termination hearings, as well as the specific\n\nprovisions related to terminating probationary employees, it simply\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fwould not be reasonable to construe the passing reference to \"just\n\ncause\" found in the general CBA provision describing management\n\nrights as granting a probationary employee affirmative employment\nprotection that is both denied by exclusion in an applicable\n\nstatute and denied explicitly by rule.6\n\n            Article 2 does, obviously, include the phrase \"with just\ncause.\"   But rather than granting rights to probationary employees\n\nthat are excluded by statute and denied by administrative rules,\n\nthat phrase is properly understood as reflecting the language of\n\nand protections extended in Mass. Gen. Laws 22C, § 13.              In addition\n\nto   granting   veteran   troopers       the   right   to   a   pre-termination\n\nhearing, that statute establishes the standard of review against\n\nwhich discharge decisions are to be measured.               A court to which a\ntrial board decision has been appealed shall \"review such finding\n\nand determine whether or not upon all the evidence such finding and\n\npunishment was justified.\"     Id. (emphasis added).\n           Necessarily,    then,     a    trial    board's      pre-termination\n\ndisciplinary decision must be \"justified.\"                  But only veteran\ntroopers are entitled to a pre-termination hearing before a trial\n\nboard.    Thus, Article 2 of the CBA, properly construed, describes\n\nMSP's \"right to exercise complete control and discretion over . . .\n\nthe suspension[,] demotion, discharge, or any other appropriate\n\n      6\n      On this point, we observe that neither party has provided us\nwith a full copy of the CBA, and, while we have Article 2\n(\"Managerial Rights/Productivity\"), we do not have before us any\nprovisions under a title like \"Employee Rights,\" where one would\nnormally expect to find a provision extending pre-termination\nhearing rights to first-year troopers, if that was the intent of\nthe parties who negotiated the CBA.\n\n                                     -17-\n\faction   against     its    employees,\"        but    also        recognizes      that   in\n\nsituations such as those covered by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, § 13,\n\nin which pre-termination hearings and \"justification\" (or \"just\ncause\") are required, the State Police will afford those rights\n\nbefore taking disciplinary action.               While the CBA might have been\n\ndrafted with greater clarity, nevertheless, understood in context\nand in light of the statutory and regulatory scheme governing State\n\nPolice disciplinary rights and procedures, the phrase \"with just\n\ncause\"   in    Article     2   is    susceptible       to     only       one   reasonable\n\nconstruction.       The phrase pertains to the discipline or discharge\n\nof veteran troopers, not probationary employees.\n\n              Because Article 2 of the CBA is unambiguous, we need not\n\nlook behind it to determine the intent of the parties (MSP and\nSPAM).     See Seaco, 761 N.E.2d at 951.                     However, even if the\n\ndisputed      language    were      ambiguous,    defendants          would     still    be\n\nentitled to summary judgment.           Dasey asserts that the phrase \"with\njust cause\" was the product of arm's-length labor negotiations\n\nbetween the MSP and SPAM over disciplinary procedures applicable to\nall   troopers.          Appellees,      however,          produced      uncontroverted\n\ndeposition testimony from a member of the MSP bargaining team that\n\nnegotiated the current CBA, who testified that discipline was never\n\na   subject    of   negotiations       between       the    MSP    and    SPAM.     Dasey\n\npresented nothing to the district judge capable of putting that\n\nfact in dispute, or from which it could be inferred that the\n\nparties intended the phrase to provide just-cause protections, and\n\nthe right to a pre-termination hearing, to probationary troopers as\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fwell as veterans.    Accordingly, based upon the undisputed factual\n\nrecord, it is apparent that use of the phrase \"with just cause\" in\n\nArticle 2 of the CBA was not intended by either the union or MSP to\nestablish a just-cause prerequisite for termination or the right to\n\na pre-termination hearing for probationary troopers.\n\n            Dasey fares no better with his customs and practices\nargument. In Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601-03 (1972), the\n\nSupreme Court established the principle that a constitutionally\n\nprotected property interest in continued employment can be founded\n\non an employer's institutional customs and practices.                   Perry\n\ninvolved a college professor who claimed a property interest in\n\nrenewal of his teaching contract.         Id. at 599-600.       He avoided a\n\nmotion to dismiss in large part based upon the college's official\nFaculty Guide, which provided:\n\n            Teacher Tenure: Odessa College has no tenure\n            system.   The Administration of the College\n            wishes the faculty member to feel that he has\n            permanent tenure as long as his teaching\n            services are satisfactory and as long as he\n            displays a cooperative attitude toward his co-\n            workers and his superiors, and as long as he\n            is happy in his work.\nId.   at   600.   Likewise,   in     Colburn    v.   Trustees    of   Indiana\n\nUniversity, 739 F. Supp. 1268 (S.D. Ind. 1990), the claims of two\n\ncollege    professors   who   were    not      reappointed   during    their\n\nprobationary periods survived summary judgment, albeit barely:\n\n                   In today's case . . . there is some\n            evidence in the record supporting the claim to\n            a custom of de facto reappointments during the\n            probationary   period.      When  taking   the\n            plaintiffs' evidence favorably for them on\n            this motion for summary judgment, reasonable\n            inferences can be drawn that the custom\n\n                                   -19-\n\f            existed and was indeed practiced. Plaintiffs\n            testified   that   they   were  \"assured\"   of\n            reappointment if their performance remained\n            satisfactory, and the testimony that such\n            reappointments were \"fairly automatic\" can\n            support a finding that such a custom was\n            practiced. Plaintiffs' evidence on this issue\n            at this stage is weak, but it appears to be\n            just enough to get them past summary judgment.\n\nId. at 1293 (citation omitted). And, in Cheveras Pacheco v. Rivera\n\nGonzalez, 809 F.2d 125, 127 (1st Cir. 1987), we held that an\n\nemployee who did \"not describe any promises or representations made\n\nthat might give rise to a property interest in employment\" had no\n\ncognizable property interest in that employment.\n\n            Unlike in Perry and Colburn, the evidence of custom and\n\npractice Dasey produced in the district court fell well short of\n\nestablishing a reasonable expectation of continued employment on\nhis part.    He produced no evidence -- not even his own affidavit --\n\nof any oral assurances, made to him or others, to the effect that\n\nfirst-year troopers were anything other than probationary employees\nwho    could        be   terminated      at   the     discretion    of   the\n\nColonel/Superintendent.         He produced no evidence suggesting any\n\ntradition or practice of affording probationary troopers pre-\n\ntermination hearings.       Similarly, he produced no evidence that any\n\nfirst-year     trooper    had   ever   been   afforded   a   pre-termination\n\nhearing.\n\n            At most, Dasey produced a patchwork of indirect evidence\n\nfrom   which    a    first-year   trooper     might   extrapolate   \"a   mere\n\nsubjective expectancy that his job would continue indefinitely.\"\n\nId. at 127 (citing Perry, 408 U.S. at 603) (internal quotation\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fmarks omitted).     Even if Dasey could prove, as he asserts, that\n\ntrainees (or cadets) at the police academy were afforded pre-\n\ntermination hearings, or that in the past some first-year troopers\nhave been presented with formal written charges before being\n\ndisciplined, that would not establish that first-year troopers\n\ncould reasonably believe their status to be anything other than\nthat   of   probationary   employees,    subject   to   discharge   at   the\n\ndiscretion of the Colonel/Superintendent.           Unlike probationary\n\ntroopers, trainees (or cadets) are not enlisted members of the\n\nState Police, and the terms of their employment relationship with\n\nthe Commonwealth are not necessarily the same as probationary\n\ntroopers.\n\n            Because neither the collective bargaining agreement nor\nthe MSP's customs and practices provided Dasey with a reasonable\n\nexpectation of continued employment, he had no constitutionally\n\nprotected property interest in his job.        Absent such an interest,\nhe had no right to a pre-termination hearing.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\nentry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\f",

After completing his training at the State Police Academy, Dasey was enlisted as a uniformed member of the State Police on August 27, 1999. During the initial application process to become a state trooper, Dasey affirmatively represented that he did not use illegal drugs and, during the preceding five-year period, had not \"used, possessed, supplied or manufactured any illegal drugs.\" On September 14, 1999, while Dasey was still serving in a probationary status,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> MSP Deputy Superintendent Glenn Anderson was given a videotape that had been seized by state troopers while executing a search warrant in an unrelated homicide investigation.

Dasey was offered an opportunity to resign in lieu of discharge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He refused and was thereupon dismissed. Dasey was awarded a general discharge, executed by DiFava in his capacity as Colonel and Superintendent, which read, in its entirety, as follows: \"In accordance with the Rules and Regulations governing the Department of State Police, the below named officer is hereby given a GENERAL DISCHARGE effective as of the close of business on Tuesday, September 14, 1999.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dasey's amended complaint contained six counts. Counts I, II, and III asserted claims for invasion of privacy, brought under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &#167; 1B, against various defendants. Count IV described a claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, based upon alleged violations of Dasey's federal constitutional rights to privacy and due process, as well as deprivation of a property right in continued employment allegedly established by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268, &#167; 13B. The due process claim in Count IV alleged deprivation of both a property interest in continued employment and a reputation-based liberty interest. Dasey contended that his property interest in continued employment entitled him to a pre-termination hearing, while his liberty interest entitled him to a post-termination name-clearing hearing. Count V asserted a second &#167; 1983 claim, involving a due process violation related to deprivation of a property interest, and Count VI asserted a violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. Because Dasey's amended complaint dropped the MSP as a defendant, and names the remaining defendants only in their individual capacities, neither the Eleventh Amendment nor principles of sovereign immunity present any obstacles to Dasey's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Counts I, II, III, and the invasion of privacy claim in Count IV. The court ruled that Dasey failed to allege that defendants disclosed any facts that would qualify as \"private\" for purposes of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &#167; 1B, an essential element of the cause of action, and, alternatively, that Dasey failed to show that defendants acted unreasonably in reviewing the videotape, or in taking action against him based on its content. The district court also granted defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Counts V and VI, and the due process claim in Count IV, on grounds that Dasey, as a probationary trooper, had no reasonable expectation that his employment would continue and, as a consequence, had no constitutionally protected property interest in his job, or concomitant due process rights, at the time he was discharged. The district court did not directly address Dasey's claim that he was entitled to a name-clearing hearing to protect a reputation-based liberty interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's ruling on summary judgment <i>de novo.

Summary judgment is appropriate when the record reveals \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

We begin with the less complicated matters &#8212; Dasey's privacy and liberty-interest claims &#8212; and end with his asserted right to a pre-termination hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Privacy Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts recognizes an actionable right of privacy. The applicable statute provides that \"[a] person shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &#167; 1B. Section 1B protects people from \"disclosure of facts... that are of a highly personal or intimate nature when there exists no legitimate, countervailing interest.\" <i>Bratt v.</i> <i>Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp.,</i> 392 Mass. 508, 467 N.E.2d 126, 133-34 (1984) (citations omitted); <i>see also French v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> 2 F.Supp.2d 128, 131 (D.Mass. 1998) (\"To constitute an invasion of privacy, the invasion must be both unreasonable <i>and</i> serious or substantial.\") (citation omitted). Massachusetts does not recognize a cause of action for false light invasion of privacy. <i>Canney v. City of Chelsea,</i> 925 F.Supp. 58, 70 (D.Mass.1996) (citing <i>ELM Med. Lab., Inc. v. RKO Gen., Inc.,</i> 403 Mass. 779, 532 N.E.2d 675, 681 (1989)). Rather, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &#167; 1B is typically invoked to remedy \"the gathering and dissemination of information which the plaintiffs contended was private.\" <i>Schlesinger v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.,</i> 409 Mass. 514, 567 N.E.2d 912, 914 n. 4 (1991) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court correctly decided, Counts I, II, and III of the complaint fail, as a matter of law. Neither the complaint nor Dasey's objection to summary judgment identified any facts at all, and certainly no highly personal or intimate facts, about Dasey that were either gathered or disseminated by any defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the personal or intimate nature of the allegedly private facts disclosed in the videotape, <i>French</i> plainly establishes that activity in the presence of others who owe no duty of confidentiality &#8212; a category which includes the subject matter of the videotape &#8212; is hardly \"private.\" <i>See French,</i> 2 F.Supp.2d at 131. Likewise, the \"gathering and dissemination\" element has not been met. Dasey neither alleged, nor produced any evidence that suggested, that any defendant made or distributed the tape; he only alleged that defendants watched it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Dasey had been able to satisfy the \"gathering and dissemination\" and \"private facts\" elements of his claim under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &#167; 1B, that still would not have been enough to survive summary judgment. To be actionable, the gathering and dissemination of private facts must also be unreasonable. When determining the reasonableness of an intrusion, an \"employer's legitimate interest in determining the employees' effectiveness in their jobs should be balanced against the seriousness of the intrusion on the employees' privacy.\" <i>O'Connor v. Police Comm'r of Boston,</i> 408 Mass. 324, 557 N.E.2d 1146, 1150 (1990) (quoting <i>Bratt,</i> 467 N.E.2d at 135) (holding that police department's \"compelling interest in determining whether cadets were using drugs\" outweighed cadets' privacy interest in avoiding unannounced urinalysis tests for which sample collection was monitored by police personnel). Here, defendants' modest intrusion into Dasey's privacy (if reviewing the seized videotape evidence constituted an intrusion at all) was entirely reasonable in light of their compelling interest in verifying the truthfulness of his prior assurances regarding illegal drug use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Dasey's privacy claims fail in three ways. Given the allegations in his complaint, the factual assertions in his objection to summary judgment, and his failure to identify pertinent information that might have been developed through discovery, this case involves: (1) no \"private\" facts of any sort; (2) no acts constituting \"gathering or dissemination\" by defendants; and (3) no unreasonable conduct on defendants' part. Accordingly, the district court's entry of judgment in favor of defendants on Dasey's state-law privacy claims (Counts I, II, and III) is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count IV Dasey asserted a claim based upon his federal constitutional right to privacy. However, we are aware of no constitutional principle that would bar defendants from, as Dasey puts it, \"using information concerning [his] private life as the basis for terminating [his] employment.\" Because that allegation is the sole basis upon which Dasey rests his federal constitutional privacy claim, the district court's entry of judgment as to that aspect of Count IV is affirmed as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Liberty Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dasey included a &#167; 1983 claim in Count IV of the complaint, in which he asserted the deprivation of a reputation-based liberty interest, occasioned by defendants' refusal to grant him a post-termination name-clearing hearing. In their motion for summary judgment, defendants specifically addressed Dasey's liberty-interest claim. Dasey, however, did not respond, not even to the extent of arguing, as he does now on appeal, that summary judgment would be inappropriate due to the limitations placed on discovery. Given his failure to press the issue in the district court, defendants say he has forfeited it. We need not dwell on whether Dasey has or has not forfeited the issue, however, because we affirm the district court's entry of judgment based upon Dasey's failure to plead a cognizable &#167; 1983 claim arising from the deprivation of a liberty interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A public employer's action may deprive an employee of a constitutionally protected liberty interest in his or her reputation under circumstances first identified in <i>Paul v. Davis,</i> 424 U.S. 693, 710-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).

Moreover, the municipality terminating the employee must also be responsible for the dissemination of defamatory charges, in a formal setting (and not merely as the result of unauthorized \"leaks\"), and thereby significantly have interfered with the employee's ability to find future employment. <i>Id.</i> at 879.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Silva v.

His general discharge does not recite the grounds for dismissal, and nothing he presented to the district court suggests any other disclosures by defendants. Absent dissemination &#8212; the means by which an employee's reputation might be threatened with serious harm &#8212; a terminated public employee has no constitutional right to a name-clearing hearing. Because Dasey did not allege, or present any evidence of, conduct by defendants that, if proven, would constitute a deprivation of any constitutionally protected liberty interest, the district court's entry of judgment in favor of defendants on that aspect of Count IV is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Property Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What remains, then, is Dasey's claim that he was denied due process when he was summarily discharged by Colonel DiFava, the MSP Superintendent. The issue before us is whether the district court erred in deciding that Dasey had no constitutionally protected property interest in his continued employment, and, therefore, was afforded all the process due him as a probationary employee when the Superintendent summarily discharged him after concluding he had made a material misstatement of fact related to prior drug use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dasey contends that, notwithstanding his probationary status, he was entitled to a pre-termination hearing because: (1) the statute granting the right to a pre-termination hearing to troopers who have completed the one-year probationary period, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, &#167; 13, does not expressly preclude extension of that right to probationary troopers; (2) Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 150E requires the MSP, as a public employer, to bargain with SPAM over working conditions, including employee discipline; and (3) the collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") negotiated by the MSP and SPAM includes a bargained-for extension of the right to a pre-termination hearing to all troopers, probationary and veteran alike, a provision that overrides the MSP rule subjecting first-year troopers to summary discharge. He further argues that even if he was not entitled to a pre-termination hearing under the CBA, he still had a reasonable expectation of continued employment (and thus a protected property interest and the right to a pre-termination hearing) based upon the customs and practices of the MSP. Finally he says that the district court's resolution of that disputed fact-bound issue (i.e., whether a custom or practice of granting hearings to probationary troopers existed) was inappropriate on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on his &#167; 1983 claim Dasey must establish that defendants deprived him of a constitutional right, in this case, his property interest in continued employment, without due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that a public employee has a constitutionally protected property interest in his continued employment when he reasonably expects that his employment will continue. <i>Cummings v.

Gen. Laws ch. 22C; (2) MSP Rules; and (3) the CBA. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, &#167; 13 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any uniformed member of the state police who has served for one year or more and against whom charges have been preferred shall be tried by a board to be appointed by the colonel or, at the request of the officer, may be tried by a board consisting of the colonel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MSP Rules, promulgated by the Colonel/Superintendent, under the authority of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, &#167; 10, contain two provisions relating to a trooper's right to a pre-termination hearing. Rule 6.5.1 mirrors Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, &#167; 13, in providing that \"[a] member who has served for one year or more and has been formally charged in accordance with Department Rules and Regulations shall be tried by a State Police Trial Board appointed by the Colonel/Superintendent.\" In contrast, Rule 7.1.3, quoted above, explicitly provides that a uniformed member of the State Police who has served for <i>less</i> than one year is on probationary status, and may be discharged by the Superintendent without any pre-termination hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the third source describing terms of Dasey's employment is the CBA, which provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except as otherwise limited by an express provision of this Agreement, <i>the Employer shall have the right to exercise complete control and discretion over</i> its organization and technology, including but not limited to, the determination of the standards of services to be provided and standards of productivity and performance of its employees; the establishment and/or revision of personnel evaluation programs; the determination of the methods, means and personnel by which its operations are to be conducted; the determination of the content of job classifications; the appointment, promotion, assignment, direction and transfer of personnel; <i>the suspension[,] demotion, discharge, or any other appropriate action against its employees</i> <i>with just cause;</i> the relief from duty of its employees because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons; the establishment of reasonable work rules; and the taking of all necessary actions to carry out its mission in emergencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis supplied).

Indeed, Article 3 of the CBA confirms that \"[i]f this Agreement contains a conflict between matters covered by this Agreement and the Rules and Regulations of the Massachusetts Department of State Police the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.\" Similarly, the MSP Rules are prefaced by a notice stating that \"[t]he Massachusetts State Police Rules and Regulations do <i>NOT</i> supersede any contractual agreements between the Commonwealth and the members of the State Police, law, or Executive Order as promulgated by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of his discharge, Dasey was not \"[a]n employee who [could] only [have been] dismissed for cause.\" <i>King,</i> 116 F.3d at 969. Plainly, neither Mass. Gen.

Article 2 must be construed in the context of the agreement as a whole, as well as in the context of the broader comprehensive regulatory and statutory scheme of which it is a part. <i>See USM Corp. v. Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc.,</i> 28 Mass.App.Ct. 108, 546 N.E.2d 888, 893 (1989) (\"The object of the court is to construe the contract as a whole, in a reasonable and practical way, consistent with its language, background, and purpose.\") (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, &#167; 13 expressly limits the right to a pre-termination hearing to troopers with one year or more of service, and Rule 7.1.3 expressly provides that first-year probationary troopers are subject to discharge at the discretion of the Superintendent. Given the detailed and comprehensive statutory and regulatory provisions regarding the availability of pre-termination hearings, as well as the specific provisions related to terminating probationary employees, it simply would not be reasonable to construe the passing reference to \"just cause\" found in the general CBA provision describing management rights as granting a probationary employee affirmative employment protection that is both denied by exclusion in an applicable statute and denied explicitly by rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article 2 does, obviously, include the phrase \"with just cause.\" But rather than granting rights to probationary employees that are excluded by statute and denied by administrative rules, that phrase is properly understood as reflecting the language of and protections extended in Mass. Gen. Laws 22C, &#167; 13. In addition to granting veteran troopers the right to a pre-termination hearing, that statute establishes the standard of review against which discharge decisions are to be measured. A court to which a trial board decision has been appealed shall \"review such finding and determine whether or not upon all the evidence such finding and punishment <i>was justified.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Necessarily, then, a trial board's pre-termination disciplinary decision must be \"justified.\" But only veteran troopers are entitled to a pre-termination hearing before a trial board. Thus, Article 2 of the CBA, properly construed, describes MSP's \"right to exercise complete control and discretion over ... the suspension[,] demotion, discharge, or any other appropriate action against its employees,\" but also recognizes that in situations such as those covered by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, &#167; 13, in which pre-termination hearings and \"justification\" (or \"just cause\") are required, the State Police will afford those rights before taking disciplinary action. While the CBA might have been drafted with greater clarity, nevertheless, understood in context and in light of the statutory and regulatory scheme governing State Police disciplinary rights and procedures, the phrase \"with just cause\" in Article 2 is susceptible to only one reasonable construction. The phrase pertains to the discipline or discharge of veteran troopers, not probationary employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Article 2 of the CBA is unambiguous, we need not look behind it to determine the intent of the parties (MSP and SPAM). <i>See Seaco,</i> 761 N.E.2d at 951. However, even if the disputed language were ambiguous, defendants would still be entitled to summary judgment. Dasey asserts that the phrase \"with just cause\" was the product of arm's-length labor negotiations between the MSP and SPAM over disciplinary procedures applicable to all troopers. Appellees, however, produced uncontroverted deposition testimony from a member of the MSP bargaining team that negotiated the current CBA, who testified that discipline was never a subject of negotiations between the MSP and SPAM. Dasey presented nothing to the district judge capable of putting that fact in dispute, or from which it could be inferred that the parties intended the phrase to provide just-cause protections, and the right to a pre-termination hearing, to probationary troopers as well as veterans. Accordingly, based upon the undisputed factual record, it is apparent that use of the phrase \"with just cause\" in Article 2 of the CBA was not intended by either the union or MSP to establish a just-cause prerequisite for termination or the right to a pre-termination hearing for probationary troopers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dasey fares no better with his customs and practices argument.

Sindermann,</i> 408 U.S. 593, 601-03, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), the Supreme Court established the principle that a constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment can be founded on an employer's institutional customs and practices. <i>Perry</i> involved a college professor who claimed a property interest in renewal of his teaching contract. <i>Id.</i> at 599-600, 92 S.Ct. 2694. He avoided a motion to dismiss in large part based upon the college's official Faculty Guide, which provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Teacher Tenure:</i> Odessa College has no tenure system. The Administration of the College wishes the faculty member to feel that he has permanent tenure as long as his teaching services are satisfactory and as long as he displays a cooperative attitude toward his co-workers and his superiors, and as long as he is happy in his work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 600, 92 S.Ct. 2694. Likewise, in <i>Colburn v. Trustees of Indiana University,</i> 739 F.Supp. 1268 (S.D.Ind.1990), the claims of two college professors who were not reappointed during their probationary periods survived summary judgment, albeit barely:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In today's case ... there is some evidence in the record supporting the claim to a custom of <i>de facto</i> reappointments during the probationary period. When taking the plaintiffs' evidence favorably for them on this motion for summary judgment, reasonable inferences can be drawn that the custom existed and was indeed practiced. Plaintiffs testified that they were \"assured\" of reappointment if their performance remained satisfactory, and the testimony that such reappointments were \"fairly automatic\" can support a finding that such a custom was practiced. Plaintiffs' evidence on this issue at this stage is weak, but it appears to be just enough to get them past summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1293 (citation omitted). And, in <i>Cheveras Pacheco v. Rivera Gonzalez,</i> 809 F.2d 125, 127 (1st Cir.1987), we held that an employee who did \"not describe any promises or representations made that might give rise to a property interest in employment\" had no cognizable property interest in that employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike in <i>Perry</i> and <i>Colburn,</i> the evidence of custom and practice Dasey produced in the district court fell well short of establishing a reasonable expectation of continued employment on his part. He produced no evidence &#8212; not even his own affidavit &#8212; of any oral assurances, made to him or others, to the effect that first-year troopers were anything other than probationary employees who could be terminated at the discretion of the Colonel/Superintendent. He produced no evidence suggesting any tradition or practice of affording probationary troopers pre-termination hearings. Similarly, he produced no evidence that any first-year trooper had ever been afforded a pre-termination hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At most, Dasey produced a patchwork of indirect evidence from which a first-year trooper might extrapolate \"a mere subjective expectancy that his job would continue indefinitely.\" <i>Id.</i> at 127 (citing <i>Perry,</i> 408 U.S. at 603, 92 S.Ct. 2694) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even if Dasey could prove, as he asserts, that trainees (or cadets) at the police academy were afforded pre-termination hearings, or that in the past some first-year troopers have been presented with formal written charges before being disciplined, that would not establish that first-year troopers could reasonably believe their status to be anything other than that of probationary employees, subject to discharge at the discretion of the Colonel/Superintendent. Unlike probationary troopers, trainees (or cadets) are not enlisted members of the State Police, and the terms of their employment relationship with the Commonwealth are not necessarily the same as probationary troopers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because neither the collective bargaining agreement nor the MSP's customs and practices provided Dasey with a reasonable expectation of continued employment, he had no constitutionally protected property interest in his job.

Before his probationary period expired, he was discharged for making a material misstatement in his employment application. Dasey filed suit, asserting violations of the Massachusetts right-of-privacy law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &#167; 1B; the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983; and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167; 11H. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts, and Dasey filed a timely appeal. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical facts are not contested. After completing his training at the State Police Academy, Dasey was enlisted as a uniformed member of the State Police on August 27, 1999. During the initial application process to become a state trooper, Dasey affirmatively represented that he did not use illegal drugs and, during the preceding five-year period, had not \"used, possessed, supplied or manufactured any illegal drugs.\" On September 14, 1999, while Dasey was still serving in a probationary status,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> MSP Deputy Superintendent Glenn Anderson was given a videotape that had been seized by state troopers while executing a search warrant in an unrelated homicide investigation. The videotape showed Dasey and others apparently smoking marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the videotape, Anderson and appellees John DiFava, Joseph McLaughlin, and Paul L. Regan, all senior State Police officers, concluded that Dasey had been caught on videotape using an illegal drug and, therefore, had necessarily made a false material statement when he denied prior drug use during the application process. Anderson summoned Dasey to MSP headquarters, where he was met by an attorney provided by the troopers' union, the State Police Association of Massachusetts (\"SPAM\"). Dasey and the union attorney then met with Anderson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson told Dasey that he had evidence (or information)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> that Dasey had used an illegal drug and had falsely denied doing so during the employment application process. Dasey was offered an opportunity to resign in lieu of discharge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He refused and was thereupon dismissed. Dasey was awarded a general discharge, executed by DiFava in his capacity as Colonel and Superintendent, which read, in its entirety, as follows: \"In accordance with the Rules and Regulations governing the Department of State Police, the below named officer is hereby given a GENERAL DISCHARGE effective as of the close of business on Tuesday, September 14, 1999.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dasey's amended complaint contained six counts. Counts I, II, and III asserted claims for invasion of privacy, brought under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &#167; 1B, against various defendants. Count IV described a claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, based upon alleged violations of Dasey's federal constitutional rights to privacy and due process, as well as deprivation of a property right in continued employment allegedly established by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268, &#167; 13B. The due process claim in Count IV alleged deprivation of both a property interest in continued employment and a reputation-based liberty interest. Dasey contended that his property interest in continued employment entitled him to a pre-termination hearing, while his liberty interest entitled him to a post-termination name-clearing hearing. Count V asserted a second &#167; 1983 claim, involving a due process violation related to deprivation of a property interest, and Count VI asserted a violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. Because Dasey's amended complaint dropped the MSP as a defendant, and names the remaining defendants only in their individual capacities, neither the Eleventh Amendment nor principles of sovereign immunity present any obstacles to Dasey's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Counts I, II, III, and the invasion of privacy claim in Count IV. The court ruled that Dasey failed to allege that defendants disclosed any facts that would qualify as \"private\" for purposes of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &#167; 1B, an essential element of the cause of action, and, alternatively, that Dasey failed to show that defendants acted unreasonably in reviewing the videotape, or in taking action against him based on its content. The district court also granted defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Counts V and VI, and the due process claim in Count IV, on grounds that Dasey, as a probationary trooper, had no reasonable expectation that his employment would continue and, as a consequence, had no constitutionally protected property interest in his job, or concomitant due process rights, at the time he was discharged. The district court did not directly address Dasey's claim that he was entitled to a name-clearing hearing to protect a reputation-based liberty interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's ruling on summary judgment <i>de novo.

Likewise, the \"gathering and dissemination\" element has not been met. Dasey neither alleged, nor produced any evidence that suggested, that any defendant made or distributed the tape; he only alleged that defendants watched it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Dasey had been able to satisfy the \"gathering and dissemination\" and \"private facts\" elements of his claim under Mass.

Here, defendants' modest intrusion into Dasey's privacy (if reviewing the seized videotape evidence constituted an intrusion at all) was entirely reasonable in light of their compelling interest in verifying the truthfulness of his prior assurances regarding illegal drug use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Dasey's privacy claims fail in three ways. Given the allegations in his complaint, the factual assertions in his objection to summary judgment, and his failure to identify pertinent information that might have been developed through discovery, this case involves: (1) no \"private\" facts of any sort; (2) no acts constituting \"gathering or dissemination\" by defendants; and (3) no unreasonable conduct on defendants' part. Accordingly, the district court's entry of judgment in favor of defendants on Dasey's state-law privacy claims (Counts I, II, and III) is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count IV Dasey asserted a claim based upon his federal constitutional right to privacy. However, we are aware of no constitutional principle that would bar defendants from, as Dasey puts it, \"using information concerning [his] private life as the basis for terminating [his] employment.\" Because that allegation is the sole basis upon which Dasey rests his federal constitutional privacy claim, the district court's entry of judgment as to that aspect of Count IV is affirmed as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Liberty Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dasey included a &#167; 1983 claim in Count IV of the complaint, in which he asserted the deprivation of a reputation-based liberty interest, occasioned by defendants' refusal to grant him a post-termination name-clearing hearing. In their motion for summary judgment, defendants specifically addressed Dasey's liberty-interest claim.

His general discharge does not recite the grounds for dismissal, and nothing he presented to the district court suggests any other disclosures by defendants. Absent dissemination &#8212; the means by which an employee's reputation might be threatened with serious harm &#8212; a terminated public employee has no constitutional right to a name-clearing hearing.

The issue before us is whether the district court erred in deciding that Dasey had no constitutionally protected property interest in his continued employment, and, therefore, was afforded all the process due him as a probationary employee when the Superintendent summarily discharged him after concluding he had made a material misstatement of fact related to prior drug use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dasey contends that, notwithstanding his probationary status, he was entitled to a pre-termination hearing because: (1) the statute granting the right to a pre-termination hearing to troopers who have completed the one-year probationary period, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, &#167; 13, does not expressly preclude extension of that right to probationary troopers; (2) Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 150E requires the MSP, as a public employer, to bargain with SPAM over working conditions, including employee discipline; and (3) the collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") negotiated by the MSP and SPAM includes a bargained-for extension of the right to a pre-termination hearing to all troopers, probationary and veteran alike, a provision that overrides the MSP rule subjecting first-year troopers to summary discharge. He further argues that even if he was not entitled to a pre-termination hearing under the CBA, he still had a reasonable expectation of continued employment (and thus a protected property interest and the right to a pre-termination hearing) based upon the customs and practices of the MSP. Finally he says that the district court's resolution of that disputed fact-bound issue (i.e., whether a custom or practice of granting hearings to probationary troopers existed) was inappropriate on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on his &#167; 1983 claim Dasey must establish that defendants deprived him of a constitutional right, in this case, his property interest in continued employment, without due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that a public employee has a constitutionally protected property interest in his continued employment when he reasonably expects that his employment will continue. <i>Cummings v.

Gen. Laws ch. 22C, &#167; 10, contain two provisions relating to a trooper's right to a pre-termination hearing. Rule 6.5.1 mirrors Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, &#167; 13, in providing that \"[a] member who has served for one year or more and has been formally charged in accordance with Department Rules and Regulations shall be tried by a State Police Trial Board appointed by the Colonel/Superintendent.\" In contrast, Rule 7.1.3, quoted above, explicitly provides that a uniformed member of the State Police who has served for <i>less</i> than one year is on probationary status, and may be discharged by the Superintendent without any pre-termination hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the third source describing terms of Dasey's employment is the CBA, which provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except as otherwise limited by an express provision of this Agreement, <i>the Employer shall have the right to exercise complete control and discretion over</i> its organization and technology, including but not limited to, the determination of the standards of services to be provided and standards of productivity and performance of its employees; the establishment and/or revision of personnel evaluation programs; the determination of the methods, means and personnel by which its operations are to be conducted; the determination of the content of job classifications; the appointment, promotion, assignment, direction and transfer of personnel; <i>the suspension[,] demotion, discharge, or any other appropriate action against its employees</i> <i>with just cause;</i> the relief from duty of its employees because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons; the establishment of reasonable work rules; and the taking of all necessary actions to carry out its mission in emergencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis supplied).

Indeed, Article 3 of the CBA confirms that \"[i]f this Agreement contains a conflict between matters covered by this Agreement and the Rules and Regulations of the Massachusetts Department of State Police the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.\" Similarly, the MSP Rules are prefaced by a notice stating that \"[t]he Massachusetts State Police Rules and Regulations do <i>NOT</i> supersede any contractual agreements between the Commonwealth and the members of the State Police, law, or Executive Order as promulgated by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of his discharge, Dasey was not \"[a]n employee who [could] only [have been] dismissed for cause.\" <i>King,</i> 116 F.3d at 969.

Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc.,</i> 28 Mass.App.Ct. 108, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2240063\"><a href=\"/opinion/2240063/usm-corp-v-arthur-d-little-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span>, 893 (1989) (\"The object of the court is to construe the contract as a whole, in a reasonable and practical way, consistent with its language, background, and purpose.\") (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, &#167; 13 expressly limits the right to a pre-termination hearing to troopers with one year or more of service, and Rule 7.1.3 expressly provides that first-year probationary troopers are subject to discharge at the discretion of the Superintendent. Given the detailed and comprehensive statutory and regulatory provisions regarding the availability of pre-termination hearings, as well as the specific provisions related to terminating probationary employees, it simply would not be reasonable to construe the passing reference to \"just cause\" found in the general CBA provision describing management rights as granting a probationary employee affirmative employment protection that is both denied by exclusion in an applicable statute and denied explicitly by rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article 2 does, obviously, include the phrase \"with just cause.\" But rather than granting rights to probationary employees that are excluded by statute and denied by administrative rules, that phrase is properly understood as reflecting the language of and protections extended in Mass. Gen. Laws 22C, &#167; 13. In addition to granting veteran troopers the right to a pre-termination hearing, that statute establishes the standard of review against which discharge decisions are to be measured. A court to which a trial board decision has been appealed shall \"review such finding and determine whether or not upon all the evidence such finding and punishment <i>was justified.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Necessarily, then, a trial board's pre-termination disciplinary decision must be \"justified.\" But only veteran troopers are entitled to a pre-termination hearing before a trial board. Thus, Article 2 of the CBA, properly construed, describes MSP's \"right to exercise complete control and discretion over ... the suspension[,] demotion, discharge, or any other appropriate action against its employees,\" but also recognizes that in situations such as those covered by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 22C, &#167; 13, in which pre-termination hearings and \"justification\" (or \"just cause\") are required, the State Police will afford those rights before taking disciplinary action. While the CBA might have been drafted with greater clarity, nevertheless, understood in context and in light of the statutory and regulatory scheme governing State Police disciplinary rights and procedures, the phrase \"with just cause\" in Article 2 is susceptible to only one reasonable construction. The phrase pertains to the discipline or discharge of veteran troopers, not probationary employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Article 2 of the CBA is unambiguous, we need not look behind it to determine the intent of the parties (MSP and SPAM). <i>See Seaco,</i> 761 N.E.2d at 951. However, even if the disputed language were ambiguous, defendants would still be entitled to summary judgment. Dasey asserts that the phrase \"with just cause\" was the product of arm's-length labor negotiations between the MSP and SPAM over disciplinary procedures applicable to all troopers. Appellees, however, produced uncontroverted deposition testimony from a member of the MSP bargaining team that negotiated the current CBA, who testified that discipline was never a subject of negotiations between the MSP and SPAM. Dasey presented nothing to the district judge capable of putting that fact in dispute, or from which it could be inferred that the parties intended the phrase to provide just-cause protections, and the right to a pre-termination hearing, to probationary troopers as well as veterans. Accordingly, based upon the undisputed factual record, it is apparent that use of the phrase \"with just cause\" in Article 2 of the CBA was not intended by either the union or MSP to establish a just-cause prerequisite for termination or the right to a pre-termination hearing for probationary troopers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dasey fares no better with his customs and practices argument.

But he cannot show how discovery would have made any difference in establishing the private nature of the facts disclosed &#8212; i.e., the activity captured on tape. The content of the tape is undisputed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> As stated earlier, Dasey does not allege that any defendant actively pried into his personal life. Instead, his privacy claims appear to rest upon a contention that defendants somehow owed him a duty to look away when his image appeared on the seized videotape. Furthermore, because Dasey does not allege that the videotape was created in aid of a grand jury investigation, his argument that grand jury secrecy rules somehow were violated also fails; his reliance on<i>In re Doe Grand Jury Investigation,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></span> (1993) is, therefore, misplaced. <i>See also WBZ-TV4 v.
