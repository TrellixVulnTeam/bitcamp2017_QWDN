Robert E. Keeton, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                    Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Thomas J.

Wernick was on brief for\nPhaly Poy.\n\n\n                            February 13, 2004\n\f      Per Curiam.    As a result of plaintiff's success in his appeal\n\nfrom the district court's denial of attorney's fees, he has filed\n\na request for attorney's fees on appeal in the amount of $23,800.\n\nAccompanying the request are billing ledger pages detailing the\n\ndates, time spent, and subject matter of counsel's work.           Counsel\n\nMark W. Miller has supplied an affidavit describing his experience\n\nand stating that his professional fees are calculated at $175 an\n\nhour.    The ledger entries for work on plaintiff's appeal total 136\n\nhours.     No opposition to the request has been submitted.\n\n        We undertake our own assessment, being guided by \"the numbers\n\nof hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a\n\nreasonable hourly rate,\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433\n\n(1983).    In light of the absence of any objection, we see no reason\n\nto question the hourly rate of $175.            Nor do we \"attempt a\n\ncomprehensive accounting of each asserted expenditure of time and\n\nfunds, annotated with our view of the labor's real worth.\" Ackerly\n\nCommunications of Mass., Inc. v. City of Somerville, 901 F.2d 170,\n\n171   (lst   Cir.   1990).   In   this   case   there   are   no   special\n\ncircumstances warranting extended discussion. Our basic inquiry is\n\nto determine the time reasonably required by the issues presented.\n\n      Plaintiff's attorney Miller performed all the services on\n\nappeal; there is no problem of duplicating work.        The records kept\n\nare meticulous, although at some point not particularly descriptive\n\nof the nature of work done.       Much of the work was directed at\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fissues raised by defendants in their own appeal.                  These include a\n\nlabored    statute   of   limitations    argument,      a    challenge      to    the\n\nevidence supporting damages for emotional distress and punitive\n\ndamages, and an ill-considered attempt to challenge the denial of\n\nattorney's    fees   to   a   non-appealing     party.            The   quality    of\n\nplaintiff's briefs was at a high standard.              We think, therefore,\n\nthat a substantial award is justified.\n\n      But we feel obliged to make the following reductions, deeming\n\nthe   reported   times    excessive.      The   claim       for    time   spent    on\n\nplaintiff's opening brief is 46 hours, of which 24 hours at the end\n\nwere spent on two days for an unspecified miscellany of tasks\n\ndescribed simply as reviewing files, editing, revising, checking\n\nand formatting.      In light of the fact that the factual background\n\nwas not complex, and the relevant authorities few, we think a\n\nreasonable time spent on the opening brief would not exceed 40\n\nhours.     The plaintiff's reply brief was longer than the opening\n\nbrief, partly because it dealt with the variety of issues raised by\n\ndefendants in their opening brief. But, as we have indicated, some\n\nof these issues were insubstantial and do not in our view warrant\n\nthe 52 hours claimed.      We feel that no more than 42 hours should be\n\nallowed.\n\n      A claim of 18 hours to prepare for oral argument seems to us\n\nadmirable but not a reasonable amount to impose on an adversary.\n\nWe reduce the claim by 6 hours.         For the 12 hours claimed for work\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fon defendants' motion to strike and 4 hours work on the present fee\n\napplication, we allow 14 hours, after a reduction of 2 hours.   This\n\nreflects, inter alia, a somewhat lower rate for time spent on the\n\npresent fee application.\n\n     In sum, we deem reasonable an expenditure of 108 hours, and\n\napprove an attorney's fee of $18,900.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
