Bardsley and Law Office of Bardsley & Gray on Motion\nfor the Issuance of a Certificate of Appealability Pursuant to\nF.R.A.P. 22(b) and Loc. R. 22.1 for petitioner.\n     James P. Bardsley and Law Office of Bardsley & Gray on\nMemorandum in Support of Motion for the Issuance of a Certificate\nof Appealability Pursuant to F.R.A.P. 22(b) and Loc. R. 22.1 for\npetitioner.\n     Michael J. Pelgro, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, on Memorandum in\nOpposition to Petitioner's Motion Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 for the\nUnited States.\n\n\n                          November 7, 2002\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge.      Mateo pled guilty, pursuant to a\n\nwritten plea agreement, to various federal drug related offenses.\n\nThe district court found that Mateo's offenses occurred at a time\n\nwhen he was the subject of an outstanding state warrant for\n\nprobation violation. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, this equates\n\nto the commission of a federal crime while under sentence for\n\nanother crime and raised Mateo's criminal history score and (in all\n\nlikelihood)   his   ultimate   federal   sentence.    See   U.S.S.G.    §§\n\n4A1.1(d), 4A1.2(m). After being sentenced, Mateo filed a notice of\n\nappeal and, while the appeal was pending, succeeded in obtaining a\n\nstate court termination of the probation warrant nunc pro tunc to\n\na time apparently before the alleged federal offenses.\n\n          On direct appeal, this court declined to consider the\n\nstate court order.    United States v. Mateo, 271 F.3d 11 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (\"Mateo I\").    The court said that it was procedurally barred\n\nfrom addressing the nunc pro tunc order because, as the order was\n\nissued after the district court imposed its sentence, a proffer of\n\nthe order was not made below.     Id. at 15.    The opinion continued,\n\n\"[E]ven were we to consider the nunc pro tunc order, [Mateo] would\n\nnot be advantaged,\" because under federal law \"the district court\n\ntakes the state-court record as it finds it.\"        Id. at n.4.\n\n          Mateo then petitioned under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2000),\n\nraising the same claim that was denied on direct appeal.               The\n\nsection 2255 motion was denied by the district court, which felt\n\n                                  -2-\n\fitself foreclosed under Mateo I from considering a collateral\n\nattack based on the vacated state warrant.            Mateo now seeks a\n\ncertificate of appealability (\"COA\") from this court under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2253 (2000).\n\n          Under   section   2253,    Mateo   must   make   a   \"substantial\n\nshowing of the denial of a constitutional right\" before a COA can\n\nbe granted.     Here his habeas petition was denied based on the\n\ndistrict court's interpretation of Mateo I's mandate, a non-\n\nconstitutional ground. Thus, section 2253 would appear on its face\n\nto bar us from issuing a COA.     However, the Supreme Court has held\n\nthat the statute permits a COA to be granted where a supposed\n\nantecedent    procedural   bar   prevented   the    district    court   from\n\nreaching the constitutional claim--if (1) the soundness of the\n\nprocedural ruling is debatable, and (2) the constitutional claim is\n\nalso colorable.    Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484-85 (2000).\n\n          The first requirement is easily met.        The district court\n\nwas right to be cautious; the mandate rule requires the district\n\ncourt to respect the appellate mandate. United States v. Rowe, 268\n\nF.3d 34, 41-42 (1st Cir. 2001).           But here the main holding in\n\nMateo I does not apply because the state court order now is part of\n\nthe record.    As for the further comment quoted above--that Mateo\n\nwould not be advantaged even had we considered the nunc pro tunc\n\norder--we think this meant only that the district court had not\n\nerred as the record before it stood; the court in Mateo I should\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fnot be taken to have decided in a brief comment a very difficult\n\nset of substantive issues concerning the consequence of a post-\n\nsentencing vacation of a state sentence that affected the federal\n\nsentence.\n\n               Slack's second requirement--that there be a plausible\n\nconstitutional claim before a COA can be granted--is a more serious\n\nproblem for Mateo.      Let us assume arguendo (we will return to this\n\nissue) that the later vacation of the state order renders Mateo's\n\nfederal sentence vulnerable in a section 2255 proceeding, even\n\nthough the sentencing judge acted properly on the record before\n\nher.       Even so, it is hard to see why this raises a constitutional\n\nquestion, especially as Mateo makes no claim to us that the state\n\ncourt probation warrant was itself constitutionally defective.1\n\n              Why   Congress   chose   to    limit   COAs   to   constitutional\n\ndefects is not entirely apparent.              Cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)\n\n(2000) (limiting second habeas petitions to new law or newly\n\ndiscovered evidence); Jamison v. United States, 244 F.3d 44, 47\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).        Any assumption that constitutional claims are\n\nalways critically important, and non-constitutional ones always\n\nless so, would not wash; there are Fourth Amendment claims that\n\nturn on whether an object sits in the glove compartment of a car or\n\nin the trunk, see, e.g., New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 460 n.4\n\n(1981), and some non-constitutional rulings (say, a misreading of\n\n       1\n      On the contrary, it appears that Mateo's claim in state court\nwas that the warrant was defective under state law.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fa guideline) that could double the time spent in jail.          Still, this\n\nis the line that Congress has drawn.\n\n           Nevertheless,    Mateo     does    assert    that    he     has    a\n\nconstitutional claim, and it may not have been properly developed\n\nbecause the government invoked, and the district court accepted,\n\nthe mandate-bar argument.    Under these circumstances, the Seventh\n\nCircuit   has   adopted    the     view    that,   if   the    petitioner's\n\nconstitutional claim does not appear utterly without merit after a\n\n\"quick look,\" the COA can be granted and an incorrect procedural\n\nbarrier removed,   the    matter    then   being   remanded    to    give    the\n\ndistrict court first crack at the constitutional claim.             Jefferson\n\nv. Welborn, 222 F.3d 286, 289 (7th Cir. 2000); accord Evicci v.\n\nCommissioner of Corrections, 226 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           This is a variation on Slack and one not presented or\n\nendorsed in that case. But the Seventh Circuit's approach reflects\n\nthe same impulse as Slack to protect nascent constitutional claims;\n\nand it certainly does not bend the language of section 2253 any\n\nmore than Slack itself.    Cases from our sister circuits look in the\n\nsame direction. Gibson v. Klinger, 232 F.3d 799, 802-03 (10th Cir.\n\n2000); Lambright v. Stewart, 220 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (9th Cir.\n\n2000);    cf. Hernandez v. Caldwell, 225 F.3d 435, 438 (4th Cir.\n\n2000); Roberts v. Sutton, 217 F.3d 1337, 1339-40 (11th Cir. 2000).\n\n           On remand, Mateo may attempt to develop his supposed\n\nconstitutional claim or offer only a non-constitutional claim or\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fboth.   The prospect of a constitutional argument is needed to\n\npermit the COA to be granted; but once back in district court Mateo\n\nis   free--on   a   first   section   2255    motion--to   proffer   non-\n\nconstitutional claims. Section 2255, which governs federal habeas,\n\nextends beyond constitutional claims.        The critical language reads\n\nas follows:\n\n                 A prisoner in custody under sentence of\n          a court established by Act of Congress\n          claiming the right to be released upon the\n          ground that the sentence was imposed in\n          violation of the Constitution or laws of the\n          United States, or that the court was without\n          jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that\n          the sentence was in excess of the maximum\n          authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to\n          collateral attack, may move the court which\n          imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or\n          correct the sentence.\n\n          Admittedly, this language has been construed somewhat\n\nless generously than the words alone might suggest.         The reference\n\nto \"laws\" and \"otherwise subject to collateral attack\" might at\n\nfirst seem to encompass any non-constitutional legal error, but the\n\nSupreme Court has limited claims of legal error--where neither a\n\nconstitutional nor a jurisdictional claim is presented--to alleged\n\nerrors that present \"a fundamental defect which inherently results\n\nin a complete miscarriage of justice\" or \"an omission inconsistent\n\nwith the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\"           Hill v. United\n\nStates, 368 U.S. 424, 428 (1962); accord David v. United States,\n\n134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir. 1998).      We have ourselves held that \"a\n\nguideline violation alone is not automatically a basis for relief\"\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fin a section 2255 proceeding.          Cofske v. United States, 290 F.3d\n\n437, 441 (1st Cir. 2002); see also Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d\n\n769, 772-73 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          On    remand,    the     district      court       will    be     faced       with\n\nformidably     interesting     issues,       assuming    that        no     superceding\n\nconstitutional claim is developed.                   Quite likely federal law\n\ncontrols the question whether the nunc pro tunc order of the\n\nMassachusetts court is to be given any effect for the purpose of\n\nthe   Sentencing      Guidelines.2        Cf.    Jamison,         244      F.3d    at    48\n\n(discussing     the    relevance     of      state     vacations           for    federal\n\nsentencing);    Fierro    v.   Reno,   217      F.3d    1,    6     (1st    Cir.    2000)\n\n(applying federal law as to whether a state nunc pro tunc order is\n\nrelevant for the purpose of citizenship status).                     If it does, the\n\nanswer then may depend on the ground on which the Massachusetts\n\ncourt acted.    U.S.S.G. §§ 4A1.2(j), 4A1.3; id. § 4A1.2 nn. 6 & 10.\n\nAnd, obviously, the government could argue--though we express no\n\nview as to the merits of such an argument--that one who commits a\n\nnew offense while under sentence for an older one deserves a higher\n\nsentence even if the former conviction is later set aside.                              Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Snyder, 235 F.3d 42, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2000) (later\n\n      2\n      There is Supreme Court caselaw on the choice of law issue,\ninterpreting the statute governing felon possession of firearms.\nIn drawing guidance from these cases, account must be taken of the\nstatutory amendment that occurred in 1986.     Compare Dickerson v.\nNew Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U.S. 103, 112 (1983), superceded by\nFirearms Owners' Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 99-308, § 101(5), 100\nStat. 449, 450 (1986) (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20) (2000));\nwith Caron v. United States, 524 U.S. 308, 312-17 (1998).\n\n                                       -7-\n\fvacation of predicate state conviction does not invalidate federal\n\nfelon possession conviction), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 2205 (2001).\n\n          If there was an error at all, a further sentencing\n\nquestion is whether such \"error\" is cognizable in a section 2255\n\nproceeding.   In our circuit, our decision in United States v.\n\nPettiford, 101 F.3d 199, 201 (1st Cir. 1996), see also Brackett v.\n\nUnited States, 270 F.3d 60, 64 n.1 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied\n\n122 S. Ct. 1575 (2002), might be taken to have answered, helpfully\n\nto Mateo, the question left open by the Supreme Court in   Daniels\n\nv. United States, 532 U.S. 374, 382-83 (2001) and Custis v. United\n\nStates, 511 U.S. 485, 491-92 (1994).      However, the limitations\n\nimposed by Hill and Knight arguably remain.\n\n          In short, this case is one of potential importance as\n\nwell as difficulty.   We have mentioned the problems encountered in\n\na preliminary look to be sure that they are noticed by counsel; but\n\nit is unwise for us to express any firm view, partly because they\n\nhave not yet been briefed and partly because any constitutional\n\nclaim Mateo may develop on remand could affect the equation.   It is\n\nenough for the present that accepting responsibility ourselves for\n\nany confusion caused by Mateo I, we grant the COA, summarily vacate\n\nthe judgment of the district court dismissing the petition for\n\nsection 2255 relief, and remand for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

The district court found that Mateo's offenses occurred at a time when he was the subject of an outstanding state warrant for probation violation. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, this equates to the commission of a federal crime while under sentence for another crime and raised Mateo's criminal history score and (in all likelihood) his ultimate federal sentence. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 4A1.1(d), 4A1.2(m). After being sentenced, Mateo filed a notice of appeal and, while the appeal was pending, succeeded in obtaining a state court termination of the probation warrant <i>nunc pro tunc</i> to a time apparently before the alleged federal offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, this court declined to consider the state court order. <i>United States v.

The court said that it was procedurally barred from addressing the <i>nunc pro tunc</i> order because, as the order was issued <i>after</i> the district court imposed its sentence, a proffer of the order was not made below. <i>Id.</i> at 15. The opinion continued, \"[E]ven were we to consider the <i>nunc pro tunc</i> order, [Mateo] would not be advantaged,\" because under federal law \"the district court takes the state-court record as it finds it.\" <i>Id.</i> at n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mateo then petitioned under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 (2000), raising the same claim that was denied on direct appeal. The section 2255 motion was denied by the district court, which felt itself foreclosed under <i>Mateo I</i> from considering a collateral attack based on the vacated state warrant. Mateo now seeks a certificate of appealability (\"COA\") from this court under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 2253, Mateo must make a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\" before a COA can be granted. Here his habeas petition was denied based on the district court's interpretation of <i>Mateo I</i>'s mandate, a nonconstitutional ground. Thus, section 2253 would appear on its face to bar us from issuing a COA. However, the Supreme Court has held that the statute permits a COA to be granted where a supposed antecedent procedural bar prevented the district court from reaching the constitutional claim &#8212; if (1) the soundness of the procedural ruling is debatable, and (2) the constitutional claim is also colorable. <i>Slack v.

But here the main holding in <i>Mateo I</i> does not apply because the state court order now is part of the record. As for the further comment quoted above &#8212; that Mateo would not be advantaged even had we considered the <i>nunc pro tunc</i> order &#8212; we think this meant only that the district court had not erred as the record before it stood; the court in <i>Mateo I</i> should not be taken to have decided in a brief comment a very difficult set of substantive issues concerning the consequence of a post-sentencing vacation of a state sentence that affected the federal sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Slack</i>'s second requirement &#8212; that there be a plausible constitutional claim before a COA can be granted &#8212; is a more serious problem for Mateo. Let us assume <i>arguendo</i> (we will return to this issue) that the later vacation of the state order renders Mateo's federal sentence vulnerable in a section 2255 proceeding, even though the sentencing judge acted properly on the record before her. Even so, it is hard to see why this raises a <i>constitutional</i> question, especially as Mateo makes no claim to us that the state court probation warrant was itself constitutionally defective.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why Congress chose to limit COAs to constitutional defects is not entirely apparent. <i>Cf.</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(b)(2) (2000) (limiting second habeas petitions to new rule of constitutional law or newly discovered evidence); <i>Jamison v.
