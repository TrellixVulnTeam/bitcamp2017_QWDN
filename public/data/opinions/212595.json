Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                   Torruella, Boudin and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joshua L. Gordon on brief for appellant.\n     Seth R. Aframe, Assistant United States Attorney, and John P.\nKacavas, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             March 17, 2011\n\f           Per Curiam. In the aftermath of a home invasion in which\n\na victim was beaten and prescription drugs were stolen, Raymond\n\nCole pled guilty to drug and Hobbs Act offenses in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1) & 844 and 18 U.S.C. § 1951.       The plea agreement\n\nmemorialized a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea, i.e., an agreement containing\n\na recommendation that would bind the district court once the court\n\naccepted the plea agreement - a \"C-type\" plea.\n\n           The plea agreement did not reference any criminal history\n\ncategory, potential offense level, or calculation based on the\n\nsentencing guidelines. That is, it did not attempt any computation\n\nof   any   potential   offense   level   and   it   made   no   projected\n\ndetermination of any likely sentencing range under the guidelines.\n\nRather, the agreement simply recited that:\n\n\n                The parties agree that the defendant\n                will be sentenced to a term of\n                imprisonment which may not be less\n                than ten and one-half (10½) years\n                nor more than fifteen (15) years.\n                The parties agree that the United\n                States will request that the Court\n                sentence defendant to a fifteen (15)\n                year term of imprisonment.\n\n           A Presentence Report (PSR) was prepared and the court\n\nsustained Cole's objection to a 2 level adjustment for a vulnerable\n\nvictim, but, nonetheless, remarked that nothing turned on the\n\nvulnerable victim calculation because the case involved a C-type\n\nplea. The resulting sentencing range as calculated by reference to\n\nthe guidelines was 120-150 months.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            In accordance with the plea agreement, Cole argued for a\n\n10½ year sentence, while the government argued for a 15 year\n\nsentence.    The court opined that the C-type plea agreement was\n\nreasonable and that the high end was particularly warranted, noting\n\nthat this home invasion, in which violent infliction of serious\n\nphysical    injury   occurred,    encompassed     robbery     of   a   victim's\n\nprescription drugs; that the crime was calculated and deliberate in\n\nits commission; that Cole had demonstrated through his criminal\n\nhistory and his parole violations that he was unable or unwilling\n\nto comply with the requirements of the law and that there was a\n\nneed to protect society from future violent crimes from Cole who\n\nwas a recidivist.     The court, therefore, sentenced Cole to a 15\n\nyear term of imprisonment.\n\n            On   appeal,   Cole   argues   that    the   15   year     term   of\n\nimprisonment constituted a variance from the guidelines -- the 15\n\nyear (180 months) term exceeded the high end of the otherwise\n\napplicable guideline range (120-150 months) by 30 months -- and\n\nthat the district court erred in imposing a variance in absence of\n\nthe 4 day notice required by Local Criminal Rule of the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of New Hampshire Rule\n\n32.1(i) (\"LCrR 32.1(i)\").\n\nThat rule provides:\n\n                  Any party requesting a departure\n                  under the sentencing guidelines\n                  and/or a variance must file a motion\n                  specifying the grounds for relief\n\n                                    -3-\n\f                    and   legal   authority    for   the\n                    departure and/or variance. This\n                    motion shall be filed no later than\n                    four (4) days prior to the scheduled\n                    sentencing, and a copy shall be\n                    served upon opposing counsel and the\n                    probation officer.\n\n              Cole concedes that Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(h) does not\n\nrequire notice in advance of a court's imposition of a variance\n\nfrom the guideline range.        Irizarry v. United States, 553 U.S. 708\n\n(2008).      So, instead, he relies solely on LCrR 32.1(i).        Cole also\n\nconcedes that the issue was not preserved below, so review is for\n\nplain error.\n\n              Cole's reliance on LCrR 32.1(i) is misplaced because the\n\nsentence was not a variance at all.          As the district court made\n\nclear   at    the   sentencing   hearing,   he   was   not   sentencing   Cole\n\npursuant to the sentencing guidelines or based on any variance from\n\nthose guidelines. Rather, the court sentenced Cole pursuant to his\n\nC-type plea and the stipulated sentencing range contained in that\n\nplea agreement (which was agreed to without any reference at all to\n\nthe sentencing guidelines).        See United States v. Rivera-Martinez,\n\n607 F.3d 283 (1st Cir. 2010), (concluding that a sentence is based\n\non the C-type agreement, notwithstanding the fact that the district\n\ncourt may also be required to compute a corresponding sentencing\n\nrange pursuant to the sentencing guidelines), petition for cert.\n\nfiled, 79 U.S.L.W. 3062 (U.S. Jul 19, 2010) (No. 10-113).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           In any event, even were LCrR 32.1(i) applicable, and\n\nassuming dubitante the legitimacy of Cole's claim that the plea\n\nagreement would not constitute notice sufficient for purposes of\n\nLCrR 32.1(i), it was not plain error for the district court to\n\nimpose the 15 year sentence despite the alleged absence of the 4\n\nday notice.   The characteristics of plain error are familiar: (1)\n\nan error that (2) was clear or obvious and which not only (3)\n\naffected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings. See, e.g., United States v. Vargas-de-Jesus, 618 F.3d\n\n59, 67 (1st Cir. 2010).    Even if this standard is met, a reviewing\n\ncourt may, but is not required to, afford relief.            Id.   Cole's\n\nclaim falters on several of the plain error prongs.\n\n           Assuming the district court erred in imposing the 15 year\n\nsentence in the absence of the notice required by LCrR 32.1(i),\n\nthat error was neither clear nor obvious.      While the provisions of\n\nLCrR 32.1(i) are clearly applicable to a request for a variant\n\nsentence, it was neither clear nor obvious that LCrR 32.1 (i) would\n\nalso apply to a C-type plea agreement that was not in any way\n\ndependent on any guideline calculation.\n\n           Further, it is hard to see how Cole was prejudiced by the\n\nlack of notice.   Were we to find error, a notice deficiency could\n\nbe easily cured upon remand.       Cole, however, appears to contend\n\n(without   citation   to   any   authority)   that,   upon   remand,   the\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fgovernment would be barred from curing any deficiency.   Rather, he\n\nargues that, since he prevailed in his objection to the vulnerable\n\nvictim adjustment, he should get the benefit of the reduction it\n\nproduced and the appropriate remedy is a resentencing \"with orders\n\nthat the non-noticed variance cannot be employed.\"   In effect, he\n\nwants the sentencing range capped at 150 months (which was the high\n\nend of the sentencing range calculated pursuant to the guidelines\n\nwithout the vulnerable victim adjustment) even though, in his C-\n\ntype agreement, he stipulated to a sentencing range of 10½ - 15\n\nyears (126-180 months).    Cole also ignores the district court's\n\nrumination that, in the absence of the C-type agreement, it likely\n\nwould have departed upward from 15 years.\n\n            Lastly, even were there error in sentencing Cole to 15\n\nyears without the prior notice provided by LCrR 32.1(i), it does\n\nnot seriously impair the fairness, integrity, or public reputation\n\nof the judicial proceedings to sentence Cole in conformity with a\n\nplea agreement in which he freely and voluntarily stipulated that\n\na sentence of 15 years was within the range of the agreed-to\n\nsentencing range and would be the sentence that the government\n\nwould request.\n\n            The judgment and sentence of the district court is\n\naffirmed.
