This is an unusually complex\n\ndenial of benefits case that arises under the Employee Retirement\n\nIncome Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461.     The\n\ndefendant is a multi-employer pension plan (\"BSA-ILA\" or \"the\n\nPlan\"), and at issue is a decision by its Board of Trustees (\"the\n\nBoard\") to deny disability benefits to a former employee, Paul\n\nBard.   The district court upheld this denial.   We reverse and order\n\nan award of benefits.\n\n            In so doing, we do not reach Bard's invitation to join\n\nthose circuits holding that a plan's ERISA violations will strip it\n\nof the deference its decisions otherwise enjoy.      Rather, using a\n\nmodel of analysis previously employed by this circuit, we hold that\n\nBard was prejudiced by the Plan's numerous regulatory violations,\n\nand that on the particular facts here he is entitled to the remedy\n\nof an award of benefits.\n\n                                 I.\n\n            Bard worked as a crane operator on the Boston docks for\n\nsome 30 years.    On July 16, 2001, he was involved in a workplace\n\naccident.   As Bard had a history of substance abuse and was working\n\nunder a \"last chance agreement,\" he was subjected to a post-\n\naccident drug test.      He tested positive.     His employment was\n\naccordingly terminated on July 23, 2001.\n\n            Bard sought medical treatment, and his doctors diagnosed\n\nhim as suffering from a variety of psychological disorders that\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fmade him disabled and unable to work.1            Before applying for\n\ndisability benefits from the Plan, Bard applied for Social Security\n\ndisability benefits on November 26, 2001.         His Social Security\n\nclaim was initially denied.       However, on May 10, 2003, after a\n\nhearing at which Bard presented additional evidence, an ALJ issued\n\na written opinion awarding Bard disability benefits on the basis\n\nthat Bard had been suffering from a \"severe\" disability since July\n\n22, 2001 -- one day before Bard received his termination letter.\n\n          Armed with this finding, Bard applied for disability\n\nbenefits from BSA-ILA. The troubled journey of that application is\n\ndescribed below.2\n\nA.        The Plan's Structure and Documents\n\n          BSA-ILA   is   a   multi-employer   employee   benefits   plan,\n\nregulated by ERISA, and governed by a Board of Trustees composed of\n\n14 members.   Seven members are management trustees selected by the\n\nBoston Shipping Association, and seven are union trustees selected\n\nby the International Longshoremen's Association.         If the trustees\n\n\n     1\n       It appears from the record that Bard's condition was\nprimarily psychological in nature, and there are references in the\nrecord to \"severe depression,\" \"anxiety disorder,\" \"bipolar\ndisorder,\" and \"a history of substance abuse.\" There are limited\nreferences to some physical problems, including psoriasis and\npsoriatic arthritis.\n     2\n       The administrative record we have been provided is unusually\nobscured. To the extent any relevant documents are missing, it was\nthe Plan's responsibility, as keeper of the records, see 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1059(a)(2), to provide those documents. As we discuss later, a\nnumber of required notices are not present in the record. No party\ncontends that these notices were in fact given.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fdeadlock    on   an   issue,   an   \"impartial   umpire\"     selected   by   the\n\ntrustees will cast the deciding vote.            A plan provision declares\n\nthat \"[e]xcept as provided by ERISA, all decisions of the Board,\n\nincluding all those made in the interpretation and administration\n\nof the Plan, shall be conclusive, final and binding.\"\n\n            For disability benefits, plan documents state that a\n\nclaimant is eligible for these benefits if he, or she, is a\n\n\"Participant who has completed fifteen . . . Years of Service [and]\n\nbecomes totally and permanently disabled.\"          The Plan also provides\n\nthat \"[t]he Board, upon competent medical evidence, shall be the\n\nsole judge of whether a Participant is disabled.\"                    The word\n\n\"Participant\" is defined in the Plan to mean \"an Employee who has\n\nmet the requirements of eligibility to participate in the Plan.\"\n\n\"Employee\" is in turn defined as \"each individual who now, or\n\nhereafter is employed as a Longshoreman, Clerk, or Linehandler in\n\nthe industry and is a member of the ILA and for whom an Employer is\n\nrequired to make contributions\" to the Plan. Nothing in the Plan's\n\ndocuments    explicitly    states    that   an   applicant    for   disability\n\nbenefits must have become disabled at a time when he was still\n\nemployed.\n\n            The administrative record contains what appears to be the\n\nsummary plan description (SPD). See 29 U.S.C. § 1022(a) (requiring\n\nan ERISA plan to provide information about the plan \"written in a\n\nmanner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fand . . . sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably\n\napprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and\n\nobligations under the plan\").        That SPD states that \"[t]o be\n\neligible [for disability benefits] you must: [(1)] Have completed\n\n15 Years of Pension Service at the time you became disabled . . .\n\n[and (2)] Demonstrate to the Board by submission on approved forms\n\nof competent medical evidence that you are permanently and totally\n\ndisabled.\"    Nothing in the SPD states that the claimant must have\n\nbeen disabled at a time when he was still employed.            The SPD is\n\ndated April 1988, and there is no evidence that the Plan ever\n\nupdated its SPD, or, if so, that any updated description was\n\nprovided to Bard.\n\nB.          Bard's First Benefits Application\n\n            Sometime   between   August   and   October   of   2003,   Bard\n\nnotified BSA-ILA that he wanted to apply for disability benefits in\n\naccordance with the Plan's provisions.           Bard's initial letter\n\nstated that he had been diagnosed with manic depression, \"which the\n\ndoctor felt was a chronic on going [sic] problem for many years,\"\n\nand that the Social Security Administration had found him mentally\n\ndisabled.    The record does not reveal whether Bard provided any\n\ndocumentation along with this letter.\n\n            At its regular meeting on October 29, 2003, the Board\n\ndetermined that Bard was not eligible to apply for a disability\n\npension.    The Board's minutes refer to a prior arbitration, dated\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fJuly 15, 2002, which had rejected an application for disability\n\nbenefits from a claimant named Gerard McLaughlin (the \"McLaughlin\n\narbitration\").    The Board read the McLaughlin arbitration to mean\n\nthat an individual who was no longer employed was ineligible to\n\neven   apply   for   a   disability       pension.       It   also    apparently\n\ninterpreted this arbitration to mean that an employee is only\n\neligible for benefits if he became totally and permanently disabled\n\nwhile still employed.      We note that the Board had never amended the\n\nSPD to reflect these points, and Bard had no prior notice of the\n\nBoard's reading.\n\n           It is also not clear that this was the correct reading.\n\nThe McLaughlin decision, which is in the record, relied heavily on\n\nminutes from a February 1993 Board meeting in which the Board\n\napparently denied a claim from a former employee named Paul Cocchi\n\n(the \"Cocchi claim\") because the \"onset\" of Cocchi's disabling\n\ncondition had occurred after Cocchi had left employment.                    Finding\n\nMcLaughlin's case indistinguishable from Cocchi's, the arbitrator\n\ndenied McLaughlin's claim.      Importantly, the decision specifically\n\ndeclined to extend itself to a situation where an employee \"leaves\n\nemployment because of the onset of a disabling condition that\n\nbecomes   total   and    permanent   at     a   later   date.\"       This    nuance\n\napparently went unnoticed by the Board, and it is unclear if Bard\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fwas ever given an opportunity to dispute the Board's reading of the\n\nMcLaughlin arbitration.3\n\nC.        The First Denial and Bard's Attempted Review\n\n          The record contains no evidence that the Board's first\n\ndenial of benefits, or its specific reasons for that denial, were\n\ncommunicated to Bard in writing or by electronic means.    This was\n\nin contravention of federal regulations. See 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-\n\n1(g)(1) (requiring \"written or electronic notification\" of any\n\ninitial \"adverse benefit determination\"); id. § 2560.503-1(g)(1)(i)\n\n(requiring that this notification explain the specific reasons on\n\nwhich the determination was based).   By some means, however, Bard\n\nlearned the outcome of the Board's first decision, although not\n\nnecessarily its reasoning, as Bard took an administrative appeal in\n\nlate 2003 to challenge the Board's initial determination.\n\n          The appeal apparently went to the Board because it had\n\nfailed to provide for an independent appellate body.      This also\n\ncontravened regulations.   See id. § 2560.503-1(h)(3)(ii), (h)(4)\n\n(requiring that an appeal be decided, without any deference to the\n\nprior determination, by an appropriate plan fiduciary \"who is\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       There is also no evidence that a copy of the McLaughlin\narbitration decision was sent to Bard in conjunction with the\ninitial rejection of his application. Indeed, it is unclear from\nthe record if Bard was ever given access to the text of the\nMcLaughlin arbitration until after this litigation had commenced.\nMoreover, the meeting minutes from the Cocchi claim, on which the\nMcLaughlin arbitrator relied, are not in the record at all.\n\n                               -7-\n\fneither the individual who made the [initial] adverse benefit\n\ndetermination . . . nor the subordinate of such individual\").\n\n          During January 2004, Bard also submitted an application\n\nfor disability benefits on a BSA-ILA form, along with medical\n\ndocumentation regarding his disability.    Some of the documentation\n\nstated that Bard was \"totally and permanently disabled,\" but did\n\nnot date the onset of symptoms or of total disability.    However, a\n\nletter from Dr. Alba De Simone and Dr. Kishanlal Chakrabarti stated\n\nthat Bard had become disabled in December of 2001.       At the time\n\nBard submitted this letter, it appears that he understood the Plan\n\nto require him to demonstrate that he was disabled, but not that he\n\nwas disabled while still employed.    There is no evidence that, as\n\nof this point in time, the Board had yet informed Bard of the\n\nreasons for its initial rejection of his application, as it was\n\nrequired to do.\n\n          The trustees again considered Bard's case at a January\n\n30, 2004 meeting.   This time they debated the substantive question\n\nof whether Bard's application should be approved. They deadlocked.\n\nThey asked that the Plan's attorney be present at the next meeting\n\nto advise them.\n\n          After the January 30th meeting, but before the next Board\n\nmeeting, it appears that Bard had additional medical information\n\nfaxed to the Board: a medical report from a counselor at Lawless &\n\nCompany (a counseling service provider).    This report stated that\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fBard had received treatment for substance abuse in March of 2000.\n\nThe report also stated that as of that month, which was more than\n\na year before Bard's crane accident, Bard had shown symptoms\n\nconsistent       with     various    psychological          disorders,    though       the\n\ncounselor had declined to make a final diagnosis.\n\n               The Board, at its February 25, 2004 meeting, continued\n\nconsidering the substantive question of whether or not Bard should\n\nreceive       disability    benefits.           The   trustees,      following     their\n\ninterpretation of the McLaughlin arbitration, questioned whether\n\nBard    had    been     totally   and    permanently        disabled    prior    to    his\n\ntermination. The trustees weighed the fact that Drs. De Simone and\n\nChakrabarti had placed December 2001 as the date on which Bard\n\nbecame totally disabled.             The Board also considered whether Bard\n\ncould    have     been     totally      and    permanently      disabled       prior   to\n\ntermination if he had been working right up until the day he was\n\nfired.    A vote was taken and the trustees again deadlocked, seven\n\nto seven.       There is no evidence that the Board took any further\n\naction on Bard's application for approximately the next four\n\nmonths,       despite    applicable      regulatory     time    limits.         See    id.\n\n§ 2560.503-1(i)(3)(ii).\n\n               Bard retained counsel, and on June 28, 2004, his attorney\n\nsent BSA-ILA a letter requesting all documents relevant to Bard's\n\napplication.          Meeting     minutes      from   the    three     Board    meetings\n\ndiscussing Bard apparently were sent in response to this request,\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\falong with other documents.    It was only at this point, or through\n\nverbal representations made to Bard some time after the January or\n\nFebruary 2004 meetings, that Bard learned of the Plan's apparent\n\nrequirement that he have become totally and permanently disabled\n\nwhile still employed.\n\nD.        The August 2004 Submissions\n\n          On August 16, 2004, Bard's attorney sent the Plan a\n\nletter requesting that Bard's application be considered at the next\n\nBoard meeting.    Bard also submitted additional evidence, including\n\nmedical evidence that Bard had become totally and permanently\n\ndisabled prior to the July 23, 2001 termination of his employment.\n\nSpecifically, Bard included a letter from Dr. Elliott Segal stating\n\nthat Dr. Segal had treated Bard between October 2, 2001, and March\n\n4, 2002, and that in Dr. Segal's opinion Bard had become totally\n\nand permanently disabled prior to termination of his employment.\n\nBard also included a revised letter from Drs. De Simone and\n\nChakrabarti, dated June 23, 2004, in which they now said Bard had\n\nbeen disabled at least since March 21, 2000.     Additionally, Bard\n\nsubmitted the Social Security Administration's determination that\n\nhe had become disabled as of the day before he was terminated from\n\nemployment.4     Finally, Bard submitted his own affidavit stating,\n\ninter alia, that due to his mental health condition he believed\n\n\n     4\n       It is not clear from the record whether Bard submitted only\nthe Social Security Agency's ultimate determination, or whether he\nalso submitted the full text of the ALJ's report.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthat he had been unable to work \"in any gainful way\" since 2000,\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that he had been employed.\n\n             The trustees again considered Bard's application at their\n\nAugust 25, 2004 meeting. At the January and February meetings, the\n\ntrustees had apparently considered the substantive question of\n\nBard's eligibility for benefits.           At this meeting, however, the\n\ntrustees appear to have reverted back to considering the procedural\n\nquestion of whether Bard was even eligible to apply for disability\n\nbenefits;     on   that   issue   the   management    and   union    trustees\n\ndeadlocked, seven to seven.       The Board decided to submit the issue\n\nto arbitration.\n\nE.           Suit, Arbitration, and Ultimate Denial\n\n             Frustrated with the delay, Bard filed suit on September\n\n7,   2004,   in    federal   district   court   in   Massachusetts    seeking\n\nbenefits under the Plan.\n\n             While that suit was pending, on December 20, 2004, a\n\nhearing was held before an arbitrator on the issue of Bard's\n\neligibility to apply for benefits. One of the management trustees'\n\nkey arguments was that because Bard had been working as a crane\n\noperator up until his termination date, Bard clearly had not been\n\ntotally and permanently disabled prior to termination.              Thus these\n\ntrustees saw no need to allow Bard even to apply for benefits.\n\n             In a written decision dated March 4, 2005, the arbitrator\n\nrejected the management trustees' position.           He decided that Bard\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fwas eligible to apply for benefits because he was now alleging that\n\nhis total disability occurred prior to his termination.                          The\n\narbitrator     also    explained      that     the   issue   of   whether   Bard's\n\napplication should be approved on the merits was not an issue\n\npresented to him for review.            The management trustees' argument\n\nwent to the merits of Bard's claim, not to the procedural question\n\nof Bard's eligibility to apply.\n\n              By now it was at least 17 months after Bard first applied\n\nfor benefits from the Plan.           The Board, accepting the arbitrator's\n\ndecision that Bard was eligible to apply, then considered the\n\nmerits of Bard's application at its meeting on March 23, 2005.                    By\n\na vote of ten to four, the trustees rejected the application.                    The\n\nmeeting minutes do not state the Board's reasons for its decision.\n\nOn April 28, 2005, the Board sent Bard a letter communicating the\n\ndenial of benefits.        The sole reason for decision stated in the\n\nletter was that \"Pursuant to Article VIII (Disability Benefits)\" of\n\nthe Plan, the Board \"in its sole judgement\" had determined that\n\nBard   \"was    not    totally   and   permanently      disabled    prior    to   his\n\ntermination.\"        No explanation was provided in the letter as to the\n\nreasons for the Board's determination. The letter also stated that\n\nBard had the right to \"appeal\" the decision to the Board.\n\n              Both parties then moved for summary judgment in the\n\nfederal court action.       In a decision issued on March 16, 2006, the\n\ndistrict court granted BSA-ILA's motion and denied Bard's.                       The\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fcourt first reasoned that the Plan was entitled to the deferential\n\narbitrary and capricious standard of review because plan provisions\n\ngave the Board discretionary authority to interpret the Plan's\n\nterms and to make disability determinations.             Under that standard,\n\nthe district court found that the Plan could reasonably have\n\ndetermined, based on the evidence before it, that Bard was not\n\ntotally and permanently disabled prior to termination of his\n\nemployment.        Additionally, the district court rejected Bard's\n\nargument that the Plan's terms did not actually require a claimant\n\nto have been disabled prior to termination.5\n\n                                         II.\n\n               We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.       Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 404 F.3d 510, 516\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).      In the ERISA context, summary judgment is merely\n\na vehicle for deciding the case; the factual determination of\n\neligibility for benefits is decided solely on the administrative\n\nrecord, and \"the non-moving party is not entitled to the usual\n\ninferences in its favor.\"         Id. at 517.\n\n               While our review of the district court's decision is de\n\nnovo,    our    standard   of   review    for   the   Board's   decision   is   a\n\n\n     5\n       The district court also denied Bard's request, made in light\nof the Plan's delays, that the administrative record be limited to\nonly those documents in the record at the time Bard's lawsuit was\nfiled.   The court noted that \"there is no evidence of material\nnoncompliance by the Board\" and that \"in any event, the\nadministrative record proposed by plaintiff does not support his\nposition.\"\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdifferent issue entirely.   The parties dispute whether the Board's\n\ndetermination should be reviewed under a de novo standard or under\n\nthe deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.\n\n          Generally, our review of a benefits determination will be\n\nhighly deferential when a plan's terms clearly grant its decision\n\nmakers the discretionary authority to interpret the plan and\n\ndetermine eligibility for benefits.   See Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145\n\nF.3d 28, 37, 40 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying deferential review to\n\nboth plan interpretation and eligibility determinations). The BSA-\n\nILA plan has both a grant of discretion to interpret the Plan and\n\na grant of discretion to determine disability.\n\n          Nevertheless, when Bard had first filed this lawsuit, the\n\nPlan had not yet resolved his benefits claim despite a significant\n\npassage of time.   Faced with no decision from the Board, Bard\n\nbrought suit on a \"deemed exhausted\" basis,6 similar to what was\n\nknown as a \"deemed denied\" basis under the old ERISA regulations.7\n\n\n     6\n       BSA-ILA has expressly waived any claim that Bard failed to\nexhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit.\n     7\n        In 2000, the ERISA regulations were revised, and the\nlanguage about claims being \"deemed denied\" was deleted. Compare\n29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(e)(2), (h)(4) (2000) (providing that if an\nERISA plan does not make a decision within ERISA's time limits \"the\nclaim shall be deemed denied\"), with 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(l)\n(2006) (providing that if a plan fails to follow ERISA's procedural\nrequirements, including its time limits, \"a claimant shall be\ndeemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available\nunder the plan and shall be entitled to pursue any available\nremedies under section 502(a) of [ERISA] on the basis that the plan\nhas failed to provide a reasonable claims procedure that would\nyield a decision on the merits of the claim\"). Bard's claim, filed\n\n                               -14-\n\fSee Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 144 (1985)\n\n(discussing \"deemed denied\" claims).         Cases from other circuits,\n\nall governed by the old ERISA regulations, have held that a de novo\n\nstandard of review may be proper in deemed denial cases -- though\n\nsome of these cases have also examined whether there has been\n\n\"substantial compliance\" with ERISA and/or the plan's terms.8\n\n           Our consistent approach in ERISA cases has been to eschew\n\nautomatic rules and to evaluate each case on its own.        See, e.g.,\n\nBuffonge v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 426 F.3d 20, 31 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (taking a case-by-case approach to determining the proper\n\nERISA remedy); Glista v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., 378 F.3d 113,\n\n130-31   (1st   Cir.   2004)   (taking   a   case-by-case   approach   to\n\naddressing a plan's attempt to articulate in litigation a new basis\n\nfor the denial of benefits).\n\n           Here, it is easy to understand why a multi-employer\n\npension plan, whose trustees are equally divided between labor and\n\n\n\nafter January 1, 2002, is governed by the new regulations.        See 29\nC.F.R. § 2560.503-1(o)(1).\n     8\n       See, e.g., Nichols v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 406 F.3d\n98, 109 (2d Cir. 2005); Jebian v. Hewlett-Packard Co. Employee\nBenefits Org. Income Prot. Plan, 349 F.3d 1098, 1105-08 (9th Cir.\n2003); Gilbertson v. Allied Signal, Inc., 328 F.3d 625, 631 (10th\nCir. 2003); Gritzer v. CBS, Inc., 275 F.3d 291, 295-96 (3d Cir.\n2002); cf. McGarrah v. Hartford Life Ins. Co., 234 F.3d 1026, 1031\n(8th Cir. 2000) (examining whether procedural irregularities raise\na serious question that the plan's decision was arbitrary and\nunconsidered). But see S. Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co. v. Moore, 993\nF.2d 98, 101 (5th Cir. 1993) (applying deferential review to deemed\ndenied claims).\n\n                                  -15-\n\fmanagement, would not be as efficient as a single decision-maker.\n\nAt the same time, it is not clear that the ERISA regulatory\n\nstructure intends to give multi-employer plans the kind of slack\n\nthat the Plan appropriated for itself in this case.   Cf. 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 2560.503-1(i)(3)(ii) (outlining special time limits, applicable\n\nonly to multi-employer plans, for a plan to decide a disability\n\nbenefits appeal and notify the claimant).\n\n          Ultimately, we do not decide whether the Plan's failure\n\nto render a timely decision by itself entitles Bard to de novo\n\nreview, whether the Plan's eventual benefits denial after suit was\n\nfiled was in \"substantial compliance\" with ERISA's time limits and\n\nother regulations, or whether inquiry into \"substantial compliance\"\n\nis even relevant in ERISA cases of this nature -- whether brought\n\nunder the new regulations or otherwise.     Those are complicated\n\nquestions on which the circuits have divided.      See Nichols v.\n\nPrudential Ins. Co. of Am., 406 F.3d 98, 106-10 (2d Cir. 2005)\n\n(discussing the different positions taken).    Instead, in keeping\n\nwith our case-by-case approach, we tailor our resolution of the\n\nissues to the unique facts presented.\n\n                               III.\n\n          This case reveals substantial confusion on the Plan's\n\npart about the basic eligibility requirements for applying for\n\nbenefits, the substantive standard for awarding benefits, and the\n\nprocedures for taking an administrative appeal from the denial of\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fbenefits.     We evaluate the Plan's procedural missteps in light of\n\nERISA's requirement that plans provide clear notice to potential\n\nclaimants of their substantive and procedural rights.\n\n             The need for clear notice pervades the ERISA regulatory\n\nstructure.     For example, one of the key purposes of an SPD is to\n\nstate   in   normal   everyday   language   both    what   the   eligibility\n\nrequirements are, and what procedures the claimant must follow.\n\nSee 29 U.S.C. § 1022(a).     Similarly, when a plan denies benefits,\n\nit is required to provide a notification that sets forth \"specific\n\nreasons for such a denial, written in a manner calculated to be\n\nunderstood by the participant.\"          Id. § 1133; see also 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 2560.503-1(g)(1) (requiring that the notification of a denial of\n\nbenefits provide its explanation \"in a manner calculated to be\n\nunderstood by the claimant\").           The Plan's documents themselves\n\nrequire that in the event of a benefits denial, BSA-ILA must\n\nprovide the claimant with notice that sets forth \"[t]he specific\n\nreason or reasons for the denial\" and makes \"[s]pecific reference\n\nto the pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based.\"\n\n             We focus on two pertinent points in evaluating the lack\n\nof clarity and notice to Bard: Bard's reliance on a reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the Plan, and the ultimate effect of the lack of\n\nclarity and notice.\n\n             The   first   point   is     that     the   Board's    ultimate\n\ninterpretation of the Plan -- that a claimant must be permanently\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fand totally disabled before the termination of employment -- is not\n\nat all self-evident from the Plan's language.                        Bard's contrary\n\nreading is reasonable, and it was not unreasonable for Bard, in the\n\nabsence of clarification from the SPD, to rely on that reading in\n\nsubmitting    his     initial     supporting        medical    documentation.            Of\n\ncourse, the fact that a plan provision is capable of different\n\nreadings would not alone negate deference to the Plan.\n\n            The   second     point     rests     on    the    first.      The      Board's\n\nhandling of the Plan's ambiguity, and its failure to comply with\n\nERISA's   requirements,          caused      substantive      prejudice       to   Bard's\n\napplication      going    well    beyond      the     costs   of   delay.          In   the\n\nparticular circumstances of this case, Bard was faced with a\n\nconstant shift in what he was required to show.                    And then BSA-ILA\n\nmade matters worse by failing to consider the evidence he submitted\n\nin an attempt to meet a moving target.\n\n            As    a   result      of   the    Plan's     ambiguity,      the       Board's\n\nprocedural failures, and the subsequent prejudice to Bard, and for\n\nthe reasons that follow, we find that Bard is entitled to a remedy.\n\nThe result is limited to this case.                 We do not reach hypothetical\n\nquestions     about      future    applicants         under   this     Plan     who     are\n\naccurately and adequately notified of BSA-ILA's interpretation.\n\nInstead, we state our holding as follows: when a plan with material\n\nambiguous terms violates ERISA in the manner that BSA-ILA did, and\n\na claimant's application is prejudiced by these violations through\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fhis reliance on a reasonable interpretation that the plan does not\n\nultimately adopt, we will bar the plan from using the claimant's\n\nreliance    against   him.      We   start   by   explaining   why   Bard's\n\nunderstanding of the Plan's terms was reasonable.\n\nA.          The Plan's Terms\n\n            No BSA-ILA plan provision explicitly requires that a\n\nclaimant have been totally and permanently disabled prior to\n\ntermination of his employment.        Such a requirement is not hard to\n\ndraft.     Cf. Perry v. New England Bus. Serv., Inc., 347 F.3d 343,\n\n344-45 (1st Cir. 2003) (plan explicitly provided that disability\n\nbenefits were only available if the claimant became disabled before\n\n\"ceas[ing] to be an Active Full-time Employee\").               Rather, the\n\nrelevant plan provisions merely grant benefits to a \"Participant\"\n\nwho has accrued sufficient years of service, and who becomes\n\n\"totally and permanently disabled.\" The Plan's general definitions\n\nsection defines \"Participant\" as \"an Employee who has met the\n\nrequirements of eligibility to participate in the Plan.\"                And\n\n\"Employee\" is in turn defined as \"each individual who now, or\n\nhereafter is employed as a Longshoreman, Clerk, or Linehandler in\n\nthe industry and is a member of the ILA and for whom an Employer is\n\nrequired to make contributions\" to the Plan.\n\n            BSA-ILA argues that its interpretation is obvious from\n\nthis   language.      Its    argument   is   apparently   that   the   word\n\n\"Employee,\" as referred to in the definition of \"Participant,\" must\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fmean either a current employee or someone who was a current\n\nemployee at the time he became eligible for benefits.\n\n                It is fair to say that Bard's contrary reading is also\n\nreasonable.9         He argues that the word \"Employee\" includes former\n\nemployees who become totally and permanently disabled after leaving\n\nemployment.\n\n                First, Bard contends that the definition of \"Employee,\"\n\nby its plain language, makes no distinction between former and\n\npresent employees.          It merely refers to an individual who \"now or\n\nhereafter\" is employed in certain positions, is a member of the\n\nILA, and is a person for whom contributions are required.                 Either\n\nat the time the Plan was adopted, or at a time afterwards, Bard\n\nmet these requirements.10             Indeed, Bard argues that a number of\n\nother        plan   terms   clearly   refer   to   the   word   \"Participant\"   as\n\n\n        9\n       Indeed, Bard contends that the Plan's terms on eligibility\nso clearly and unambiguously support him that this court must adopt\nhis interpretation under any standard of review. Cf. Dandurand v.\nUnum Life Ins. Co. of Am., 284 F.3d 331, 336-38 (1st Cir. 2002).\nWe do not reach that argument.\n        10\n        At oral argument, BSA-ILA's counsel challenged Bard's\ntextual argument by claiming, for the first time, that \"Employee\"\nmust refer to \"active\" employees because the definition of\n\"Employee\" refers to individuals for whom benefit contributions are\nrequired. Counsel told us that it is only active employees for\nwhom contributions are required. This new argument appears to be\npremised on the existence of certain terms in a collective\nbargaining agreement. That agreement is not in the record, nor do\nwe know the extent to which Bard was aware of or had access to\nthese terms in the agreement.     In any event, this new argument\nabout the meaning of \"Employee\" is not grammatically compelled. It\ninstead depends on exactly which terms are modified by the Plan's\n\"now, or hereafter\" language.\n\n                                        -20-\n\fincluding former employees who were not eligible for the payment of\n\nbenefits at the time of their termination.         In particular, the\n\nPlan's retirement provisions specifically refer to \"terminated\n\nParticipants,\" who are eligible to receive their vested pensions\n\nupon attaining a particular age.\n\n           Also, Bard argues that his interpretation comports with\n\nERISA's   definition   of   the   word   \"participant.\"   Under   that\n\ndefinition, a \"participant\" is \"any employee or former employee of\n\nan employer . . . who is or may become eligible to receive a\n\nbenefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1002(7) (emphasis added).\n\n           Our response is that ERISA's definitions technically\n\napply only within the ERISA statute, and the Plan can of course\n\nadopt its own meanings of various terms.      The Plan itself provides\n\nfor arbitration to decide close questions of interpretation, and\n\nBard has no special interpretive status.      We merely conclude that\n\nBard's interpretation, in the absence of clear guidance, was\n\nreasonable.   The rest of our analysis relies on nothing more.\n\nB.         The Plan's Procedural Failures\n\n           Had the Plan uniformly and promptly settled upon an\n\ninterpretation of the key plan terms, and made that interpretation\n\nclear to Bard at all material times, this might have been a\n\ndifferent case.    But it did not, and how it handled his claim\n\nviolated ERISA.\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\f          The Plan's specific violations of the ERISA regulations\n\nhad different characteristics.        Of particular importance were its\n\nfailure to provide a variety of decisional safeguards in the review\n\nprocess, and its violations of ERISA's notice requirements.11\n\n          We    start   with   the   failure   to   abide   by   the   notice\n\nrequirements.    Under 29 U.S.C. § 1133, every ERISA plan must:\n\n          (1) provide adequate notice in writing to any\n          participant or beneficiary whose claim for\n          benefits under the plan has been denied,\n          setting forth the specific reasons for such\n          denial, written in a manner calculated to be\n          understood by the participant, and\n          (2) afford a reasonable opportunity to any\n          participant whose claim for benefits has been\n          denied for a full and fair review by the\n          appropriate named fiduciary of the decision\n          denying the claim.\n\n          Under the Department of Labor's regulations, a plan must\n\nprovide \"written or electronic notification of any adverse benefit\n\ndetermination.\"    29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(g)(1).        This notification\n\nmust state \"[t]he specific reason or reasons for the adverse\n\ndetermination,\" id. § 2560.503-1(g)(1)(i); it must make reference\n\n\n\n     11\n        In concluding that the Plan violated a variety of ERISA\nrequirements, we cite to the standard ERISA regulations in 29\nC.F.R. § 2560.503-1. In its brief, the Plan treats these standard\nregulations as governing.\n     It is sometimes permissible for plans under collective\nbargaining agreements to depart from the terms of these\nregulations.   See id. § 2560.503-1(b)(6) (explaining that for\ncertain plans established pursuant to a collective bargaining\nagreement, the standard ERISA regulations will not apply if the\ncollective bargaining agreement \"sets forth or incorporates by\nspecific reference\" certain alternative claims procedures). The\nPlan has not argued that it falls under this exception.\n\n                                     -22-\n\f\"to the specific plan provisions on which the determination is\n\nbased,\" id. § 2560.503-1(g)(1)(ii); and it must include information\n\nabout how the claimant can pursue further review and rectify the\n\ndeficiencies in his application, see id. § 2560.503-1(g)(1)(iii),\n\n(iv).\n\n           Additionally, in its notice of denial, a disability\n\nbenefits plan must provide information about any internal rules,\n\nguidelines, or protocols that the plan relied on in making its\n\ndetermination.     Specifically, the plan's notification must provide\n\n           either the specific rule, guideline, protocol,\n           or other similar criterion [relied upon]; or a\n           statement that such a rule, guideline,\n           protocol, or other similar criterion was\n           relied    upon   in    making   the    adverse\n           determination and that a copy of such rule,\n           guideline, protocol, or other criterion will\n           be provided free of charge to the claimant\n           upon request.\n\nId. § 2560.503-1(g)(1)(v)(A).\n\n           All of these notice provisions serve an obvious purpose:\n\nthey seek to notify the claimant of what he or she will need to do\n\nto   effectively    make   out   a   benefits   claim   and   to   take   an\n\nadministrative appeal from a denial.        See DiGregorio v. Hartford\n\nComprehensive Employee Benefit Serv. Co., 423 F.3d 6, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); Glista, 378 F.3d at 129; 65 Fed. Reg. 70,246, 70,251 & n.25\n\n(Nov. 21, 2000).     In doing so, the aim is also \"'to minimize the\n\nnumber of frivolous lawsuits; promote consistent treatment of\n\nclaims; provide a nonadversarial dispute resolution process; and\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fdecrease the cost and time of claims settlement.'\"     Glista, 378\n\nF.3d at 129 (quoting Powell v. AT&T Commc'ns, Inc., 938 F.2d 823,\n\n826 (7th Cir. 1991)).\n\n          There is no evidence in the record that the Plan complied\n\nwith a single one of these notice provisions after it deemed Bard\n\nineligible to apply for benefits in October 2003.12   There was no\n\nwritten or electronic notification to Bard at all.         Thus no\n\ndocument adequately notified Bard of the specific reasons why the\n\nBoard initially rejected his claim.    There was also no adequate\n\nnotification of the specific plan provisions on which the denial\n\nwas based.   Nor was Bard sufficiently informed about how he could\n\nperfect his claim on review.\n\n          Additionally, in relying on the McLaughlin arbitration to\n\nreject Bard's claim, the Board relied on a \"rule, guideline,\n\nprotocol, or other similar criterion.\"      29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-\n\n1(g)(1)(v)(A). It is clear that the Board treated the \"holding\" of\n\nthe McLaughlin arbitration as stating a rule governing which\n\nclaimants may apply for benefits.     Yet Bard was not notified of\n\neven a condensed version of this rule, nor does it appear that he\n\n\n\n     12\n       For purposes of the ERISA regulations, the Board's initial\ndetermination that Bard was ineligible to apply for benefits is an\n\"adverse benefit determination,\" notwithstanding the Plan's\nargument that the Board did not initially reject Bard's claim on\nits merits. See 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(m)(4) (defining an \"adverse\nbenefit determination\" to include any denial of a benefit or\nfailure to make a payment for a benefit, including one based on the\nclaimant's \"eligibility to participate in a plan\").\n\n                               -24-\n\fwas    timely   notified     that    the    McLaughlin   arbitrator's     opinion\n\nexisted at all.\n\n             Also relevant is the Plan's failure to provide a variety\n\nof procedural safeguards designed to ensure the objectivity of its\n\nadministrative appellate review.13               An appeal must be decided,\n\nwithout any deference to the prior determination, by an appropriate\n\nplan    fiduciary     \"who    is    neither    the   individual   who   made     the\n\n[initial] adverse benefit determination . . . nor the subordinate\n\nof such individual.\" Id. § 2560.503-1(h)(3)(ii), (h)(4). The full\n\nBoard both initially rejected Bard's application and heard Bard's\n\nappeal from that denial.           Indeed, when the Board ultimately denied\n\nBard his benefits on the merits in March 2005, its denial letter\n\nindicated that any further appeal would again be to the Board\n\nitself.     Bard was thus deprived of a fully objective review of his\n\nbenefits denial.\n\n             This reduced objectivity was further compounded by the\n\nBoard's     failure   to     consult   an     appropriate   medical     expert    in\n\nreviewing Bard's claims.           See id. § 2560.503-1(h)(3)(iii), (h)(4)\n\n(requiring an appellate body to consult an appropriate medical\n\nexpert in reviewing a claim of this nature); id. § 2560.503-\n\n\n       13\n       Contrary to the Plan's attempt to suggest otherwise, the\nBoard's 2004 and 2005 actions are properly characterized as\nconsidering an \"appeal\" and not as making an initial \"benefits\ndetermination.\" This is because the Board's 2003 decision not to\naward benefits was an \"adverse benefit determination,\" even if it\nwas based on a procedural reason and was not a denial on the\nmerits. See 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(m)(4).\n\n                                        -25-\n\f1(h)(3)(v), (h)(4) (requiring that the Board's medical expert on\n\nreview     be    an    expert   not     consulted       in   the   initial   benefits\n\ndetermination).         No BSA-ILA doctor examined either Bard or his\n\nmedical records.\n\nC.              Prejudice\n\n                Our cases, decided under the previous ERISA regulations,\n\nhave generally put a burden on the claimant to demonstrate how a\n\nplan's ERISA violations prejudiced him by affecting review of his\n\nclaim.14    For example, in DiGregorio the court found that where a\n\nplan may have failed to provide a claimant with her entire claims\n\nfile, the claimant was required to show some relevant prejudice in\n\norder to get a remand to the plan and a second bite at the apple.\n\nSee 423 F.3d at 15-16.            DiGregorio built on two of our earlier\n\nopinions.       In Terry, the notice of denial of benefits had arguably\n\nfailed to meet ERISA's notice requirements, and the court required\n\nthe plaintiff to show prejudice in order to obtain benefits.                      See\n\n145 F.3d at 38-39.              In Recupero v. New England Telephone &\n\nTelegraph       Co.,    this    court    adopted    a    requirement    of    showing\n\nprejudice to obtain benefits in an ERISA § 503(1), 29 U.S.C.\n\n\n\n     14\n       A showing of prejudice may not be needed in a case where the\nplan's own grant of discretionary authority does not extend to the\nactual decision maker involved.      See Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase\nManhattan Bank, N.A., 986 F.2d 580, 583-84 (1st Cir. 1993); see\nalso Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989)\n(holding that de novo review is appropriate unless a plan's terms\nspecifically grant discretion to its administrators). That is not\nthe factual situation here.\n\n                                          -26-\n\f§ 1133(1), defective notice case.           See 118 F.3d 820, 840 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).      DiGregorio rejected the argument that Terry and Recupero\n\nwere distinguishable because of the differences in procedural\n\nviolations and the differences in remedies sought. See 423 F.3d at\n\n16.     Without addressing whether a prejudice showing is always\n\nrequired under the new ERISA regulations, we find that Bard was\n\nprejudiced by the Plan's ERISA failures.15\n\n               First, the Plan's failure to comply with the ERISA notice\n\nprovisions significantly prejudiced Bard in his claim for benefits.\n\nBecause Bard was not initially informed that he needed to show that\n\nhis    total     disability    occurred     prior   to    termination      of   his\n\nemployment, he submitted medical documentation not meant to address\n\nthat    point    and   which   ultimately    proved      quite   harmful   to   his\n\nadministrative appeal.         Specifically, when Bard submitted medical\n\nevidence of his disability in January 2004, he included a letter\n\nfrom Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti stating that he had become\n\ntotally disabled in December of 2001 -- approximately five months\n\nafter he stopped working.         At the time of this submission neither\n\n\n       15\n        DiGregorio also stated that a district court's finding of\nno prejudice is a \"factual conclusion that we review only for clear\nerror.\" 423 F.3d at 13. Here the district court did not actually\nmake factual findings about prejudice. Instead, in response to\nBard's argument that the Plan's delays should result in a\nlimitation of the administrative record, the court summarily stated\nthat \"there is no evidence of material noncompliance by the Board.\"\nSince there are no relevant factual determinations to defer to, we\nmake our own determination of prejudice from the administrative\nrecord.   Further, it was clear error to hold that there was no\n\"material noncompliance by the Board.\"\n\n                                     -27-\n\fhe nor his doctors had been informed that the exact date of his\n\ntotal        disability     would    be    relevant.           Indeed,    under   Bard's\n\nreasonable reading of the Plan, he needed only to show that he was\n\ntotally and permanently disabled at the time of his submission. He\n\nhad little reason then to ask Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti to be\n\nprecise about the date he became disabled.                        And it is unclear\n\nwhether Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti in fact engaged in any\n\nanalysis that specifically tried to identify the exact onset date\n\nof Bard's disability.\n\n                Once Bard learned of the Plan's interpretation of its\n\ndisability         provisions,      he    went    back    to    Drs.     De   Simone   and\n\nChakrabarti.         They then issued a revised letter dating Bard's\n\ndisability to before Bard's termination.16                        Additionally, Bard\n\nobtained       a   letter    from    Dr.    Segal,       which    also    dated   Bard's\n\ndisability to before his termination from employment.                              These\n\nletters were submitted to the Board in August 2004 as part of\n\nBard's attempt to restart the then-stalled review process.\n\n                Importantly, when the Board later voted to deny benefits,\n\nits counsel tells us that it discounted Bard's new medical evidence\n\n\n        16\n       It is true that this letter did not explain why the doctors\nwere revising their opinion. The Board argues to us that this is\na reason to disregard their new letter entirely. The Board failed,\nhowever, to give any indication that this was an issue when it sent\nBard its April 2005 letter denying his claim on the merits. Bard\nthus was not informed that the Board considered this omission\nimportant. Had he been so informed, he could have gone back to\nDrs. Chakrabarti and De Simone and asked them to supplement their\nexplanation.\n\n                                           -28-\n\fbecause it was inconsistent with the disability date reflected in\n\nBard's first batch of evidence.        Indeed, the Plan's brief to this\n\ncourt recounts that the Board members \"elected to discount the\n\nAppellant's self-serving and revised medicals -- which were created\n\nafter the Appellant knew of the issue about when his disability\n\noccurred -- and rely on his first set of medicals, which documented\n\nno disability until after his termination.\" The prejudice from the\n\nPlan's faulty notice could not be clearer.\n\n           The prejudice to Bard was then compounded by the Board's\n\nfailure   to   take   the   required    steps   for   ensuring   objective\n\nadministrative review.      Had a different fiduciary decided Bard's\n\nappeal (instead of the same entity that initially rejected Bard's\n\nclaim),   and/or   had   the   Board   followed   ERISA   regulations   by\n\nconsulting an appropriate medical expert, it might not have so\n\nreadily dismissed Bard's medical evidence.17\n\n\n     17\n        Indeed, a more objective review could potentially have\nsolved another problem.      The Plan's denial of benefits on\nadministrative appeal did not mention at all the Social Security\nALJ's determination that Bard had been disabled at the time he was\nterminated.   The Plan's brief posits that there was no need to\nmention this because the Plan's definition of disability differs\nfrom the one used by the ALJ (although the brief does not describe\nhow). It is true that a plan is not required to accept a Social\nSecurity adjudication of disability as binding on it where the\ndefinitions of disability are different. See Pari-Fasano v. ITT\nHartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415, 419-20 (1st Cir.\n2000). Nor is a plan required to defer to treating physicians in\nthe manner required of an ALJ in a Social Security case. See Black\n& Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S. 822, 825 (2003). But\nthat does not mean that the Social Security determination provides\nno relevant evidence. See Pari-Fasano, 230 F.3d at 420. If the\nBoard did in fact discount this evidence because of a differing\n\n                                  -29-\n\f           The Plan contends that because Bard was working as of his\n\ntermination date, it is inherently unreasonable to conclude he was\n\ntotally and permanently disabled at that time. It implies that, as\n\na result, Bard suffered no prejudice from the Plan's violations.\n\nWe reject the argument on the facts here.      The Plan essentially\n\nasks this court to adopt a legal rule that it is fundamentally\n\ninconsistent for an ERISA claimant to be at work and also be\n\nsufficiently disabled to support a total and permanent disability\n\nclaim.    That is not self-evidently true.     Instead, the matter\n\nappears to depend on the nature of the disability.18         As the\n\nMcLaughlin arbitrator recognized, permanent and total disability\n\nmay develop while someone is working.      This certainly applies,\n\ninter alia, in cases of mental disabilities.   See Radford Trust v.\n\nFirst Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., 321 F. Supp. 2d 226, 246-47 (D.\n\nMass. 2004).   In fact, Bard's doctors obviously disagree with the\n\n\n\n\ndefinition of disability, or a differing level of deference to\ntreating physicians, the trustees could easily have stated this to\nBard in their letter communicating the benefits denial.      Their\nfailure to do so suggests that the evidence was not considered at\nall.\n     18\n        Additionally, adoption of BSA-ILA's \"common sense\" rule\ncould lead to some pernicious effects.     Employers who think an\nemployee may be becoming disabled will have an incentive to\nterminate satisfactory employees, before they reach the point of\nunambiguous disability, in order to avoid the payment of disability\nbenefits.\n\n                                -30-\n\fBoard's view, and they present the only competent medical evidence\n\nin the record on the issue.19\n\n          We do not have the benefit of any medical evidence\n\nshowing   that   a   given   disabling   psychological    condition   is\n\ninconsistent with the ability to show up at work.        Thus a decision\n\n\n\n     19\n        The Board's position is not strengthened by our decision in\nSullivan v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 358 F.3d 110 (1st Cir.\n2004). BSA-ILA contends that Sullivan, a case about the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA), memorializes \"the commonsense notion\n. . . that if an employee is performing his job satisfactorily then\nhe obviously is not totally and permanently disabled from that\njob.\" This reading of Sullivan is well out of context.\n     In Sullivan we rejected the ADA claim of an alcoholic\nplaintiff.      The plaintiff maintained that his alcoholism\nconstituted a disability because it significantly impaired his\nability to work. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A) (defining disability\nas including \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially\nlimits one or more of the major life activities of an individual\").\nWith some skepticism, we assumed that the plaintiff was correct in\nhis contention that \"working\" could be a \"major life activity\"\nunder this definition. Sullivan, 358 F.3d at 115. However, we\nnoted the Catch-22 that resulted from this: the plaintiff had to\nshow substantial difficulty working in order to count as\n\"disabled,\" but to get relief he was also statutorily required to\ndemonstrate that he was qualified for the job he claimed he was\nwrongfully fired from. Id. at 114-17. We ultimately relied on the\nplaintiff's statements that he was able to perform his job\nadequately despite his alcoholism, and so we upheld summary\njudgment for the employer on the ground that the plaintiff was not\ndisabled under the ADA. Id.\n     Sullivan does not hold that an employee who was working before\ntermination will never be able to show he was disabled under the\nADA. See id. at 115-17. And Sullivan is an ADA case, not one\ngoverned by ERISA. In any event, Bard's case presents facts and\nissues that are drastically different from Sullivan's. First, Bard\nflatly contended to the Board, through his affidavit and his\nmedical evidence, that he was not performing his job satisfactorily\nat the time he was fired. Indeed, shortly before his termination\nBard was involved in a crane accident, which at least suggests his\nperformance may have been lacking. Second, nothing in the Plan\npresents the same Catch-22 that the Sullivan plaintiff faced.\n\n                                 -31-\n\fmaker without medical expertise -- such as this court -- would be\n\nhard-pressed to conclude as the Plan argues.   That is exactly why\n\nthe ERISA regulations (and the Plan's documents) require that\n\nappropriate medical experts be consulted.20\n\nD.        Remedy\n\n          The Plan's procedural irregularities here were serious,\n\nhad a connection to the substantive decision reached, and call into\n\nquestion the integrity of the benefits-denial decision itself.   In\n\nlight of this, we must determine the appropriate remedy for Bard.\n\n          ERISA gives courts the authority:\n\n          (A) to enjoin any act or practice which\n          violates any provision of this subchapter or\n          the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other\n          appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress\n          such violations or (ii) to enforce any\n\n\n\n     20\n        We note that there is yet another way in which Bard was\nharmed by the Plan's missteps. Had Bard been put on notice of the\nMcLaughlin arbitration, and been informed of its availability, Bard\ncould have made a substantial argument to the Plan that it was\ninterpreting its disability provisions too strictly. As the text\nof the McLaughlin arbitration makes clear, the arbitrator in that\ncase explicitly avowed ruling on a situation in which an employee's\ncondition causes symptoms while the employee is still working,\nthose symptoms contribute to the employee's departure from\nemployment, and the condition then worsens into total and permanent\ndisability after the employee has left his position. Bard arguably\nfits that situation. His submitted evidence demonstrates that he\nwas experiencing psychological symptoms as early as 2000.       And\nthose symptoms may have contributed to the drug and alcohol\ndependency that got him fired. Even if the Plan is correct that\nBard was not totally and permanently disabled prior to his\ntermination, if Bard could show that his symptoms worsened so that\nhe is now totally and permanently disabled, he could well be\nentitled to benefits under a plan interpretation that is perfectly\nconsistent with the McLaughlin arbitration.\n\n                               -32-\n\f          provisions of this subchapter or the terms of\n          the plan.\n\nGlista, 378 F.3d at 131 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).    Under ERISA, a court's remedial power\n\n\"encompasses an array of possible responses.\"   Id.   Similarly, our\n\noversight of ERISA cases must be governed by principles of federal\n\ncommon law.   See Forcier v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., No. 06-1088, slip\n\nop. at 12 (1st Cir. Nov. 20, 2006) (citing Pilot Life Ins. Co. v.\n\nDedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 56 (1987)).\n\n          We have invoked our equitable and common law powers to\n\nprevent a plan from taking actions, even in good faith, which have\n\nthe effect of \"sandbagging\" claimants.21    See Glista, 378 F.3d at\n\n131-32.   Other courts have shared our concern.       See Jebian v.\n\nHewlett-Packard Co. Employee Benefits Org. Income Prot. Plan, 349\n\nF.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir. 2003); Marolt v. Alliant Techsystems,\n\nInc., 146 F.3d 617, 620 (8th Cir. 1998); cf. Hancock v. Montgomery\n\nWard Long Term Disability Trust, 787 F.2d 1302, 1307 (9th Cir.\n\n1986) (noting that a plan's failure to explain its reasons for\n\ndecision may constitute an abuse of discretion); cf. also Fed.\n\nPower Comm'n v. Texaco, Inc., 417 U.S. 380, 397 (1974) (refusing to\n\n\"accept appellate counsel's post hoc rationalizations for agency\n\n\n     21\n        In using the term \"sandbagging\" we mean only that from\nBard's perspective, the Plan's ERISA failures set in motion a chain\nof events whose effect was to shift the targets that Bard was\naiming for, and then penalize Bard for aiming at the first round of\ntargets. We do not mean that the Plan acted in bad faith, and\nthere is no evidence that it did.\n\n                                -33-\n\faction [because] an agency's order must be upheld, if at all, on\n\nthe same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself\"\n\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S.\n\n156, 168-69 (1962); SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n          In Glista the defendant insurer did not articulate a\n\nparticular ground for its benefits denial until it was in federal\n\ncourt.    See 378 F.3d at 128.     We found that the failure to\n\ncommunicate this explanation earlier was a violation of ERISA's\n\nnotice regulations,22 and that as a result the claimant had been\n\nunable to effectively challenge the new reasoning during the\n\nadministrative process.   See id. at 128-30.   Ultimately, we barred\n\nthe defendant in Glista from using its new rationale in litigation.\n\nId. at 131-32.\n\n          Bard is in a similar position: because of the Plan's\n\nfailures to give proper notice, he did not learn about the Plan's\n\ninterpretation until it was too late.      By the time the Plan's\n\ninterpretation was made clear to him, he was forced to argue his\n\ncase to a Board that lacked the requisite objectivity, and that\n\n\n\n     22\n        Glista was decided under the previous ERISA regulations.\nSee id. at 128-29 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(f), (h)(3)\n(2000)). Although the new notice provisions are not identical, the\nprior provisions contained many of the same requirements, including\nthe requirement that the plan articulate its \"specific reason\" for\nthe denial, and that it point to the specific \"plan provisions on\nwhich the denial is based.\" See 29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(f)(1), (2)\n(2000).\n\n                               -34-\n\fused his earlier submissions against him.          Additionally, as in\n\nGlista, the defendant plan has \"offered no explanation for why it\n\ndid not explain earlier\" its basis for the initial adverse benefit\n\ndetermination.   See id. at 132.\n\n          Accordingly, we grant relief similar to what we ordered\n\nin Glista.     Thus we bar the defendant plan from using Bard's\n\nearlier medical evidence against him.      In so doing, we essentially\n\nundo the prejudice that resulted from Bard's reliance on his\n\ninitial reasonable interpretation of the Plan.              Cf. Mauser v.\n\nRaytheon Co. Pension Plan For Salaried Employees, 239 F.3d 51, 54-\n\n55 (1st Cir. 2001) (when a plan's SPD conflicts with the plan's\n\nterms,   the   SPD   will   control   if   the   claimant    demonstrates\n\n\"significant or reasonable reliance\" on it).           Our relief also\n\nremedies the possibility that the Plan's decision to rely on Bard's\n\nfirst evidence, rather than his later-submitted evidence, was a\n\nproduct of the Board's lack of objectivity.\n\n          This relief results in a conclusion that the Board's\n\ndenial of benefits was invalid under any standard of review,\n\nwhether de novo or deferential.       As we have previously noted, the\n\nPlan's terms require the Board to judge disability \"upon competent\n\nmedical evidence.\"    All of the medical evidence in this case was\n\n\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\feither silent on the onset of Bard's total disability, or it placed\n\nthat onset before Bard's termination from employment.23\n\n               The one exception is Bard's first letter from Drs. De\n\nSimone and Chakrabarti, and the Plan is prohibited from relying on\n\nthat letter.24       Other than that, the Plan offers absolutely no\n\ncompetent medical evidence to contravene Bard's medical evidence.\n\nThe Plan did not have a doctor provide any medical reason to reject\n\nBard's evidence, nor did the Plan have Bard examined by a medical\n\nexpert of its own. We have already rejected the Plan's generalized\n\nassertion that someone who is working necessarily cannot be totally\n\ndisabled by a mental disease.         And there is no evidence from any\n\nPlan medical expert saying that the Plan's assertion is true in\n\nBard's case. Nor is there any medical evidence that Bard's doctors\n\ncannot    be    relied   upon   because   they   evaluated   Bard   after   his\n\nemployment had been terminated.           Even now the Plan does not argue,\n\n\n\n\n     23\n       Dr. Segal, who treated Bard in October 2001, placed Bard's\ndate of total disability as occurring prior to Bard's termination.\nThe revised letter from Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti agreed. And\nthe Social Security ALJ determined that Bard became severely\ndisabled as of July 22, 2001.\n     24\n       The Plan suggests that it could have relied on the Lawless\n& Company report, dated March 2000, which had declined to make a\nfinal diagnosis as to Bard's condition.    That report recounted\nBard's statements that he believed himself able to work at that\ntime. This report offers no competent medical evidence supporting\nthe Board's conclusion: it expresses no final medical judgment as\nto Bard's condition right before he was terminated.\n\n                                     -36-\n\fnor can it, that its interpretation requires that a person be\n\ntreated for a disability before his employment is terminated.25\n\n                In other circumstances, it might be an appropriate remedy\n\nto   remand      to   a   plan    administrator     for    reconsideration.      See\n\nBuffonge, 426 F.3d at 31-32.             But a remand is not appropriate here.\n\nUnlike     in    Buffonge,       here   the    remaining   evidence   compels    the\n\nconclusion that Bard is entitled to benefits.                   Additionally, the\n\ndelay in this case vastly exceeded the time limits that ERISA\n\nimposes.        During that delay, the medical evidence shows, Bard has\n\nbeen totally and permanently disabled and unable to work.                       This\n\nfavors a resolution of his claim without further delay.                          Cf.\n\nGlista, 378 F.3d at 132 (\"Glista's medical condition calls for\n\nresolving this controversy quickly.\").\n\n                                              IV.\n\n                The district court's judgment is reversed.            The case is\n\nremanded, and the district court is instructed to enter judgment\n\n\n\n      25\n        Citing a Seventh Circuit case, the Plan contends that it\ncannot have acted arbitrarily and capriciously by refusing to\nconsider a post-denial diagnosis.       See Blickenstaff v. R.R.\nDonnelly & Sons, 378 F.3d 669, 680-81 (7th Cir. 2004). But that\ncase presented a drastically different fact pattern. There, two\nmedical experts opined that the plaintiff was not totally disabled\nand that she might be faking the extent of her injuries. A third\nexpert, proffered after the plaintiff's claim had been initially\ndenied, took a different position. Blickenstaff merely holds that\nwhen faced with multiple and conflicting expert opinions, a Plan\ncan act reasonably if it does not credit the expert whose diagnosis\nonly came post-denial. See id. Bard's case presents no similar\nconflict: as we have restricted the record, there is no medical\nevidence that contravenes Bard's.\n\n                                          -37-\n\frequiring BSA-ILA to pay Bard his disability benefits, including\n\nany benefits past due, and any applicable interest.

The defendant is a multi-employer pension plan (\"BSA-ILA\" or \"the Plan\"), and at issue is a decision by its Board of Trustees (\"the Board\") to deny disability benefits to a former employee, Paul Bard. The district court upheld this denial. We reverse and order an award of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so doing, we do not reach Bard's invitation to join those circuits holding that a plan's ERISA violations will strip it of the deference its decisions otherwise enjoy. Rather, using a model of analysis previously employed by this circuit, we hold that Bard was prejudiced by the Plan's numerous regulatory violations, and that on the particular facts here he is entitled to the remedy of an award of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bard worked as a crane operator on the Boston docks for some 30 years. On July 16, 2001, he was involved in a workplace accident. As Bard had a history of substance abuse and was working under a \"last chance agreement,\" he was subjected to a post-accident drug test. He tested positive. His employment was accordingly terminated on July 23, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bard sought medical treatment, and his doctors diagnosed him as suffering from a variety of psychological disorders that made him disabled and unable to work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Before applying for disability benefits from the Plan, Bard applied for Social Security disability benefits on November 26, 2001. His Social Security claim was initially denied. However, on May 10, 2003, after a hearing at which Bard presented additional evidence, an ALJ issued a written opinion awarding Bard disability benefits on the basis that Bard had been suffering from a \"severe\" disability since July 22, 2001 &#8212; one day before Bard received his termination letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armed with this finding, Bard applied for disability benefits from BSA-ILA. The troubled journey of that application is described below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Plan's Structure and Documents</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BSA-ILA is a multi-employer employee benefits plan, regulated by ERISA, and governed by a Board of Trustees composed of 14 members. Seven members are management trustees selected by the Boston Shipping Association, and seven are union trustees selected by the International Longshoremen's Association. If the trustees deadlock on an issue, an \"impartial umpire\" selected by the trustees will cast the deciding vote. A plan provision declares that \"[e]xcept as provided by ERISA, all decisions of the Board, including all those made in the interpretation and administration of the Plan, shall be conclusive, final and binding.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For disability benefits, plan documents state that a claimant is eligible for these benefits if he, or she, is a \"Participant who has completed fifteen . . . Years of Service [and] becomes totally and permanently disabled.\" The Plan also provides that \"[t]he Board, upon competent medical evidence, shall be the sole judge of whether a Participant is disabled.\" The word \"Participant\" is defined in the Plan to mean \"an Employee who has met the requirements of eligibility to participate in the Plan.\" \"Employee\" is in turn defined as \"each individual who now, or hereafter is employed as a Longshoreman, Clerk, or Linehandler in the industry and is a member of the ILA and for whom an Employer is required to make contributions\" to the Plan. Nothing in the Plan's documents explicitly states that an applicant for disability benefits must have become disabled at a time when he was still employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The administrative record contains what appears to be the summary plan description (SPD). <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1022(a) (requiring an ERISA plan to provide information about the plan \"written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and . . . sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan\"). That SPD states that \"[t]o be eligible [for disability benefits] you must: [(1)] Have completed 15 Years of Pension Service at the time you became disabled . . . [and (2)] Demonstrate to the Board by submission on approved forms of competent medical evidence that you are permanently and totally disabled.\" Nothing in the SPD states that the claimant must have been disabled at a time when he was still employed. The SPD is dated April 1988, and there is no evidence that the Plan ever updated its SPD, or, if so, that any updated description was provided to Bard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Bard's First Benefits Application</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime between August and October of 2003, Bard notified BSA-ILA that he wanted to apply for disability benefits in accordance with the Plan's provisions. Bard's initial letter stated that he had been diagnosed with manic depression, \"which the doctor felt was a chronic on going [sic] problem for many years,\" and that the Social Security Administration had found him mentally disabled. The record does not reveal whether Bard provided any documentation along with this letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At its regular meeting on October 29, 2003, the Board determined that Bard was not eligible to <i>apply</i> for a disability pension. The Board's minutes refer to a prior arbitration, dated July 15, 2002, which had rejected an application for disability benefits from a claimant named Gerard McLaughlin (the \"McLaughlin arbitration\"). The Board read the McLaughlin arbitration to mean that an individual who was no longer employed was ineligible to even <i>apply</i> for a disability pension. It also apparently interpreted this arbitration to mean that an employee is only eligible for benefits if he became totally and permanently disabled while still employed. We note that the Board had never amended the SPD to reflect these points, and Bard had no prior notice of the Board's reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also not clear that this was the correct reading. The McLaughlin decision, which is in the record, relied heavily on minutes from a February 1993 Board meeting in which the Board apparently denied a claim from a former employee named Paul Cocchi (the \"Cocchi claim\") because the \"onset\" of Cocchi's disabling condition had occurred after Cocchi had left employment. Finding McLaughlin's case indistinguishable from Cocchi's, the arbitrator denied McLaughlin's claim. Importantly, the decision specifically declined to extend itself to a situation where an employee \"leaves employment because of the onset of a disabling condition that becomes total and permanent at a later date.\" This nuance apparently went unnoticed by the Board, and it is unclear if Bard was ever given an opportunity to dispute the Board's reading of the McLaughlin arbitration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The First Denial and Bard's Attempted Review</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains no evidence that the Board's first denial of benefits, or its specific reasons for that denial, were communicated to Bard in writing or by electronic means. This was in contravention of federal regulations. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2560.503-1(g)(1) (requiring \"written or electronic notification\" of any initial \"adverse benefit determination\"); <i>id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(g)(1)(i) (requiring that this notification explain the specific reasons on which the determination was based). By some means, however, Bard learned the <i>outcome</i> of the Board's first decision, although not necessarily its reasoning, as Bard took an administrative appeal in late 2003 to challenge the Board's initial determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal apparently went to the Board because it had failed to provide for an independent appellate body. This also contravened regulations. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(h)(3)(ii), (h)(4) (requiring that an appeal be decided, without any deference to the prior determination, by an appropriate plan fiduciary \"who is neither the individual who made the [initial] adverse benefit determination . . . nor the subordinate of such individual\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During January 2004, Bard also submitted an application for disability benefits on a BSA-ILA form, along with medical documentation regarding his disability. Some of the documentation stated that Bard was \"totally and permanently disabled,\" but did not date the onset of symptoms or of total disability. However, a letter from Dr. Alba De Simone and Dr. Kishanlal Chakrabarti stated that Bard had become disabled in December of 2001. At the time Bard submitted this letter, it appears that he understood the Plan to require him to demonstrate that he was disabled, but not that he was disabled while still employed. There is no evidence that, as of this point in time, the Board had yet informed Bard of the <i>reasons</i> for its initial rejection of his application, as it was required to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustees again considered Bard's case at a January 30, 2004 meeting. This time they debated the <i>substantive</i> question of whether Bard's application should be approved. They deadlocked. They asked that the Plan's attorney be present at the next meeting to advise them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the January 30th meeting, but before the next Board meeting, it appears that Bard had additional medical information faxed to the Board: a medical report from a counselor at Lawless &amp; Company (a counseling service provider). This report stated that Bard had received treatment for substance abuse in March of 2000. The report also stated that as of that month, which was more than a year before Bard's crane accident, Bard had shown symptoms consistent with various psychological disorders, though the counselor had declined to make a final diagnosis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board, at its February 25, 2004 meeting, continued considering the substantive question of whether or not Bard should receive disability benefits. The trustees, following their interpretation of the McLaughlin arbitration, questioned whether Bard had been totally and permanently disabled <i>prior to</i> his termination. The trustees weighed the fact that Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti had placed December 2001 as the date on which Bard became totally disabled. The Board also considered whether Bard could have been totally and permanently disabled prior to termination if he had been working right up until the day he was fired. A vote was taken and the trustees again deadlocked, seven to seven. There is no evidence that the Board took any further action on Bard's application for approximately the next four months, despite applicable regulatory time limits. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(i)(3)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bard retained counsel, and on June 28, 2004, his attorney sent BSA-ILA a letter requesting all documents relevant to Bard's application. Meeting minutes from the three Board meetings discussing Bard apparently were sent in response to this request, along with other documents. It was only at this point, or through verbal representations made to Bard some time after the January or February 2004 meetings, that Bard learned of the Plan's apparent requirement that he have become totally and permanently disabled while still employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>The August 2004 Submissions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 2004, Bard's attorney sent the Plan a letter requesting that Bard's application be considered at the next Board meeting. Bard also submitted additional evidence, including medical evidence that Bard had become totally and permanently disabled prior to the July 23, 2001 termination of his employment. Specifically, Bard included a letter from Dr. Elliott Segal stating that Dr. Segal had treated Bard between October 2, 2001, and March 4, 2002, and that in Dr. Segal's opinion Bard had become totally and permanently disabled prior to termination of his employment. Bard also included a revised letter from Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti, dated June 23, 2004, in which they now said Bard had been disabled at least since March 21, 2000. Additionally, Bard submitted the Social Security Administration's determination that he had become disabled as of the day before he was terminated from employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Finally, Bard submitted his own affidavit stating, inter alia, that due to his mental health condition he believed that he had been unable to work \"in any gainful way\" since 2000, notwithstanding the fact that he had been employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustees again considered Bard's application at their August 25, 2004 meeting. At the January and February meetings, the trustees had apparently considered the <i>substantive</i> question of Bard's eligibility for benefits. At this meeting, however, the trustees appear to have reverted back to considering the <i>procedural</i> question of whether Bard was even eligible to apply for disability benefits; on that issue the management and union trustees deadlocked, seven to seven. The Board decided to submit the issue to arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Suit, Arbitration, and Ultimate Denial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frustrated with the delay, Bard filed suit on September 7, 2004, in federal district court in Massachusetts seeking benefits under the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While that suit was pending, on December 20, 2004, a hearing was held before an arbitrator on the issue of Bard's eligibility to apply for benefits. One of the management trustees' key arguments was that because Bard had been working as a crane operator up until his termination date, Bard clearly had not been totally and permanently disabled prior to termination. Thus these trustees saw no need to allow Bard even to apply for benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a written decision dated March 4, 2005, the arbitrator rejected the management trustees' position. He decided that Bard was eligible to apply for benefits because he was now alleging that his total disability occurred prior to his termination. The arbitrator also explained that the issue of whether Bard's application should be approved on the merits was not an issue presented to him for review. The management trustees' argument went to the merits of Bard's claim, not to the procedural question of Bard's eligibility to apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By now it was at least 17 months after Bard first applied for benefits from the Plan. The Board, accepting the arbitrator's decision that Bard was eligible to apply, then considered the merits of Bard's application at its meeting on March 23, 2005. By a vote of ten to four, the trustees rejected the application. The meeting minutes do not state the Board's reasons for its decision. On April 28, 2005, the Board sent Bard a letter communicating the denial of benefits. The sole reason for decision stated in the letter was that \"Pursuant to Article VIII (Disability Benefits)\" of the Plan, the Board \"in its sole judgement\" had determined that Bard \"was not totally and permanently disabled prior to his termination.\" No explanation was provided in the letter as to the reasons for the Board's determination. The letter also stated that Bard had the right to \"appeal\" the decision to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties then moved for summary judgment in the federal court action. In a decision issued on March 16, 2006, the district court granted BSA-ILA's motion and denied Bard's. The court first reasoned that the Plan was entitled to the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review because plan provisions gave the Board discretionary authority to interpret the Plan's terms and to make disability determinations. Under that standard, the district court found that the Plan could reasonably have determined, based on the evidence before it, that Bard was not totally and permanently disabled prior to termination of his employment. Additionally, the district court rejected Bard's argument that the Plan's terms did not actually require a claimant to have been disabled prior to termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Orndorf v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co.,</i> 404 F.3d 510, 516 (1st Cir.2005). In the ERISA context, summary judgment is merely a vehicle for deciding the case; the factual determination of eligibility for benefits is decided solely on the administrative record, and \"the non-moving party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.\" <i>Id.</i> at 517.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While our review of the district court's decision is de novo, our standard of review for the Board's decision is a different issue entirely. The parties dispute whether the Board's determination should be reviewed under a de novo standard or under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, our review of a benefits determination will be highly deferential when a plan's terms clearly grant its decision makers the discretionary authority to interpret the plan and determine eligibility for benefits. <i>See Terry v. Bayer Corp.,</i> 145 F.3d 28, 37, 40 (1st Cir.1998) (applying deferential review to both plan interpretation and eligibility determinations). The BSA-ILA plan has both a grant of discretion to interpret the Plan and a grant of discretion to determine disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, when Bard had first filed this lawsuit, the Plan had not yet resolved his benefits claim despite a significant passage of time. Faced with no decision from the Board, Bard brought suit on a \"deemed exhausted\" basis,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> similar to what was known as a \"deemed denied\" basis under the old ERISA regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,</i> 473 U.S. 134, 144, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985) (discussing \"deemed denied\" claims). Cases from other circuits, all governed by the old ERISA regulations, have held that a de novo standard of review may be proper in deemed denial cases &#8212; though some of these cases have also examined whether there has been \"substantial compliance\" with ERISA and/or the plan's terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our consistent approach in ERISA cases has been to eschew automatic rules and to evaluate each case on its own. <i>See, e.g., Buffonge v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 426 F.3d 20, 31 (1st Cir.2005) (taking a case-by-case approach to determining the proper ERISA remedy); <i>Glista v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 378 F.3d 113, 130-31 (1st Cir.2004) (taking a case-by-case approach to addressing a plan's attempt to articulate in litigation a new basis for the denial of benefits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, it is easy to understand why a multi-employer pension plan, whose trustees are equally divided between labor and management, would not be as efficient as a single decision-maker. At the same time, it is not clear that the ERISA regulatory structure intends to give multi-employer plans the kind of slack that the Plan appropriated for itself in this case. <i>Cf.</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2560.503-1(i)(3)(ii) (outlining special time limits, applicable only to multi-employer plans, for a plan to decide a disability benefits appeal and notify the claimant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, we do not decide whether the Plan's failure to render a timely decision by itself entitles Bard to de novo review, whether the Plan's eventual benefits denial after suit was filed was in \"substantial compliance\" with ERISA's time limits and other regulations, or whether inquiry into \"substantial compliance\" is even relevant in ERISA cases of this nature &#8212; whether brought under the new regulations or otherwise. Those are complicated questions on which the circuits have divided. <i>See Nichols v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 406 F.3d 98, 106-10 (2d Cir. 2005) (discussing the different positions taken). Instead, in keeping with our case-by-case approach, we tailor our resolution of the issues to the unique facts presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case reveals substantial confusion on the Plan's part about the basic eligibility requirements for applying for benefits, the substantive standard for awarding benefits, and the procedures for taking an administrative appeal from the denial of benefits. We evaluate the Plan's procedural missteps in light of ERISA's requirement that plans provide clear notice to potential claimants of their substantive and procedural rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The need for clear notice pervades the ERISA regulatory structure. For example, one of the key purposes of an SPD is to state in normal everyday language both what the eligibility requirements are, and what procedures the claimant must follow. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1022(a). Similarly, when a plan denies benefits, it is required to provide a notification that sets forth \"specific reasons for such a denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1133; <i>see also</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2560.503-1(g)(1) (requiring that the notification of a denial of benefits provide its explanation \"in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant\"). The Plan's documents themselves require that in the event of a benefits denial, BSA-ILA must provide the claimant with notice that sets forth \"[t]he specific reason or reasons for the denial\" and makes \"[s]pecific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We focus on two pertinent points in evaluating the lack of clarity and notice to Bard: Bard's reliance on a reasonable interpretation of the Plan, and the ultimate effect of the lack of clarity and notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first point is that the Board's ultimate interpretation of the Plan &#8212; that a claimant must be permanently and totally disabled before the termination of employment &#8212; is not at all self-evident from the Plan's language. Bard's contrary reading is reasonable, and it was not unreasonable for Bard, in the absence of clarification from the SPD, to rely on that reading in submitting his initial supporting medical documentation. Of course, the fact that a plan provision is capable of different readings would not alone negate deference to the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second point rests on the first. The Board's handling of the Plan's ambiguity, and its failure to comply with ERISA's requirements, caused substantive prejudice to Bard's application going well beyond the costs of delay. In the particular circumstances of this case, Bard was faced with a constant shift in what he was required to show. And then BSA-ILA made matters worse by failing to consider the evidence he submitted in an attempt to meet a moving target.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the Plan's ambiguity, the Board's procedural failures, and the subsequent prejudice to Bard, and for the reasons that follow, we find that Bard is entitled to a remedy. The result is limited to this case. We do not reach hypothetical questions about future applicants under this Plan who are accurately and adequately notified of BSA-ILA's interpretation. Instead, we state our holding as follows: when a plan with material ambiguous terms violates ERISA in the manner that BSA-ILA did, and a claimant's application is prejudiced by these violations through his reliance on a reasonable interpretation that the plan does not ultimately adopt, we will bar the plan from using the claimant's reliance against him. We start by explaining why Bard's understanding of the Plan's terms was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Plan's Terms</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No BSA-ILA plan provision explicitly requires that a claimant have been totally and permanently disabled prior to termination of his employment. Such a requirement is not hard to draft. <i>Cf. Perry v. New England Bus. Serv., Inc.,</i> 347 F.3d 343, 344-45 (1st Cir.2003) (plan explicitly provided that disability benefits were only available if the claimant became disabled before \"ceas[ing] to be an Active Full-time Employee\"). Rather, the relevant plan provisions merely grant benefits to a \"Participant\" who has accrued sufficient years of service, and who becomes \"totally and permanently disabled.\" The Plan's general definitions section defines \"Participant\" as \"an Employee who has met the requirements of eligibility to participate in the Plan.\" And \"Employee\" is in turn defined as \"each individual who now, or hereafter is employed as a Longshoreman, Clerk, or Linehandler in the industry and is a member of the ILA and for whom an Employer is required to make contributions\" to the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BSA-ILA argues that its interpretation is obvious from this language. Its argument is apparently that the word \"Employee,\" as referred to in the definition of \"Participant,\" must mean either a current employee or someone who was a current employee at the time he became eligible for benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is fair to say that Bard's contrary reading is also reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> He argues that the word \"Employee\" includes former employees who become totally and permanently disabled after leaving employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Bard contends that the definition of \"Employee,\" by its plain language, makes no distinction between former and present employees. It merely refers to an individual who \"now or hereafter\" is employed in certain positions, is a member of the ILA, and is a person for whom contributions are required. Either at the time the Plan was adopted, or at a time afterwards, Bard met these requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Indeed, Bard argues that a number of other plan terms clearly refer to the word \"Participant\" as including former employees who were not eligible for the payment of benefits at the time of their termination. In particular, the Plan's retirement provisions specifically refer to \"terminated Participants,\" who are eligible to receive their vested pensions upon attaining a particular age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, Bard argues that his interpretation comports with ERISA's definition of the word \"participant.\" Under that definition, a \"participant\" is \"any employee <i>or former employee</i> of an employer . . . who <i>is or may become eligible</i> to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(7) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our response is that ERISA's definitions technically apply only within the ERISA statute, and the Plan can of course adopt its own meanings of various terms. The Plan itself provides for arbitration to decide close questions of interpretation, and Bard has no special interpretive status. We merely conclude that Bard's interpretation, in the absence of clear guidance, was reasonable. The rest of our analysis relies on nothing more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Plan's Procedural Failures</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the Plan uniformly and promptly settled upon an interpretation of the key plan terms, and made that interpretation clear to Bard at all material times, this might have been a different case. But it did not, and how it handled his claim violated ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan's specific violations of the ERISA regulations had different characteristics. Of particular importance were its failure to provide a variety of decisional safeguards in the review process, and its violations of ERISA's notice requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the failure to abide by the notice requirements.

This notification must state \"[t]he specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(g)(1)(i); it must make reference \"to the specific plan provisions on which the determination is based,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(g)(1)(ii); and it must include information about how the claimant can pursue further review and rectify the deficiencies in his application, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(g)(1)(iii), (iv).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, in its notice of denial, a disability benefits plan must provide information about any internal rules, guidelines, or protocols that the plan relied on in making its determination. Specifically, the plan's notification must provide</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">either the specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion [relied upon]; or a statement that such a rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied upon in making the adverse determination and that a copy of such rule, guideline, protocol, or other criterion will be provided free of charge to the claimant upon request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(g)(1)(v)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of these notice provisions serve an obvious purpose: they seek to notify the claimant of what he or she will need to do to effectively make out a benefits claim and to take an administrative appeal from a denial. <i>See DiGregorio v. Hartford Comprehensive Employee Benefit Serv. Co.,</i> 423 F.3d 6, 14 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Glista,</i> 378 F.3d at 129; 65 Fed.Reg. 70,246, 70,251 &amp; n. 25 (Nov. 21, 2000). In doing so, the aim is also \"`to minimize the number of frivolous lawsuits; promote consistent treatment of claims; provide a nonadversarial dispute resolution process; and decrease the cost and time of claims settlement.'\" <i>Glista,</i> 378 F.3d at 129 (quoting <i>Powell v.

Thus no document adequately notified Bard of the specific reasons why the Board initially rejected his claim. There was also no adequate notification of the specific plan provisions on which the denial was based. Nor was Bard sufficiently informed about how he could perfect his claim on review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, in relying on the McLaughlin arbitration to reject Bard's claim, the Board relied on a \"rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2560.503-1(g)(1)(v)(A). It is clear that the Board treated the \"holding\" of the McLaughlin arbitration as stating a rule governing which claimants may apply for benefits. Yet Bard was not notified of even a condensed version of this rule, nor does it appear that he was timely notified that the McLaughlin arbitrator's opinion existed at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also relevant is the Plan's failure to provide a variety of procedural safeguards designed to ensure the objectivity of its administrative appellate review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> An appeal must be decided, without any deference to the prior determination, by an appropriate plan fiduciary \"who is neither the individual who made the [initial] adverse benefit determination . . . nor the subordinate of such individual.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(h)(3)(ii), (h)(4). The full Board both initially rejected Bard's application and heard Bard's appeal from that denial. Indeed, when the Board ultimately denied Bard his benefits on the merits in March 2005, its denial letter indicated that any further appeal would again be to the Board itself. Bard was thus deprived of a fully objective review of his benefits denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reduced objectivity was further compounded by the Board's failure to consult an appropriate medical expert in reviewing Bard's claims. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(h)(3)(iii), (h)(4) (requiring an appellate body to consult an appropriate medical expert in reviewing a claim of this nature); <i>id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(h)(3)(v), (h)(4) (requiring that the Board's medical expert on review be an expert not consulted in the initial benefits determination). No BSA-ILA doctor examined either Bard or his medical records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Prejudice</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our cases, decided under the previous ERISA regulations, have generally put a burden on the claimant to demonstrate how a plan's ERISA violations prejudiced him by affecting review of his claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> For example, in <i>DiGregorio</i> the court found that where a plan may have failed to provide a claimant with her entire claims file, the claimant was required to show some relevant prejudice in order to get a remand to the plan and a second bite at the apple. <i>See</i> 423 F.3d at 15-16. <i>DiGregorio</i> built on two of our earlier opinions. In <i>Terry,</i> the notice of denial of benefits had arguably failed to meet ERISA's notice requirements, and the court required the plaintiff to show prejudice in order to obtain benefits. <i>See</i> 145 F.3d at 38-39. In <i>Recupero v. New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.,</i> this court adopted a requirement of showing prejudice to obtain benefits in an ERISA &#167; 503(1), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1133(1), defective notice case. <i>See</i> 118 F.3d 820, 840 (1st Cir.1997). <i>DiGregorio</i> rejected the argument that <i>Terry</i> and <i>Recupero</i> were distinguishable because of the differences in procedural violations and the differences in remedies sought. <i>See</i> 423 F.3d at 16. Without addressing whether a prejudice showing is always required under the new ERISA regulations, we find that Bard was prejudiced by the Plan's ERISA failures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Plan's failure to comply with the ERISA notice provisions significantly prejudiced Bard in his claim for benefits. Because Bard was not initially informed that he needed to show that his total disability occurred prior to termination of his employment, he submitted medical documentation not meant to address that point and which ultimately proved quite harmful to his administrative appeal. Specifically, when Bard submitted medical evidence of his disability in January 2004, he included a letter from Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti stating that he had become totally disabled in December of 2001&#8212;approximately five months after he stopped working. At the time of this submission neither he nor his doctors had been informed that the exact date of his total disability would be relevant. Indeed, under Bard's reasonable reading of the Plan, he needed only to show that he was totally and permanently disabled <i>at the time of his submission.</i> He had little reason then to ask Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti to be precise about the date he became disabled. And it is unclear whether Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti in fact engaged in any analysis that specifically tried to identify the exact onset date of Bard's disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Bard learned of the Plan's interpretation of its disability provisions, he went back to Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti. They then issued a revised letter dating Bard's disability to before Bard's termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Additionally, Bard obtained a letter from Dr. Segal, which also dated Bard's disability to before his termination from employment. These letters were submitted to the Board in August 2004 as part of Bard's attempt to restart the then-stalled review process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, when the Board later voted to deny benefits, its counsel tells us that it discounted Bard's new medical evidence because it was inconsistent with the disability date reflected in Bard's first batch of evidence. Indeed, the Plan's brief to this court recounts that the Board members \"elected to discount the Appellant's self-serving and revised medicals&#8212;which were created <i>after</i> the Appellant knew of the issue about when his disability occurred&#8212;and rely on his first set of medicals, which documented no disability until after his termination.\" The prejudice from the Plan's faulty notice could not be clearer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prejudice to Bard was then compounded by the Board's failure to take the required steps for ensuring objective administrative review. Had a different fiduciary decided Bard's appeal (instead of the same entity that initially rejected Bard's claim), and/or had the Board followed ERISA regulations by consulting an appropriate medical expert, it might not have so readily dismissed Bard's medical evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan contends that because Bard was working as of his termination date, it is inherently unreasonable to conclude he was totally and permanently disabled at that time. It implies that, as a result, Bard suffered no prejudice from the Plan's violations. We reject the argument on the facts here. The Plan essentially asks this court to adopt a legal rule that it is fundamentally inconsistent for an ERISA claimant to be at work and also be sufficiently disabled to support a total and permanent disability claim. That is not self-evidently true. Instead, the matter appears to depend on the nature of the disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> As the McLaughlin arbitrator recognized, permanent and total disability may develop while someone is working. This certainly applies, inter alia, in cases of mental disabilities. <i>See Radford Trust v. First Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 321 F.Supp.2d 226, 246-47 (D.Mass.2004). In fact, Bard's doctors obviously disagree with the Board's view, and they present the only competent medical evidence in the record on the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not have the benefit of any medical evidence showing that a given disabling psychological condition is inconsistent with the ability to show up at work. Thus a decision maker without medical expertise&#8212;such as this court&#8212;would be hard-pressed to conclude as the Plan argues. That is exactly why the ERISA regulations (and the Plan's documents) require that appropriate medical experts be consulted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Remedy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan's procedural irregularities here were serious, had a connection to the substantive decision reached, and call into question the integrity of the benefits-denial decision itself.

We found that the failure to communicate this explanation earlier was a violation of ERISA's notice regulations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> and that as a result the claimant had been unable to effectively challenge the new reasoning during the administrative process. <i>See id.</i> at 128-30. Ultimately, we barred the defendant in <i>Glista</i> from using its new rationale in litigation. <i>Id.</i> at 131-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bard is in a similar position: because of the Plan's failures to give proper notice, he did not learn about the Plan's interpretation until it was too late. By the time the Plan's interpretation was made clear to him, he was forced to argue his case to a Board that lacked the requisite objectivity, and that used his earlier submissions against him. Additionally, as in <i>Glista,</i> the defendant plan has \"offered no explanation for why it did not explain earlier\" its basis for the initial adverse benefit determination. <i>See id.</i> at 132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we grant relief similar to what we ordered in <i>Glista.</i> Thus we bar the defendant plan from using Bard's earlier medical evidence against him. In so doing, we essentially undo the prejudice that resulted from Bard's reliance on his initial reasonable interpretation of the Plan. <i>Cf. Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan For Salaried Employees,</i> 239 F.3d 51, 54-55 (1st Cir.2001) (when a plan's SPD conflicts with the plan's terms, the SPD will control if the claimant demonstrates \"significant or reasonable reliance\" on it). Our relief also remedies the possibility that the Plan's decision to rely on Bard's first evidence, rather than his later-submitted evidence, was a product of the Board's lack of objectivity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This relief results in a conclusion that the Board's denial of benefits was invalid under any standard of review, whether de novo or deferential. As we have previously noted, the Plan's terms require the Board to judge disability \"upon competent medical evidence.\" All of the medical evidence in this case was either silent on the onset of Bard's total disability, or it placed that onset before Bard's termination from employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one exception is Bard's first letter from Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti, and the Plan is prohibited from relying on that letter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> Other than that, the Plan offers absolutely no competent medical evidence to contravene Bard's medical evidence. The Plan did not have a doctor provide any medical reason to reject Bard's evidence, nor did the Plan have Bard examined by a medical expert of its own. We have already rejected the Plan's generalized assertion that someone who is working necessarily cannot be totally disabled by a mental disease. And there is no evidence from any Plan medical expert saying that the Plan's assertion is true in Bard's case. Nor is there any <i>medical evidence</i> that Bard's doctors cannot be relied upon because they evaluated Bard after his employment had been terminated. Even now the Plan does not argue, nor can it, that its interpretation requires that a person be treated for a disability before his employment is terminated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other circumstances, it might be an appropriate remedy to remand to a plan administrator for reconsideration. <i>See Buffonge,</i> 426 F.3d at 31-32. But a remand is not appropriate here. Unlike in <i>Buffonge,</i> here the remaining evidence compels the conclusion that Bard is entitled to benefits. Additionally, the delay in this case vastly exceeded the time limits that ERISA imposes. During that delay, the medical evidence shows, Bard has been totally and permanently disabled and unable to work. This favors a resolution of his claim without further delay. <i>Cf. Glista,</i> 378 F.3d at 132 (\"Glista's medical condition calls for resolving this controversy quickly.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment is <i>reversed.</i> The case is remanded, and the district court is instructed to enter judgment requiring BSA-ILA to pay Bard his disability benefits, including any benefits past due, and any applicable interest.

That agreement is not in the record, nor do we know the extent to which Bard was aware of or had access to these terms in the agreement.

Here the district court did not actually make factual findings about prejudice. Instead, in response to Bard's argument that the Plan's delays should result in a limitation of the administrative record, the court summarily stated that \"there is no evidence of material noncompliance by the Board.\" Since there are no relevant factual determinations to defer to, we make our own determination of prejudice from the administrative record.

The Board argues to us that this is a reason to disregard their new letter entirely. The Board failed, however, to give any indication that this was an issue when it sent Bard its April 2005 letter denying his claim on the merits. Bard thus was not informed that the Board considered this omission important. Had he been so informed, he could have gone back to Drs. Chakrabarti and De Simone and asked them to supplement their explanation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Indeed, a more objective review could potentially have solved another problem. The Plan's denial of benefits on administrative appeal did not mention at all the Social Security ALJ's determination that Bard had been disabled at the time he was terminated. The Plan's brief posits that there was no need to mention this because the Plan's definition of disability differs from the one used by the ALJ (although the brief does not describe how). It is true that a plan is not required to accept a Social Security adjudication of disability as binding on it where the definitions of disability are different<i>See Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co.,</i> 230 F.3d 415, 419-20 (1st Cir.2000). Nor is a plan required to defer to treating physicians in the manner required of an ALJ in a Social Security case. <i>See Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord,</i> 538 U.S. 822, 825, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003). But that does not mean that the Social Security determination provides no relevant evidence. <i>See Pari-Fasano,</i> 230 F.3d at 420. If the Board did in fact discount this evidence because of a differing definition of disability, or a differing level of deference to treating physicians, the trustees could easily have stated this to Bard in their letter communicating the benefits denial. Their failure to do so suggests that the evidence was not considered at all.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Additionally, adoption of BSA-ILA's \"common sense\" rule could lead to some pernicious effects. Employers who think an employee may be becoming disabled will have an incentive to terminate satisfactory employees, before they reach the point of unambiguous disability, in order to avoid the payment of disability benefits</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The Board's position is not strengthened by our decision in<i>Sullivan v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc.,</i> 358 F.3d 110 (1st Cir.2004). BSA-ILA contends that <i>Sullivan,</i> a case about the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), memorializes \"the commonsense notion ... that if an employee is performing his job satisfactorily then he obviously is not totally and permanently disabled from that job.\" This reading of <i>Sullivan</i> is well out of context.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Sullivan</i> we rejected the ADA claim of an alcoholic plaintiff. The plaintiff maintained that his alcoholism constituted a disability because it significantly impaired his ability to work. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(A) (defining disability as including \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual\"). With some skepticism, we assumed that the plaintiff was correct in his contention that \"working\" could be a \"major life activity\" under this definition. <i>Sullivan,</i> 358 F.3d at 115. However, we noted the Catch-22 that resulted from this: the plaintiff had to show substantial difficulty working in order to count as \"disabled,\" but to get relief he was also statutorily required to demonstrate that he was qualified for the job he claimed he was wrongfully fired from. <i>Id.</i> at 114-17. We ultimately relied on the plaintiff's statements that he was able to perform his job adequately despite his alcoholism, and so we upheld summary judgment for the employer on the ground that the plaintiff was not disabled under the ADA. <i>Id.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Sullivan</i> does not hold that an employee who was working before termination will never be able to show he was disabled under the ADA. <i>See id.</i> at 115-17. And <i>Sullivan</i> is an ADA case, not one governed by ERISA. In any event, Bard's case presents facts and issues that are drastically different from <i>Sullivan's.</i> First, Bard flatly contended to the Board, through his affidavit and his medical evidence, that he was <i>not</i> performing his job satisfactorily at the time he was fired. Indeed, shortly before his termination Bard was involved in a crane accident, which at least suggests his performance may have been lacking. Second, nothing in the Plan presents the same Catch-22 that the <i>Sullivan</i> plaintiff faced.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> We note that there is yet another way in which Bard was harmed by the Plan's missteps. Had Bard been put on notice of the McLaughlin arbitration, and been informed of its availability, Bard could have made a substantial argument to the Plan that it was interpreting its disability provisions too strictly. As the text of the McLaughlin arbitration makes clear, the arbitrator in that case explicitly avowed ruling on a situation in which an employee's condition causes symptoms while the employee is still working, those symptoms contribute to the employee's departure from employment, and the condition then worsens into total and permanent disability after the employee has left his position. Bard arguably fits that situation. His submitted evidence demonstrates that he was experiencing psychological symptoms as early as 2000. And those symptoms may have contributed to the drug and alcohol dependency that got him fired. Even if the Plan is correct that Bard was not totally and permanently disabled prior to his termination, if Bard could show that his symptoms worsened so that he is<i>now</i> totally and permanently disabled, he could well be entitled to benefits under a plan interpretation that is perfectly consistent with the McLaughlin arbitration.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> In using the term \"sandbagging\" we mean only that from Bard's perspective, the Plan's ERISA failures set in motion a chain of events whose<i>effect</i> was to shift the targets that Bard was aiming for, and then penalize Bard for aiming at the first round of targets.

His Social Security claim was initially denied. However, on May 10, 2003, after a hearing at which Bard presented additional evidence, an ALJ issued a written opinion awarding Bard disability benefits on the basis that Bard had been suffering from a \"severe\" disability since July 22, 2001 &#8212; one day before Bard received his termination letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armed with this finding, Bard applied for disability benefits from BSA-ILA. The troubled journey of that application is described below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Plan's Structure and Documents</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BSA-ILA is a multi-employer employee benefits plan, regulated by ERISA, and governed by a Board of Trustees composed of 14 members. Seven members are management trustees selected by the Boston Shipping Association, and seven are union trustees selected by the International Longshoremen's Association. If the trustees deadlock on an issue, an \"impartial umpire\" selected by the trustees will cast the deciding vote. A plan provision declares that \"[e]xcept as provided by ERISA, all decisions of the Board, including all those made in the interpretation and administration of the Plan, shall be conclusive, final and binding.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For disability benefits, plan documents state that a claimant is eligible for these benefits if he, or she, is a \"Participant who has completed fifteen . . . Years of Service [and] becomes totally and permanently disabled.\" The Plan also provides that \"[t]he Board, upon competent medical evidence, shall be the sole judge of whether a Participant is disabled.\" The word \"Participant\" is defined in the Plan to mean \"an Employee who has met the requirements of eligibility to participate in the Plan.\" \"Employee\" is in turn defined as \"each individual who now, or hereafter is employed as a Longshoreman, Clerk, or Linehandler in the industry and is a member of the ILA and for whom an Employer is required to make contributions\" to the Plan. Nothing in the Plan's documents explicitly states that an applicant for disability benefits must have become disabled at a time when he was still employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The administrative record contains what appears to be the summary plan description (SPD). <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1022(a) (requiring an ERISA plan to provide information about the plan \"written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and . . . sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan\"). That SPD states that \"[t]o be eligible [for disability benefits] you must: [(1)] Have completed 15 Years of Pension Service at the time you became disabled . . . [and (2)] Demonstrate to the Board by submission on approved forms of competent medical evidence that you are permanently and totally disabled.\" Nothing in the SPD states that the claimant must have been disabled at a time when he was still employed. The SPD is dated April 1988, and there is no evidence that the Plan ever updated its SPD, or, if so, that any updated description was provided to Bard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Bard's First Benefits Application</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime between August and October of 2003, Bard notified BSA-ILA that he wanted to apply for disability benefits in accordance with the Plan's provisions. Bard's initial letter stated that he had been diagnosed with manic depression, \"which the doctor felt was a chronic on going [sic] problem for many years,\" and that the Social Security Administration had found him mentally disabled. The record does not reveal whether Bard provided any documentation along with this letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At its regular meeting on October 29, 2003, the Board determined that Bard was not eligible to <i>apply</i> for a disability pension. The Board's minutes refer to a prior arbitration, dated July 15, 2002, which had rejected an application for disability benefits from a claimant named Gerard McLaughlin (the \"McLaughlin arbitration\"). The Board read the McLaughlin arbitration to mean that an individual who was no longer employed was ineligible to even <i>apply</i> for a disability pension. It also apparently interpreted this arbitration to mean that an employee is only eligible for benefits if he became totally and permanently disabled while still employed. We note that the Board had never amended the SPD to reflect these points, and Bard had no prior notice of the Board's reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also not clear that this was the correct reading. The McLaughlin decision, which is in the record, relied heavily on minutes from a February 1993 Board meeting in which the Board apparently denied a claim from a former employee named Paul Cocchi (the \"Cocchi claim\") because the \"onset\" of Cocchi's disabling condition had occurred after Cocchi had left employment. Finding McLaughlin's case indistinguishable from Cocchi's, the arbitrator denied McLaughlin's claim. Importantly, the decision specifically declined to extend itself to a situation where an employee \"leaves employment because of the onset of a disabling condition that becomes total and permanent at a later date.\" This nuance apparently went unnoticed by the Board, and it is unclear if Bard was ever given an opportunity to dispute the Board's reading of the McLaughlin arbitration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The First Denial and Bard's Attempted Review</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains no evidence that the Board's first denial of benefits, or its specific reasons for that denial, were communicated to Bard in writing or by electronic means. This was in contravention of federal regulations. <i>See</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2560.503-1(g)(1) (requiring \"written or electronic notification\" of any initial \"adverse benefit determination\"); <i>id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(g)(1)(i) (requiring that this notification explain the specific reasons on which the determination was based). By some means, however, Bard learned the <i>outcome</i> of the Board's first decision, although not necessarily its reasoning, as Bard took an administrative appeal in late 2003 to challenge the Board's initial determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal apparently went to the Board because it had failed to provide for an independent appellate body. This also contravened regulations. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(h)(3)(ii), (h)(4) (requiring that an appeal be decided, without any deference to the prior determination, by an appropriate plan fiduciary \"who is neither the individual who made the [initial] adverse benefit determination . . . nor the subordinate of such individual\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During January 2004, Bard also submitted an application for disability benefits on a BSA-ILA form, along with medical documentation regarding his disability. Some of the documentation stated that Bard was \"totally and permanently disabled,\" but did not date the onset of symptoms or of total disability. However, a letter from Dr. Alba De Simone and Dr. Kishanlal Chakrabarti stated that Bard had become disabled in December of 2001. At the time Bard submitted this letter, it appears that he understood the Plan to require him to demonstrate that he was disabled, but not that he was disabled while still employed. There is no evidence that, as of this point in time, the Board had yet informed Bard of the <i>reasons</i> for its initial rejection of his application, as it was required to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustees again considered Bard's case at a January 30, 2004 meeting. This time they debated the <i>substantive</i> question of whether Bard's application should be approved. They deadlocked. They asked that the Plan's attorney be present at the next meeting to advise them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the January 30th meeting, but before the next Board meeting, it appears that Bard had additional medical information faxed to the Board: a medical report from a counselor at Lawless &amp; Company (a counseling service provider). This report stated that Bard had received treatment for substance abuse in March of 2000. The report also stated that as of that month, which was more than a year before Bard's crane accident, Bard had shown symptoms consistent with various psychological disorders, though the counselor had declined to make a final diagnosis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board, at its February 25, 2004 meeting, continued considering the substantive question of whether or not Bard should receive disability benefits. The trustees, following their interpretation of the McLaughlin arbitration, questioned whether Bard had been totally and permanently disabled <i>prior to</i> his termination. The trustees weighed the fact that Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti had placed December 2001 as the date on which Bard became totally disabled. The Board also considered whether Bard could have been totally and permanently disabled prior to termination if he had been working right up until the day he was fired. A vote was taken and the trustees again deadlocked, seven to seven. There is no evidence that the Board took any further action on Bard's application for approximately the next four months, despite applicable regulatory time limits. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2560.503-1(i)(3)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bard retained counsel, and on June 28, 2004, his attorney sent BSA-ILA a letter requesting all documents relevant to Bard's application. Meeting minutes from the three Board meetings discussing Bard apparently were sent in response to this request, along with other documents. It was only at this point, or through verbal representations made to Bard some time after the January or February 2004 meetings, that Bard learned of the Plan's apparent requirement that he have become totally and permanently disabled while still employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>The August 2004 Submissions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 2004, Bard's attorney sent the Plan a letter requesting that Bard's application be considered at the next Board meeting. Bard also submitted additional evidence, including medical evidence that Bard had become totally and permanently disabled prior to the July 23, 2001 termination of his employment. Specifically, Bard included a letter from Dr. Elliott Segal stating that Dr. Segal had treated Bard between October 2, 2001, and March 4, 2002, and that in Dr. Segal's opinion Bard had become totally and permanently disabled prior to termination of his employment. Bard also included a revised letter from Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti, dated June 23, 2004, in which they now said Bard had been disabled at least since March 21, 2000. Additionally, Bard submitted the Social Security Administration's determination that he had become disabled as of the day before he was terminated from employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Finally, Bard submitted his own affidavit stating, inter alia, that due to his mental health condition he believed that he had been unable to work \"in any gainful way\" since 2000, notwithstanding the fact that he had been employed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustees again considered Bard's application at their August 25, 2004 meeting. At the January and February meetings, the trustees had apparently considered the <i>substantive</i> question of Bard's eligibility for benefits. At this meeting, however, the trustees appear to have reverted back to considering the <i>procedural</i> question of whether Bard was even eligible to apply for disability benefits; on that issue the management and union trustees deadlocked, seven to seven. The Board decided to submit the issue to arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Suit, Arbitration, and Ultimate Denial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frustrated with the delay, Bard filed suit on September 7, 2004, in federal district court in Massachusetts seeking benefits under the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While that suit was pending, on December 20, 2004, a hearing was held before an arbitrator on the issue of Bard's eligibility to apply for benefits. One of the management trustees' key arguments was that because Bard had been working as a crane operator up until his termination date, Bard clearly had not been totally and permanently disabled prior to termination. Thus these trustees saw no need to allow Bard even to apply for benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a written decision dated March 4, 2005, the arbitrator rejected the management trustees' position. He decided that Bard was eligible to apply for benefits because he was now alleging that his total disability occurred prior to his termination. The arbitrator also explained that the issue of whether Bard's application should be approved on the merits was not an issue presented to him for review. The management trustees' argument went to the merits of Bard's claim, not to the procedural question of Bard's eligibility to apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By now it was at least 17 months after Bard first applied for benefits from the Plan. The Board, accepting the arbitrator's decision that Bard was eligible to apply, then considered the merits of Bard's application at its meeting on March 23, 2005. By a vote of ten to four, the trustees rejected the application. The meeting minutes do not state the Board's reasons for its decision. On April 28, 2005, the Board sent Bard a letter communicating the denial of benefits. The sole reason for decision stated in the letter was that \"Pursuant to Article VIII (Disability Benefits)\" of the Plan, the Board \"in its sole judgement\" had determined that Bard \"was not totally and permanently disabled prior to his termination.\" No explanation was provided in the letter as to the reasons for the Board's determination. The letter also stated that Bard had the right to \"appeal\" the decision to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties then moved for summary judgment in the federal court action. In a decision issued on March 16, 2006, the district court granted BSA-ILA's motion and denied Bard's. The court first reasoned that the Plan was entitled to the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review because plan provisions gave the Board discretionary authority to interpret the Plan's terms and to make disability determinations. Under that standard, the district court found that the Plan could reasonably have determined, based on the evidence before it, that Bard was not totally and permanently disabled prior to termination of his employment. Additionally, the district court rejected Bard's argument that the Plan's terms did not actually require a claimant to have been disabled prior to termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Orndorf v.

In the ERISA context, summary judgment is merely a vehicle for deciding the case; the factual determination of eligibility for benefits is decided solely on the administrative record, and \"the non-moving party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.\" <i>Id.</i> at 517.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While our review of the district court's decision is de novo, our standard of review for the Board's decision is a different issue entirely.

Faced with no decision from the Board, Bard brought suit on a \"deemed exhausted\" basis,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> similar to what was known as a \"deemed denied\" basis under the old ERISA regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See Mass.

At the same time, it is not clear that the ERISA regulatory structure intends to give multi-employer plans the kind of slack that the Plan appropriated for itself in this case. <i>Cf.</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2560.503-1(i)(3)(ii) (outlining special time limits, applicable only to multi-employer plans, for a plan to decide a disability benefits appeal and notify the claimant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, we do not decide whether the Plan's failure to render a timely decision by itself entitles Bard to de novo review, whether the Plan's eventual benefits denial after suit was filed was in \"substantial compliance\" with ERISA's time limits and other regulations, or whether inquiry into \"substantial compliance\" is even relevant in ERISA cases of this nature &#8212; whether brought under the new regulations or otherwise. Those are complicated questions on which the circuits have divided. <i>See Nichols v. Prudential Ins.

Instead, in keeping with our case-by-case approach, we tailor our resolution of the issues to the unique facts presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case reveals substantial confusion on the Plan's part about the basic eligibility requirements for applying for benefits, the substantive standard for awarding benefits, and the procedures for taking an administrative appeal from the denial of benefits. We evaluate the Plan's procedural missteps in light of ERISA's requirement that plans provide clear notice to potential claimants of their substantive and procedural rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The need for clear notice pervades the ERISA regulatory structure. For example, one of the key purposes of an SPD is to state in normal everyday language both what the eligibility requirements are, and what procedures the claimant must follow. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1022(a). Similarly, when a plan denies benefits, it is required to provide a notification that sets forth \"specific reasons for such a denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1133; <i>see also</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2560.503-1(g)(1) (requiring that the notification of a denial of benefits provide its explanation \"in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant\"). The Plan's documents themselves require that in the event of a benefits denial, BSA-ILA must provide the claimant with notice that sets forth \"[t]he specific reason or reasons for the denial\" and makes \"[s]pecific reference to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We focus on two pertinent points in evaluating the lack of clarity and notice to Bard: Bard's reliance on a reasonable interpretation of the Plan, and the ultimate effect of the lack of clarity and notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first point is that the Board's ultimate interpretation of the Plan &#8212; that a claimant must be permanently and totally disabled before the termination of employment &#8212; is not at all self-evident from the Plan's language. Bard's contrary reading is reasonable, and it was not unreasonable for Bard, in the absence of clarification from the SPD, to rely on that reading in submitting his initial supporting medical documentation. Of course, the fact that a plan provision is capable of different readings would not alone negate deference to the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second point rests on the first. The Board's handling of the Plan's ambiguity, and its failure to comply with ERISA's requirements, caused substantive prejudice to Bard's application going well beyond the costs of delay. In the particular circumstances of this case, Bard was faced with a constant shift in what he was required to show. And then BSA-ILA made matters worse by failing to consider the evidence he submitted in an attempt to meet a moving target.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the Plan's ambiguity, the Board's procedural failures, and the subsequent prejudice to Bard, and for the reasons that follow, we find that Bard is entitled to a remedy. The result is limited to this case. We do not reach hypothetical questions about future applicants under this Plan who are accurately and adequately notified of BSA-ILA's interpretation. Instead, we state our holding as follows: when a plan with material ambiguous terms violates ERISA in the manner that BSA-ILA did, and a claimant's application is prejudiced by these violations through his reliance on a reasonable interpretation that the plan does not ultimately adopt, we will bar the plan from using the claimant's reliance against him. We start by explaining why Bard's understanding of the Plan's terms was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Plan's Terms</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No BSA-ILA plan provision explicitly requires that a claimant have been totally and permanently disabled prior to termination of his employment. Such a requirement is not hard to draft. <i>Cf. Perry v. New England Bus. Serv., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200701\"><a href=\"/opinion/200701/perry-v-new-england-business/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span>, 344-45 (1st Cir.2003) (plan explicitly provided that disability benefits were only available if the claimant became disabled before \"ceas[ing] to be an Active Full-time Employee\"). Rather, the relevant plan provisions merely grant benefits to a \"Participant\" who has accrued sufficient years of service, and who becomes \"totally and permanently disabled.\" The Plan's general definitions section defines \"Participant\" as \"an Employee who has met the requirements of eligibility to participate in the Plan.\" And \"Employee\" is in turn defined as \"each individual who now, or hereafter is employed as a Longshoreman, Clerk, or Linehandler in the industry and is a member of the ILA and for whom an Employer is required to make contributions\" to the Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BSA-ILA argues that its interpretation is obvious from this language. Its argument is apparently that the word \"Employee,\" as referred to in the definition of \"Participant,\" must mean either a current employee or someone who was a current employee at the time he became eligible for benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is fair to say that Bard's contrary reading is also reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> He argues that the word \"Employee\" includes former employees who become totally and permanently disabled after leaving employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Bard contends that the definition of \"Employee,\" by its plain language, makes no distinction between former and present employees. It merely refers to an individual who \"now or hereafter\" is employed in certain positions, is a member of the ILA, and is a person for whom contributions are required. Either at the time the Plan was adopted, or at a time afterwards, Bard met these requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Indeed, Bard argues that a number of other plan terms clearly refer to the word \"Participant\" as including former employees who were not eligible for the payment of benefits at the time of their termination. In particular, the Plan's retirement provisions specifically refer to \"terminated Participants,\" who are eligible to receive their vested pensions upon attaining a particular age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, Bard argues that his interpretation comports with ERISA's definition of the word \"participant.\" Under that definition, a \"participant\" is \"any employee <i>or former employee</i> of an employer . . . who <i>is or may become eligible</i> to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(7) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our response is that ERISA's definitions technically apply only within the ERISA statute, and the Plan can of course adopt its own meanings of various terms. The Plan itself provides for arbitration to decide close questions of interpretation, and Bard has no special interpretive status. We merely conclude that Bard's interpretation, in the absence of clear guidance, was reasonable. The rest of our analysis relies on nothing more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Plan's Procedural Failures</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the Plan uniformly and promptly settled upon an interpretation of the key plan terms, and made that interpretation clear to Bard at all material times, this might have been a different case. But it did not, and how it handled his claim violated ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan's specific violations of the ERISA regulations had different characteristics.

It is clear that the Board treated the \"holding\" of the McLaughlin arbitration as stating a rule governing which claimants may apply for benefits.

The full Board both initially rejected Bard's application and heard Bard's appeal from that denial.

In <i>Terry,</i> the notice of denial of benefits had arguably failed to meet ERISA's notice requirements, and the court required the plaintiff to show prejudice in order to obtain benefits. <i>See</i> 145 F.3d at 38-39. In <i>Recupero v. New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.,</i> this court adopted a requirement of showing prejudice to obtain benefits in an ERISA &#167; 503(1), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1133(1), defective notice case. <i>See</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197450\"><a href=\"/opinion/197450/recupero-v-ne-telephone/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span>, 840 (1st Cir.1997). <i>DiGregorio</i> rejected the argument that <i>Terry</i> and <i>Recupero</i> were distinguishable because of the differences in procedural violations and the differences in remedies sought. <i>See</i> 423 F.3d at 16. Without addressing whether a prejudice showing is always required under the new ERISA regulations, we find that Bard was prejudiced by the Plan's ERISA failures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Plan's failure to comply with the ERISA notice provisions significantly prejudiced Bard in his claim for benefits. Because Bard was not initially informed that he needed to show that his total disability occurred prior to termination of his employment, he submitted medical documentation not meant to address that point and which ultimately proved quite harmful to his administrative appeal. Specifically, when Bard submitted medical evidence of his disability in January 2004, he included a letter from Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti stating that he had become totally disabled in December of 2001&#8212;approximately five months after he stopped working. At the time of this submission neither he nor his doctors had been informed that the exact date of his total disability would be relevant. Indeed, under Bard's reasonable reading of the Plan, he needed only to show that he was totally and permanently disabled <i>at the time of his submission.</i> He had little reason then to ask Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti to be precise about the date he became disabled. And it is unclear whether Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti in fact engaged in any analysis that specifically tried to identify the exact onset date of Bard's disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Bard learned of the Plan's interpretation of its disability provisions, he went back to Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti. They then issued a revised letter dating Bard's disability to before Bard's termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Additionally, Bard obtained a letter from Dr. Segal, which also dated Bard's disability to before his termination from employment. These letters were submitted to the Board in August 2004 as part of Bard's attempt to restart the then-stalled review process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, when the Board later voted to deny benefits, its counsel tells us that it discounted Bard's new medical evidence because it was inconsistent with the disability date reflected in Bard's first batch of evidence. Indeed, the Plan's brief to this court recounts that the Board members \"elected to discount the Appellant's self-serving and revised medicals&#8212;which were created <i>after</i> the Appellant knew of the issue about when his disability occurred&#8212;and rely on his first set of medicals, which documented no disability until after his termination.\" The prejudice from the Plan's faulty notice could not be clearer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prejudice to Bard was then compounded by the Board's failure to take the required steps for ensuring objective administrative review. Had a different fiduciary decided Bard's appeal (instead of the same entity that initially rejected Bard's claim), and/or had the Board followed ERISA regulations by consulting an appropriate medical expert, it might not have so readily dismissed Bard's medical evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan contends that because Bard was working as of his termination date, it is inherently unreasonable to conclude he was totally and permanently disabled at that time. It implies that, as a result, Bard suffered no prejudice from the Plan's violations. We reject the argument on the facts here. The Plan essentially asks this court to adopt a legal rule that it is fundamentally inconsistent for an ERISA claimant to be at work and also be sufficiently disabled to support a total and permanent disability claim. That is not self-evidently true. Instead, the matter appears to depend on the nature of the disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> As the McLaughlin arbitrator recognized, permanent and total disability may develop while someone is working. This certainly applies, inter alia, in cases of mental disabilities. <i>See Radford Trust v. First Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2411205\"><a href=\"/opinion/2411205/radford-trust-v-first-unum-life-ins-co-of-am/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 246-47 (D.Mass.2004). In fact, Bard's doctors obviously disagree with the Board's view, and they present the only competent medical evidence in the record on the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not have the benefit of any medical evidence showing that a given disabling psychological condition is inconsistent with the ability to show up at work. Thus a decision maker without medical expertise&#8212;such as this court&#8212;would be hard-pressed to conclude as the Plan argues. That is exactly why the ERISA regulations (and the Plan's documents) require that appropriate medical experts be consulted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Remedy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan's procedural irregularities here were serious, had a connection to the substantive decision reached, and call into question the integrity of the benefits-denial decision itself.

We found that the failure to communicate this explanation earlier was a violation of ERISA's notice regulations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> and that as a result the claimant had been unable to effectively challenge the new reasoning during the administrative process. <i>See id.</i> at 128-30. Ultimately, we barred the defendant in <i>Glista</i> from using its new rationale in litigation. <i>Id.</i> at 131-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bard is in a similar position: because of the Plan's failures to give proper notice, he did not learn about the Plan's interpretation until it was too late. By the time the Plan's interpretation was made clear to him, he was forced to argue his case to a Board that lacked the requisite objectivity, and that used his earlier submissions against him. Additionally, as in <i>Glista,</i> the defendant plan has \"offered no explanation for why it did not explain earlier\" its basis for the initial adverse benefit determination. <i>See id.</i> at 132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we grant relief similar to what we ordered in <i>Glista.</i> Thus we bar the defendant plan from using Bard's earlier medical evidence against him. In so doing, we essentially undo the prejudice that resulted from Bard's reliance on his initial reasonable interpretation of the Plan. <i>Cf. Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan For Salaried Employees,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771953\"><a href=\"/opinion/771953/gary-b-mauser-appellantcross-appellee-v-raytheon-company-pension-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 54-55 (1st Cir.2001) (when a plan's SPD conflicts with the plan's terms, the SPD will control if the claimant demonstrates \"significant or reasonable reliance\" on it). Our relief also remedies the possibility that the Plan's decision to rely on Bard's first evidence, rather than his later-submitted evidence, was a product of the Board's lack of objectivity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This relief results in a conclusion that the Board's denial of benefits was invalid under any standard of review, whether de novo or deferential. As we have previously noted, the Plan's terms require the Board to judge disability \"upon competent medical evidence.\" All of the medical evidence in this case was either silent on the onset of Bard's total disability, or it placed that onset before Bard's termination from employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one exception is Bard's first letter from Drs. De Simone and Chakrabarti, and the Plan is prohibited from relying on that letter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> Other than that, the Plan offers absolutely no competent medical evidence to contravene Bard's medical evidence. The Plan did not have a doctor provide any medical reason to reject Bard's evidence, nor did the Plan have Bard examined by a medical expert of its own. We have already rejected the Plan's generalized assertion that someone who is working necessarily cannot be totally disabled by a mental disease. And there is no evidence from any Plan medical expert saying that the Plan's assertion is true in Bard's case. Nor is there any <i>medical evidence</i> that Bard's doctors cannot be relied upon because they evaluated Bard after his employment had been terminated. Even now the Plan does not argue, nor can it, that its interpretation requires that a person be treated for a disability before his employment is terminated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other circumstances, it might be an appropriate remedy to remand to a plan administrator for reconsideration. <i>See Buffonge,</i> 426 F.3d at 31-32. But a remand is not appropriate here. Unlike in <i>Buffonge,</i> here the remaining evidence compels the conclusion that Bard is entitled to benefits. Additionally, the delay in this case vastly exceeded the time limits that ERISA imposes.

The Plan's denial of benefits on administrative appeal did not mention at all the Social Security ALJ's determination that Bard had been disabled at the time he was terminated. The Plan's brief posits that there was no need to mention this because the Plan's definition of disability differs from the one used by the ALJ (although the brief does not describe how). It is true that a plan is not required to accept a Social Security adjudication of disability as binding on it where the definitions of disability are different<i>See Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770872\"><a href=\"/opinion/770872/carolyn-pari-fasano-v-itt-hartford-life-and-accident-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 419-20 (1st Cir.2000). Nor is a plan required to defer to treating physicians in the manner required of an ALJ in a Social Security case. <i>See Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127929\"><a href=\"/opinion/127929/black-decker-disability-plan-v-nord/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span>, 825, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127929\"><a href=\"/opinion/127929/black-decker-disability-plan-v-nord/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If the Board did in fact discount this evidence because of a differing definition of disability, or a differing level of deference to treating physicians, the trustees could easily have stated this to Bard in their letter communicating the benefits denial. Their failure to do so suggests that the evidence was not considered at all.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Additionally, adoption of BSA-ILA's \"common sense\" rule could lead to some pernicious effects. Employers who think an employee may be becoming disabled will have an incentive to terminate satisfactory employees, before they reach the point of unambiguous disability, in order to avoid the payment of disability benefits</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The Board's position is not strengthened by our decision in<i>Sullivan v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200856\"><a href=\"/opinion/200856/sullivan-v-neiman-marcus/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004). BSA-ILA contends that <i>Sullivan,</i> a case about the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), memorializes \"the commonsense notion ... that if an employee is performing his job satisfactorily then he obviously is not totally and permanently disabled from that job.\" This reading of <i>Sullivan</i> is well out of context.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Sullivan</i> we rejected the ADA claim of an alcoholic plaintiff. The plaintiff maintained that his alcoholism constituted a disability because it significantly impaired his ability to work. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(A) (defining disability as including \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual\"). With some skepticism, we assumed that the plaintiff was correct in his contention that \"working\" could be a \"major life activity\" under this definition. <i>Sullivan,</i> 358 F.3d at 115. However, we noted the Catch-22 that resulted from this: the plaintiff had to show substantial difficulty working in order to count as \"disabled,\" but to get relief he was also statutorily required to demonstrate that he was qualified for the job he claimed he was wrongfully fired from. <i>Id.</i> at 114-17. We ultimately relied on the plaintiff's statements that he was able to perform his job adequately despite his alcoholism, and so we upheld summary judgment for the employer on the ground that the plaintiff was not disabled under the ADA. <i>Id.</i></p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Sullivan</i> does not hold that an employee who was working before termination will never be able to show he was disabled under the ADA. <i>See id.</i> at 115-17. And <i>Sullivan</i> is an ADA case, not one governed by ERISA. In any event, Bard's case presents facts and issues that are drastically different from <i>Sullivan's.</i> First, Bard flatly contended to the Board, through his affidavit and his medical evidence, that he was <i>not</i> performing his job satisfactorily at the time he was fired. Indeed, shortly before his termination Bard was involved in a crane accident, which at least suggests his performance may have been lacking. Second, nothing in the Plan presents the same Catch-22 that the <i>Sullivan</i> plaintiff faced.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> We note that there is yet another way in which Bard was harmed by the Plan's missteps. Had Bard been put on notice of the McLaughlin arbitration, and been informed of its availability, Bard could have made a substantial argument to the Plan that it was interpreting its disability provisions too strictly. As the text of the McLaughlin arbitration makes clear, the arbitrator in that case explicitly avowed ruling on a situation in which an employee's condition causes symptoms while the employee is still working, those symptoms contribute to the employee's departure from employment, and the condition then worsens into total and permanent disability after the employee has left his position. Bard arguably fits that situation. His submitted evidence demonstrates that he was experiencing psychological symptoms as early as 2000. And those symptoms may have contributed to the drug and alcohol dependency that got him fired. Even if the Plan is correct that Bard was not totally and permanently disabled prior to his termination, if Bard could show that his symptoms worsened so that he is<i>now</i> totally and permanently disabled, he could well be entitled to benefits under a plan interpretation that is perfectly consistent with the McLaughlin arbitration.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> In using the term \"sandbagging\" we mean only that from Bard's perspective, the Plan's ERISA failures set in motion a chain of events whose<i>effect</i> was to shift the targets that Bard was aiming for, and then penalize Bard for aiming at the first round of targets. We do not mean that the Plan acted in bad faith, and there is no evidence that it did.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> <i>Glista</i> was decided under the previous ERISA regulations. <i>See id.</i> at 128-29 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2560.503-1(f), (h)(3) (2000)).

But that case presented a drastically different fact pattern. There, two medical experts opined that the plaintiff was not totally disabled and that she might be faking the extent of her injuries. A third expert, proffered after the plaintiff's claim had been initially denied, took a different position. <i>Blickenstaff</i> merely holds that when faced with multiple and conflicting expert opinions, a Plan can act reasonably if it does not credit the expert whose diagnosis only came post-denial. <i>See id.</i> Bard's case presents no similar conflict: as we have restricted the record, there is <i>no</i> medical evidence that contravenes Bard's.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
