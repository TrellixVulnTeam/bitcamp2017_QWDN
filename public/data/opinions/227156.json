These auction sales are not conducted for the benefit of would-be real estate operators, and one who bids in accordance with the terms of the sale buys something permanently.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gordon in his statement of points states that the district court erred in its order and decree of September 29, 1950; in affirming the referee's confirmation of the sale to him; in affirming the referee's denial of his petition for rescission; in affirming the referee's order that he consummate the sale and in ordering him to accept the deed tendered by the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is evident from the record that the findings of fact of the referee as affirmed by the district court are not clearly erroneous and should not be disturbed on this appeal. Rule 52, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.; 2 Collier on Bankruptcy (14th Ed.) &#167; 25.30, p. 960.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt but that there was a sale in this case and that the property was knocked down to Gordon by the auctioneer. Gordon, in fact, signed a memorandum<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in which he agreed to purchase the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The period between the time the auctioneer's hammer fell and the time the sale was confirmed was not a respite during which Gordon could reconsider the wisdom of his purchase and withdraw his offer, without good cause, and thereby avoid liability. Confirmation is a device for the protection of the bankrupt estate. The stability of judicial sales is to be maintained and a bidder should not be allowed to trifle with or baffle them by the means Gordon employed here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Camden v. Mayhew, 129 U.S. 73, 85, 86, 9 S.Ct. 246, 249, 32 L.Ed. 608, the court said: \"Where a purchaser refuses, without cause, to make his bid good, he may be compelled to do so by rule or attachment issuing out of the court under whose decree the sale is had. It was so held in Blossom v. [Milwaukee &amp; C.] Railroad Co., 1 Wall. [655], 656, [17 L.Ed. 673], where it was said that a purchaser or bidder at a master's sale in chancery subjects himself <i>quoad hoc</i> to the jurisdiction of the court, and can be compelled to perform his agreement specifically. In Lansdown v. Elderton, 14 Ves. 512, a motion that the person reported to be the best bidder before the master pay within a given time the purchase money, or stand committed, was sustained by Lord Chancellor Eldon, who observed that the purchaser could not be permitted to disobey an order, more than any other person. That case was followed in Brasher v. Cortlandt, 2 Johns. Ch.[N.Y.] [505] 506, where Chancellor Kent, after observing that the purchaser ought to be compelled to complete the purchase, said: `If no order of this kind could be made in this case, it would follow that not only the purchaser, but the committee of the lunatic, would be permitted to baffle the court, and sport with its decree. * * * I have no doubt the court may, in its discretion, do it in every case where the previous conditions of the sale have not given the purchaser an alternative.' See, also, Blossom v. [Milwaukee &amp; C.] Railroad Co., 3 Wall. 196, 207 [18 L.Ed. 43]; Smith v. Arnold [Fed.Cas.No.13,004], 5 Mason, 414, 420; Requa v. Rea, 2 Paige [N.Y. 339], 341; Casamajor v. Strode, 1 Sim. &amp; S. 381; Anderson v. Foulke, 2 Har. &amp; G. [Md.] 346, 362, 373. If, as is clear, the purchaser can be required, by rule or attachment, to pay into court the entire sum bid by him, and thus complete his purchase, it is difficult to see why a bidder sought to be made liable for a deficiency resulting from a resale caused by his refusal to make his bid good may not be proceeded against in the same suit by rule, or in any other mode devised by the court that will enable him to meet the issue as to his liability. That issue in the present case was tried upon pleadings and proof, and there is no pretense that the appellant had not full opportunity to present his defense before the final order now under review was made.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case of In re Lane Lumber Co., 9 Cir., 207 F. 762, 765, did not involve a public auction but it was concerned with a judicial sale. The court overruled petitioner's contention \"that he had a right to withdraw his offers or bids at any time before the acceptance thereof by the trustee because they were merely offers to contract in the future.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In re Huguenot Pub. Co., Inc., Taylor v. Folsom, 2 Cir., 83 F.2d 258, 259, the court said: \"When a purchaser at a judicial sale has defaulted, the vendor may either obtain an order confirming the sale and directing the purchaser to complete, or, if he prefers, may obtain an order directing a resale at the purchaser's risk and requiring the purchaser to make good any loss due to receipt of a lower price on the second sale. * * *\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case an order of confirmation was obtained and Gordon was directed \"to consummate the sale so made to him not later than thirty days from April 25, 1950.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of In re Rival Knitting Co., 2 Cir., 289 F. 960, 963, the court said: \"* * * after he refused to carry out the terms of his bid, the court, without affirming the sale by a formal order, could hold him to his offer and could order a resale in the meantime at his risk, both in respect to the expenses of the resale and any deficits resulting therefrom.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the referee, after an extensive hearing, confirmed the sale and found in effect that Gordon's attempt to withdraw or rescind was without merit and that his refusal to make his bid good was without good cause. The district court affirmed and we are not disposed on the facts of this case to disturb the orders of the court or of the referee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing we were informed that, subsequent to the filing of this appeal, the parties entered into a stipulation, approved by the district court, which provided, among other things, for the resale of the property in question and that the resale has been carried out. That stipulation is not part of the record before us. We feel, however, that the district court will give effect to it in the further disposition of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court entered September 29, 1950, is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> </p>\n        <p>\"PETITIONER'S EXHIBIT 4.</p>\n        <pre>                     April 25, 1950.</pre>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"I/We Dugan Bros.

The stability of judicial sales is to be maintained and a bidder should not be allowed to trifle with or baffle them by the means Gordon employed here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Camden v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></span>, the court said: \"Where a purchaser refuses, without cause, to make his bid good, he may be compelled to do so by rule or attachment issuing out of the court under whose decree the sale is had. It was so held in Blossom v. [Milwaukee &amp; C.] Railroad Co., 1 Wall. [655], 656, [17 L.Ed. 673], where it was said that a purchaser or bidder at a master's sale in chancery subjects himself <i>quoad hoc</i> to the jurisdiction of the court, and can be compelled to perform his agreement specifically. In Lansdown v. Elderton, 14 Ves. 512, a motion that the person reported to be the best bidder before the master pay within a given time the purchase money, or stand committed, was sustained by Lord Chancellor Eldon, who observed that the purchaser could not be permitted to disobey an order, more than any other person. That case was followed in Brasher v. Cortlandt, 2 Johns. Ch.[N.Y.] [505] 506, where Chancellor Kent, after observing that the purchaser ought to be compelled to complete the purchase, said: `If no order of this kind could be made in this case, it would follow that not only the purchaser, but the committee of the lunatic, would be permitted to baffle the court, and sport with its decree. * * * I have no doubt the court may, in its discretion, do it in every case where the previous conditions of the sale have not given the purchaser an alternative.'

If, as is clear, the purchaser can be required, by rule or attachment, to pay into court the entire sum bid by him, and thus complete his purchase, it is difficult to see why a bidder sought to be made liable for a deficiency resulting from a resale caused by his refusal to make his bid good may not be proceeded against in the same suit by rule, or in any other mode devised by the court that will enable him to meet the issue as to his liability. That issue in the present case was tried upon pleadings and proof, and there is no pretense that the appellant had not full opportunity to present his defense before the final order now under review was made.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case of In re Lane Lumber Co., 9 Cir., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></span>, 765, did not involve a public auction but it was concerned with a judicial sale.
