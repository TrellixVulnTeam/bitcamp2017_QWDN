Defendants Andrea, Michael, and John R.\n\nLentz,   individually             and   d/b/a        L&L    Collisions,    appeal        civil\n\njudgments       entered       upon      jury    verdicts       concluding        that     they\n\nparticipated in an automobile insurance fraud scheme which damaged\n\nplaintiff Metropolitan Property & Casualty Company and violated,\n\ninter alia, the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\n\n(\"RICO\") Act.         See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962, 1964.                 Defendants argue that,\n\ndue to a nearly complete absence of evidence that the United States\n\nmails    were     used       in    furtherance         of    the     scheme,     there     was\n\ninsufficient evidence from which the jury could have found the\n\npredicate acts of mail fraud -- the theory under which the RICO\n\nclaim went to the jury -- and, derivatively, insufficient evidence\n\nfrom which the jury could have found that the alleged acts of mail\n\nfraud    constituted          a      \"pattern\"         of    racketeering        activity.1\n\nProceeding       on    the    assumption        that       their    principal     appellate\n\nargument    is    meritorious,          defendants          further    contend    that     the\n\nevidence relevant to the RICO counts (which defendants say the jury\n\nnever should have heard) was so prejudicial that it might well have\n\nmisled the jury into holding them liable under non-RICO theories.\n\n             Our review of the record reveals that defendants did not\n\n\n\n     1\n      Defendants also hint at other theories why there was\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury's \"pattern\" finding, but\nthose theories fail because, in addition to being only minimally\ndeveloped on appeal, they were not presented with sufficient\nspecificity to the district court before the jury was discharged.\nSee infra.\n\n                                               -2-\n\fpresent either their principal appellate argument, or the \"pattern\"\n\nargument which is largely built from it, see n.1, above, to the\n\ndistrict court with sufficient specificity to have made their\n\nposition on the matter understood until after the jury verdicts\n\nwere returned.     We will not disturb a lower court's judgment on the\n\nbasis of an argument raised so late in the game unless the argument\n\npersuades us that, among other things, a miscarriage of justice has\n\noccurred.    See Davignon v. Clemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(argument first presented in a post-verdict Fed. R. Civ. P. 50\n\nmotion is forfeited); Blockel v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., 337 F.3d\n\n17, 25 (1st Cir. 2003) (sufficiency arguments must be made with\n\nspecificity to preserve them for plenary appellate review); Rivera-\n\nTorres v. Ortiz Velez, 2003 WL 22006239, at *14 (1st Cir. Aug. 26,\n\n2003)   (\"claims   forfeit[ed]   through   ignorance   or   neglect\"   are\n\nsubject to plain error review, which permits error correction in\n\ncivil cases only when the error \"resulted in a miscarriage of\n\njustice or seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation    of   judicial   proceedings\")   (citations    and   internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).      There was no miscarriage of justice in\n\nthis case.    Rather than demonstrating or strongly suggesting that\n\nno mailings took place in furtherance of the scheme, the record is\n\nmerely ambiguous about which documents were mailed and which were\n\nhand delivered.      An ambiguity of this sort does not call into\n\nquestion the fundamental fairness of the trial.
