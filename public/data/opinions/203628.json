George Z.

This is defendant Mitchell McGuire's pro se\n\nappeal from the district court's denial of a sentence reduction\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3582 and the recently amended crack guidelines.1\n\nThe only argument that defendant makes on appeal is that the\n\ndistrict court denied him due process by treating his motion for\n\nappointment of counsel as a motion for a sentence reduction and\n\ndenying it as such.\n\n          We need not consider the merits of that due-process\n\nargument because any error in denying a reduction without first\n\ngiving defendant an opportunity to be heard was harmless; it is\n\nclear that the reduction would have been correctly denied in any\n\nevent.   United States v. Ganun, 547 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(per curiam).   As recognized by the district court, defendant was\n\nstatutorily ineligible for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3582(c)(2) because his guideline range was based on the career\n\noffender guideline rather than the crack guideline and therefore\n\nwas not \"based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been\n\nlowered\" by the recent crack cocaine amendments.
