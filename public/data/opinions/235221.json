The inner side of the frame extends slightly above the level of the top side of the frame so as to provide a condensation gutter.  The top or covering member of the frame joins both sides and then continues outwardly on a horizontal plane to form a marginal flange.  On top of this basic frame there is set an elliptic plastic dome with an outwardly projecting base flange coextensive with the horizontal flange of the frame.  The dome and frame are joined on these flanges by passing bolts through aligned holes in these flanges; the holes in the plastic being slightly larger in diameter than the bolts so as to allow for the expansion and contraction of the plastic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court in holding that the patent is invalid for want of invention stated that '* * * practically every element in the plaintiff's patent was taken directly from the prior art and those that were not (if there are any) were either suggested by the prior art or else were devised by the patentee as unstartling routine solutions to problems incident to the use of the materials incorporated in the plaintiff's patent.'
