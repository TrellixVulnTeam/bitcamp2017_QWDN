David Eduardo Castañeda-Castillo\n\n(\"Castañeda\") entered the United States together with his family in\n\nAugust 1991 on a tourist visa, overstayed and in January 1993\n\napplied for asylum. In July 1999, the responsible agency--then the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")--began a removal\n\nproceeding, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B) (2000). Thereafter, Castañeda\n\ntestified at successive hearings seeking to establish his need for\n\nasylum and to refute a claim that he was barred from asylum by\n\nreason of having assisted or otherwise participated in persecution.\n\nId. § 1158.\n\n              Castañeda, the only witness at the hearings, testified in\n\nsubstance that he had been commissioned as a lieutenant in the\n\nPeruvian military in 1983.        In January 1985 he was transferred to\n\nan antiterrorist unit in an area designated an emergency zone in\n\nwhich   the    Shining   Path   was   active.    The   Shining     Path   is    a\n\nrevolutionary Marxist organization, well known for its energy and\n\nbrutality, that has been at war with the Peruvian government for\n\nmany years.\n\n              In August 1985, the military conducted an operation to\n\nsearch for Shining Path members in the village of Llocllapampa in\n\nthe   Accomarca    region.      Two   patrols,   one   of   them   headed      by\n\nSublieutenant Telmo Hurtado and the other by Lieutenant Riveri\n\nRondon, were to enter the village and conduct the search.                   Two\n\nother patrols, one of which was led by Castañeda, were assigned to\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fblock escape routes from the village.         Castañeda's patrol located\n\nitself about three to five miles from the village on either side of\n\na path.\n\n           The first two patrols entered the village and there\n\nfollowed   a   brutal   massacre    of   dozens   of   innocent   villagers,\n\nincluding many women and children.         Castañeda said that he was in\n\nradio contact with his base commander but not with the patrols\n\nentering the town, and that he did not know when the attack had\n\noccurred or that it had turned into a massacre of civilians.\n\nAccording to Castañeda, he did not learn of the massacre until\n\nabout three weeks after the operation when he heard that Hurtado\n\nhad confessed to executing civilians.\n\n           The Peruvian Senate Human Rights Commission conducted an\n\ninvestigation    and    concluded   that    Hurtado's    patrol   had   been\n\nprimarily responsible for the massacre. However, the report stated\n\nthat Hurtado was \"only a piece of a large picture and it is\n\nnecessary to study whether he acted on virtue of expressed verbal\n\norders or if he acted as such because that is how he has formed.\"\n\nAs to Castañeda, the report concluded that his squad \"was not\n\ninvolved in any confrontations with fugitive civilians.\"\n\n           Castañeda was charged before a military tribunal with\n\nhomicide and abuse of authority, but the charges were dismissed.\n\nHurtado, Riveri Rondon, and other officers were also charged, and\n\nHurtado was convicted of abuse of authority, given a sentence which\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fwas later commuted in a general amnesty, and eventually restored to\n\nduty and promoted to captain.\n\n             After the court martial, Castañeda returned to duty and\n\nwas promoted.       However, he had been publicly associated with the\n\nmassacre and (he testified) began to receive death threats from the\n\nShining     Path.    According   to   Castañeda,   the   Shining   Path   had\n\nattempted to murder him on two occasions and to kidnap one of his\n\ndaughters, and a neighbor and military colleague who had received\n\nsimilar threats was murdered by the Shining Path.            These events,\n\nCastañeda said, prompted him to flee to the United States with his\n\nfamily.\n\n             Under the Immigration and Naturalization Act, an alien is\n\nnot eligible for asylum or withholding of removal if the Attorney\n\nGeneral determines that \"the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or\n\notherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account\n\nof race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\"          8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(i); see\n\nalso id. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). In October 2004, following the series\n\nof hearings, the immigration judge (\"IJ\") found that this bar\n\napplied to Castañeda.\n\n             After a discussion of Castañeda's testimony, the IJ\n\nconcluded that Castañeda was not credible; the IJ also said that\n\neven   if    Castañeda's   testimony    were   believed,    Castañeda     had\n\nnevertheless assisted in persecution because the \"objective effect\"\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fof his participation in the operation as a blocking force was to\n\nconfine the villagers and thus aid in their massacre. In September\n\n2005, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\" or \"Board\") affirmed\n\nthe IJ's ruling in a brief decision, agreeing that Castañeda had\n\nnot been a credible witness and seemingly endorsing the \"objective\n\neffect\" ground as well.\n\n            Castañeda petitioned to this court for judicial review.\n\nA divided panel reversed the BIA and determined that the BIA's\n\nadverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial\n\nevidence,    Castañeda-Castillo v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 112 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), and that the persecutor bar did not apply to Castañeda.    It\n\nremanded solely for a determination as to the merits of his asylum\n\nand withholding of removal application--a separate and sequential\n\nissue that is not before us.    On petition by the government, this\n\ncourt agreed to rehear the case en banc, vacating the panel\n\ndecision.\n\n            The Legal Issue.   The statute that bars persecutors has\n\na smooth surface beneath which lie a series of rocks.     Among the\n\nproblems are the nature of the acts and motivations that comprise\n\npersecution, the role of scienter, whether and when inaction may\n\nsuffice, and the kind of connection with persecution by others that\n\nconstitutes \"assistance.\"      The more one ponders the variety of\n\npossible situations, the less confident one becomes of a useful,\n\nall-embracing answer.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          Yet the inquiry in this case can be narrowed.        The\n\ngovernment asserts and Castañeda does not deny that the deliberate\n\nmassacre of civilians because of their perceived connection with or\n\nsupport for the Shining Path amounted to persecution.     Nor does\n\nCastañeda dispute that, if he had been aware in advance of a plan\n\nto murder civilians, his role in leading a patrol to block escape\n\nroutes could be treated as culpable assistance.   We think that the\n\nsame could be true if he learned of a massacre in progress and\n\ncontinued to assist by blocking escape routes.\n\n          What remains in dispute is the legal question whether the\n\npersecutor bar would apply to Castañeda if he had no prior or\n\ncontemporaneous knowledge of the murder of civilians.   Castañeda,\n\nsaying that he lacked such knowledge, argues that the answer is no.\n\nBy contrast, the government has taken the position, most fully\n\nelaborated in a letter from government counsel sent in response to\n\na query from the panel, that such culpable knowledge is not\n\nrequired by the statute.\n\n          For this view the government offers several arguments.\n\nOne--the lack of an explicit scienter requirement in the statute--\n\nis not persuasive:   the term \"persecution\" strongly implies both\n\nscienter and illicit motivation.   Dictionary definitions, as well\n\nas the Board's own precedent, bear this out.1      So does common\n\n\n     1\n      The dictionary defines \"persecute\" as \"to pursue with\nharassing or oppressive treatment, esp. because of religion, race,\nor beliefs; harass persistently.\" Random House Dictionary of the\n\n                               -7-\n\fsense:   the bus driver who unwittingly ferries a killer to the site\n\nof a massacre can hardly be labeled a \"persecutor,\" even if the\n\nobjective effect of his actions was to aid the killer's secret\n\nplan.\n\n           The government cites Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U.S.\n\n490 (1981), Xie v. INS, 434 F.3d 136, 142-43 (2d Cir. 2006), and In\n\nre Rodriguez-Majano, 19 I. & N. Dec. 811, 814-15 (BIA 1988), for\n\nthe view that scienter is not required and that the \"objective\n\neffect\" of an alien's actions is all that matters.             But these\n\ndecisions merely say that one can \"assist\" in persecution even if\n\nhis assistance is involuntary; the involuntariness claims seem to\n\nhave fallen somewhere between a showing of true duress and an\n\n\"obeying orders\" defense.     Cf. Hernandez v. Reno, 258 F.3d 806,\n\n814-15 (8th Cir. 2001).\n\n           The   government   also   cites   various   court    and   BIA\n\nprecedents that suggest that the \"totality of the relevant conduct\"\n\nmay be taken into account in determining whether one has assisted\n\nin the persecution of others.   But these cases tend to reaffirm the\n\nneed for some degree of moral culpability; and again, most focus on\n\n\n\n\nEnglish Language (2d ed. unabr. 1987).        The Board defines\npersecution as \"harm or suffering\" inflicted \"to overcome a\ncharacteristic of the victim.\" In re Kasinga, 21 I. & N. Dec. 357,\n365 (BIA 1996).\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthe question whether certain conduct constitutes \"assistance,\" not\n\non the issue of scienter.2\n\n           Two circuit cases might be read to depreciate the need\n\nfor scienter, see United States v. Schmidt, 923 F.2d 1253, 1258 &\n\nn.8 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 921 (1991) (involving an SS\n\nofficer who guarded a concentration camp and escorted inmates to\n\nand from forced labor sites); Kulle v. INS, 825 F.2d 1188, 1193\n\n(7th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1042 (1988) (same).        But in\n\nboth, knowledge of persecution was not in doubt and could be\n\ninferred from presence at the place of persecution.         And most case\n\nlaw assumes or affirms the need for some degree of subjective\n\nfault.   See note 2, above.\n\n           The government's better arguments turn on the need for\n\nsome flexibility in applying the statute to gray areas and the\n\nlatitude   implicitly    confided     to   the   Attorney    General   in\n\nadministering the scheme.     Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res.\n\nDef. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984).       Consider, for example,\n\ncases of willful blindness or strong suspicions, or an abettor who\n\nknows generally of a pattern of persecution while being ignorant of\n\nspecific incidents.     There may well be gray-area cases where less\n\nthan full and detailed knowledge may suffice.\n\n\n     2\n      E.g., Miranda Alvarado v. Gonzales, 449 F.3d 915, 927-29 (9th\nCir.), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 505 (2006); Xie, 434 F.3d at 142-\n43; Vukmirovic v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 1247, 1252 (9th Cir. 2004);\nHernandez v. Reno, 258 F.3d at 814-15; In re A--H--, 23 I. & N.\nDec. 774, 784 (BIA 2005).\n\n                                    -9-\n\f               But in the present case, it appears as if Castañeda\n\neither had guilty knowledge or (as he claims) knew nothing about\n\nthe massacre until after it had occurred.                   If this is a case\n\nsomewhere       in    between--say,      of   strong    suspicions    or    willful\n\nblindness on Castañeda's part--the government has not spelled out\n\nsuch a possibility.           No such scenario is described in the IJ or\n\nBoard decisions, and the government does not point to any evidence\n\nfor such an \"in between\" assessment.\n\n               Nor is it an excuse for dispensing with scienter that\n\nknowledge may be hard for the government to prove:                  in cases like\n\nours, once the government introduced evidence of the applicant's\n\nassociation with persecution, it then became Castañeda's burden to\n\ndisprove       that    he    was    engaged   in   persecution.      8     C.F.R.   §\n\n1208.13(c)(2)(ii); see Abdille v. Ashcroft, 242 F.3d 477, 491 (3d\n\nCir.       2001).    Here,   this    would    require   Castañeda    to    disprove\n\nknowledge.3\n\n               We hold that presumptively the persecutor bar should be\n\nread not to apply to Castañeda if his version of his state of mind\n\nis accepted.         On remand the agency can, if it wants, try to develop\n\na construction more favorable to the government.                  But this would\n\n\n\n       3\n      The government's evidence showed that atrocities had\noccurred, that they were likely on account of political opinion,\nand that Castañeda--wittingly or not--had been involved to the\nextent described.   This is enough to shift the burden to him.\nMiranda Alvarado, 449 F.3d at 930; Salazar v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d\n45, 50 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                         -10-\n\fhave to be done expressly and persuasively, and not by vague\n\nreference to the \"totality of . . . conduct\" that conflates the\n\nquestion whether one's conduct constitutes \"assistance\" with the\n\nquestion whether one possessed such scienter as may be required\n\nunder the circumstances.\n\n           The IJ, Board, and government's filings can all be read\n\nto assume that scienter is not required and that any conduct with\n\nan \"objective effect\" of facilitating persecution by others would\n\nsuffice to trigger the bar.       The Board stated that \"it may be true\"\n\nthat Castañeda \"lacked knowledge regarding the events which took\n\nplace following the August 8 massacre, including whether and how\n\nmany   people   were   killed.\"      Although      the   IJ   came   closer     to\n\nsuggesting that Castañeda had guilty knowledge, the Board did not\n\nadopt this ground and the IJ himself assumed that such knowledge\n\nwas unnecessary.\n\n           If   the    IJ   and   Board   rested   their      decision   upon    a\n\nmisunderstanding of the legal elements of persecution, the ordinary\n\nremedy is a remand to allow the matter to be considered anew under\n\nthe proper legal standards.        INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U.S. 12,\n\n16-17 (2002) (per curiam).          The main question is how far this\n\nmisunderstanding infected the fact-finder's conclusion, and the\n\nburden of showing lack of prejudice is normally on the party\n\nwishing to excuse an error.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f              This would be a different case if the evidence clearly\n\nestablished that Castañeda had guilty knowledge, or that his denial\n\nof knowledge was unworthy of belief, so that remanding \"would be an\n\nidle and useless formality.\"            NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 394 U.S.\n\n759, 766 n.6 (1969); see also Li v. INS, 453 F.3d 129, 137 (2d Cir.\n\n2006).   Here, however, there is no direct evidence of Castañeda's\n\nknowledge;     and   the   IJ's   and    the   Board's   adverse   credibility\n\nfindings are independently vulnerable.\n\n              Credibility.   Because the burden rested on Castañeda to\n\nshow that he was not a persecutor, the IJ and the Board needed to\n\ndo no more than make a well-reasoned and specific determination\n\nbased in the record that Castañeda was not credible in denying\n\ntimely knowledge of the massacre.          The rule in Moore v. Chesapeake\n\n& Ohio Ry. Co., 340 U.S. 573, 576 (1951)--that a fact cannot be\n\nestablished by disbelieving a witness's denial of that fact--does\n\nnot assist one who (like Castañeda) bears the burden of proof as to\n\nthe existence of the fact (here, lack of knowledge) and fails to\n\ncarry it.\n\n              Although the fact-finder on the scene has the advantage\n\nas to demeanor evidence, Cordero-Trejo v. INS, 40 F.3d 482, 487\n\n(1st   Cir.    1994),   judges    are   expected--unlike     juries--to   give\n\nreasons for their conclusions even on credibility.                 The reasons\n\nmust be \"cogent\" and \"specific,\" Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 46-47\n\n(1st Cir. 1998), and must be \"reasonably grounded in the record,\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fviewed as a whole,\" Cordero-Trejo, 40 F.3d at 487.                        It is not our\n\ntask       to    \"invent       explanations    that    may   justify\"     the   agency's\n\nconclusion.         Dia v. Ashcroft, 353 F.3d 228, 260 (3d Cir. 2003) (en\n\nbanc).\n\n                  The government may be arguing that the quality of the\n\nexplanation provided is irrelevant because, under a 1996 amendment,\n\n\"administrative            findings     of    fact     are   conclusive     unless   any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary,\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).4 The quoted language reflects\n\na gloss by the Supreme Court as to when a court may disagree with\n\nthe fact-finder's weighing of evidence.                       See United States v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483 (1992).                      Neither we nor other\n\ncourts          treat    this    language     as     eliminating    the    conventional\n\nrequirement             that    an   administrative      agency's    explanation      be\n\nrational.5\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      A companion provision, more narrowly focused, provides: \"No\ncourt shall reverse a determination made by a trier of fact with\nrespect to the availability of corroborating evidence . . . unless\nthe court finds . . . that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled\nto conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.\" 8\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(4).\n       5\n      See, e.g., Simo v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 2006)\n(requiring that adverse credibility determinations be accompanied\nby \"specific, cogent, and supportable explanation\"); Capric v.\nAshcroft, 355 F.3d 1075, 1086-87 (7th Cir. 2004) (same); Secaida-\nRosales v. INS, 331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir. 2003) (same); Gao v.\nAshcroft, 299 F.3d 266, 275-76 (3d Cir. 2002) (same); Gui v.

Such possibilities do not prevent a fact-finder from\n\ndisbelieving Castañeda's denial of knowledge, but they underscore\n\nthe need for a rational explanation, rooted in the record, to\n\nsupport a finding that Castañeda should be disbelieved.\n\n            On the present facts, a well-reasoned explanation by the\n\nIJ and Board would likely require, first, specific findings with\n\nrecord support that Castañeda lied, or evaded answering or was\n\nsignificantly    inconsistent     in    his    responses     to   subsidiary\n\nquestions; and second, an inference that because he lied on these\n\nsubsidiary    matters,   his   denial   of    advance   or   contemporaneous\n\nknowledge of a massacre was also false.           There are other ways to\n\ndiscredit a witness, but the two-step sequence just described--\n\nfalsus in uno, falsus in omnibus--is the most plausible method in\n\nthis case.6\n\n\n     6\n      Under a provision enacted by the Real ID Act in 2005, Pub. L.\nNo. 109-13, div. B, tit. I, § 101(a)(3)(iii) (2005), codified at 8\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii), the fact-finder is entitled to draw\nthe falsus in omnibus inference based upon inaccuracies,\ninconsistencies, or falsehoods \"without regard to whether . . .\n[they go] to the heart of the applicant's claim,\" 8 U.S.C. §\n1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). This provision is not applicable here because\nit applies only to asylum and withholding applications made post-\nenactment, Real ID Act § 101(h)(2), but it would not cure the\nproblems with the IJ and Board reasoning in this case even if it\ndid apply.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f            The BIA and IJ together offered five specific reasons--\n\ndemeanor aside--for finding that Castañeda was not credible.                We\n\nconsider each of the five in turn and find each flawed to varying\n\ndegrees--several badly so as to reasoning, record support, or both.\n\nWe summarize our conclusions as to each immediately below but leave\n\nthe details of each, together with necessary transcript quotations,\n\nfor an addendum to this decision.\n\n            Two of these reasons (the first and the fourth), although\n\nweak, involve debatable interpretations of evidence, and we might\n\ndefer as to these subsidiary findings if they stood alone.              But as\n\nto the other three, the IJ's and Board's explanations do not make\n\nsense and appear at odds with the record, and these flaws badly\n\nundermine    our   confidence     in    the   IJ's    and   Board's   ultimate\n\nconclusion that Castañeda was not credible in denying knowledge.\n\n            The BIA's and the IJ's first reason for finding Castañeda\n\nnot credible is that he failed to produce the transcript from his\n\nmilitary tribunal proceeding and, according to the IJ, Castañeda\n\nwas \"extremely evasive and non-responsive\" when questioned as to\n\nwhy.   The IJ offered no specific examples of evasion; and careful\n\ninspection of the transcript suggests that Castañeda, who has no\n\nlegal training, was simply ignorant as to the existence of a record\n\nand confused as to what was being asked of him.\n\n            Second,   the   BIA   and    IJ   found    that   Castañeda   gave\n\ninconsistent testimony concerning whether he was in radio contact\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fwith Hurtado's and Riveri Rondon's patrols during the massacre.\n\nThe   IJ's    explanation,    which     the    BIA   summarized,     is    based\n\nimportantly on the IJ's mischaracterization of the record and the\n\nattribution to Castañeda of statements that Castañeda did not make.\n\nThe   demeanor   evidence,    related    only   to   this   issue,   was   that\n\nCastañeda blinked more rapidly than usual.\n\n             Third, the IJ and BIA found that Castañeda was evasive\n\nabout the extent of human rights abuses committed by the Peruvian\n\nmilitary.      In   fact,   the   transcript    shows   that   Castañeda    was\n\nconsistent in answering that, while he knew that some human rights\n\nviolations had occurred, they were not the norm.            This was not the\n\nanswer the prosecutor sought, but it was not evasive, vague or\n\ninconsistent.\n\n             Fourth, the BIA and IJ found that Castañeda was evasive\n\nabout the judgment issued against Hurtado, the commutation of\n\nHurtado's sentence, and Hurtado's reappointment and promotion.\n\nWhether Castañeda's testimony was inconsistent or incomplete in\n\nsome details is a judgment call; his basic position was consistent.\n\nCastañeda's lack of mastery as to detail was hardly surprising\n\nsince Castañeda left Peru two years before Hurtado was sentenced,\n\nand four years before Hurtado was reinstated and promoted.\n\n             The IJ's fifth and final ground--not adopted by the\n\nBoard--was that Castañeda was \"incredible\" in saying that he\n\nlearned of the massacre only three weeks after it occurred, given\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fthat he was debriefed after he returned to base.              The IJ's finding\n\nhas no basis in the record: the massacre might well have been\n\nconcealed    from   anyone      not   directly   involved    for    as    long   as\n\npossible.\n\n             A State Department Human Rights Report, referred to by\n\nthe agency, said that Hurtado and \"three other officers\" bore\n\nresponsibility for the massacre.            Castañeda was surely one of the\n\nthree others.       But the State Department report cited only the\n\nSenate     Report   and   a     preliminary     military    investigation        not\n\notherwise identified.          Since the Senate Report (quoted above) made\n\nno finding as to Castañeda and the final military inquiry dismissed\n\nthe charges against him, the State Department reference provides no\n\nbasis for inculpating Castañeda and was not relied upon by either\n\nthe IJ or the BIA as a basis for discrediting him.\n\n             We do not say that the evidentiary record \"compels\" the\n\nIJ   and   the   Board    to    credit    Castañeda's   denial     of    prior    or\n\ncontemporaneous knowledge. Rather, in explaining their conclusion,\n\nthe IJ and Board misstate Castañeda's testimony, apply labels (like\n\ninconsistent and evasive) that are at odds with what the transcript\n\nshows, and draw inferences that appear wholly speculative and\n\nwithout record support.         A remand for further consideration is the\n\nproper remedy.\n\n             The suggestion may be made (see, e.g., He v. Ashcroft,\n\n328 F.3d 593, 603-04 (9th Cir. 2003)) that remand gives the agency\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fa second bite at the apple.         The short answer is that, outside\n\ncriminal   prosecutions     governed   by    double    jeopardy   principles,\n\nsecond bites are routine in litigation.            If the agency decision is\n\nflawed    by   mistaken   legal   premises,       unsustainable   subsidiary\n\nfindings, or doubtful reasoning, remanding to give the agency an\n\nopportunity to cure the error is the ordinary course.7\n\n            By contrast, if the record compelled the IJ and the Board\n\nto   believe   Castañeda,    it   would     be    appropriate--although   not\n\nnecessarily required--for us to treat the issue of knowledge as\n\ndefinitively resolved in Castañeda's favor.             We might then limit\n\nthe remand solely to the issues that would remain (primarily,\n\nwhether Castañeda otherwise qualified for asylum).           Naturally, the\n\nbarrier to such a determination is high--and it would be high even\n\nwithout the restrictive language that Congress has adopted.\n\n            Castañeda urges that great weight should be given to the\n\nPeruvian military court's dismissal of charges against him, and\n\nsays that the BIA erred in characterizing the proceeding as a\n\nwhitewash.       Castañeda    supplied       no     information   about   the\n\ncircumstances of the acquittal or how the grounds or evidence\n\nrelated to the central issue here, namely, Castañeda's knowledge.\n\nMoreover, the government submitted evidence calling into question\n\n\n\n      7\n      Orlando Ventura, 537 U.S. at 16-17; Cordero-Trejo, 40 F.3d at\n492; Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 426 F.3d 104, 116-17 (2d Cir.\n2005); Elzour v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 1143, 1154 (10th Cir. 2004);\nDia, 353 F.3d at 260.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fthe impartiality of the tribunal, which the IJ and Board were\n\nentitled to credit.\n\n              The only remaining affirmative evidence for Castañeda is\n\nhis own testimony.      Although we think the IJ's and Board's parsing\n\nof his testimony is seriously flawed, this does not mean that a\n\nmore cogent explanation would necessarily fail; nor is the Board or\n\nIJ precluded on remand from reopening the record and taking further\n\nevidence.      8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2, 1003.23.         In the end, the burden\n\nremains upon Castañeda to persuade the fact-finder to believe his\n\ndenial of culpable knowledge.\n\n              One of the amici urges us to alter the deferential\n\nstandard of review conventionally applied in these cases, saying\n\nthat the immigration courts have a poor track record and should not\n\nbe trusted.       The framework for review is largely dictated by\n\nstatute and binding Supreme Court precedent.                E.g., 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b)(4); Orlando Ventura, 537 U.S. at 16.             We will not raise the\n\nbar, but will insist that the agency clear the bar and think it has\n\nnot yet done so here.\n\n              On remand, the IJ and Board are free to adopt the\n\nposition, or to assume arguendo, that knowledge is required in this\n\ncase and then to explain plausibly why it disbelieves Castañeda's\n\ndenial.     They are also free to adopt (and then seek to defend on\n\nappeal)   a    legal   standard   as    to    scienter   different   than   the\n\npresumptive one that we have framed, or to take additional evidence\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\for to do both.      If they do alter the standard, they may have to\n\nprovide a new evidentiary hearing so Castañeda can seek to meet it.\n\n             People are sometimes skeptical about whether an agency,\n\nasked by a reviewing court to revisit a matter, will do so with an\n\nopen mind.    We count on the agency to give this case a truly fresh\n\nlook, unclouded by any prior judgment of Castañeda's credibility.\n\nAlthough we intend no criticism of the IJ, and the matter of\n\nassignments    is   primarily    for    the   agency,   confidence   in   this\n\ninstance would be enhanced if a new IJ were to make the next\n\nassessment.\n\n             The decision of the IJ and the Board excluding Castañeda\n\nfrom asylum and/or withholding of removal under the persecutor bar\n\nis vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f                                ADDENDUM\n\n          In this case, the BIA and IJ together offered five\n\nreasons for finding Castañeda not credible:\n\n          First, that he was evasive when asked to explain why he\n\nfailed to provide a transcript of his military court-martial;\n\n          Second,   that   he    offered     inconsistent   and   evasive\n\ntestimony concerning his radio contact with Hurtado and Riveri\n\nRondon's units during the Accomarca operation;\n\n          Third, that he was evasive concerning his knowledge of\n\nthe extent of human rights violations by the Peruvian military;\n\n          Fourth,   that   he   was   not   forthcoming   concerning   the\n\njudgment against Hurtado and Hurtado's subsequent reappointment to\n\nthe military; and\n\n          Fifth, that he was not credible concerning the manner in\n\nwhich he claimed to have found out about the massacre.\n\n          In reviewing the transcript, there are some occasions in\n\nwhich it appears that answers or inferences from answers may have\n\nbeen affected by problems of translation and transcription.            We\n\nhave noted these in the discussion that follows as part of our\n\nattempt at an independent assessment.       At the same time, it is fair\n\nto note that Castañeda has not complained about these on appeal and\n\nthey are to some extent judgment calls concerning which the IJ--who\n\nheard the testimony--has the superior vantage.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\f1. Evasion Concerning Court-martial Transcript\n\n           The BIA and IJ's first reason for finding Castañeda not\n\ncredible is that Castañeda did not produce the transcript from his\n\nmilitary tribunal proceeding and, according to the IJ, he was\n\n\"extremely     evasive    and   non-responsive\"   when     the   prosecutor\n\nquestioned him as to why he failed to do so.               However, the IJ\n\noffered   no   specific   examples   of   evasion,   and   the   transcript\n\nsuggests that Castañeda--who has no legal training--was confused as\n\nto what was being asked of him and ignorant of the existence of\n\nsuch a transcript, not evasive:\n\n           Q. Sir, are there any written documents or\n           reports that confirm your version of your actions\n           in the Accomarca incident?\n           A. Yes. I want to know regarding what documents\n           about what?\n           Q. I'm asking you if there is any report or\n           written accounting of the facts that support your\n           version of your location that day, the actions by\n           your patrol?\n           A. I have none of these documents. What I have\n           is the decision of the martial court without the\n           documents that I presented in that court remain\n           there.\n           Q. The prosecutor appeals the decision of the\n           court and the appeals court affirms what the\n           trial judge did, correct?\n           A. Yes.     The judge's verdict that we were\n           innocent. We were exonerated . . .\n           Q. The government appealed that decision,\n           correct?\n           A. I did not know if the government appealed that\n           decision or not.\n           Q. But the decision was appealed and the appeal\n           court made a decision, correct?\n           A. I don't know very well what the procedures\n           about that. I don't know if the government makes\n           an appeal and it moves to a court of -- a supreme\n           military court or what I have was an interview\n\n                                     -22-\n\fwith the human rights commission where I was\nconsidered a member of that massacre and with the\nprevious investigation. Later on, I was taken to\nmartial court and as I said on four or five\noccasions and after that, jury or judge, after\nthat I was found innocent.\nPROSECUTOR TO JUDGE: This is non-responsive. I\nasked about an appellate record.\nJUDGE: Sir, answer the question. Do you know who\nappealed the decision?\nA. I did not know who appealed.\nPROSECUTOR: But there was an appeal.\nA. In the document it manifests an appeal. . . .\nQ. Do you know what documents, what record the\nappeal court looked at to decide what the facts\nwere so they can decide that the dismissal was\ncorrect . . .?\nA. What I know is that the commission of human\nrights, I don't know if they represent the\ngovernment. I don't understand that very well.\nI understand it was in the process of appealing,\nappeal.\nJUDGE: Sir, answer the question if you know the\nanswer.   Do you know what records the appeal\ncourt used, yes or no?\nA. I do not know.\nPROSECUTOR: The investigation that the army\nconducted was in writing, correct, was reduced to\nwriting? Have you ever seen that document?\nA. No.\nQ. Did your defense attorney ever ask the\ngovernment to produce that in your defense?\nA. I don't know if he presented something.\nQ. Did you ever ask for a copy of this\ninvestigation to assist in your defense at this\ncourt-martial? . . .\nA. No. I did not request documents.\nQ. Why not?\nA. Because I did not know what sort of documents\nI need to ask or --\nQ. No further questions . . .\n\n\n\n\n                     -23-\n\f2. Inconsistent Testimony Regarding Radio Communications\n\n           The BIA and IJ found that Castañeda gave inconsistent\n\ntestimony concerning whether he was in radio contact with Hurtado\n\nand   Riveri   Rondon's    patrols    during   the   massacre.      The   IJ's\n\nexplanation,    which     the   BIA   summarized,    is   not   supported   by\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record.            The IJ reasoned as follows\n\n(with key passages not supported by the evidence underlined):\n\n           [T]his court finds that [Castañeda] provided\n           inconsistent and evasive responses to his\n           activities regarding radio communication during\n           the massacre . . . .\n                   During the first part of [his] cross-\n           examination, he testified unequivocally that it\n           was absolutely crucial for patrols during\n           military operations to communicate with each\n           other so that they did not have accidental\n           contact . . . . However, [Castañeda then said]\n           that he was not provided the radio frequencies\n           for the other patrols on that operation at\n           Accomarca.     This is completely far fetched\n           . . . .\n                   [Castañeda] testified very clearly in his\n           earlier testimony that coordinating an attack\n           with patrols from different bases would require\n           each patrol . . . responding to each other. Yet\n           . . . [h]e wants this Court to believe that he\n           was simply in his blocking position without\n           communication with anyone.      Yet, later in his\n           cross-examination, he testifies that he extracted\n           from his position upon communication [with] his\n           commanders.\n                   Early   in   his   cross-examination,   he\n           testified that the patrols communicated with each\n           other to avoid accidental contact. Yet, he would\n           have this Court believe that not only was he not\n           in radio control, but he was never given the\n           frequencies that [the attacking patrols] were\n           operating on . . . .\n                   It is completely illogical that a blocking\n           force during a military operation . . . to block\n           an escape route, would not be informed by radio\n\n                                       -24-\n\f             of the attack on the target and of the status of\n             those being attacked, that is whether or not they\n             were fleeing . . . .\n                    When   the    Government   did    question\n             [Castañeda] as to why he did not have the radio\n             frequencies . . . [his] answer was completely\n             non-responsive and evasive. He spoke of how the\n             attacking patrols could talk to each other, but\n             not the blocking patrols.       He . . . never\n             answered the Government's question.\n\nIn addition, the IJ noted that Castañeda's \"demeanor during this\n\npart    of   his   testimony\"     revealed    him    to    be    untrustworthy;\n\nspecifically, the IJ noted that Castañeda was \"blinking his eyes in\n\nan   unusually     rapid   rate   as   compared     with   the    rest   of   his\n\ntestimony.\"\n\n             Much of the IJ's reasoning mischaracterizes the record.\n\nCastañeda never testified that \"it was absolutely crucial\" for\n\npatrols to communicate with each other.           He said that it was \"very\n\nimportant\" to know the location of other patrols \"to coordinate the\n\nmovement,\" and that he would \"keep contact with the base by radio\"\n\n(emphasis added) to remain apprised of the location of other\n\npatrols.     The government lawyer asked, \"Would you also make direct\n\ncontact via radio with other patrols in your area?\" Castañeda\n\nreplied, \"Sometimes\"--not always.\n\n             There is no inconsistency between this colloquy and the\n\nlater   exchange    concerning     the   Accomarca    operation,      in   which\n\nCastañeda stated that he had no direct radio communication with the\n\nattacking patrols. According to Castañeda, in the ordinary course,\n\npatrols would remain in contact with, and receive orders from,\n\n                                       -25-\n\ftheir base; they would not be in direct contact with other patrols.\n\nThis   is   consistent   with   his   not    having   been   provided   radio\n\nfrequencies to communicate with the attacking patrols.\n\n            Contrary to the IJ's assertion, Castañeda never testified\n\n\"very clearly . . . that coordinating an attack with patrols from\n\ndifferent bases would require each patrol . . . responding to each\n\nother.\" Rather, when asked how he coordinated an attack with other\n\npatrols,    he   explained   that   communication     between   patrols   was\n\nindirect, traveling up and then back down the chain of command:\n\n            Each base has a patrol. The patrol will go and\n            conduct an operation. Each head of a patrol will\n            respond to the immediate boss, the head of base.\n            The head of base at the attack, they will inform\n            the command of the battalion who can communicate\n            and coordinate directly with the head of patrol\n            and give another specific order or can get\n            contact among the heads of patrol.\n\n            The government's counsel pressed, expressing skepticism\n\nthat patrols would be unable to communicate with each other.\n\nCastañeda's response was not pellucid--due at least in part to what\n\nappears to be poor translation or transcription--but the gist again\n\nappears to be that patrols report to the heads of base:\n\n            There are different situations . . . . [T]he\n            organization of battalion against the guerrillas\n            is completely different [than in a conventional\n            war] and the company is segregated in base in an\n            expansion in an area.        So the firing of\n            corroboration,   they   are  through   radio   in\n            coordination with heads of base and also\n            transmitted to their patrol. One time, a patrol\n            was moved from a base by helicopter to the other\n            base to coordinate and attack a mission together,\n            but sometimes depending where the mission was,\n\n                                      -26-\n\f          there was just the base . . . . Each base had a\n          [topographical chart] and they will indicate the\n          point for the patrol where they are at and for a\n          coordinated force.\n\n          Castañeda also never testified that \"he was simply in his\n\nblocking position without communication with anyone.\"   Rather, he\n\nconsistently testified that he was in communication with his base,\n\nbut not with the attacking patrols.    The colloquy was as follows:\n\n          Q. How were you told [that the attack had ended]?\n          A. They called me by radio and the captain told me\n          I could go back.\n          Q. Were you monitoring the radio?\n          A. I was listening to my radio operator.\n          Q. Were you able to pick up radio traffic between\n          the two teams that were in the attack?\n          A. No. I was not able to hear their communication\n          . . . .\n          Q. Did you hear the communication when the\n          platoons called their headquarters to . . . let\n          the headquarters know they were ready to [begin]\n          the attack?\n          A. No.\n          Q. You and the radio operator heard no other radio\n          traffic.\n          A. No. I did not hear any radio attack. . . .\n          Q. Who decided what frequency your radio would be\n          on for communicating with base?\n          A. There is a frequency established by base. . . .\n          Q. Were you were [sic] what frequency you needed\n          to communicate with these other patrols in the\n          case of an emergency, correct?\n          A. To communicate with my base.\n          Q. For example, if one of those patrols needed to\n          come towards your position, it would be helpful if\n          the two of you knew how to communicate, correct?\n          A. That's true.\n          Q. So you were informed what frequencies the two\n          attacking patrols would be using, correct?\n          A. That's correct, but both patrols entered from\n          the same place and where those patrols are\n          directed, four patrols are directed by the same\n          head of unit, but these orders came from the\n\n\n                                -27-\n\f          division. I had directly directed by the head of\n          commander of base.\n          Q. But who's got operational command of this\n          attack?\n          A. The head of the division . . . .\n          Q. Wasn't there a division frequency that they\n          could call you on?\n          A. I had only one frequency with my base.\n          JUDGE. Sir, it still hasn't been answered though.\n          Could you contact the other two patrols by radio,\n          yes or no?\n          A. No, I did not on my radio.\n          JUDGE. That's not what I asked. Could you contact\n          them by radio, yes or no?\n          A. No. I could not.\n          JUDGE. Why not?\n          A. Because I did not have their frequency.\n          JUDGE. Why not?\n          A. Because they didn't give them to me. I only\n          used to communicate with the head of my base that\n          was higher. . . .\n          Q. Did the attacking patrols know your frequency?\n          . . .\n          A. No.\n          Q. How do you know that they did not have your\n          frequency?\n          A. Because they never relayed anything. They only\n          responded to their head.\n\n          Finally, again, taking account of what appears to be poor\n\ntranslation and transcription, Castañeda was not \"completely non-\n\nresponsive and evasive\" in answering the government's query as to\n\nwhy he lacked the radio frequencies of the attacking patrols.   The\n\ngovernment's counsel, in a long question, asked Castañeda to\n\nreconcile the importance of coordination with the fact that he\n\nlacked radio frequencies for the attacking patrols.   The question\n\nwas followed by an objection and back-and-forth between Castañeda's\n\ncounsel and the IJ.     Finally, Castañeda gave an answer that\n\nemphasized advance planning as the keystone of coordination rather\n\n                               -28-\n\fthan inter-unit communication, but the answer was clearly infected\n\nby poor translation:\n\n            A.   The   planning   is    very   important   for\n            communication. At the time, there was a planning\n            that the commander from the other base the two\n            patrols were closely -- to the point where they\n            need to close those point and that they should not\n            move from there, just need to close those point.\n            There are two patrols in --\n            INTERPRETER. Your Honor, the Interpreter will need\n            to ask him about that.\n            JUDGE. Go ahead.\n            CASTANEDA. To patrol, to transport so they can act\n            as with direct orders from the division their\n            independence from the order that was given to the\n            heads of both bases so to cause as few possible\n            exit points and they planned it that.\n            Q. Sir, how do you exercise judgment independent\n            of the bases when you can't communicate with any\n            of the other units attacking the objective? Are\n            you sure none of those patrols could talk to each\n            other?\n            A. Yes.     The attacking, the patrols could\n            communicate with each other. They were going to\n            talk to the -- the base.         I have the same\n            frequency at my base, but correspond with the\n            sam[e] battalion.\n\n            As for the IJ's assertion that Castañeda blinked during\n\nhis testimony, even if this demeanor observation is given some\n\nweight,     the    number   of    flaws     in    the   IJ's   reasoning    and\n\ncharacterization of the record is enough for us to find his\n\nexplanation wanting.\n\n            The government in its brief says that even if Castañeda's\n\ntestimony was consistent, it was illogical: because the Accomarca\n\noperation    was    coordinated    by     the    division   rather   than   the\n\nbattalion, and because it was one of Castañeda's first combat\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fpatrols,    radio   contact     among   patrols      would    seem   especially\n\nimportant. But this explanation was provided by neither the BIA or\n\nthe IJ (aside from the IJ's bare assertion, without any analysis,\n\nthat Castañeda's account was \"far-fetched\").               Nor does it find any\n\nsupport in the record: given Castañeda's consistent testimony that\n\nradio communication ordinarily took place up and down the chain of\n\ncommand rather than among patrols, inter-patrol contact would seem\n\neven less likely than usual in an operation where patrols were\n\ndrawn from separate battalions.\n\n\n\n3. Castañeda's Knowledge of Human Rights Abuses Generally\n\n            The IJ and BIA found that Castañeda was evasive about the\n\nextent of human rights abuses committed by the Peruvian military in\n\nthe emergency zone.      The IJ stated, \"At one point at the beginning\n\nof the Government's cross-examination on this issue, [Castañeda]\n\ntestified   that    he   is   aware   and    was   aware    that   human   rights\n\nviolations were occurring . . . . However, moments later, [he]\n\nchanges his testimony, becomes significantly vague in his answers,\n\nand in fact disagrees with the State Department['s description of]\n\nhundreds upon hundreds of killings . . . .\"\n\n            In   fact,   inspection     of   the   transcript      reveals   that\n\nCastañeda was consistent in his answer:             he knew that some human\n\nrights violations occurred, but they were not the norm. While this\n\nanswer did not dovetail with the knowledge that the prosecutor\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\fwished to impute to Castañeda, neither was it evasive, vague, or\n\ninconsistent. Several times in the questioning the IJ interjected,\n\nasserting that Castañeda had not answered the question posed to\n\nhim; but the transcript shows that Castañeda did in fact answer the\n\nquestion posed.   The colloquy follows:\n\n          Q. Prior to August 1985, did you become aware of\n          the security forces meaning the Peruvian army\n          engaging     in     extrajudicial      killings,\n          disappearances, torture . . . and arbitrary\n          detentions? Are you aware of that?\n          A. Yes.\n          . . .\n          Q. Most of these violations occurred in the\n          emergency zone. Is that correct?\n          A. Some of it. It was not the norm.\n          JUDGE. Sir, I don't understand that answer. The\n          question was, did most of these violations that\n          you are aware of like the extrajudicial killings\n          and torture by the Peruvian army occur in the\n          emergency zone?\n          A. Could you let me explain or do you want just\n          the plan [sic] answer?\n          PROSECUTOR. Can you answer that yes or no?\n          A. I did not know that.      I know of very rare\n          cases . . . .\n          Q. Did you discuss these cases with your\n          commanders or did your commanders discuss them\n          with you?\n          A. About what?\n          Q. The Peruvian army engaging in extrajudicial\n          killings and torture of Shining Path guerrillas.\n          A. The information of the torture, we didn't\n          unless it was some military. They inform us all\n          this.   That's what I knew was the minority of\n          some elements outside of the rule, a minority.\n          They have some of it, but not the entire Peruvian\n          military. Sometimes, by some bad elements that\n          belonged to this organization and they have been\n          retired military.\n          JUDGE.   Sir,   that    does   not   answer   the\n          question . . . .\n          PROSECUTOR. I'll move on, Judge . . . . [Citing\n          the State Department Human Rights Report:] Total\n\n                                 -31-\n\f          deaths related to any terrorist operations of the\n          security forces are estimated by human rights\n          groups as being in the thousands from 1980 to\n          '85. Does that sound incorrect?\n          A. Correct.\n          Q. What were you aware of prior to August 1985?\n          A. I knew that some very few bad element.\n          Q.   Sir,   could   I  have   specifics?     What\n          specifically did you know about army personnel\n          committing human rights abuses prior to August\n          15, 1985? What were you aware of? What had you\n          heard?\n          A. That there were a number of officers that had\n          detained terrorists or possibly terrorists in an\n          unjust manner.\n          Q. What about killings, sir?\n          A. Officers that had detained prisoners and that\n          they were executed.\n          Q. What about civilians suspected of supporting\n          [the Shining Path]? . . .\n          A. . . . I did not know about detained civilians.\n          I did not know that they had detained civilians\n          accused of helping and then being killed.\n          Q. What about suspected [Shining Path] terrorists\n          being executed or tortured?\n          A. I'm talking about some official. I heard of\n          that acted on -- acting with no orders, taking\n          justice in front of the military group.\n          Q. Sir, you were aware that this kind of thing\n          happened on occasion prior to August 15, 1985.\n          A. Occasionally, not constantly.\n          Q. Were you aware of any incidents that happened\n          in your area of operation in anti terrorist\n          battalion 34? . . .\n          A. In others. I participated in this operation.\n          Q. I'm talking about prior to this operation.\n          A. No. I did not know.\n          Q. We're talking about just in the area of\n          battalion 34.\n          A. I did not know.\n\n\n\n4. The Judgment Against Hurtado\n\n          The BIA and IJ found that Castañeda was evasive about the\n\njudgment issued against Hurtado, the commutation of Hurtado's\n\n                               -32-\n\fsentence, and the reappointment of Hurtado to the military. The IJ\n\nreasoned that Castañeda\n\n            in a very evasive way . . . stated that . . .\n            anyone who is convicted of such a crime like\n            Lieutenant   Hurtado   would   be   automatically\n            dismissed from the military.           Yet, when\n            [Castañeda] was presented moments later by the\n            Government with evidence that Lieutenant Hurtado\n            was in fact never convicted of murder, but was\n            only convicted of abuse of authority, [Castañeda]\n            then immediately changed his testimony and\n            admitted that he had heard about that through the\n            media . . . .\n                   However, when given the opportunity by the\n            Government prosecutor moments earlier to tell the\n            Court what he knew about Lieutenant Hurtado,\n            [Castañeda] did not do so. This goes directly to\n            his credibility.\n\n            In fact, Castañeda did not change his testimony.                     He\n\ntestified that he believed Hurtado had been convicted of murder.\n\nWhen    presented   with     a       State   Department   Human   Rights      Report\n\nindicating that Hurtado had in fact only been convicted of abuse of\n\nauthority, Castañeda responded: \"Clearly, I don't know.                    What I\n\nmanifested what I know is that [the] court found him guilty of that\n\nmurder and I'm not an expert on the law, but maybe the murder is\n\ninstead of the disobedience, sorry, abuse of authority.\"\n\n            The prosecutor also asked Castañeda whether Hurtado had\n\nbeen discharged.      Castañeda responded, \"I do not know really if he\n\nwas discharged.       What I know is that he was recluded in prison.\"\n\nAfter   some   additional        questioning,     Castañeda     added,   \"[E]very\n\nofficer    expected    for       a    situation   like    in   this   case,    he's\n\nautomatically discharged.             That's what I know.      I did not try to\n\n                                         -33-\n\ffind out what privileges he might have had and what had happened to\n\nhis life.\"   A little later, the prosecutor quoted from a State\n\nDepartment Human Rights Report to the effect that Hurtado had\n\n\"reappeared on active duty,\" and the following colloquy took place:\n\n          Q. Do you know whether Lieutenant Hurtado was\n          promoted to captain?\n          A. I did not know that. I find out through public\n          media when I was here in the United States, but he\n          was not involved in activity which I did not know\n          was true or if he was absolved by some law. I did\n          not know that.\n          Q. Would you surprise you to know that he was\n          promoted after been convicted and sentenced?\n          A. Yes. It was a surprise.\n\nLater on, when asked again about his knowledge of Hurtado's release\n\nfrom prison and promotion, Castañeda further clarified:\n\n          A. I did not know he was promoted to captain. I\n          think he was not absolved.     I only heard the\n          comments in the news and the TV.\n          Q. What comments did you hear on TV?\n          A. I heard the comments that he was promoted to\n          captain and that the army was demanding that.\n\n          Taking his testimony as a whole, Castañeda testified\n\nconsistently that he did not know whether Hurtado was actually\n\ndischarged, even though that would be the normal procedure in a\n\ncase such as his; and that he was surprised when he learned from\n\nthe news media that--in contravention of ordinary procedures--\n\nHurtado had apparently been promoted.   Nor is it surprising that\n\nCastañeda knew few of the details concerning Hurtado's sentence and\n\nultimate reinstatement and promotion.    Hurtado was sentenced in\n\n\n\n\n                               -34-\n\f1993, two years after Castañeda left Peru, and was not released\n\nfrom prison and reinstated until a general amnesty in 1995.\n\n            The testimony was not flawless: one could perhaps infer\n\nthat   Castañeda   had    held   back    his    knowledge     of   Hurtado's\n\nreinstatement until pressed on the subject by the government.\n\nWhether one regards this as significant, and infers from it that\n\nCastañeda was evasive, is very much a judgment call.\n\n\n\n5. The Manner in which Castañeda Learned of the Massacre\n\n            The IJ's final ground for finding Castañeda not credible\n\nconcerned   Castañeda's   testimony     about   how   he    learned   of   the\n\nmassacre: he testified that he first learned of the killings three\n\nweeks later on the radio.         The IJ found it \"incredible that\n\nalthough [Castañeda] reported back to his base and although he was\n\ndebriefed, he was never aware that approximately 69 civilians were\n\nraped and murdered by the other two patrols that he claims were\n\nfour or five miles away.\"\n\n            This is pure speculation by the IJ: there is no basis in\n\nthe record for the IJ's conclusion that because Castañeda was\n\ndebriefed following the operation, he would necessarily or even\n\nlikely have been informed about a massacre committed by the head of\n\nanother patrol.    The Board chose not to rely on this ground in\n\naffirming the IJ's general finding that Castañeda was not credible.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\f",

In July 1999, the responsible agency&#8212;then the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")&#8212;began a removal proceeding, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B) (2000). Thereafter, Casta&#241;eda testified at successive hearings seeking to establish his need for asylum and to refute a claim that he was barred from asylum by reason of having assisted or otherwise participated in persecution. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1158.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda, the only witness at the hearings, testified in substance that he had been commissioned as a lieutenant in the Peruvian military in 1983. In January 1985 he was transferred to an antiterrorist unit in an area designated an emergency zone in which the Shining Path was active. The Shining Path is a revolutionary Marxist organization, well known for its energy and brutality, that has been at war with the Peruvian government for many years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1985, the military conducted an operation to search for Shining Path members in the village of Llocllapampa in the Accomarca region. Two patrols, one of them headed by Sublieutenant Telmo Hurtado and the other by Lieutenant Riveri Rondon, were to enter the village and conduct the search. Two other patrols, one of which was led by Casta&#241;eda, were assigned to block escape routes from the village. Casta&#241;eda's patrol located itself about three to five miles from the village on either side of a path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two patrols entered the village and there followed a brutal massacre of dozens of innocent villagers, including many women and children. Casta&#241;eda said that he was in radio contact with his base commander but not with the patrols entering the town, and that he did not know when the attack had occurred or that it had turned into a massacre of civilians. According to Casta&#241;eda, he did not learn of the massacre until about three weeks after the operation when he heard that Hurtado had confessed to executing civilians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Peruvian Senate Human Rights Commission conducted an investigation and concluded that Hurtado's patrol had been primarily responsible for the massacre. However, the report stated that Hurtado was \"only a piece of a large picture and it is necessary to study whether he acted on virtue of expressed verbal orders or if he acted as such because that is how he has formed.\" As to Casta&#241;eda, the report concluded that his squad \"was not involved in any confrontations with fugitive civilians.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda was charged before a military tribunal with homicide and abuse of authority, but the charges were dismissed. Hurtado, Riveri Rondon, and other officers were also charged, and Hurtado was convicted of abuse of authority, given a sentence which was later commuted in a general amnesty, and eventually restored to duty and promoted to captain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the court martial, Casta&#241;eda returned to duty and was promoted. However, he had been publicly associated with the massacre and (he testified) began to receive death threats from the Shining Path. According to Casta&#241;eda, the Shining Path had attempted to murder him on two occasions and to kidnap one of his daughters, and a neighbor and military colleague who had received similar threats was murdered by the Shining Path. These events, Casta&#241;eda said, prompted him to flee to the United States with his family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal if the Attorney General determines that \"the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). In October 2004, following the series of hearings, the immigration judge (\"IJ\") found that this bar applied to Casta&#241;eda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a discussion of Casta&#241;eda's testimony, the IJ concluded that Casta&#241;eda was not credible; the IJ also said that even if Casta&#241;eda's testimony were believed, Casta&#241;eda had nevertheless assisted in persecution because the \"objective effect\" of his participation in the operation as a blocking force was to confine the villagers and thus aid in their massacre. In September 2005, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\" or \"Board\") affirmed the IJ's ruling in a brief decision, agreeing that Casta&#241;eda had not been a credible witness and seemingly endorsing the \"objective effect\" ground as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda petitioned to this court for judicial review. A divided panel reversed the BIA and determined that the BIA's adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, <i>Casta&#241;eda-Castillo v. Gonzales,</i> 464 F.3d 112 (1st Cir.2006), and that the persecutor bar did not apply to Casta&#241;eda. It remanded solely for a determination as to the merits of his asylum and withholding of removal application&#8212;a separate and sequential issue that is not before us. On petition by the government, this court agreed to rehear the case en banc, vacating the panel decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Legal Issue.</i> The statute that bars persecutors has a smooth surface beneath which lie a series of rocks. Among the problems are the nature of the acts and motivations that comprise persecution, the role of scienter, whether and when inaction may suffice, and the kind of connection with persecution by others that constitutes \"assistance.\" The more one ponders the variety of possible situations, the less confident one becomes of a useful, all-embracing answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the inquiry in this case can be narrowed. The government asserts and Casta&#241;eda does not deny that the deliberate massacre of civilians because of their perceived connection with or support for the Shining Path amounted to persecution. Nor does Casta&#241;eda dispute that, if he had been aware in advance of a plan to murder civilians, his role in leading a patrol to block escape routes could be treated as culpable assistance. We think that the same could be true if he learned of a massacre in progress and continued to assist by blocking escape routes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What remains in dispute is the <i>legal</i> question whether the persecutor bar would apply to Casta&#241;eda if he had no prior or contemporaneous knowledge of the murder of civilians. Casta&#241;eda, saying that he lacked such knowledge, argues that the answer is no. By contrast, the government has taken the position, most fully elaborated in a letter from government counsel sent in response to a query from the panel, that such culpable knowledge is not required by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this view the government offers several arguments. One&#8212;the lack of an explicit scienter requirement in the statute&#8212; is not persuasive: the term \"persecution\" strongly implies both scienter and illicit motivation. Dictionary definitions, as well as the Board's own precedent, bear this out.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> So does common sense: the bus driver who unwittingly ferries a killer to the site of a massacre can hardly be labeled a \"persecutor,\" even if the objective effect of his actions was to aid the killer's secret plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cites <i>Fedorenko v. United States,</i> 449 U.S. 490, 101 S.Ct. 737, 66 L.Ed.2d 686 (1981), <i>Xie v. INS,</i> 434 F.3d 136, 142-43 (2d Cir.2006), and <i>In re Rodriguez-Majano,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 811, 814-15 (BIA 1988), for the view that scienter is not required and that the \"objective effect\" of an alien's actions is all that matters. But these decisions merely say that one can \"assist\" in persecution even if his assistance is involuntary; the involuntariness claims seem to have fallen somewhere between a showing of true duress and an \"obeying orders\" defense. <i>Cf. Hernandez v. Reno,</i> 258 F.3d 806, 814-15 (8th Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also cites various court and BIA precedents that suggest that the \"totality of the relevant conduct\" may be taken into account in determining whether one has assisted in the persecution of others. But these cases tend to reaffirm the need for some degree of moral culpability; and again, most focus on the question whether certain conduct constitutes \"assistance,\" not on the issue of scienter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two circuit cases might be read to depreciate the need for scienter, <i>see United States v. Schmidt,</i> 923 F.2d 1253, 1258 &amp; n. 8 (7th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 502 U.S. 921, 112 S.Ct. 331, 116 L.Ed.2d 272 (1991) (involving an SS officer who guarded a concentration camp and escorted inmates to and from forced labor sites); <i>Kulle v. INS,</i> 825 F.2d 1188, 1193 (7th Cir.1987), <i>cert. denied,</i> 484 U.S. 1042, 108 S.Ct. 773, 98 L.Ed.2d 860 (1988) (same). But in both, knowledge of persecution was not in doubt and could be inferred from presence at the place of persecution. And most case law assumes or affirms the need for some degree of subjective fault. <i>See</i> note 2, <i>above.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's better arguments turn on the need for some flexibility in applying the statute to gray areas and the latitude implicitly confided to the Attorney General in administering the scheme. <i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Consider, for example, cases of willful blindness or strong suspicions, or an abettor who knows generally of a pattern of persecution while being ignorant of specific incidents. There may well be gray-area cases where less than full and detailed knowledge may suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But in the present case, it appears as if Casta&#241;eda either had guilty knowledge or (as he claims) knew nothing about the massacre until after it had occurred. If this is a case somewhere in between&#8212;say, of strong suspicions or willful blindness on Casta&#241;eda's part&#8212;the government has not spelled out such a possibility. No such scenario is described in the IJ or Board decisions, and the government does not point to any evidence for such an \"in between\" assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it an excuse for dispensing with scienter that knowledge may be hard for the government to prove: in cases like ours, once the government introduced evidence of the applicant's association with persecution, it then became <i>Casta&#241;eda</i>'s burden to disprove that he was engaged in persecution. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(c)(2)(ii); <i>see Abdille v. Ashcroft,</i> 242 F.3d 477, 491 (3d Cir.2001). Here, this would require Casta&#241;eda to disprove knowledge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that <i>presumptively</i> the persecutor bar should be read not to apply to Casta&#241;eda <i>if</i> his version of his state of mind is accepted. On remand the agency can, if it wants, try to develop a construction more favorable to the government. But this would have to be done expressly and persuasively, and not by vague reference to the \"totality of . . . conduct\" that conflates the question whether one's conduct constitutes \"assistance\" with the question whether one possessed such scienter as may be required under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ, Board, and government's filings can all be read to assume that scienter is not required and that any conduct with an \"objective effect\" of facilitating persecution by others would suffice to trigger the bar. The Board stated that \"it may be true\" that Casta&#241;eda \"lacked knowledge regarding the events which took place following the August 8 massacre, including whether and how many people were killed.\" Although the IJ came closer to suggesting that Casta&#241;eda had guilty knowledge, the Board did not adopt this ground and the IJ himself assumed that such knowledge was unnecessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the IJ and Board rested their decision upon a misunderstanding of the legal elements of persecution, the ordinary remedy is a remand to allow the matter to be considered anew under the proper legal standards. <i>INS v. Orlando Ventura,</i> 537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam). The main question is how far this misunderstanding infected the fact-finder's conclusion, and the burden of showing lack of prejudice is normally on the party wishing to excuse an error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This would be a different case if the evidence clearly established that Casta&#241;eda had guilty knowledge, or that his denial of knowledge was unworthy of belief, so that remanding \"would be an idle and useless formality.\" <i>NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co.,</i> 394 U.S. 759, 766 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 22 L.Ed.2d 709 (1969); <i>see also Li v. INS,</i> 453 F.3d 129, 137 (2d Cir.2006). Here, however, there is <i>no</i> direct evidence of Casta&#241;eda's knowledge; and the IJ's and the Board's adverse credibility findings are independently vulnerable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Credibility.</i> Because the burden rested on Casta&#241;eda to show that he was not a persecutor, the IJ and the Board needed to do no more than make a well-reasoned and specific determination based in the record that Casta&#241;eda was not credible in denying timely knowledge of the massacre. The rule in <i>Moore v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co.,</i> 340 U.S. 573, 576, 71 S.Ct. 428, 95 L.Ed. 547 (1951)&#8212;that a fact cannot be established by disbelieving a witness's denial of that fact&#8212;does not assist one who (like Casta&#241;eda) bears the burden of proof as to the existence of the fact (here, lack of knowledge) and fails to carry it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the fact-finder on the scene has the advantage as to demeanor evidence, <i>Cordero-Trejo v. INS,</i> 40 F.3d 482, 487 (1st Cir.1994), judges are expected&#8212; unlike juries&#8212;to give reasons for their conclusions even on credibility. The reasons must be \"cogent\" and \"specific,\" <i>Gailius v. INS,</i> 147 F.3d 34, 46-47 (1st Cir. 1998), and must be \"reasonably grounded in the record, viewed as a whole,\" <i>Cordero-Trejo,</i> 40 F.3d at 487. It is not our task to \"invent explanations that may justify\" the agency's conclusion. <i>Dia v. Ashcroft,</i> 353 F.3d 228, 260 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government may be arguing that the quality of the explanation provided is irrelevant because, under a 1996 amendment, \"administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The quoted language reflects a gloss by the Supreme Court as to when a court may disagree with the fact-finder's weighing of evidence. <i>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Neither we nor other courts treat this language as eliminating the conventional requirement that an administrative agency's explanation be rational.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Hurtado could have been a rogue officer acting without any direction, or knowledge of a planned atrocity could have been (for obvious reasons) deliberately withheld from Casta&#241;eda and others not directly involved in carrying out the killings. Such possibilities do not prevent a fact-finder from disbelieving Casta&#241;eda's denial of knowledge, but they underscore the need for a rational explanation, rooted in the record, to support a finding that Casta&#241;eda should be disbelieved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the present facts, a well-reasoned explanation by the IJ and Board would likely require, first, specific findings with record support that Casta&#241;eda lied, or evaded answering or was significantly inconsistent in his responses to subsidiary questions; and second, an inference that because he lied on these subsidiary matters, his denial of advance or contemporaneous knowledge of a massacre was also false. There are other ways to discredit a witness, but the two-step sequence just described&#8212;<i>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus</i> &#8212;is the most plausible method in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA and IJ together offered five specific reasons&#8212;demeanor aside&#8212;for finding that Casta&#241;eda was not credible. We consider each of the five in turn and find each flawed to varying degrees&#8212;several badly so as to reasoning, record support, or both. We summarize our conclusions as to each immediately below but leave the details of each, together with necessary transcript quotations, for an addendum to this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two of these reasons (the first and the fourth), although weak, involve debatable interpretations of evidence, and we might defer as to these subsidiary findings if they stood alone. But as to the other three, the IJ's and Board's explanations do not make sense and appear at odds with the record, and these flaws badly undermine our confidence in the IJ's and Board's ultimate conclusion that Casta&#241;eda was not credible in denying knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's and the IJ's first reason for finding Casta&#241;eda not credible is that he failed to produce the transcript from his military tribunal proceeding and, according to the IJ, Casta&#241;eda was \"extremely evasive and non-responsive\" when questioned as to why. The IJ offered no specific examples of evasion; and careful inspection of the transcript suggests that Casta&#241;eda, who has no legal training, was simply ignorant as to the existence of a record and confused as to what was being asked of him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the BIA and IJ found that Casta&#241;eda gave inconsistent testimony concerning whether he was in radio contact with Hurtado's and Riveri Rondon's patrols during the massacre. The IJ's explanation, which the BIA summarized, is based importantly on the IJ's mischaracterization of the record and the attribution to Casta&#241;eda of statements that Casta&#241;eda did not make. The demeanor evidence, related only to this issue, was that Casta&#241;eda blinked more rapidly than usual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the IJ and BIA found that Casta&#241;eda was evasive about the extent of human rights abuses committed by the Peruvian military. In fact, the transcript shows that Casta&#241;eda was consistent in answering that, while he knew that some human rights violations had occurred, they were not the norm. This was not the answer the prosecutor sought, but it was not evasive, vague or inconsistent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the BIA and IJ found that Casta&#241;eda was evasive about the judgment issued against Hurtado, the commutation of Hurtado's sentence, and Hurtado's reappointment and promotion. Whether Casta&#241;eda's testimony was inconsistent or incomplete in some details is a judgment call; his basic position was consistent. Casta&#241;eda's lack of mastery as to detail was hardly surprising since Casta&#241;eda left Peru two years before Hurtado was sentenced, and four years before Hurtado was reinstated and promoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ's fifth and final ground&#8212;not adopted by the Board&#8212;was that Casta&#241;eda was \"incredible\" in saying that he learned of the massacre only three weeks after it occurred, given that he was debriefed after he returned to base. The IJ's finding has no basis in the record: the massacre might well have been concealed from anyone not directly involved for as long as possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A State Department Human Rights Report, referred to by the agency, said that Hurtado and \"three other officers\" bore responsibility for the massacre. Casta&#241;eda was surely one of the three others. But the State Department report cited only the Senate Report and a preliminary military investigation not otherwise identified. Since the Senate Report (quoted above) made no finding as to Casta&#241;eda and the final military inquiry dismissed the charges against him, the State Department reference provides no basis for inculpating Casta&#241;eda and was not relied upon by either the IJ or the BIA as a basis for discrediting him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not say that the evidentiary record \"compels\" the IJ and the Board to credit Casta&#241;eda's denial of prior or contemporaneous knowledge. Rather, in explaining their conclusion, the IJ and Board misstate Casta&#241;eda's testimony, apply labels (like inconsistent and evasive) that are at odds with what the transcript shows, and draw inferences that appear wholly speculative and without record support. A remand for further consideration is the proper remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion may be made (<i>see, e.g., He v. Ashcroft,</i> 328 F.3d 593, 603-04 (9th Cir.2003)) that remand gives the agency a second bite at the apple. The short answer is that, outside criminal prosecutions governed by double jeopardy principles, second bites are routine in litigation. If the agency decision is flawed by mistaken legal premises, unsustainable subsidiary findings, or doubtful reasoning, remanding to give the agency an opportunity to cure the error is the <i>ordinary</i> course.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, if the record compelled the IJ and the Board to believe Casta&#241;eda, it would be appropriate&#8212;although not necessarily required&#8212;for us to treat the issue of knowledge as definitively resolved in Casta&#241;eda's favor. We might then limit the remand solely to the issues that would remain (primarily, whether Casta&#241;eda otherwise qualified for asylum). Naturally, the barrier to such a determination is high&#8212;and it would be high even without the restrictive language that Congress has adopted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda urges that great weight should be given to the Peruvian military court's dismissal of charges against him, and says that the BIA erred in characterizing the proceeding as a whitewash. Casta&#241;eda supplied no information about the circumstances of the acquittal or how the grounds or evidence related to the central issue here, namely, Casta&#241;eda's knowledge. Moreover, the government submitted evidence calling into question the impartiality of the tribunal, which the IJ and Board were entitled to credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remaining <i>affirmative</i> evidence for Casta&#241;eda is his own testimony. Although we think the IJ's and Board's parsing of his testimony is seriously flawed, this does not mean that a more cogent explanation would necessarily fail; nor is the Board or IJ precluded on remand from reopening the record and taking further evidence. 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1003.2, 1003.23. In the end, the burden remains upon Casta&#241;eda to persuade the fact-finder to believe his denial of culpable knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the amici urges us to alter the deferential standard of review conventionally applied in these cases, saying that the immigration courts have a poor track record and should not be trusted. The framework for review is largely dictated by statute and binding Supreme Court precedent. <i>E.g.,</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4); <i>Orlando Ventura,</i> 537 U.S. at 16, 123 S.Ct. 353. We will not raise the bar, but will insist that the agency clear the bar and think it has not yet done so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the IJ and Board are free to adopt the position, or to assume <i>arguendo,</i> that knowledge is required in this case and then to explain plausibly why it disbelieves Casta&#241;eda's denial. They are also free to adopt (and then seek to defend on appeal) a legal standard as to scienter different than the presumptive one that we have framed, or to take additional evidence or to do both. If they do alter the standard, they may have to provide a new evidentiary hearing so Casta&#241;eda can seek to meet it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">People are sometimes skeptical about whether an agency, asked by a reviewing court to revisit a matter, will do so with an open mind. We count on the agency to give this case a truly fresh look, unclouded by any prior judgment of Casta&#241;eda's credibility. Although we intend no criticism of the IJ, and the matter of assignments is primarily for the agency, confidence in this instance would be enhanced if a new IJ were to make the next assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the IJ and the Board excluding Casta&#241;eda from asylum and/or withholding of removal under the persecutor bar is vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>ADDENDUM</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the BIA and IJ together offered five reasons for finding Casta&#241;eda not credible:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, that he was evasive when asked to explain why he failed to provide a transcript of his military court-martial;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, that he offered inconsistent and evasive testimony concerning his radio contact with Hurtado and Riveri Rondon's units during the Accomarca operation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, that he was evasive concerning his knowledge of the extent of human rights violations by the Peruvian military;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, that he was not forthcoming concerning the judgment against Hurtado and Hurtado's subsequent reappointment to the military; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, that he was not credible concerning the manner in which he claimed to have found out about the massacre.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the transcript, there are some occasions in which it appears that answers or inferences from answers may have been affected by problems of translation and transcription. We have noted these in the discussion that follows as part of our attempt at an independent assessment. At the same time, it is fair to note that Casta&#241;eda has not complained about these on appeal and they are to some extent judgment calls concerning which the IJ&#8212;who heard the testimony&#8212;has the superior vantage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>1.

The IJ's explanation, which the BIA summarized, is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The IJ reasoned as follows (with key passages not supported by the evidence underlined):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]his court finds that [Casta&#241;eda] provided inconsistent and evasive responses to his activities regarding radio communication during the massacre . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the first part of [his] cross-examination, <i>he testified unequivocally that it was absolutely crucial for patrols during military operations to communicate with each other</i> so that they did not have accidental contact . . . . However, [Casta&#241;eda then said] that he was not provided the radio frequencies for the other patrols on that operation at Accomarca. This is completely far fetched. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Casta&#241;eda] testified very clearly in his earlier testimony that <i>coordinating an attack with patrols from different bases would require each patrol . . . responding to each other.</i> Yet . . . [h]e wants this Court to believe that <i>he was simply in his blocking position without communication with anyone.</i> Yet, later in his cross-examination, he testifies that he extracted from his position upon communication [with] his commanders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in his cross-examination, <i>he testified that the patrols communicated with each other to avoid accidental contact.</i> Yet, he would have this Court believe that not only was he not in radio control, but he was never given the frequencies that [the attacking patrols] were operating on. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is completely illogical that a blocking force during a military operation . . . to block an escape route, would not be informed by radio of the attack on the target and of the status of those being attacked, that is whether or not they were fleeing. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the Government did question [Casta&#241;eda] as to why he did not have the radio frequencies . . . <i>[his] answer was completely non-responsive and evasive.</i> He spoke of how the attacking patrols could talk to each other, but not the blocking patrols. He . . . never answered the Government's question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the IJ noted that Casta&#241;eda's \"demeanor during this part of his testimony\" revealed him to be untrustworthy; specifically, the IJ noted that Casta&#241;eda was \"blinking his eyes in an unusually rapid rate as compared with the rest of his testimony.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of the IJ's reasoning mischaracterizes the record. Casta&#241;eda never testified that \"it was absolutely crucial\" for patrols to communicate with each other. He said that it was \"very important\" to know the location of other patrols \"to coordinate the movement,\" and that he would \"keep contact <i>with the base</i> by radio\" (emphasis added) to remain apprised of the location of other patrols. The government lawyer asked, \"Would you also make direct contact via radio with other patrols in your area?\" Casta&#241;eda replied, \"Sometimes\"&#8212; not always.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no inconsistency between this colloquy and the later exchange concerning the Accomarca operation, in which Casta&#241;eda stated that he had no direct radio communication with the attacking patrols. According to Casta&#241;eda, in the ordinary course, patrols would remain in contact with, and receive orders from, their base; they would not be in direct contact with other patrols. This is consistent with his not having been provided radio frequencies to communicate with the attacking patrols.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the IJ's assertion, Casta&#241;eda never testified \"very clearly . . . that coordinating an attack with patrols from different bases would require each patrol . . . responding to each other.\" Rather, when asked how he coordinated an attack with other patrols, he explained that communication between patrols was indirect, traveling up and then back down the chain of command:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each base has a patrol. The patrol will go and conduct an operation. Each head of a patrol will respond to the immediate boss, the head of base. The head of base at the attack, they will inform the command of the battalion who can communicate and coordinate directly with the head of patrol and give another specific order or can get contact among the heads of patrol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's counsel pressed, expressing skepticism that patrols would be unable to communicate with each other. Casta&#241;eda's response was not pellucid&#8212; due at least in part to what appears to be poor translation or transcription&#8212;but the gist again appears to be that patrols report to the heads of base:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are different situations. . . . [T]he organization of battalion against the guerrillas is completely different [than in a conventional war] and the company is segregated in base in an expansion in an area. So the firing of corroboration, they are through radio in coordination with heads of base and also transmitted to their patrol. One time, a patrol was moved from a base by helicopter to the other base to coordinate and attack a mission together, but sometimes depending where the mission was, there was just the base . . . . Each base had a [topographical chart] and they will indicate the point for the patrol where they are at and for a coordinated force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda also never testified that \"he was simply in his blocking position without communication with anyone.\" Rather, he consistently testified that he was in communication with his base, but not with the attacking patrols.

The government's counsel, in a long question, asked Casta&#241;eda to reconcile the importance of coordination with the fact that he lacked radio frequencies for the attacking patrols. The question was followed by an objection and back-and-forth between Casta&#241;eda's counsel and the IJ. Finally, Casta&#241;eda gave an answer that emphasized advance planning as the keystone of coordination rather than inter-unit communication, but the answer was clearly infected by poor translation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

But this explanation was provided by neither the BIA or the IJ (aside from the IJ's bare assertion, without any analysis, that Casta&#241;eda's account was \"far-fetched\"). Nor does it find any support in the record: given Casta&#241;eda's consistent testimony that radio communication ordinarily took place up and down the chain of command rather than among patrols, inter-patrol contact would seem even <i>less</i> likely than usual in an operation where patrols were drawn from separate battalions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>3.

The IJ stated, \"At one point at the beginning of the Government's cross-examination on this issue, [Casta&#241;eda] testified that he is aware and was aware that human rights violations were occurring. . . .

While this answer did not dovetail with the knowledge that the prosecutor wished to impute to Casta&#241;eda, neither was it evasive, vague, or inconsistent. Several times in the questioning the IJ interjected, asserting that Casta&#241;eda had not answered the question posed to him; but the transcript shows that Casta&#241;eda did in fact answer the question posed.

The Judgment Against Hurtado</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA and IJ found that Casta&#241;eda was evasive about the judgment issued against Hurtado, the commutation of Hurtado's sentence, and the reappointment of Hurtado to the military. The IJ reasoned that Casta&#241;eda</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">in a very evasive way . . . stated that . . . anyone who is convicted of such a crime like Lieutenant Hurtado would be automatically dismissed from the military. Yet, when [Casta&#241;eda] was presented moments later by the Government with evidence that Lieutenant Hurtado was in fact never convicted of murder, but was only convicted of abuse of authority, [Casta&#241;eda] then immediately changed his testimony and admitted that he had heard about that through the media. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, when given the opportunity by the Government prosecutor moments earlier to tell the Court what he knew about Lieutenant Hurtado, [Casta&#241;eda] did not do so. This goes directly to his credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, Casta&#241;eda did not change his testimony. He testified that he believed Hurtado had been convicted of murder. When presented with a State Department Human Rights Report indicating that Hurtado had in fact only been convicted of abuse of authority, Casta&#241;eda responded: \"Clearly, I don't know. What I manifested what I know is that [the] court found him guilty of that murder and I'm not an expert on the law, but maybe the murder is instead of the disobedience, sorry, abuse of authority.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor also asked Casta&#241;eda whether Hurtado had been discharged. Casta&#241;eda responded, \"I do not know really if he was discharged. What I know is that he was recluded in prison.\" After some additional questioning, Casta&#241;eda added, \"[E]very officer expected for a situation like in this case, he's automatically discharged. That's what I know. I did not try to find out what privileges he might have had and what had happened to his life.\" A little later, the prosecutor quoted from a State Department Human Rights Report to the effect that Hurtado had \"reappeared on active duty,\" and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.

I did not know he was promoted to captain. I think he was not absolved.

Nor is it surprising that Casta&#241;eda knew few of the details concerning Hurtado's sentence and ultimate reinstatement and promotion. Hurtado was sentenced in 1993, two years after Casta&#241;eda left Peru, and was not released from prison and reinstated until a general amnesty in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony was not flawless: one could perhaps infer that Casta&#241;eda had held back his knowledge of Hurtado's reinstatement until pressed on the subject by the government. Whether one regards this as significant, and infers from it that Casta&#241;eda was evasive, is very much a judgment call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>5.

The IJ found it \"incredible that although [Casta&#241;eda] reported back to his base and although he was debriefed, he was never aware that approximately 69 civilians were raped and murdered by the other two patrols that he claims were four or five miles away.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is pure speculation by the IJ: there is no basis in the record for the IJ's conclusion that because Casta&#241;eda was debriefed following the operation, he would necessarily or even likely have been informed about a massacre committed by the head of another patrol. The Board chose not to rely on this ground in affirming the IJ's general finding that Casta&#241;eda was not credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The dictionary defines \"persecute\" as \"to pursue with harassing or oppressive treatment, esp. because of religion, race, or beliefs; harass persistently.\"<i>Random House Dictionary of the English Language</i> (2d ed. unabr.1987).

In July 1999, the responsible agency&#8212;then the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")&#8212;began a removal proceeding, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B) (2000). Thereafter, Casta&#241;eda testified at successive hearings seeking to establish his need for asylum and to refute a claim that he was barred from asylum by reason of having assisted or otherwise participated in persecution. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1158.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda, the only witness at the hearings, testified in substance that he had been commissioned as a lieutenant in the Peruvian military in 1983. In January 1985 he was transferred to an antiterrorist unit in an area designated an emergency zone in which the Shining Path was active. The Shining Path is a revolutionary Marxist organization, well known for its energy and brutality, that has been at war with the Peruvian government for many years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1985, the military conducted an operation to search for Shining Path members in the village of Llocllapampa in the Accomarca region. Two patrols, one of them headed by Sublieutenant Telmo Hurtado and the other by Lieutenant Riveri Rondon, were to enter the village and conduct the search. Two other patrols, one of which was led by Casta&#241;eda, were assigned to block escape routes from the village. Casta&#241;eda's patrol located itself about three to five miles from the village on either side of a path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two patrols entered the village and there followed a brutal massacre of dozens of innocent villagers, including many women and children. Casta&#241;eda said that he was in radio contact with his base commander but not with the patrols entering the town, and that he did not know when the attack had occurred or that it had turned into a massacre of civilians. According to Casta&#241;eda, he did not learn of the massacre until about three weeks after the operation when he heard that Hurtado had confessed to executing civilians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Peruvian Senate Human Rights Commission conducted an investigation and concluded that Hurtado's patrol had been primarily responsible for the massacre. However, the report stated that Hurtado was \"only a piece of a large picture and it is necessary to study whether he acted on virtue of expressed verbal orders or if he acted as such because that is how he has formed.\" As to Casta&#241;eda, the report concluded that his squad \"was not involved in any confrontations with fugitive civilians.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda was charged before a military tribunal with homicide and abuse of authority, but the charges were dismissed. Hurtado, Riveri Rondon, and other officers were also charged, and Hurtado was convicted of abuse of authority, given a sentence which was later commuted in a general amnesty, and eventually restored to duty and promoted to captain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the court martial, Casta&#241;eda returned to duty and was promoted. However, he had been publicly associated with the massacre and (he testified) began to receive death threats from the Shining Path. According to Casta&#241;eda, the Shining Path had attempted to murder him on two occasions and to kidnap one of his daughters, and a neighbor and military colleague who had received similar threats was murdered by the Shining Path. These events, Casta&#241;eda said, prompted him to flee to the United States with his family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal if the Attorney General determines that \"the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(i); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). In October 2004, following the series of hearings, the immigration judge (\"IJ\") found that this bar applied to Casta&#241;eda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a discussion of Casta&#241;eda's testimony, the IJ concluded that Casta&#241;eda was not credible; the IJ also said that even if Casta&#241;eda's testimony were believed, Casta&#241;eda had nevertheless assisted in persecution because the \"objective effect\" of his participation in the operation as a blocking force was to confine the villagers and thus aid in their massacre. In September 2005, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\" or \"Board\") affirmed the IJ's ruling in a brief decision, agreeing that Casta&#241;eda had not been a credible witness and seemingly endorsing the \"objective effect\" ground as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda petitioned to this court for judicial review. A divided panel reversed the BIA and determined that the BIA's adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, <i>Casta&#241;eda-Castillo v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></span> (1st Cir.2006), and that the persecutor bar did not apply to Casta&#241;eda. It remanded solely for a determination as to the merits of his asylum and withholding of removal application&#8212;a separate and sequential issue that is not before us. On petition by the government, this court agreed to rehear the case en banc, vacating the panel decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Legal Issue.</i> The statute that bars persecutors has a smooth surface beneath which lie a series of rocks. Among the problems are the nature of the acts and motivations that comprise persecution, the role of scienter, whether and when inaction may suffice, and the kind of connection with persecution by others that constitutes \"assistance.\" The more one ponders the variety of possible situations, the less confident one becomes of a useful, all-embracing answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the inquiry in this case can be narrowed. The government asserts and Casta&#241;eda does not deny that the deliberate massacre of civilians because of their perceived connection with or support for the Shining Path amounted to persecution. Nor does Casta&#241;eda dispute that, if he had been aware in advance of a plan to murder civilians, his role in leading a patrol to block escape routes could be treated as culpable assistance. We think that the same could be true if he learned of a massacre in progress and continued to assist by blocking escape routes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What remains in dispute is the <i>legal</i> question whether the persecutor bar would apply to Casta&#241;eda if he had no prior or contemporaneous knowledge of the murder of civilians. Casta&#241;eda, saying that he lacked such knowledge, argues that the answer is no. By contrast, the government has taken the position, most fully elaborated in a letter from government counsel sent in response to a query from the panel, that such culpable knowledge is not required by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this view the government offers several arguments. One&#8212;the lack of an explicit scienter requirement in the statute&#8212; is not persuasive: the term \"persecution\" strongly implies both scienter and illicit motivation. Dictionary definitions, as well as the Board's own precedent, bear this out.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> So does common sense: the bus driver who unwittingly ferries a killer to the site of a massacre can hardly be labeled a \"persecutor,\" even if the objective effect of his actions was to aid the killer's secret plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cites <i>Fedorenko v.

Dec. 811, 814-15 (BIA 1988), for the view that scienter is not required and that the \"objective effect\" of an alien's actions is all that matters. But these decisions merely say that one can \"assist\" in persecution even if his assistance is involuntary; the involuntariness claims seem to have fallen somewhere between a showing of true duress and an \"obeying orders\" defense. <i>Cf. Hernandez v.

But these cases tend to reaffirm the need for some degree of moral culpability; and again, most focus on the question whether certain conduct constitutes \"assistance,\" not on the issue of scienter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two circuit cases might be read to depreciate the need for scienter, <i>see United States v.

Consider, for example, cases of willful blindness or strong suspicions, or an abettor who knows generally of a pattern of persecution while being ignorant of specific incidents.

If this is a case somewhere in between&#8212;say, of strong suspicions or willful blindness on Casta&#241;eda's part&#8212;the government has not spelled out such a possibility. No such scenario is described in the IJ or Board decisions, and the government does not point to any evidence for such an \"in between\" assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it an excuse for dispensing with scienter that knowledge may be hard for the government to prove: in cases like ours, once the government introduced evidence of the applicant's association with persecution, it then became <i>Casta&#241;eda</i>'s burden to disprove that he was engaged in persecution. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(c)(2)(ii); <i>see Abdille v.

On remand the agency can, if it wants, try to develop a construction more favorable to the government. But this would have to be done expressly and persuasively, and not by vague reference to the \"totality of . . . conduct\" that conflates the question whether one's conduct constitutes \"assistance\" with the question whether one possessed such scienter as may be required under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ, Board, and government's filings can all be read to assume that scienter is not required and that any conduct with an \"objective effect\" of facilitating persecution by others would suffice to trigger the bar. The Board stated that \"it may be true\" that Casta&#241;eda \"lacked knowledge regarding the events which took place following the August 8 massacre, including whether and how many people were killed.\" Although the IJ came closer to suggesting that Casta&#241;eda had guilty knowledge, the Board did not adopt this ground and the IJ himself assumed that such knowledge was unnecessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the IJ and Board rested their decision upon a misunderstanding of the legal elements of persecution, the ordinary remedy is a remand to allow the matter to be considered anew under the proper legal standards. <i>INS v.

Such possibilities do not prevent a fact-finder from disbelieving Casta&#241;eda's denial of knowledge, but they underscore the need for a rational explanation, rooted in the record, to support a finding that Casta&#241;eda should be disbelieved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the present facts, a well-reasoned explanation by the IJ and Board would likely require, first, specific findings with record support that Casta&#241;eda lied, or evaded answering or was significantly inconsistent in his responses to subsidiary questions; and second, an inference that because he lied on these subsidiary matters, his denial of advance or contemporaneous knowledge of a massacre was also false. There are other ways to discredit a witness, but the two-step sequence just described&#8212;<i>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus</i> &#8212;is the most plausible method in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA and IJ together offered five specific reasons&#8212;demeanor aside&#8212;for finding that Casta&#241;eda was not credible. We consider each of the five in turn and find each flawed to varying degrees&#8212;several badly so as to reasoning, record support, or both. We summarize our conclusions as to each immediately below but leave the details of each, together with necessary transcript quotations, for an addendum to this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two of these reasons (the first and the fourth), although weak, involve debatable interpretations of evidence, and we might defer as to these subsidiary findings if they stood alone. But as to the other three, the IJ's and Board's explanations do not make sense and appear at odds with the record, and these flaws badly undermine our confidence in the IJ's and Board's ultimate conclusion that Casta&#241;eda was not credible in denying knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's and the IJ's first reason for finding Casta&#241;eda not credible is that he failed to produce the transcript from his military tribunal proceeding and, according to the IJ, Casta&#241;eda was \"extremely evasive and non-responsive\" when questioned as to why. The IJ offered no specific examples of evasion; and careful inspection of the transcript suggests that Casta&#241;eda, who has no legal training, was simply ignorant as to the existence of a record and confused as to what was being asked of him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the BIA and IJ found that Casta&#241;eda gave inconsistent testimony concerning whether he was in radio contact with Hurtado's and Riveri Rondon's patrols during the massacre. The IJ's explanation, which the BIA summarized, is based importantly on the IJ's mischaracterization of the record and the attribution to Casta&#241;eda of statements that Casta&#241;eda did not make. The demeanor evidence, related only to this issue, was that Casta&#241;eda blinked more rapidly than usual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the IJ and BIA found that Casta&#241;eda was evasive about the extent of human rights abuses committed by the Peruvian military. In fact, the transcript shows that Casta&#241;eda was consistent in answering that, while he knew that some human rights violations had occurred, they were not the norm. This was not the answer the prosecutor sought, but it was not evasive, vague or inconsistent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the BIA and IJ found that Casta&#241;eda was evasive about the judgment issued against Hurtado, the commutation of Hurtado's sentence, and Hurtado's reappointment and promotion. Whether Casta&#241;eda's testimony was inconsistent or incomplete in some details is a judgment call; his basic position was consistent. Casta&#241;eda's lack of mastery as to detail was hardly surprising since Casta&#241;eda left Peru two years before Hurtado was sentenced, and four years before Hurtado was reinstated and promoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ's fifth and final ground&#8212;not adopted by the Board&#8212;was that Casta&#241;eda was \"incredible\" in saying that he learned of the massacre only three weeks after it occurred, given that he was debriefed after he returned to base. The IJ's finding has no basis in the record: the massacre might well have been concealed from anyone not directly involved for as long as possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A State Department Human Rights Report, referred to by the agency, said that Hurtado and \"three other officers\" bore responsibility for the massacre. Casta&#241;eda was surely one of the three others. But the State Department report cited only the Senate Report and a preliminary military investigation not otherwise identified. Since the Senate Report (quoted above) made no finding as to Casta&#241;eda and the final military inquiry dismissed the charges against him, the State Department reference provides no basis for inculpating Casta&#241;eda and was not relied upon by either the IJ or the BIA as a basis for discrediting him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not say that the evidentiary record \"compels\" the IJ and the Board to credit Casta&#241;eda's denial of prior or contemporaneous knowledge. Rather, in explaining their conclusion, the IJ and Board misstate Casta&#241;eda's testimony, apply labels (like inconsistent and evasive) that are at odds with what the transcript shows, and draw inferences that appear wholly speculative and without record support. A remand for further consideration is the proper remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion may be made (<i>see, e.g., He v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781894\"><a href=\"/opinion/781894/wang-he-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>, 603-04 (9th Cir.2003)) that remand gives the agency a second bite at the apple. The short answer is that, outside criminal prosecutions governed by double jeopardy principles, second bites are routine in litigation. If the agency decision is flawed by mistaken legal premises, unsustainable subsidiary findings, or doubtful reasoning, remanding to give the agency an opportunity to cure the error is the <i>ordinary</i> course.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, if the record compelled the IJ and the Board to believe Casta&#241;eda, it would be appropriate&#8212;although not necessarily required&#8212;for us to treat the issue of knowledge as definitively resolved in Casta&#241;eda's favor. We might then limit the remand solely to the issues that would remain (primarily, whether Casta&#241;eda otherwise qualified for asylum). Naturally, the barrier to such a determination is high&#8212;and it would be high even without the restrictive language that Congress has adopted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda urges that great weight should be given to the Peruvian military court's dismissal of charges against him, and says that the BIA erred in characterizing the proceeding as a whitewash. Casta&#241;eda supplied no information about the circumstances of the acquittal or how the grounds or evidence related to the central issue here, namely, Casta&#241;eda's knowledge. Moreover, the government submitted evidence calling into question the impartiality of the tribunal, which the IJ and Board were entitled to credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remaining <i>affirmative</i> evidence for Casta&#241;eda is his own testimony. Although we think the IJ's and Board's parsing of his testimony is seriously flawed, this does not mean that a more cogent explanation would necessarily fail; nor is the Board or IJ precluded on remand from reopening the record and taking further evidence. 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1003.2, 1003.23. In the end, the burden remains upon Casta&#241;eda to persuade the fact-finder to believe his denial of culpable knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the amici urges us to alter the deferential standard of review conventionally applied in these cases, saying that the immigration courts have a poor track record and should not be trusted. The framework for review is largely dictated by statute and binding Supreme Court precedent. <i>E.g.,</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4); <i>Orlando Ventura,</i> 537 U.S. at 16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122242\"><a href=\"/opinion/122242/ins-v-orlando-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We will not raise the bar, but will insist that the agency clear the bar and think it has not yet done so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the IJ and Board are free to adopt the position, or to assume <i>arguendo,</i> that knowledge is required in this case and then to explain plausibly why it disbelieves Casta&#241;eda's denial. They are also free to adopt (and then seek to defend on appeal) a legal standard as to scienter different than the presumptive one that we have framed, or to take additional evidence or to do both. If they do alter the standard, they may have to provide a new evidentiary hearing so Casta&#241;eda can seek to meet it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">People are sometimes skeptical about whether an agency, asked by a reviewing court to revisit a matter, will do so with an open mind. We count on the agency to give this case a truly fresh look, unclouded by any prior judgment of Casta&#241;eda's credibility. Although we intend no criticism of the IJ, and the matter of assignments is primarily for the agency, confidence in this instance would be enhanced if a new IJ were to make the next assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the IJ and the Board excluding Casta&#241;eda from asylum and/or withholding of removal under the persecutor bar is vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>ADDENDUM</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the BIA and IJ together offered five reasons for finding Casta&#241;eda not credible:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, that he was evasive when asked to explain why he failed to provide a transcript of his military court-martial;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, that he offered inconsistent and evasive testimony concerning his radio contact with Hurtado and Riveri Rondon's units during the Accomarca operation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, that he was evasive concerning his knowledge of the extent of human rights violations by the Peruvian military;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, that he was not forthcoming concerning the judgment against Hurtado and Hurtado's subsequent reappointment to the military; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, that he was not credible concerning the manner in which he claimed to have found out about the massacre.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the transcript, there are some occasions in which it appears that answers or inferences from answers may have been affected by problems of translation and transcription. We have noted these in the discussion that follows as part of our attempt at an independent assessment. At the same time, it is fair to note that Casta&#241;eda has not complained about these on appeal and they are to some extent judgment calls concerning which the IJ&#8212;who heard the testimony&#8212;has the superior vantage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>1.

The IJ's explanation, which the BIA summarized, is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The IJ reasoned as follows (with key passages not supported by the evidence underlined):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]his court finds that [Casta&#241;eda] provided inconsistent and evasive responses to his activities regarding radio communication during the massacre . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the first part of [his] cross-examination, <i>he testified unequivocally that it was absolutely crucial for patrols during military operations to communicate with each other</i> so that they did not have accidental contact . . . . However, [Casta&#241;eda then said] that he was not provided the radio frequencies for the other patrols on that operation at Accomarca. This is completely far fetched. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Casta&#241;eda] testified very clearly in his earlier testimony that <i>coordinating an attack with patrols from different bases would require each patrol . . . responding to each other.</i> Yet . . . [h]e wants this Court to believe that <i>he was simply in his blocking position without communication with anyone.</i> Yet, later in his cross-examination, he testifies that he extracted from his position upon communication [with] his commanders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in his cross-examination, <i>he testified that the patrols communicated with each other to avoid accidental contact.</i> Yet, he would have this Court believe that not only was he not in radio control, but he was never given the frequencies that [the attacking patrols] were operating on. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is completely illogical that a blocking force during a military operation . . . to block an escape route, would not be informed by radio of the attack on the target and of the status of those being attacked, that is whether or not they were fleeing. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the Government did question [Casta&#241;eda] as to why he did not have the radio frequencies . . . <i>[his] answer was completely non-responsive and evasive.</i> He spoke of how the attacking patrols could talk to each other, but not the blocking patrols. He . . . never answered the Government's question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the IJ noted that Casta&#241;eda's \"demeanor during this part of his testimony\" revealed him to be untrustworthy; specifically, the IJ noted that Casta&#241;eda was \"blinking his eyes in an unusually rapid rate as compared with the rest of his testimony.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of the IJ's reasoning mischaracterizes the record. Casta&#241;eda never testified that \"it was absolutely crucial\" for patrols to communicate with each other. He said that it was \"very important\" to know the location of other patrols \"to coordinate the movement,\" and that he would \"keep contact <i>with the base</i> by radio\" (emphasis added) to remain apprised of the location of other patrols. The government lawyer asked, \"Would you also make direct contact via radio with other patrols in your area?\" Casta&#241;eda replied, \"Sometimes\"&#8212; not always.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no inconsistency between this colloquy and the later exchange concerning the Accomarca operation, in which Casta&#241;eda stated that he had no direct radio communication with the attacking patrols. According to Casta&#241;eda, in the ordinary course, patrols would remain in contact with, and receive orders from, their base; they would not be in direct contact with other patrols. This is consistent with his not having been provided radio frequencies to communicate with the attacking patrols.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the IJ's assertion, Casta&#241;eda never testified \"very clearly . . . that coordinating an attack with patrols from different bases would require each patrol . . . responding to each other.\" Rather, when asked how he coordinated an attack with other patrols, he explained that communication between patrols was indirect, traveling up and then back down the chain of command:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each base has a patrol. The patrol will go and conduct an operation. Each head of a patrol will respond to the immediate boss, the head of base. The head of base at the attack, they will inform the command of the battalion who can communicate and coordinate directly with the head of patrol and give another specific order or can get contact among the heads of patrol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's counsel pressed, expressing skepticism that patrols would be unable to communicate with each other. Casta&#241;eda's response was not pellucid&#8212; due at least in part to what appears to be poor translation or transcription&#8212;but the gist again appears to be that patrols report to the heads of base:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are different situations. . . . [T]he organization of battalion against the guerrillas is completely different [than in a conventional war] and the company is segregated in base in an expansion in an area. So the firing of corroboration, they are through radio in coordination with heads of base and also transmitted to their patrol. One time, a patrol was moved from a base by helicopter to the other base to coordinate and attack a mission together, but sometimes depending where the mission was, there was just the base . . . . Each base had a [topographical chart] and they will indicate the point for the patrol where they are at and for a coordinated force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casta&#241;eda also never testified that \"he was simply in his blocking position without communication with anyone.\" Rather, he consistently testified that he was in communication with his base, but not with the attacking patrols.

The government's counsel, in a long question, asked Casta&#241;eda to reconcile the importance of coordination with the fact that he lacked radio frequencies for the attacking patrols. The question was followed by an objection and back-and-forth between Casta&#241;eda's counsel and the IJ. Finally, Casta&#241;eda gave an answer that emphasized advance planning as the keystone of coordination rather than inter-unit communication, but the answer was clearly infected by poor translation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

Sir, how do you exercise judgment independent of the bases when you can't communicate with any of the other units attacking the objective? Are you sure none of those patrols could talk to each other?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes. The attacking, the patrols could communicate with each other. They were going to talk to the&#8212;the base. I have the same frequency at my base, but correspond with the sam[e] battalion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the IJ's assertion that Casta&#241;eda blinked during his testimony, even if this demeanor observation is given some weight, the number of flaws in the IJ's reasoning and characterization of the record is enough for us to find his explanation wanting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government in its brief says that even if Casta&#241;eda's testimony was consistent, it was illogical: because the Accomarca operation was coordinated by the division rather than the battalion, and because it was one of Casta&#241;eda's first combat patrols, radio contact among patrols would seem especially important. But this explanation was provided by neither the BIA or the IJ (aside from the IJ's bare assertion, without any analysis, that Casta&#241;eda's account was \"far-fetched\"). Nor does it find any support in the record: given Casta&#241;eda's consistent testimony that radio communication ordinarily took place up and down the chain of command rather than among patrols, inter-patrol contact would seem even <i>less</i> likely than usual in an operation where patrols were drawn from separate battalions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>3.

The IJ stated, \"At one point at the beginning of the Government's cross-examination on this issue, [Casta&#241;eda] testified that he is aware and was aware that human rights violations were occurring. . . . However, moments later, [he] changes his testimony, becomes significantly vague in his answers, and in fact disagrees with the State Department['s description of] hundreds upon hundreds of killings. . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, inspection of the transcript reveals that Casta&#241;eda was consistent in his answer: he knew that some human rights violations occurred, but they were not the norm. While this answer did not dovetail with the knowledge that the prosecutor wished to impute to Casta&#241;eda, neither was it evasive, vague, or inconsistent. Several times in the questioning the IJ interjected, asserting that Casta&#241;eda had not answered the question posed to him; but the transcript shows that Casta&#241;eda did in fact answer the question posed. The colloquy follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.

The Judgment Against Hurtado</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA and IJ found that Casta&#241;eda was evasive about the judgment issued against Hurtado, the commutation of Hurtado's sentence, and the reappointment of Hurtado to the military. The IJ reasoned that Casta&#241;eda</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">in a very evasive way . . . stated that . . . anyone who is convicted of such a crime like Lieutenant Hurtado would be automatically dismissed from the military. Yet, when [Casta&#241;eda] was presented moments later by the Government with evidence that Lieutenant Hurtado was in fact never convicted of murder, but was only convicted of abuse of authority, [Casta&#241;eda] then immediately changed his testimony and admitted that he had heard about that through the media. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, when given the opportunity by the Government prosecutor moments earlier to tell the Court what he knew about Lieutenant Hurtado, [Casta&#241;eda] did not do so. This goes directly to his credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, Casta&#241;eda did not change his testimony. He testified that he believed Hurtado had been convicted of murder. When presented with a State Department Human Rights Report indicating that Hurtado had in fact only been convicted of abuse of authority, Casta&#241;eda responded: \"Clearly, I don't know. What I manifested what I know is that [the] court found him guilty of that murder and I'm not an expert on the law, but maybe the murder is instead of the disobedience, sorry, abuse of authority.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor also asked Casta&#241;eda whether Hurtado had been discharged. Casta&#241;eda responded, \"I do not know really if he was discharged. What I know is that he was recluded in prison.\" After some additional questioning, Casta&#241;eda added, \"[E]very officer expected for a situation like in this case, he's automatically discharged. That's what I know. I did not try to find out what privileges he might have had and what had happened to his life.\" A little later, the prosecutor quoted from a State Department Human Rights Report to the effect that Hurtado had \"reappeared on active duty,\" and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Do you know whether Lieutenant Hurtado was promoted to captain?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. I did not know that. I find out through public media when I was here in the United States, but he was not involved in activity which I did not know was true or if he was absolved by some law. I did not know that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Would you surprise you to know that he was promoted after been convicted and sentenced?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes. It was a surprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later on, when asked again about his knowledge of Hurtado's release from prison and promotion, Casta&#241;eda further clarified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. I did not know he was promoted to captain. I think he was not absolved. I only heard the comments in the news and the TV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. What comments did you hear on TV?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. I heard the comments that he was promoted to captain and that the army was demanding that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking his testimony as a whole, Casta&#241;eda testified consistently that he did not know whether Hurtado was actually discharged, even though that would be the normal procedure in a case such as his; and that he was surprised when he learned from the news media that&#8212;in contravention of ordinary procedures&#8212;Hurtado had apparently been promoted. Nor is it surprising that Casta&#241;eda knew few of the details concerning Hurtado's sentence and ultimate reinstatement and promotion. Hurtado was sentenced in 1993, two years after Casta&#241;eda left Peru, and was not released from prison and reinstated until a general amnesty in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony was not flawless: one could perhaps infer that Casta&#241;eda had held back his knowledge of Hurtado's reinstatement until pressed on the subject by the government. Whether one regards this as significant, and infers from it that Casta&#241;eda was evasive, is very much a judgment call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>5. The Manner in which Casta&#241;eda Learned of the Massacre</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ's final ground for finding Casta&#241;eda not credible concerned Casta&#241;eda's testimony about how he learned of the massacre: he testified that he first learned of the killings three weeks later on the radio. The IJ found it \"incredible that although [Casta&#241;eda] reported back to his base and although he was debriefed, he was never aware that approximately 69 civilians were raped and murdered by the other two patrols that he claims were four or five miles away.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is pure speculation by the IJ: there is no basis in the record for the IJ's conclusion that because Casta&#241;eda was debriefed following the operation, he would necessarily or even likely have been informed about a massacre committed by the head of another patrol. The Board chose not to rely on this ground in affirming the IJ's general finding that Casta&#241;eda was not credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The dictionary defines \"persecute\" as \"to pursue with harassing or oppressive treatment, esp. because of religion, race, or beliefs; harass persistently.\"<i>Random House Dictionary of the English Language</i> (2d ed. unabr.1987).
