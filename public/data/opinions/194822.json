Having  pleaded guilty  to one\n          SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\n                               \n\ncount of extortion in  violation of 18 U.S.C.    1951, defendant-\n\nappellant Eric Jones now appeals from the imposition of sentence.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n          We  succinctly summarize  the relevant  facts.   In May\n\n1991,   appellant  sought   a   $5,000  loan   from  a   business\n\nacquaintance,  John Halle.  Halle  asked Richard Cyr  to make the\n\nloan.  When Cyr agreed,  the parties consummated the transaction.\n\nBy its terms, the loan was to be repaid in full, with interest of\n\n$2,500, within seven days.   Although appellant provided security\n\nin the form of a United  States treasury bond having a face value\n\nof  $10,000, he  failed to repay  the loan.   When  Halle and Cyr\n\ncontacted  a brokerage firm  to arrange for  a sale  of the bond,\n\nthey discovered that it had previously been stolen.\n\n          The Federal  Bureau of  Investigation (FBI)  mounted an\n\ninquiry into the theft.  Halle and Cyr cooperated.  In the course\n\nof  its  investigation,  the  FBI, with  Halle's  consent,  tape-\n\nrecorded   certain  telephone  conversations  between  Halle  and\n\nappellant.  During these calls,  which occurred in December 1991,\n\nappellant  attempted to  retrieve  the bond.    As part  of  this\n\neffort, he implied that  bad things would happen to  Halle and/or\n\nCyr  if they did  not return the  bond.  At  one point, appellant\n\nstated to  Halle that the  bond had to  be returned by  5:00 p.m.\n\nthat  afternoon or else \"someone\"  would be on  Cyr's doorstep at\n\nsome point during the  next few days.  Appellant  told Halle that\n\n                                2\n\nhe had  better leave  town  for this  period of  time.   He  also\n\nsuggested that Halle warn Cyr.\n\n                                II\n\n          The  sentencing guideline  that applies  to appellant's\n\noffense is U.S.S.G.    2B3.2 (Nov. 1991).  Under  this guideline,\n\nthe  base offense  level is  18.   See U.S.S.G.    2B3.2(a).   At\n                                      \n\nsentencing, the  district court made offsetting  adjustments.  It\n\ngranted   appellant  a   two-level  credit   for  acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility, U.S.S.G.    3E1.1,  but simultaneously  ordered a\n\ntwo-level  increase  under  U.S.S.G.    2B3.2(b)(1)  because  the\n\noffense conduct involved \"an express  or implied threat of death,\n\nbodily  injury,   or  kidnapping.\"1    The   court  calculated  a\n\nsentencing  range of  27-33  months (offense  level 18;  criminal\n\nhistory  category  I)  and   imposed  a  30-month   incarcerative\n\nsentence.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                               III\n\n          On appeal, Jones challenges only the two-level increase\n\nawarded pursuant to section 2B3.2(b)(1).   His principal claim is\n\nthat the  district court  erred  in applying  a specific  offense\n\ncharacteristic  (threat  of  bodily  harm) to  effect  an  upward\n\nadjustment in circumstances where  the Sentencing Commission  had\n\nalready  factored this same conduct  into the base offense level.\n\n                    \n\n     1Section 2B3.2(b)(1)  is relatively new.   See U.S.S.G. App.\n                                                   \nC, amend. 366 at 186  (Nov. 1991).  Prior to this  amendment, the\nextortion guideline did not provide an enhancement for threats of\nbodily  harm  and the  like.   Presumably  because of  its recent\norigin,   there  is   no   appreciable  caselaw   under   section\n2B3.2(b)(1).\n\n                                3\n\nTo support this contention, appellant points to the definition of\n\nextortion contained in 18 U.S.C.   1951(b)(2)   \"the obtaining of\n\nproperty from another, with his consent, induced by  wrongful use\n\nof actual or threatened  force, violence [or] fear  . . . .\"   He\n\nasseverates that,  under this definition, a  \"threat\" of physical\n\nharm, which  results in \"fear,\"  is an element of  the crime; and\n\nthat,  because the  caption of  U.S.S.G.    2B3.2 also  refers to\n\n\"extortion\" by \"threat\"  of injury, the base offense  level must,\n\nby analogy, incorporate the  element of threatened bodily injury.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n          Although  minations  may  often  accompany  an  act  of\n\nextortion,  a  threat  of  bodily  harm  is  neither an  inherent\n\ncharacteristic nor a necessary concomitant of the crime.  Rather,\n\n18 U.S.C.   1951(b)(2) leaves the dimensions  of a fear-producing\n\nthreat relatively open-ended.   That  is to say,  the statute  of\n\nconviction criminalizes  a wide array of  fear-producing threats,\n\ne.g., threats to destroy valuable business records, McLaughlin v.\n                                                              \n\nAnderson,  962  F.2d 187  (2d Cir.  1992),  or to  yank lucrative\n        \n\ncounty  contracts, United  States v. Stodola,  953 F.2d  266 (7th\n                                            \n\nCir.),  cert. denied,  113  S. Ct.  104  (1992), in  addition  to\n                    \n\nthreats of physical harm.\n\n          Moreover, unlike appellant, we do not think it seems at\n\nall  unusual  that  the  Sentencing Commission,  charged  with  a\n\ndifferent function than the Congress, would choose to distinguish\n\namong  various types  of extortion  for sentencing  purposes and,\n\naccordingly, seek to punish  extortionists who employ \"express or\n\n                                4\n\nimplied threat[s]  of death,  bodily injury, or  kidnapping,\" see\n                                                                 \n\nU.S.S.G.    2B3.2(b)(1), with  greater severity than  other, less\n\ncallous,  practitioners  of the  same crime.    There is  not the\n\nslightest sign that the Commission had  specifically incorporated\n\na threat  of bodily  harm to  the victim's  person into  the base\n\noffense level generally applicable  to the offense of conviction.\n\nTo the exact contrary,  the application notes make  manifest that\n\nthe  Commission  designed  the  general  guideline  provision  to\n\nencompass  all acts  of extortion,  not just  those in  which the\n              \n\nvictim's life and limb are placed at risk:\n\n          This  guideline  applies  if  there  was  any\n          threat, express or  implied, that  reasonably\n          could  be  interpreted  as  one  to  injure a\n          person or physically damage property,  or any\n          comparably serious threat,  such as to  drive\n          an enterprise out of business.\n\nU.S.S.G.    2B3.2,  comment. (n.2); see,  e.g., United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nPenn,  966 F.2d  55, 57  (2d Cir.  1992) (per  curiam) (upholding\n    \n\napplication  of    2B3.2  in case  where  defendant, among  other\n\nthings, \"sought to generate fear through . . . threat of economic\n\ninjury\").\n\n          Having  swept  broadly   in  constructing  the  general\n\nguideline, the Commission  subsequently designed the  enhancement\n                                       \n\nprovision specifically to  target those who made a  bad situation\n\nworse by using  \"an express  or implied threat  of death,  bodily\n\ninjury,  or  kidnapping\"  as  a  tool  of  the  extortion  trade.\n\nU.S.S.G.    2B3.2(b)(1).   The  very fact  that the  enhancer was\n\nadded later, and, thus,  superimposed upon the general guideline,\n\nfurnishes  potent evidence that the  Commission did not intend to\n\n                                5\n\nimplement the analogy which appellant struggles to draw.\n\n          Appellant's reliance on United States  v. Plaza-Garcia,\n                                                                \n\n914  F.2d 345 (1st  Cir. 1990), is plainly  misplaced.  In Plaza-\n                                                                 \n\nGarcia, the  defendant  pled  guilty to  one  count  of  sexually\n      \n\nexploiting a  minor in  violation of  18 U.S.C.    2251(a).   The\n\napplicable  sentencing guideline,  U.S.S.G.    2G2.1(a), provided\n\nfor  a  base  offense  level  of  25.    The  presentence  report\n\nrecommended,  and  the  sentencing  judge  imposed,  a  two-level\n\nincrease  because   the  victim's   youth  made   him  \"unusually\n\nvulnerable\" within the  meaning of  U.S.S.G.   3A1.1.   But,  the\n\ncommentary to U.S.S.G.   3A1.1  stated specifically that the two-\n\nlevel  adjustment for vulnerability due to age does not apply \"if\n\nthe  offense  guideline specifically  incorporates  this factor.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.   3A1.1, comment. (n.2).  Hence,  we reversed, reasoning\n\nthat, because  the guideline for  sexual exploitation of  a minor\n\n\"specifically incorporates the factor of age,\" an increase of two\n\nlevels would constitute  impermissible double  counting.   Plaza-\n                                                                 \n\nGarcia,  914 F.2d  at  347.    Here,  in  contrast,  the  general\n      \n\nguideline for extortion, U.S.S.G. 2B3.2(a), does not specifically\n\nincorporate the relevant factor (threatened bodily harm) into the\n\nbase offense level.\n\n          We will not paint  the lily.  Mindful, as we  are, that\n\ncourts should, for the most part, apply the guidelines as written\n\nand give  effect to  the interpretive commentary  and application\n\nnotes, see, e.g., Stinson v. United States, 113 S. Ct. 1913, 1915\n                                          \n\n(1993);  United States  v. Weston,  960 F.2d  212, 219  (1st Cir.\n                                 \n\n                                6\n\n1992),  we conclude,  without serious  question, that  U.S.S.G.  \n\n2B3.2(a)  does not  specifically incorporate  a threat  of bodily\n\nharm into  the base offense  level for extortion  and, therefore,\n\nthe  district court  did not  engage in  double counting  when it\n\nordered the two-level increase.2\n\n                                IV\n\n          Appellant  has  a  second  arrow  in his  quiver.    He\n\nmaintains  that his conduct did not fall within the compendium of\n\naggravating   factors  represented   by   the  specific   offense\n\ncharacteristics listed in U.S.S.G.    2B3.2(b)(1).  This argument\n\nwill not wash.   The district court  made its finding that  Jones\n\nthreatened to inflict bodily harm on Halle and Cyr largely on the\n\nbasis  of  words  spoken  by  Jones  himself  and  preserved  for\n\nposterity on magnetic tape.   To the extent, if at all,  that the\n\nthreats were inexplicit   and we  do not suggest that they were  \n\nthe sentencing court was  nonetheless entitled to draw reasonable\n\ninferences  and  resolve  any  possible   ambiguity  against  the\n\nextortionist.  See U.S.S.G.   2B3.2, comment. (n.2) (\"Even if [a]\n                  \n\nthreat does  not in  itself  imply violence,  the possibility  of\n\nviolence or serious adverse consequences may be inferred from the\n\n                    \n\n     2In light of this ruling, we need not address whether double\ncounting, had it  occurred, would have affected the lawfulness of\nthe  sentence.  See generally  United States v.  Newman, 982 F.2d\n                                                       \n665, 672-73  (1st Cir.  1992) (discussing problem  and collecting\ncases); compare,  e.g., United States v.

See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates  v.

Here,  appellant  admits that  he\n\nthreatened  Halle  and Cyr  with possible  harm  if they  did not\n\nreturn the bond.   Given this undisputed fact, we  can hardly say\n\nthat the district court  committed clear error in  inferring that\n\nthe threats  involved bodily harm and,  consequently, in invoking\n                            \n\nU.S.S.G.   2B3.2(b)(1).

Having  pleaded guilty  to one\n          SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\n                               \n\ncount of extortion in  violation of 18 U.S.C.    1951, defendant-\n\nappellant Eric Jones now appeals from the imposition of sentence.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n          We  succinctly summarize  the relevant  facts.   In May\n\n1991,   appellant  sought   a   $5,000  loan   from  a   business\n\nacquaintance,  John Halle.  Halle  asked Richard Cyr  to make the\n\nloan.  When Cyr agreed,  the parties consummated the transaction.\n\nBy its terms, the loan was to be repaid in full, with interest of\n\n$2,500, within seven days.   Although appellant provided security\n\nin the form of a United  States treasury bond having a face value\n\nof  $10,000, he  failed to repay  the loan.   When  Halle and Cyr\n\ncontacted  a brokerage firm  to arrange for  a sale  of the bond,\n\nthey discovered that it had previously been stolen.\n\n          The Federal  Bureau of  Investigation (FBI)  mounted an\n\ninquiry into the theft.  Halle and Cyr cooperated.  In the course\n\nof  its  investigation,  the  FBI, with  Halle's  consent,  tape-\n\nrecorded   certain  telephone  conversations  between  Halle  and\n\nappellant.  During these calls,  which occurred in December 1991,\n\nappellant  attempted to  retrieve  the bond.    As part  of  this\n\neffort, he implied that  bad things would happen to  Halle and/or\n\nCyr  if they did  not return the  bond.  At  one point, appellant\n\nstated to  Halle that the  bond had to  be returned by  5:00 p.m.\n\nthat  afternoon or else \"someone\"  would be on  Cyr's doorstep at\n\nsome point during the  next few days.  Appellant  told Halle that\n\n                                2\n\nhe had  better leave  town  for this  period of  time.   He  also\n\nsuggested that Halle warn Cyr.\n\n                                II\n\n          The  sentencing guideline  that applies  to appellant's\n\noffense is U.S.S.G.    2B3.2 (Nov. 1991).  Under  this guideline,\n\nthe  base offense  level is  18.   See U.S.S.G.    2B3.2(a).   At\n                                      \n\nsentencing, the  district court made offsetting  adjustments.  It\n\ngranted   appellant  a   two-level  credit   for  acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility, U.S.S.G.    3E1.1,  but simultaneously  ordered a\n\ntwo-level  increase  under  U.S.S.G.    2B3.2(b)(1)  because  the\n\noffense conduct involved \"an express  or implied threat of death,\n\nbodily  injury,   or  kidnapping.\"1    The   court  calculated  a\n\nsentencing  range of  27-33  months (offense  level 18;  criminal\n\nhistory  category  I)  and   imposed  a  30-month   incarcerative\n\nsentence.  This appeal ensued.\n\n                               III\n\n          On appeal, Jones challenges only the two-level increase\n\nawarded pursuant to section 2B3.2(b)(1).   His principal claim is\n\nthat the  district court  erred  in applying  a specific  offense\n\ncharacteristic  (threat  of  bodily  harm) to  effect  an  upward\n\nadjustment in circumstances where  the Sentencing Commission  had\n\nalready  factored this same conduct  into the base offense level.\n\n                    \n\n     1Section 2B3.2(b)(1)  is relatively new.   See U.S.S.G. App.\n                                                   \nC, amend. 366 at 186  (Nov. 1991).  Prior to this  amendment, the\nextortion guideline did not provide an enhancement for threats of\nbodily  harm  and the  like.   Presumably  because of  its recent\norigin,   there  is   no   appreciable  caselaw   under   section\n2B3.2(b)(1).\n\n                                3\n\nTo support this contention, appellant points to the definition of\n\nextortion contained in 18 U.S.C.   1951(b)(2)   \"the obtaining of\n\nproperty from another, with his consent, induced by  wrongful use\n\nof actual or threatened  force, violence [or] fear  . . . .\"   He\n\nasseverates that,  under this definition, a  \"threat\" of physical\n\nharm, which  results in \"fear,\"  is an element of  the crime; and\n\nthat,  because the  caption of  U.S.S.G.    2B3.2 also  refers to\n\n\"extortion\" by \"threat\"  of injury, the base offense  level must,\n\nby analogy, incorporate the  element of threatened bodily injury.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n          Although  minations  may  often  accompany  an  act  of\n\nextortion,  a  threat  of  bodily  harm  is  neither an  inherent\n\ncharacteristic nor a necessary concomitant of the crime.  Rather,\n\n18 U.S.C.   1951(b)(2) leaves the dimensions  of a fear-producing\n\nthreat relatively open-ended.   That  is to say,  the statute  of\n\nconviction criminalizes  a wide array of  fear-producing threats,\n\ne.g., threats to destroy valuable business records, McLaughlin v.\n                                                              \n\nAnderson,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582545\"><a href=\"/opinion/582545/thomas-v-mclaughlin-joseph-gall-macgall-inc-and-macgall-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (2d Cir.  1992),  or to  yank lucrative\n        \n\ncounty  contracts, United  States v.

There is  not the\n\nslightest sign that the Commission had  specifically incorporated\n\na threat  of bodily  harm to  the victim's  person into  the base\n\noffense level generally applicable  to the offense of conviction.\n\nTo the exact contrary,  the application notes make  manifest that\n\nthe  Commission  designed  the  general  guideline  provision  to\n\nencompass  all acts  of extortion,  not just  those in  which the\n              \n\nvictim's life and limb are placed at risk:\n\n          This  guideline  applies  if  there  was  any\n          threat, express or  implied, that  reasonably\n          could  be  interpreted  as  one  to  injure a\n          person or physically damage property,  or any\n          comparably serious threat,  such as to  drive\n          an enterprise out of business.\n\nU.S.S.G.    2B3.2,  comment. (n.2); see,  e.g., United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nPenn,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584191\"><a href=\"/opinion/584191/united-states-v-terrence-penn/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57  (2d Cir.  1992) (per  curiam) (upholding\n    \n\napplication  of    2B3.2  in case  where  defendant, among  other\n\nthings, \"sought to generate fear through . . . threat of economic\n\ninjury\").\n\n          Having  swept  broadly   in  constructing  the  general\n\nguideline, the Commission  subsequently designed the  enhancement\n                                       \n\nprovision specifically to  target those who made a  bad situation\n\nworse by using  \"an express  or implied threat  of death,  bodily\n\ninjury,  or  kidnapping\"  as  a  tool  of  the  extortion  trade.\n\nU.S.S.G.    2B3.2(b)(1).   The  very fact  that the  enhancer was\n\nadded later, and, thus,  superimposed upon the general guideline,\n\nfurnishes  potent evidence that the  Commission did not intend to\n\n                                5\n\nimplement the analogy which appellant struggles to draw.\n\n          Appellant's reliance on United States  v.

In Plaza-\n                                                                 \n\nGarcia, the  defendant  pled  guilty to  one  count  of  sexually\n      \n\nexploiting a  minor in  violation of  18 U.S.C.    2251(a).   The\n\napplicable  sentencing guideline,  U.S.S.G.    2G2.1(a), provided\n\nfor  a  base  offense  level  of  25.    The  presentence  report\n\nrecommended,  and  the  sentencing  judge  imposed,  a  two-level\n\nincrease  because   the  victim's   youth  made   him  \"unusually\n\nvulnerable\" within the  meaning of  U.S.S.G.   3A1.1.   But,  the\n\ncommentary to U.S.S.G.   3A1.1  stated specifically that the two-\n\nlevel  adjustment for vulnerability due to age does not apply \"if\n\nthe  offense  guideline specifically  incorporates  this factor.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.   3A1.1, comment. (n.2).  Hence,  we reversed, reasoning\n\nthat, because  the guideline for  sexual exploitation of  a minor\n\n\"specifically incorporates the factor of age,\" an increase of two\n\nlevels would constitute  impermissible double  counting.

Here,  in  contrast,  the  general\n      \n\nguideline for extortion, U.S.S.G. 2B3.2(a), does not specifically\n\nincorporate the relevant factor (threatened bodily harm) into the\n\nbase offense level.\n\n          We will not paint  the lily.  Mindful, as we  are, that\n\ncourts should, for the most part, apply the guidelines as written\n\nand give  effect to  the interpretive commentary  and application\n\nnotes, see, e.g., Stinson v.

He\n\nmaintains  that his conduct did not fall within the compendium of\n\naggravating   factors  represented   by   the  specific   offense\n\ncharacteristics listed in U.S.S.G.    2B3.2(b)(1).  This argument\n\nwill not wash.   The district court  made its finding that  Jones\n\nthreatened to inflict bodily harm on Halle and Cyr largely on the\n\nbasis  of  words  spoken  by  Jones  himself  and  preserved  for\n\nposterity on magnetic tape.   To the extent, if at all,  that the\n\nthreats were inexplicit   and we  do not suggest that they were  \n\nthe sentencing court was  nonetheless entitled to draw reasonable\n\ninferences  and  resolve  any  possible   ambiguity  against  the\n\nextortionist.
