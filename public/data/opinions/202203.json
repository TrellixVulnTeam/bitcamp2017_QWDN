Magdalena Pomales worked as a\n\nsales consultant for Celulares Telefónica, Inc. (CTI), a Puerto\n\nRico retailer of cellular telephone equipment and services.          After\n\nPomales was fired by CTI, she brought this action claiming sexual\n\nharassment and retaliation under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights\n\nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., and Puerto Rico law.              She also\n\nclaimed   that   CTI   violated    the    Consolidated   Omnibus    Budget\n\nReconciliation Act (COBRA), 29 U.S.C. § 1161 et seq., by not\n\nnotifying her of the opportunity to purchase continuing health\n\ncoverage under the company policy following her termination.           The\n\ndistrict court granted CTI summary judgment.         We affirm.\n\n           Pomales failed to oppose CTI's statement of undisputed\n\nfacts in support of its motion for summary judgment in accord with\n\nthe Puerto Rico Local Rules.      See D.P.L.R. 56.    The district court,\n\ntherefore, accepted the facts presented by CTI as admitted.            See\n\nid.   We will do the same.   See Cosme-Rosado v. Serrano-Rodriguez,\n\n360 F.3d 42, 45-46 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           Pomales' relationship with CTI began when she was hired\n\nas a temporary employee in November 1995.            In August 1999, CTI\n\nconverted Pomales to permanent status and assigned her to work as\n\na sales consultant in its store in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.           Pomales\n\nwas initially supervised by Norma Vargas. In 2000, Peter Rodríguez\n\njoined Vargas as another supervisor.         Peter Rodríguez and Vargas\n\nwere themselves supervised by Rodney Rodríguez.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           In April 2000, Pomales complained to Rodney Rodríguez\n\nthat Peter Rodríguez had directed an inappropriate comment and\n\ngesture toward her.            According to Pomales, she invited Peter\n\nRodríguez to come on a sales visit with her, and he responded by\n\ngrabbing his crotch and stating that \"it would be great to come\n\nwith you.\"\n\n           As    a   sales     consultant,         Pomales   was     responsible    for\n\nselling   products      and    services       to    CTI   customers.       CTI   sales\n\nconsultants     made    in-store      and    \"proactive\"      out-of-store       sales.\n\nSales consultants were responsible for meeting a minimum sales\n\nquota and were paid based on an hourly rate plus commissions.\n\n           CTI required sales consultants to verify each customer's\n\ncredit before consummating a sale. Customers with poor credit were\n\nrequired to provide CTI with a deposit before the sales consultant\n\ncould   complete       the    sale.     The        process   for    determining    the\n\ncustomer's credit rating (and resulting deposit) varied depending\n\non whether the sale was an in-store or proactive.\n\n           For in-store sales, the consultant accessed, through\n\nCTI's computer system, a third-party credit service and reported\n\ncertain information about the customer.                   The credit service then\n\nprovided a credit score which the computer automatically translated\n\ninto a required deposit amount (if any).                  For proactive sales, the\n\nconsultant called CTI's credit department and provided customer\n\ninformation to the credit-department employee.                     That employee then\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fdetermined the required deposit amount and entered the deposit\n\namount   manually     into    the    computer.         Only   credit-department\n\nemployees could set the required deposit amount for proactive\n\nsales, and no sale could be completed until the customer had paid\n\nthe required deposit.\n\n           During     Pomales'       employment,    CTI's     computer      system\n\nmalfunctioned in such a way that consultants could bypass the\n\ncredit-verification process and manually enter a deposit amount.\n\nCTI eventually discovered this malfunction in its system, after\n\nlearning that several consultants had entered inaccurate deposit\n\ninformation to register unauthorized sales.\n\n           In August 2000, Vargas received confidential information\n\nthat Pomales had failed to secure proper deposits from clients by\n\nmanipulating the credit-verification system.                  Rodney Rodríguez\n\nauthorized Vargas to investigate this accusation.\n\n           Vargas' investigation revealed that the credit department\n\nwas unfamiliar with Pomales and had no documentation that she had\n\never contacted it to register a proactive sale.                      At Vargas'\n\nrequest, the credit department reviewed more than 10 of Pomales'\n\nsales.    On   each    occasion,      Pomales    had    bypassed    the    credit-\n\nverification   process       and    manually    entered   into     the    system   a\n\nnotation stating that no deposit was required.\n\n           On August 30, 2000, Vargas requested that Pomales produce\n\nevidence that she had collected a deposit from one of her proactive\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcustomers. Pomales failed to comply with this request by September\n\n5th, when she began a three-month medical leave of absence.\n\n           While Pomales was on leave, Vargas discussed the results\n\nof her investigation with two members of the CTI human resources\n\ndepartment.    A conclusion was reached that Pomales had breached\n\nseveral    company    policies,    including    a     policy    against       the\n\nfalsification or malicious alteration of reports and records of\n\ninterest to the company.        Vargas thereafter decided to terminate\n\nPomales' employment.       Vargas arrived at this decision without\n\nknowledge that Pomales had previously complained to CTI management\n\nabout Peter Rodríguez's inappropriate conduct.\n\n           Vargas informed Pomales on the day that she returned from\n\nher leave of absence that her employment was terminated.                Pomales\n\nwas one of several employees that CTI discharged for breaching its\n\ncredit    verification    and     deposit    policies.         Upon    Pomales'\n\ntermination, CTI did not provide her with information concerning\n\nthe   option   to   purchase    continuing   health    coverage       under   the\n\ncompany's group health insurance policy.\n\n           Three weeks after her termination, Pomales filed an\n\nadministrative charge of sexual harassment based on a hostile work\n\nenvironment     and   retaliation     with     the    Puerto     Rico     Anti-\n\nDiscrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Labor and Human Resources\n\nDepartment.     She eventually received a right to sue letter and\n\nfiled the present action.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f                 After a period for discovery, CTI moved for summary\n\njudgment. The district court ruled that Pomales' Title VII hostile\n\nwork environment claim failed because, inter alia, no reasonable\n\nfact       finder     could     conclude    that     the    conduct       alleged   was\n\nsufficiently severe or pervasive.                   The court also rejected her\n\nTitle      VII     retaliation     claim    because       there    was    no   evidence\n\nestablishing         a   causal    connection       between       Pomales'     protected\n\nactivity and her termination.              Finally, the court determined that\n\nCTI did not violate COBRA's notice requirements because the company\n\ndismissed Pomales for gross misconduct.                   Pomales timely appealed.\n\n                 We review the district court's order granting summary\n\njudgment de novo.             See Wolinetz v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 361\n\nF.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 2004).           We will affirm the order \"if there is\n\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . [CTI] is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"                  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n                 We begin by considering Pomales' hostile work environment\n\nclaim.       This claim is limited to Peter Rodriguez's comment and\n\ngesture      to     Pomales    suggesting    that    he    wished    to   have    sexual\n\nrelations with her.1\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Pomales' brief makes passing reference to certain alleged\nacts of harassment that occurred in 1997. The district court ruled\nthat these acts were time barred, and Pomales has not challenged\nthis ruling. In addition, Pomales' appellate argument concerning\nher harassment claim discusses only Peter Rodríguez's comment in\nApril 2000. Therefore, any claim concerning the 1997 conduct is\nforfeit.\n\n                                            -6-\n\f           To succeed on her hostile work environment claim, Pomales\n\nmust demonstrate, inter alia, that the complained-of conduct was so\n\nsevere or pervasive that it altered the terms or conditions of her\n\nemployment.      See Lee-Crespo v. Schering-Plough Del Caribe, Inc.,\n\n354 F.3d 34, 46 (1st Cir. 2003).            \"There is no mathematically\n\nprecise   test    to   determine      whether   [a     plaintiff]    presented\n\nsufficient evidence\" that she was subjected to a severely or\n\npervasively hostile work environment.           Kosereis v. Rhode Island,\n\n331 F.3d 207, 216 (1st Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted). We\n\nexamine all the attendant circumstances including the frequency of\n\nthe discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it was physically\n\nthreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and\n\nwhether   it    unreasonably    interfered      with    an    employee's   work\n\nperformance.     See O'Rourke v. Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 729 (1st\n\nCir.   2001).      Because     this   inquiry    is    fact    specific,    the\n\ndetermination is often reserved for a fact finder, see Marrero v.\n\nGoya of P.R., Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 19 (1st Cir. 2002), but summary\n\njudgment is an appropriate vehicle for \"polic[ing] the baseline for\n\nhostile environment claims,\" Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., 195 F.3d\n\n1238, 1244 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc).\n\n           The record does not provide a sufficient basis from which\n\na reasonable fact finder could conclude that Pomales was subjected\n\nto a hostile work environment.           The alleged harassing conduct,\n\nwhile certainly crude, comprised only a single incident. See Clark\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fCounty Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 271 (2001) (per curiam)\n\n(stating that \"isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will\n\nnot amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of\n\nemployment\"); Chamberlin v. 101 Realty, Inc., 915 F.2d 777, 783\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (\"[A]n isolated sexual advance, without more, does\n\nnot satisfy the requirement that an employee asserting a cause of\n\naction   for       hostile       environment        discrimination       demonstrate     an\n\nabusive workplace environment.\").                    There was no proof that Peter\n\nRodríguez touched or physically threatened Pomales.                           While we do\n\nnot preclude the possibility of a single-incident hostile work\n\nenvironment claim based on exclusively verbal conduct, successful\n\nsingle-incident claims typically have involved unwanted physical\n\ncontact.       See       Barbara    Lindemann        &   Paul    Grossman,     Employment\n\nDiscrimination Law at 795 n. 240 (3d ed. 1996) (collecting cases).\n\nFinally, Pomales presented no proof that Peter Rodríguez's conduct\n\nnegatively affected her ability to work as a CTI sales consultant.\n\nSee Lee-Crespo, 354 F.3d at 46 (affirming summary judgment for an\n\nemployer in a hostile environment case where there was no evidence\n\nthat the conduct caused \"an impediment to [the plaintiff's] work\n\nperformance\").\n\n            The inappropriate conduct alleged here is similar to\n\nconduct which this circuit and others have deemed insufficient to\n\nestablish      a    hostile        work      environment        claim.        See,    e.g.,\n\nChamberlin,        915    F.2d    at   783    (concluding       that     it   was    \"highly\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\fdoubtful\" that five sexual advances by a supervisor \"could be\n\nconsidered sufficiently severe or pervasive to support a sexual\n\ndiscrimination claim of the hostile environment variety\"); Morgan\n\nv. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 901 F.2d 186, 192-93 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding\n\nthat conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive where, over\n\ntwo-week period, a coworker stood behind the plaintiff to create\n\nphysical   contact,    surreptitiously     looked   at    the    plaintiff's\n\ngenitals in the restroom, and engaged in unwanted touching);\n\nBurnett v. Tyco Corp., 203 F.3d 980, 984-85 (6th Cir. 2000)\n\n(holding that evidence of a single battery and two offensive\n\nremarks over six months did not establish a hostile environment).\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment on Pomales' sexual harassment claim.2\n\n           We turn next to Pomales' retaliation claim. She contends\n\nthat, shortly after complaining about Peter Rodríguez's conduct to\n\nRodney Rodríguez, she was retaliated against by being discharged\n\nfor   conduct   that   she   was   never   notified      could   result   in\n\ntermination.    We analyze this claim under the familiar McDonnell\n\n\n      2\n      Even if Pomales had established a prima facie case of hostile\nwork environment, CTI may have established an affirmative defense.\nAn employer is not liable if it has an anti-harassment policy with\na complaint procedure that an employee unreasonably fails to use.\nSee Marrero v. Goya of P.R., Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 20-21 (1st Cir.\n2002). CTI has a policy against sexual harassment and a procedure\nfor brining an incident of sexual harassment to the company's\nattention by reporting it to the company's human resources office.\nPomales acknowledges receipt of CTI's Ethics Manual which discusses\nthis procedure.     However, she did not follow this procedure\nregarding the April 2000 incident.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fDouglas framework.          See Ramirez Rodriguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim\n\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 425 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir. 2005) (describing\n\nthe framework for analyzing retaliation claims drawn from McDonnell\n\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973)). To establish\n\na prima facie case of retaliation, Pomales must show that she was\n\nengaged in protected conduct, that she was discharged, and that\n\nthere   was    a    causal     connection   between     the    discharge    and    the\n\nprotected conduct.          See Wright v. CompUSA, Inc.,         352 F.3d 472, 478\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              There    is    sufficient     proof    that     Pomales    engaged    in\n\nprotected     activity       by   complaining   to     management       about   Peter\n\nRodríguez's         conduct.       Moreover,        Pomales     was     subsequently\n\ndischarged.         The issue is whether a reasonable fact finder could\n\nfind an adequate causal link between these events.                    Pomales relies\n\nprimarily on the chronological proximity between her complaint and\n\ndischarge      to     establish    the    requisite    connection.         Temporal\n\nproximity can create an inference of causation in the proper case.\n\nSee Wyatt v. Boston, 35 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1994).                    But to draw\n\nsuch an inference, there must be proof that the decisionmaker knew\n\nof the plaintiff's protected conduct when he or she decided to take\n\nthe adverse employment action.              See Soileau v. Guilford of Me.,\n\nInc., 105 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n              There is no evidence that Vargas, the CTI employee who\n\ndischarged Pomales, had any knowledge that Pomales complained to\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fRodney Rodríguez about Peter Rodríguez's conduct.3 See, e.g.,\n\nSanchez v. Denver Pub. Schs., 164 F.3d 527, 533-34 (10th Cir. 1998)\n\n(holding that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case\n\nof retaliation because there was no evidence that the decisionmaker\n\nknew of the plaintiff's protected conduct); Smith v. Riceland\n\nFoods, Inc., 151 F.3d 813, 818-19 (8th Cir. 1998) (same).        There is\n\nalso no proof that Peter Rodríguez or Rodney Rodríguez participated\n\nor   otherwise   influenced   either   Vargas'   investigation    or   the\n\nultimate decision to discharge Pomales.\n\n            Pomales argues that the fact that she did not receive\n\nformal notice before the termination suggests retaliation.              We\n\ndisagree.    CTI's policy stated that an employee who falsified\n\ncompany records was subject to immediate termination.             In any\n\nevent, Pomales did receive some notice that there was a question\n\nabout her sales conduct when Vargas asked her to document one of\n\nher proactive sales.   Given the absence of evidence establishing a\n\ncausal connection between the protected conduct and discharge, the\n\ndistrict court correctly granted CTI summary judgment on the\n\nretaliation claim.4\n\n\n      3\n      We do not decide whether the six-to-eight-month interval\nbetween Pomales' complaint and the discharge could be probative of\nretaliation had the decisionmaker known of the complaint. See Kipp\nv. Missouri Highway & Transp. Comm'n, 280 F.3d 893, 897 (8th Cir.\n2002) (concluding that a two-month interval between complaint and\nadverse action was too long to establish causal connection).\n      4\n      Pomales has presented no appellate argument challenging the\ndistrict court's determination that CTI was not required to provide\n\n                                 -11-\n\f          Affirmed.5\n\n\n\n\nher with COBRA notice because she was fired for gross misconduct.\nTherefore, Pomales has waived any challenge to this ruling. See\nUnited States v.

(CTI), a Puerto Rico retailer of cellular telephone equipment and services. After Pomales was fired by CTI, she brought this action claiming sexual harassment and retaliation under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq., and Puerto Rico law. She also claimed that CTI violated the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1161 et seq., by not notifying her of the opportunity to purchase continuing health coverage under the company policy following her termination. The district court granted CTI summary judgment.

The district court, therefore, accepted the facts presented by CTI as admitted. <i>See id.</i> We will do the same. <i>See Cosme-Rosado v. Serrano-Rodriguez,</i> 360 F.3d 42, 45-46 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pomales' relationship with CTI began when she was hired as a temporary employee in November 1995. In August 1999, CTI converted Pomales to permanent status and assigned her to work as a sales consultant in its store in Bayam&#243;n, Puerto Rico. Pomales was initially supervised by Norma Vargas. In 2000, Peter Rodr&#237;guez joined Vargas as another supervisor. Peter Rodr&#237;guez and Vargas were themselves supervised by Rodney Rodr&#237;guez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 2000, Pomales complained to Rodney Rodr&#237;guez that Peter Rodr&#237;guez had directed an inappropriate comment and gesture toward her. According to Pomales, she invited Peter Rodr&#237;guez to come on a sales visit with her, and he responded by grabbing his crotch and stating that \"it would be great to come with you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a sales consultant, Pomales was responsible for selling products and services to CTI customers. CTI sales consultants made in-store and \"proactive\" out-of-store sales. Sales consultants were responsible for meeting a minimum sales quota and were paid based on an hourly rate plus commissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CTI required sales consultants to verify each customer's credit before consummating a sale. Customers with poor credit were required to provide CTI with a deposit before the sales consultant could complete the sale. The process for determining the customer's credit rating (and resulting deposit) varied depending on whether the sale was an in-store or proactive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For in-store sales, the consultant accessed, through CTI's computer system, a third-party credit service and reported certain information about the customer. The credit service then provided a credit score which the computer automatically translated into a required deposit amount (if any). For proactive sales, the consultant called CTI's credit department and provided customer information to the credit-department employee. That employee then determined the required deposit amount and entered the deposit amount manually into the computer. Only credit-department employees could set the required deposit amount for proactive sales, and no sale could be completed until the customer had paid the required deposit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Pomales' employment, CTI's computer system malfunctioned in such a way that consultants could bypass the credit-verification process and manually enter a deposit amount. CTI eventually discovered this malfunction in its system, after learning that several consultants had entered inaccurate deposit information to register unauthorized sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 2000, Vargas received confidential information that Pomales had failed to secure proper deposits from clients by manipulating the credit-verification system. Rodney Rodr&#237;guez authorized Vargas to investigate this accusation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vargas' investigation revealed that the credit department was unfamiliar with Pomales and had no documentation that she had ever contacted it to register a proactive sale. At Vargas' request, the credit department reviewed more than 10 of Pomales' sales. On each occasion, Pomales had bypassed the credit-verification process and manually entered into the system a notation stating that no deposit was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 30, 2000, Vargas requested that Pomales produce evidence that she had collected a deposit from one of her proactive customers. Pomales failed to comply with this request by September 5th, when she began a three-month medical leave of absence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Pomales was on leave, Vargas discussed the results of her investigation with two members of the CTI human resources department. A conclusion was reached that Pomales had breached several company policies, including a policy against the falsification or malicious alteration of reports and records of interest to the company. Vargas thereafter decided to terminate Pomales' employment. Vargas arrived at this decision without knowledge that Pomales had previously complained to CTI management about Peter Rodr&#237;guez's inappropriate conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vargas informed Pomales on the day that she returned from her leave of absence that her employment was terminated. Pomales was one of several employees that CTI discharged for breaching its credit verification and deposit policies. Upon Pomales' termination, CTI did not provide her with information concerning the option to purchase continuing health coverage under the company's group health insurance policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three weeks after her termination, Pomales filed an administrative charge of sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment and retaliation with the Puerto Rico Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Labor and Human Resources Department. She eventually received a right to sue letter and filed the present action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a period for discovery, CTI moved for summary judgment. The district court ruled that Pomales' Title VII hostile work environment claim failed because, <i>inter alia,</i> no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the conduct alleged was sufficiently severe or pervasive. The court also rejected her Title VII retaliation claim because there was no evidence establishing a causal connection between Pomales' protected activity and her termination. Finally, the court determined that CTI did not violate COBRA's notice requirements because the company dismissed Pomales for gross misconduct. Pomales timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's order granting summary judgment de novo. <i>See Wolinetz v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,</i> 361 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir.2004). We will affirm the order \"if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . [CTI] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by considering Pomales' hostile work environment claim. This claim is limited to Peter Rodriguez's comment and gesture to Pomales suggesting that he wished to have sexual relations with her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed on her hostile work environment claim, Pomales must demonstrate, <i>inter alia,</i> that the complained-of conduct was so severe or pervasive that it altered the terms or conditions of her employment. <i>See Lee-Crespo v. Schering-Plough Del Caribe, Inc.,</i> 354 F.3d 34, 46 (1st Cir.2003). \"There is no mathematically precise test to determine whether [a plaintiff] presented sufficient evidence\" that she was subjected to a severely or pervasively hostile work environment. <i>Kosereis v. Rhode Island,</i> 331 F.3d 207, 216 (1st Cir.2003) (internal citations omitted). We examine all the attendant circumstances including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interfered with an employee's work performance. <i>See O'Rourke v. Providence,</i> 235 F.3d 713, 729 (1st Cir.2001). Because this inquiry is fact specific, the determination is often reserved for a fact finder, <i>see Marrero v. Goya of P.R., Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 7, 19 (1st Cir.2002), but summary judgment is an appropriate vehicle for \"polic[ing] the baseline for hostile environment claims,\" <i>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc.,</i> 195 F.3d 1238, 1244 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record does not provide a sufficient basis from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Pomales was subjected to a hostile work environment. The alleged harassing conduct, while certainly crude, comprised only a single incident. <i>See Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden,</i> 532 U.S. 268, 271, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (per curiam) (stating that \"isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment\"); <i>Chamberlin v. 101 Realty, Inc.,</i> 915 F.2d 777, 783 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[A]n isolated sexual advance, without more, does not satisfy the requirement that an employee asserting a cause of action for hostile environment discrimination demonstrate an abusive workplace environment.\"). There was no proof that Peter Rodr&#237;guez touched or physically threatened Pomales. While we do not preclude the possibility of a single-incident hostile work environment claim based on exclusively verbal conduct, successful single-incident claims typically have involved unwanted physical contact. <i>See</i> Barbara Lindemann &amp; Paul Grossman, <i>Employment Discrimination Law</i> at 795 n. 240 (3d ed.1996) (collecting cases). Finally, Pomales presented no proof that Peter Rodr&#237;guez's conduct negatively affected her ability to work as a CTI sales consultant. <i>See Lee-Crespo,</i> 354 F.3d at 46 (affirming summary judgment for an employer in a hostile environment case where there was no evidence that the conduct caused \"an impediment to [the plaintiff's] work performance\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inappropriate conduct alleged here is similar to conduct which this circuit and others have deemed insufficient to establish a hostile work environment claim. <i>See, e.g., Chamberlin,</i> 915 F.2d at 783 (concluding that it was \"highly doubtful\" that five sexual advances by a supervisor \"could be considered sufficiently severe or pervasive to support a sexual discrimination claim of the hostile environment variety\"); <i>Morgan v. Mass. Gen. Hosp.,</i> 901 F.2d 186, 192-93 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive where, over two-week period, a co-worker stood behind the plaintiff to create physical contact, surreptitiously looked at the plaintiff's genitals in the restroom, and engaged in unwanted touching); <i>Burnett v. Tyco Corp.,</i> 203 F.3d 980, 984-85 (6th Cir.2000) (holding that evidence of a single battery and two offensive remarks over six months did not establish a hostile environment). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on Pomales' sexual harassment claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to Pomales' retaliation claim. She contends that, shortly after complaining about Peter Rodr&#237;guez's conduct to Rodney Rodr&#237;guez, she was retaliated against by being discharged for conduct that she was never notified could result in termination. We analyze this claim under the familiar <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework. <i>See Ramirez Rodriguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> 425 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir.2005) (describing the framework for analyzing retaliation claims drawn from <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Pomales must show that she was engaged in protected conduct, that she was discharged, and that there was a causal connection between the discharge and the protected conduct. <i>See Wright v. CompUSA, Inc.,</i> 352 F.3d 472, 478 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is sufficient proof that Pomales engaged in protected activity by complaining to management about Peter Rodr&#237;guez's conduct. Moreover, Pomales was subsequently discharged. The issue is whether a reasonable fact finder could find an adequate causal link between these events. Pomales relies primarily on the chronological proximity between her complaint and discharge to establish the requisite connection. Temporal proximity can create an inference of causation in the proper case. <i>See Wyatt v. Boston,</i> 35 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1994). But to draw such an inference, there must be proof that the decisionmaker knew of the plaintiff's protected conduct when he or she decided to take the adverse employment action. <i>See Soileau v. Guilford of Me., Inc.,</i> 105 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence that Vargas, the CTI employee who discharged Pomales, had any knowledge that Pomales complained to Rodney Rodr&#237;guez about Peter Rodr&#237;guez's conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See, e.g., Sanchez v. Denver Pub. Schs.,</i> 164 F.3d 527, 533-34 (10th Cir.1998) (holding that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation because there was no evidence that the decisionmaker knew of the plaintiff's protected conduct); <i>Smith v. Riceland Foods, Inc.,</i> 151 F.3d 813, 818-19 (8th Cir.1998) (same). There is also no proof that Peter Rodr&#237;guez or Rodney Rodr&#237;guez participated or otherwise influenced either Vargas' investigation or the ultimate decision to discharge Pomales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pomales argues that the fact that she did not receive formal notice before the termination suggests retaliation. We disagree. CTI's policy stated that an employee who falsified company records was subject to <i>immediate</i> termination. In any event, Pomales did receive some notice that there was a question about her sales conduct when Vargas asked her to document one of her proactive sales. Given the absence of evidence establishing a causal connection between the protected conduct and discharge, the district court correctly granted CTI summary judgment on the retaliation claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Pomales' brief makes passing reference to certain alleged acts of harassment that occurred in 1997. The district court ruled that these acts were time barred, and Pomales has not challenged this ruling. In addition, Pomales' appellate argument concerning her harassment claim discusses only Peter Rodr&#237;guez's comment in April 2000. Therefore, any claim concerning the 1997 conduct is forfeit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Even if Pomales had established a prima facie case of hostile work environment, CTI may have established an affirmative defense. An employer is not liable if it has an anti-harassment policy with a complaint procedure that an employee unreasonably fails to use<i>See Marrero v. Goya of P.R., Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 7, 20-21 (1st Cir.2002). CTI has a policy against sexual harassment and a procedure for bringing an incident of sexual harassment to the company's attention by reporting it to the company's human resources office. Pomales acknowledges receipt of CTI's Ethics Manual which discusses this procedure. However, she did not follow this procedure regarding the April 2000 incident.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We do not decide whether the six-to-eight-month interval between Pomales' complaint and the discharge could be probative of retaliation had the decisionmaker known of the complaint<i>See Kipp v. Missouri Highway &amp; Transp.

Therefore, Pomales has waived any challenge to this ruling<i>See United States v.

Rodney Rodr&#237;guez authorized Vargas to investigate this accusation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vargas' investigation revealed that the credit department was unfamiliar with Pomales and had no documentation that she had ever contacted it to register a proactive sale. At Vargas' request, the credit department reviewed more than 10 of Pomales' sales. On each occasion, Pomales had bypassed the credit-verification process and manually entered into the system a notation stating that no deposit was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 30, 2000, Vargas requested that Pomales produce evidence that she had collected a deposit from one of her proactive customers. Pomales failed to comply with this request by September 5th, when she began a three-month medical leave of absence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Pomales was on leave, Vargas discussed the results of her investigation with two members of the CTI human resources department. A conclusion was reached that Pomales had breached several company policies, including a policy against the falsification or malicious alteration of reports and records of interest to the company. Vargas thereafter decided to terminate Pomales' employment. Vargas arrived at this decision without knowledge that Pomales had previously complained to CTI management about Peter Rodr&#237;guez's inappropriate conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vargas informed Pomales on the day that she returned from her leave of absence that her employment was terminated. Pomales was one of several employees that CTI discharged for breaching its credit verification and deposit policies. Upon Pomales' termination, CTI did not provide her with information concerning the option to purchase continuing health coverage under the company's group health insurance policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three weeks after her termination, Pomales filed an administrative charge of sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment and retaliation with the Puerto Rico Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Labor and Human Resources Department. She eventually received a right to sue letter and filed the present action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a period for discovery, CTI moved for summary judgment. The district court ruled that Pomales' Title VII hostile work environment claim failed because, <i>inter alia,</i> no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the conduct alleged was sufficiently severe or pervasive. The court also rejected her Title VII retaliation claim because there was no evidence establishing a causal connection between Pomales' protected activity and her termination. Finally, the court determined that CTI did not violate COBRA's notice requirements because the company dismissed Pomales for gross misconduct. Pomales timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's order granting summary judgment de novo. <i>See Wolinetz v.

This claim is limited to Peter Rodriguez's comment and gesture to Pomales suggesting that he wished to have sexual relations with her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed on her hostile work environment claim, Pomales must demonstrate, <i>inter alia,</i> that the complained-of conduct was so severe or pervasive that it altered the terms or conditions of her employment. <i>See Lee-Crespo v. Schering-Plough Del Caribe, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200796\"><a href=\"/opinion/200796/lee-crespo-v-schering-plough-del/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.2003). \"There is no mathematically precise test to determine whether [a plaintiff] presented sufficient evidence\" that she was subjected to a severely or pervasively hostile work environment. <i>Kosereis v.

We examine all the attendant circumstances including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interfered with an employee's work performance. <i>See O'Rourke v. Providence,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771503\"><a href=\"/opinion/771503/julia-m-orourke-v-city-of-providence/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 729 (1st Cir.2001). Because this inquiry is fact specific, the determination is often reserved for a fact finder, <i>see Marrero v.

The alleged harassing conduct, while certainly crude, comprised only a single incident. <i>See Clark County Sch. Dist. v.

There was no proof that Peter Rodr&#237;guez touched or physically threatened Pomales. While we do not preclude the possibility of a single-incident hostile work environment claim based on exclusively verbal conduct, successful single-incident claims typically have involved unwanted physical contact. <i>See</i> Barbara Lindemann &amp; Paul Grossman, <i>Employment Discrimination Law</i> at 795 n. 240 (3d ed.1996) (collecting cases). Finally, Pomales presented no proof that Peter Rodr&#237;guez's conduct negatively affected her ability to work as a CTI sales consultant. <i>See Lee-Crespo,</i> 354 F.3d at 46 (affirming summary judgment for an employer in a hostile environment case where there was no evidence that the conduct caused \"an impediment to [the plaintiff's] work performance\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inappropriate conduct alleged here is similar to conduct which this circuit and others have deemed insufficient to establish a hostile work environment claim. <i>See, e.g., Chamberlin,</i> 915 F.2d at 783 (concluding that it was \"highly doubtful\" that five sexual advances by a supervisor \"could be considered sufficiently severe or pervasive to support a sexual discrimination claim of the hostile environment variety\"); <i>Morgan v.

Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on Pomales' sexual harassment claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to Pomales' retaliation claim. She contends that, shortly after complaining about Peter Rodr&#237;guez's conduct to Rodney Rodr&#237;guez, she was retaliated against by being discharged for conduct that she was never notified could result in termination. We analyze this claim under the familiar <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework. <i>See Ramirez Rodriguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201844\"><a href=\"/opinion/201844/ramirez-rodriguez-v-boehringer/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2005) (describing the framework for analyzing retaliation claims drawn from <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 802-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1973)). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Pomales must show that she was engaged in protected conduct, that she was discharged, and that there was a causal connection between the discharge and the protected conduct. <i>See Wright v. CompUSA, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200779\"><a href=\"/opinion/200779/wright-v-comp-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span>, 478 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is sufficient proof that Pomales engaged in protected activity by complaining to management about Peter Rodr&#237;guez's conduct. Moreover, Pomales was subsequently discharged. The issue is whether a reasonable fact finder could find an adequate causal link between these events. Pomales relies primarily on the chronological proximity between her complaint and discharge to establish the requisite connection. Temporal proximity can create an inference of causation in the proper case. <i>See Wyatt v. Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195603\"><a href=\"/opinion/195603/wyatt-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1994). But to draw such an inference, there must be proof that the decisionmaker knew of the plaintiff's protected conduct when he or she decided to take the adverse employment action. <i>See Soileau v. Guilford of Me., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197175\"><a href=\"/opinion/197175/soileau-v-guilford-of-me/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence that Vargas, the CTI employee who discharged Pomales, had any knowledge that Pomales complained to Rodney Rodr&#237;guez about Peter Rodr&#237;guez's conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See, e.g., Sanchez v.

There is also no proof that Peter Rodr&#237;guez or Rodney Rodr&#237;guez participated or otherwise influenced either Vargas' investigation or the ultimate decision to discharge Pomales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pomales argues that the fact that she did not receive formal notice before the termination suggests retaliation. We disagree. CTI's policy stated that an employee who falsified company records was subject to <i>immediate</i> termination. In any event, Pomales did receive some notice that there was a question about her sales conduct when Vargas asked her to document one of her proactive sales. Given the absence of evidence establishing a causal connection between the protected conduct and discharge, the district court correctly granted CTI summary judgment on the retaliation claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Pomales' brief makes passing reference to certain alleged acts of harassment that occurred in 1997.

In addition, Pomales' appellate argument concerning her harassment claim discusses only Peter Rodr&#237;guez's comment in April 2000. Therefore, any claim concerning the 1997 conduct is forfeit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Even if Pomales had established a prima facie case of hostile work environment, CTI may have established an affirmative defense.

CTI has a policy against sexual harassment and a procedure for bringing an incident of sexual harassment to the company's attention by reporting it to the company's human resources office. Pomales acknowledges receipt of CTI's Ethics Manual which discusses this procedure.
