HALL,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n           [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Edward S. MacColl, with whom Thompson, Bull, Furey, Bass &\nMacColl, LLC, P.A. was on brief, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        January 12, 2006\n\f             HOWARD, Circuit Judge.     A federal grand jury in Maine\n\nreturned an indictment against Kevin Hall charging him with one\n\ncount   of   conspiring    to   distribute   marijuana,    21    U.S.C.   §§\n\n841(a)(1) & 846; 163 counts of money laundering, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1956(a)(1)(B)(i), for his use of the conspiracy proceeds; and four\n\ncounts of tax evasion, 26 U.S.C. § 7201, for failing to pay income\n\ntax on the drug-related income.        The government also brought two\n\nforfeiture counts to obtain assets related to Hall's illegal\n\nconduct, 21 U.S.C. § 853; 18 U.S.C. § 982.         After a ten-day jury\n\ntrial, Hall was convicted on all counts.         He was sentenced to 151\n\nmonths of imprisonment on the conspiracy and money laundering\n\nconvictions,     to   be   served   concurrently   with   60    months    of\n\nimprisonment on each of the tax evasion convictions.            He also was\n\nordered to forfeit his illegally obtained assets.         On appeal, Hall\n\nclaims that there was insufficient evidence of a drug conspiracy or\n\nmoney laundering and alleges a host of trial and sentencing errors.\n\n                  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE CLAIMS\n\n             We review Hall's sufficiency of the evidence claims de\n\nnovo, see United States v. Cruzado-Laureano, 404 F.3d 470, 480 (1st\n\nCir. 2005), and apply the following standard:\n\n             We must determine whether the evidence,\n             taken in the light most favorable to the\n             government--a perspective that requires us\n             to draw every reasonable inference and\n             resolve credibility conflicts in a manner\n             consistent with the verdict--would permit\n             a rational trier of fact to find each\n             element of the crime charged beyond a\n\n                            -2-\n\f              reasonable doubt. The government can meet\n              this   burden   by    either    direct   or\n              circumstantial    evidence,   or   by   any\n              combination of the two.      Moreover, the\n              government   need    not  disprove    every\n              hypothesis consistent with the defendant's\n              innocence; rather, it is enough that a\n              rational jury could look objectively at\n              the proof and supportably conclude beyond\n              a reasonable doubt that the defendant's\n              guilt has been established.\n\nUnited States v. Patel, 370 F.3d 108, 111 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              A.         Drug Conspiracy\n\n              Hall contends that there was insufficient evidence of his\n\nparticipation       in    a   drug   trafficking        conspiracy     because      the\n\ngovernment     established        only    that    he   purchased    marijuana      from\n\nanother individual and resold it.                 According to Hall, proof of a\n\nbuyer/seller relationship is not sufficient to establish a drug\n\nconspiracy.\n\n              This contention does not warrant extended discussion. It\n\nis   enough    to   say    that    Hall    understates     the     strength   of    the\n\ngovernment’s evidence. There was proof that from 1995 to 1999 Hall\n\nbought large amounts of marijuana from an individual named John\n\nRedihan.      Redihan testified that he was aware that Hall's purpose\n\nwas to resell the drugs for profit and that, on occasion, he\n\nassisted Hall in these efforts.             See United States v. Berrios, 132\n\nF.3d   834,    841-42     (1st    Cir.    1998)    (concluding      that   there    was\n\nsufficient proof of a distribution conspiracy where seller knew\n\nthat buyer was purchasing drugs for the purpose of selling it to\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fothers and intended to facilitate the resales).                 Moreover, Hall\n\nenlisted several other individuals to help him in the storage,\n\npreparation, and selling of the drugs.        For example, an individual\n\nnamed William Lee sold marijuana for Hall, and a married couple,\n\nGeorge and Brenda Elliot, assisted Hall by letting him store drugs\n\nin their home, helping him weigh the drugs, picking up marijuana\n\ndeliveries     from    Redihan,   and    participating     in     Hall's    debt\n\ncollection efforts.      This evidence sufficiently established Hall's\n\nparticipation in a conspiracy to distribute marijuana.\n\n          B.          Money Laundering\n\n          The     government      charged   Hall    with   163     counts      of\n\nconcealment money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) for\n\nhis use of the drug conspiracy proceeds.           To sustain a conviction\n\nunder § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), the government must prove: (1) that Hall\n\nknowingly conducted a financial transaction, (2) that he knew that\n\nthe transaction involved funds that were proceeds of some form of\n\nunlawful activity, (3) that the funds were proceeds of a specified\n\nunlawful activity, and (4) that Hall engaged in the financial\n\ntransaction knowing that it was designed in whole or in part to\n\nconceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or\n\ncontrol of the proceeds of such unlawful activity.                 See United\n\nStates v. Cornier-Ortiz, 361 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir. 2004).                  Hall's\n\nsufficiency claims relate primarily to the government's proof on\n\nthe \"conceal or disguise\" element.           He asserts that all of the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\ffinancial transactions were conducted above board and were thus not\n\nmeant to conceal or disguise anything. In essence, Hall’s argument\n\nis that the government proved only that he spent or invested drug\n\nmoney and that this evidence is inadequate to sustain a conviction\n\nunder § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).\n\n            It is true that the money laundering statute does not\n\ncriminalize the mere spending or investing of illegally obtained\n\nassets.   See United States v. Corchado-Peralta, 318 F.3d 255, 259\n\n(1st Cir. 2003). Instead, at least one purpose for the expenditure\n\nmust be to conceal or disguise the assets.     See id.   Proof of this\n\nelement may be based on direct evidence, such as the defendant's\n\nown statements; or circumstantial evidence, like the use of a\n\nthird-party to disguise the transaction; or unusual secrecy in\n\nmaking the transaction.    See Cruzado-Laureano, 404 F.3d at 483.\n\n            In this case the government charged a series of financial\n\ntransactions as separate counts.       See United States v. Marshall,\n\n248 F.3d 525, 540 (6th Cir. 2001).      We must therefore examine the\n\ngovernment's proof on each count to determine its sufficiency. See\n\nUnited States v. Shepard, 396 F.3d 1116, 1121 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\nThe 163 counts essentially involve loans to friends and colleagues\n\nand related transactions, purchases of cars and other vehicles,\n\nexpenditures to renovate property, and establishing a construction\n\nbusiness.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                    1.   Loans and Related Transactions\n\n                         i. Cosby/Brown Loans (Counts 2-97)\n\n          In 1995, Hall offered to loan $30,000 to Danny Cosby and\n\nhis girlfriend, Susan Brown, to buy a parcel of land.           Cosby and\n\nBrown accepted Hall's offer and, after executing a mortgage to\n\nsecure the loan, Hall gave them the loan proceeds in cash.                    In\n\n1996, Cosby and Brown borrowed another $25,000, which Hall also\n\npaid out in cash.    Over the next several years, Hall negotiated 96\n\nrepayment checks from Cosby and Brown, including a $33,000 check to\n\npay off the remainder of the loans.\n\n          When Cosby and Brown asked Hall where he got the money\n\nfor the loans, he told them that he got most of it from an\n\ninheritance from his father.        But there was evidence that Hall's\n\nfather had intentionally omitted him from his will and that Hall\n\ndid not receive anything from his father's estate.         There also was\n\ntestimony that, in regard to a loan to another person, Hall stated\n\nthat the reason he wanted to loan money was to \"get some of his\n\nmoney more legal.\"\n\n          The   government    charged     each   negotiation   of    a    loan\n\nrepayment check as a separate money laundering count.          Hall claims\n\nthat there \"was nothing suspicious about the loan\" repayments\n\nbecause he made no attempt to conceal his identity when dealing\n\nwith Cosby and Brown in making the loans or negotiating the\n\nrepayments.     This     argument   misconstrues     the   purpose       of    §\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f1956(a)(1)(B)(i).       The statute criminalizes conduct designed to\n\nconceal or disguise the source of the drug proceeds even if the\n\ndefendant does not conceal his own identity in the process.           See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Norman, 143 F.3d 375, 377-78 (8th Cir.\n\n1998); United States v. Starke, 62 F.3d 1374, 1384 (11th Cir.\n\n1995); United States v. Kinzler, 55 F.3d 70, 73 (2d Cir. 1995);\n\nUnited States v. Lovett, 964 F.2d 1029, 1034 n.3 (10th Cir. 1992).\n\n              While Hall arranged the loans himself and negotiated the\n\nchecks in his own name, there was evidence that one purpose for the\n\nloans was to disguise the illegal origin of the loan funds.           Hall\n\nadmitted as much when he claimed to another individual that he\n\nwanted to loan money to \"get some of his money more legal.\"           Hall\n\nmade this comment regarding a different loan, but the jury could\n\ninfer that the same motivation applied to other similar loans which\n\nHall   made    while   running   his   marijuana   trafficking   operation.\n\nAdditionally, Hall intentionally misled the borrowers about the\n\nsource of the proceeds by telling them that he obtained the money\n\nfrom a family inheritance.         Such a misstatement is probative of\n\nconcealment.     See United States v. Tekle, 329 F.3d 1108, 1114 (9th\n\nCir. 2003) (affirming money laundering conviction based on evidence\n\nthat defendant lied about the origin of funds that he used to\n\npurchase a home); United States v. Wilson, 77 F.3d 105, 109 (5th\n\nCir. 1996) (affirming money laundering conviction where defendant\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fsaid that money was from an inheritance to \"cover\" for the cash\n\npurchase). This evidence is sufficient to sustain the convictions.\n\n                          ii. Moving Funds to an E*Trade Account\n                          (Count 98)\n\n           As mentioned above, Cosby and Brown provided Hall with a\n\n$33,000 check to pay off their debt.             After receiving the check,\n\nHall placed these funds in his bank account for a few days before\n\nmoving them to an E*Trade investment account.                    The government\n\ncharged the moving of the funds as money laundering.                Hall claims\n\nthat \"there was absolutely nothing about the transaction that\n\nsuggested concealment or an intent to conceal.\"\n\n           We agree that there is nothing about the transfer of\n\nmoney   from   Hall's   bank   account      to   his   E*Trade   account   that,\n\nstanding alone, necessarily suggests an intent to conceal. But the\n\ntransfer   cannot be viewed in isolation.          It was part of the series\n\nof transactions that began with the loans to Cosby and Brown.                \"A\n\ndesign to conceal on a particular transaction may be imputed to a\n\nsubsequent     transaction     if   the   subsequent      transaction,     while\n\ninnocent on its face, is part of a larger money laundering scheme.\"\n\nUnited States v. Burns, 162 F.3d 840, 848-49 (5th Cir. 1998)\n\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).                    This is so\n\nbecause a \"launderer can never be sure that he has run the money\n\nthrough enough laundering cycles to make it clean enough so that\n\nthe government can't find the stains.\"            B. Williams & F. Whitney,\n\nFederal Money Laundering: Crimes and Forfeitures § 5.1.6.4 (1999).\n\n                                      -8-\n\fGiven the proof that the original loans to Cosby and Brown were\n\nmotivated by Hall's desire to conceal the source of the funds, the\n\njury could infer that Hall's continued shuffling of the money\n\nthrough accounts was an attempt to further separate the money from\n\nits illegal source. See Burns, 162 F.3d at 848-49 (affirming money\n\nlaundering conviction based on bank deposit which when viewed in\n\nisolation was innocent, but when viewed in context was part of a\n\nscheme to launder funds).1\n\n                       iii. Recording a Mortgage (Count 161)\n\n           As security for a loan that Hall made to Felicity Hyde\n\n(Count 160), Hall recorded a mortgage on property that Hyde owned.\n\nThe government charged the recording of the mortgage as a separate\n\ncount of money laundering. Hall contends that the recording of the\n\nmortgage does not constitute money laundering because it is not a\n\n\"financial transaction\" as defined under the money laundering\n\nstatute.   See 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (3)(c)(4).   This argument was not\n\nraised below, and therefore our review is for plain error.      See\n\nUnited States v. Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           As a threshold for relief under the plain error standard,\n\nHall must show that the district court committed a clear and\n\n\n     1\n      Counts 119-121, 125-150, 155-157 and 160 also concern loan\nrepayments Hall received and Hall's subsequent distribution of the\nloan proceeds. For each count, there was evidence similar to the\nproof presented for counts 2-98. Hall has not provided additional\ngrounds for overturning these convictions.     We therefore affirm\nthese convictions for substantially the same reasons that we affirm\nthe convictions for counts 2-98.\n\n                                -9-\n\fobvious error by not dismissing this count on the ground that\n\nrecording the mortgage was not a financial transaction. See United\n\nStates v. Marino, 277 F.3d 11, 32 (1st Cir. 2002).              The money\n\nlaundering statute defines a financial transaction as a transaction\n\nwhich \"in any way or degree affects interstate commerce\" and, among\n\nother things \"involves the transfer of title to any real property.\"\n\nThis definition is construed broadly.          Federal Money Laundering,\n\nsupra § 2.3 (citing S. Rep. 99-433 at 13 (1986)).           A mortgage is\n\n\"a conveyance of title to property that is given as security for\n\nthe payment of a debt . . . that will become void upon payment . .\n\n. according to the stipulated terms.\"         Black's Law Dictionary 1031\n\n(8th ed. 1999) (emphasis supplied). The recording of the mortgage\n\nthus memorialized and made efficacious \"transfer of title to any\n\nreal   property,\"   and   would   seem   to    constitute   a   \"financial\n\ntransaction.\"   In any event, we are aware of no caselaw to the\n\ncontrary, and therefore the district court's error, if any, was not\n\nclear or obvious.    See Patel, 370 F.3d at 118.\n\n                    2.    Vehicle Purchases\n\n                          i. Pickup Truck (Count 99)\n\n           In April 1997, Hall purchased a used one-ton pickup\n\ntruck.   Hall found an advertisement for the truck in a local\n\nmagazine and called the owner, Mark Stevens, to inquire about it.\n\nAfter a few contacts, Hall and Stevens agreed on a $12,000 purchase\n\nprice.   Hall asked that Stevens deliver the truck to his house.\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fAlthough Stevens found that request peculiar, he complied and upon\n\ndelivering the truck received from Hall $12,000 in cash in the form\n\nof wrapped packages of $20 bills. Hall contends that this evidence\n\ndoes not suggest an effort by him to conceal the funds used for the\n\ntransaction.\n\n           \"The conversion of cash into goods or services as a way\n\nof concealing or disguising [a] wellspring of . . . cash              is a\n\ncentral concern of the money laundering statute.\" United States v.\n\nJackson, 935 F.2d 832, 841 (7th Cir. 1991).            \"Because cash is a\n\nfrequent by-product of many kinds of illegal activity, converting\n\n. . . cash into useable funds is probative of money laundering.\n\nThus, spending large amounts of cash to buy cars . . . may suggest\n\nan intent to conceal.\"        Federal Money Laundering supra at §\n\n5.16.11.\n\n           The jury heard evidence that Hall paid for the truck with\n\nwrapped packages of small bills.     Hall's use of small bills made it\n\nmore difficult for anyone to trace the truck payment.          See United\n\nStates v. Misher, 99 F.3d 664, 668-69 (5th Cir. 1996) (concluding\n\nthat proof that drug dealer purchased pickup truck with $10 and $20\n\nbills was sufficient for the jury to conclude that a purpose of the\n\npurchase was to conceal the source of the funds); United States v.\n\nHeater, 63 F.3d 311, 319 (4th Cir. 1995) (concluding that proof\n\nthat defendant made several large purchases using small bills which\n\nexceeded   his   lawful   income   was    sufficient   to   sustain   money\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\flaundering conviction).        Additionally, as we will discuss below,\n\nthe government introduced evidence of other vehicle purchases for\n\nwhich there was additional proof that Hall made the purchases to\n\nconceal his drug income.         The jury could have relied on this\n\nevidence to conclude that the pickup truck purchase was part of a\n\nsingle pattern of concealment.             Taken in total, this evidence\n\nsuffices to sustain the conviction on count 99.\n\n                         ii. 1988 Ford Dump Truck (Counts 100-01)\n\n            In August 1997, Hall provided his sister, Andrea Read,\n\nwith $16,000 cash to purchase a money order in her name payable to\n\nO'Connor GMC.     Hall used the money order along with an additional\n\n$500 in cash to purchase a dump truck.           Hall's use of his sister's\n\nname in purchasing the money order is evidence of his intent to\n\nconceal because it indicates that he was attempting to disguise the\n\nsource of the proceeds by having it pass through another person's\n\ncontrol.    See United States v. Willey, 57 F.3d 1374, 1385 (5th Cir.\n\n1995) (stating that \"using a third party, for example,                         . . . a\n\nrelative,    to   purchase    goods   on     one's   behalf      .    .    .   usually\n\nconstitutes sufficient proof of a design to conceal\").                     Moreover,\n\nRedihan    testified   that   Hall    told    him    that   he       had   set   up   a\n\nfictitious \"inheritance account\" in which the money \"was cleaned\"\n\nand used to purchase construction equipment such as a dump truck.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fThus, the jury could have found that this purchase was part of the\n\nmoney laundering scheme.2\n\n                        iii. 1932 Ford Coupe (Count 102)\n\n           In August 1997, Hall purchased a restored 1932 Ford Coupe\n\nfrom Terrence Blair for $24,000.    When Blair delivered the car to\n\nHall, Hall gave him a paper bag filled with cash.           At Hall's\n\nrequest, Blair wrote the bill of sale for only $5,000.     In addition\n\nto the use of cash to make the purchase, Hall's request for a false\n\nbill of sale suggests concealment because it permitted Hall to\n\ninclude an additional $19,000 in the purchase price that could not\n\neasily be traced.      See Wilson, 77 F.3d at 109 (affirming money\n\nlaundering conviction where defendant asked seller of car to say\n\nthat he sold the car to him for half of the actual purchase\n\nprice).3\n\n                  3.    Renovations and Fire Island Construction\n\n\n\n     2\n      Redihan's testimony is also sufficient to affirm the\nconvictions on counts 103-118 and 122-124 which relate to Hall's\npurchase of other pieces of construction equipment.\n     3\n      There was evidence that Hall requested false bills of sale\nfor his purchases of a 1970 Volkswagon (count 154) and a 1965\nCorvette (count 158). We affirm these convictions on this basis.\nWe also affirm the conviction concerning Hall's purchase of a 1995\nVolvo (count 151), as there was evidence that Hall attempted to\nconceal certain loan repayment funds by purchasing this vehicle.\nAdditionally, we affirm the conviction concerning Hall's purchase\nof an all-terrain vehicle (count 159) on the ground that the jury\ncould conclude that this purchase (made in cash) was part of the\nsame laundering scheme as the other vehicle purchases. Hall has\nnot challenged the convictions on counts 152 and 153 which relate\nto his purchase of a 1992 Ford Explorer.\n\n                                -13-\n\f                           i.     Renovations to Hall's Real Estate\n                                  Holdings (Counts 162-163)\n\n              In 1997 and 1998, Hall paid almost $100,000 for supplies\n\nand   labor    to   renovate    property   that   he   owned   in   Camden   and\n\nNorthport, Maine.       Hall argues that he organized the work himself\n\nand therefore there was no effort on his part to conceal or\n\ndisguise the drug funds.\n\n              But, as discussed above, the issue is not whether Hall\n\nhid his identity in performing these renovations but rather whether\n\none purpose of the transaction was to conceal or disguise drug\n\nproceeds.      See supra at 6-7.      The government presented evidence\n\nthat Hall paid for the labor and materials using mostly cash and\n\nthat he did not keep records of the labor costs.           The evidence also\n\nestablished that Hall spent far in excess of his declared income to\n\nmake these renovations.         See United States v. Webster, 960 F.2d\n\n1301, 1308 (5th Cir. 1992) (holding that \"a differential between [a\n\ndrug dealer's] legitimate income and cash flow is sufficient for a\n\nmoney laundering conviction\").         A jury could conclude that Hall's\n\nexpenditures of large amounts of cash, far in excess of his\n\nreported      income,   coupled    with     his   non-existent      bookkeeping\n\npractices demonstrated that he renovated the properties as a way to\n\ndisguise illegally obtained cash by converting the money into\n\nexpensive real estate holdings.4\n\n\n      4\n      Hall also argues that these counts should have been dismissed\nbecause the government did not charge each expenditure related to\n\n                                     -14-\n\f                             ii.    Transferring Assets to Fire Island\n                                    Construction (Count 164)\n\n             The final count of money laundering charged Hall with\n\ntransferring over $80,000 in assets to a construction company that\n\nhe established called Fire Island Construction.                 Hall again claims\n\nthat the government failed to prove the concealment element of the\n\noffense.     Hall's objection to this count fails on the basis of his\n\nstatements to others. See Cruzado-Laureano, 404 F.3d at 483. There\n\nwas testimony that Hall said that he established Fire Island\n\nConstruction \"to make him look legitimate\" and that he transferred\n\nconstruction equipment to Fire Island as part of a scheme to \"clean\n\nup some [of the] money.\"           The jury could infer from this testimony\n\nthat Hall's creation of Fire Island Construction and the subsequent\n\ntransfer     of   property    to    the    company   was   at    least   partially\n\nmotivated    by   his   desire      to    disguise   the   source   of   his   drug\n\nproceeds.5\n\n\nthe renovations as a separate offense.       He argues that each\nrenovation expenditure was a distinct transaction and therefore\nshould have been charged separately.     This argument was first\nraised on appeal, and we therefore limit ourselves to plain error\nreview. The term transaction \"may comprehend a series of many\noccurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness of their\nconnection as upon their logical relationship.\"     Moore v. N.Y.\nCotton Exchange, 270 U.S. 593, 610 (1926).     It was not clearly\nwrong for the district court to view Hall's numerous renovation\nexpenditures as one transaction even though it was comprised of\nseveral \"subtransactions.\"   Federal Money Laundering supra at §\n2.2.2.\n     5\n      Hall also challenges his money laundering convictions on the\nground that the government failed to establish a nexus between the\nmoney laundering transactions and interstate commerce as required\n\n                                          -15-\n\f                            TRIAL-ERROR CLAIMS\n\n           A.       Brady Violation\n\n           Hall    claims   that   the    government   committed     a   Brady\n\nviolation by withholding information concerning the extent of\n\nRedihan's prior criminal history.         See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S.\n\n83, 87 (1963) (holding that prosecution violates defendant's due\n\nprocess   rights   by   withholding      evidence   from   defense   that   is\n\nmaterial to either guilt or punishment); Giglio v. United States,\n\n405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972) (applying Brady to impeachment evidence).\n\nBefore trial, the government disclosed Redihan's prior convictions,\n\nincluding a 1998 drug conviction in Rhode Island.            As part of the\n\ndisclosure, the government told defense counsel that the Rhode\n\nIsland conviction involved the sale of Percodan and steroids, but\n\nafter trial, it was discovered, through the preparation of Hall's\n\npresentence report, that the conviction also involved allegations\n\nof marijuana distribution.\n\n           Hall asserts that this omission prejudiced his defense.\n\nOne of Hall's defenses was that, while he sold small amounts of\n\nmarijuana, he was not involved in the large-scale trafficking\n\n\n\nby 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(3)(B). This argument was not raised below.\nWhile Hall claims that \"many of the transactions\" fail the\ninterstate commerce requirement, he has provided us with only a\nskeletal argument and has not cited any authority to support his\nclaim. This sort of underdeveloped argument is inadequate for Hall\nto sustain his \"heavy burden\" of demonstrating plain error for this\nunpreserved claim. United States v. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.\n2004).\n\n                                   -16-\n\fcharged in the indictment.          Hall argues that evidence concerning\n\nthe nature of Redihan's Rhode Island conviction was important\n\nbecause it would have shown that Redihan lied when he testified\n\nthat Hall was his major customer during the period of the charged\n\nconspiracy.      He posits that, if he could have shown that Redihan\n\nwas supplying drugs to many people, the jury would have been less\n\nlikely   to    believe     that   Redihan   was    selling   him    such   large\n\nquantities of marijuana. The government counters that there was no\n\nBrady violation because it was unaware of the marijuana aspects of\n\nthe Rhode Island conviction until after the trial, and in any event\n\nthe unavailability of this information was not prejudicial to\n\nHall's defense.\n\n              Hall's Brady argument fails because there is no evidence\n\nthat, prior to the conclusion of the trial, the government had\n\ninformation concerning the marijuana aspect of Redihan's Rhode\n\nIsland conviction.         The information that Redihan's Rhode Island\n\nconviction concerned marijuana trafficking came from a police\n\nreport which the government states that it learned about only after\n\nthe probation department discovered it during Hall's presentence\n\ninvestigation.\n\n              The government's obligations under Brady only extend to\n\ninformation in its possession, custody, or control.                 See United\n\nStates   v.     Josleyn,    206   F.3d   144,     153-54   (1st    Cir.    2000).\n\nNevertheless, Hall contends that the government had a duty to learn\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fand disclose the details of Redihan's Rhode Island convictions and\n\nnot just the fact of the conviction.             While a prosecutor must\n\ndisclose information maintained by government agents even if the\n\nprosecutor herself does not possess the information, see Strickler\n\nv. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 280 (1999), this duty does not extend to\n\ninformation possessed by government agents not working with the\n\nprosecution, see United States v. Bender, 304 F.3d 161, 164 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).     The information concerning the details of Redihan's\n\nconviction was maintained by the Rhode Island state courts, and\n\nthere is no evidence that the federal prosecutor or any agent\n\nworking on her behalf had this information prior to or during\n\ntrial.    See id.\n\n            Moreover, even assuming the government had to disclose\n\nthe details of Redihan's Rhode Island conviction, Hall has not\n\nshown sufficient prejudice to warrant relief.            Brady prejudice\n\nexists where \"there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed\n\nevidence would have produced a different verdict.\"        Strickler, 527\n\nU.S. at 281-82.     Hall elicited from Redihan, on cross-examination,\n\nthat he was a convicted drug dealer and that he had distributed\n\ndrugs in Rhode Island.       Additional detail about the Rhode Island\n\nconviction would have been mostly cumulative.            See Lavallee v.\n\nCoplan,   374   F.3d   41,   46   (1st   Cir.   2004).   There   also   was\n\nsubstantial evidence of Hall's participation in a drug conspiracy\n\naside from Redihan's testimony.            Several other members of the\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fconspiracy testified about Hall's criminal conduct. In sum, we are\n\npersuaded the disputed information, if known to Hall, would not\n\nhave   affected    the   trial's    outcome.      See   United    States   v.\n\nSchneiderman, 404 F.3d 73, 79 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           B.       Redihan's Plea Agreement\n\n           Hall next challenges the admission of Redihan's plea\n\nagreement for conspiring with Hall to distribute drugs.                 While\n\nHall's brief is not explicit, he appears to object to the admission\n\nof the plea agreement because the agreement was conditioned on\n\nRedihan's truthful testimony at Hall's trial.           According to Hall,\n\nadmitting the agreement had the effect of bolstering Redihan's\n\ncredibility in the jury's eyes.\n\n           We have previously concluded that \"informing the jury of\n\nthe contents of a plea agreement of, at least, normal stripe,\" is\n\npermissible.    See United States v. Martin, 815 F.2d 818, 821 (1st\n\nCir. 1987).     Hall has not presented any claim that Redihan's plea\n\nagreement was atypical or outside the rule stated in Martin.\n\n           Hall also claims that the district court did not provide\n\nan   appropriate    cautionary     instruction    concerning     the   jury's\n\nconsideration of the plea agreement.             We disagree.     The court\n\ninstructed the jury that \"[s]ome people [testifying pursuant to a\n\nplea agreement] are entirely truthful when testifying.            Still, you\n\nshould consider the testimony of these individuals with particular\n\ncaution.   They may have had reason to make up stories or exaggerate\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fwhat others did because they wanted to help themselves.\"          Hall did\n\nnot object to this instruction or propose other language, and the\n\ninstruction was not clearly erroneous as given.\n\n           C.      Money Laundering Jury Instruction\n\n           The next challenge concerns the jury instruction on the\n\nconcealment element of money laundering.              The district court\n\ninstructed that the concealment element was satisfied if the jury\n\nconcluded that \"Hall knew that the transaction in question was\n\ndesigned in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,\n\nlocation, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of the\n\nmarijuana trafficking.\"      Hall objected to this instruction on the\n\nground that the instruction did not sufficiently convey that he had\n\nto intend specifically to conceal the drug proceeds.\n\n           We review challenges to the wording of a jury instruction\n\nfor abuse of discretion.      See United States v. Tom, 330 F.3d 83, 91\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).     The court's instruction closely tracked the\n\nlanguage of the statute, which is a strong indicator that the\n\ncharge passes muster.       See, e.g., United States v. Rosa, 705 F.2d\n\n1375, 1381 (1st Cir. 1983).      In any event, the instruction clearly\n\nconveyed that Hall had to intend the transactions to conceal drug\n\nproceeds   by   requiring    such   a   design   on   Hall's   part.   The\n\ninstructions were thus adequate.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f            D.       Agent Giguere's Testimony\n\n            Near   the   close   of    its    case,   the   government   called\n\nInternal Revenue Service Agent Rodney Giguere to testify concerning\n\nhis investigation of Hall's finances.                 Relying on our recent\n\ndecisions in United States v. García-Morales, 382 F.3d 12, 16-17\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) and United States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 119-120 (1st\n\nCir.   2004),    Hall    challenges     Giguere's     testimony   as   improper\n\noverview testimony.       He also suggests Giguere provided prejudicial\n\nsummary testimony.       Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.      See United States v. Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 11 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n            Hall's reliance on García-Morales and Casas is misplaced.\n\nIn both cases, we were addressing the problem of the prosecution\n\nbeginning its case-in-chief by calling a government agent to\n\nprovide an overview of its case.               We criticized that practice\n\nbecause \"such testimony raises the very real specter that the jury\n\nverdict could be influenced by statements of fact or credibility\n\nassessments in the overview but not in evidence.\"             Casas, 356 F.3d\n\nat 119.\n\n            Here, Giguere did not testify until near the end of the\n\ngovernment's case-in-chief.           Most of his testimony concerned his\n\ndescription of his investigation into Hall's activities.                   This\n\ntestimony   was    appropriate    because      it   was   based   on   Giguere's\n\npersonal knowledge.        See García-Morales, 382 F.3d at 16.             On a\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fcouple of occasions, Giguere testified to hearsay statements made\n\nto him during the investigation.         But Hall did not object to\n\nGiguere's answers, and the testimony was hardly prejudicial.\n\n           To the extent that Giguere provided summary testimony, it\n\nconcerned the travel of Hall's funds in and out of various accounts\n\nand was based on testimony and documents in evidence.        This sort of\n\ntestimony is permissible to summarize complex aspects of a case\n\nsuch as the financial dealings of a defendant.        See Casas, 120 F.3d\n\nat 120 n.4.     Furthermore, the court cautioned the jury that it\n\nshould rely on its own memory of the facts and not the summary\n\nprovided by Giguere.     We discern no abuse of discretion.\n\n           E.      Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n           Hall alleges that the government violated his Fifth and\n\nSixth Amendment rights by threatening certain witnesses with severe\n\nconsequences if they did not testify on the government's behalf.\n\nSpecifically, one witness, Andrea Read, testified that government\n\nagents told her that she would face prosecution if she did not tell\n\nthem \"what they wanted to hear,\" and a second witness, Steven\n\nHiscock, testified that a government agent told him that, if he did\n\nnot   cooperate,   the   government   \"would   take   his   home.\"   Both\n\nwitnesses testified on behalf of the government and were examined\n\nabout the nature of the threats and the effect, if any, these\n\nthreats had on their testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\f            We have recognized that a due process violation can occur\n\nwhere the government intimidates or harasses potential defense\n\nwitnesses to discourage them from testifying.                   See United States\n\nv. Anguilo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1192 (1st Cir. 1990).                 Hall has cited a\n\nseries    of   cases    in     which   appellate     courts      have    overturned\n\nconvictions where the prosecution coerced a potential witness not\n\nto testify on behalf of the defendant.              See, e.g., United       States\n\nv. Morrison, 535 F.2d 223, 226 (3d Cir. 1976); United States v.\n\nSmith, 478 F.3d 976, 978-79 (D.C. Cir. 1973).                     These case are\n\ndistinguishable because, here, the challenged conduct was intended\n\nto encourage witnesses to testify.             Anguilo and the cases cited by\n\nHall recognize a constitutional problem when the defendant is\n\nprecluded from putting on the defense of his choice because the\n\ngovernment threatens a person into not testifying.                 See also Webb\n\nv. Texas, 409 U.S. 95, 98 (1972) (per curiam) (stating that\n\nthreatening comments by a judge that \"effectively drove the witness\n\noff the stand\" violated the defendant's constitutional right to\n\npresent his defense).\n\n            Hall does not claim that he was deprived of testimony but\n\nrather that Read and Hiscock may have testified falsely because of\n\nthe government's alleged threats. The problem is a complicated one\n\nbecause   in   many    cases    the    government    has   to    press    unwilling\n\nwitnesses, out of fear or friendship, are reluctant to give. There\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fis   no   blanket     rule    against        inducements   by      the   government    to\n\nwitnesses to produce truthful testimony.\n\n                We will assume that, in extreme circumstances, government\n\nmisconduct, could occur through improper efforts to shape testimony\n\nto the government's liking.              In this instance, however, there was\n\nconflicting       testimony        as   to    whether   the     government     actually\n\nthreatened Read or Hiscock and defense counsel was allowed to\n\ncross-examine on the issue, leaving it to the jury to evaluate\n\nwitness credibility in light of the evidence concerning the alleged\n\nthreats.        We do not find a constitutional violation.\n\n                Hall also asserts that his constitutional rights were\n\nviolated by the government convincing his wife, Jill Hall, to\n\ninvoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and\n\nto decline to testify on his behalf during sentencing.                      Before Ms.\n\nHall testified, the government informed the court that Ms. Hall was\n\na target of an investigation for conduct related to the crimes for\n\nwhich     her    husband     had    been     convicted.       In    response    to    the\n\ngovernment's representation, the court summoned Ms. Hall's lawyer\n\nto discuss with her the possible consequences of her testimony.\n\nAfter Ms. Hall and her lawyer consulted, she decided to invoke her\n\nprivilege not to testify, and the court upheld her invocation.\n\n                Under these facts, the government did not substantially\n\ninterfere with Hall's ability to call his wife as a witness.                          The\n\ncourt found that Ms. Hall properly invoked her Fifth Amendment\n\n\n                                             -24-\n\fprivilege.      There is no evidence that the government acted in bad\n\nfaith by notifying the court that Ms. Hall was the target of an\n\ninvestigation.             Moreover,       the   court     handled     the      matter\n\nappropriately by alerting Ms. Hall to the possible consequences of\n\ntestifying and assuring that an attorney was present to counsel Ms.\n\nHall on her decision of whether to invoke her Fifth Amendment\n\nprivilege. See United States v. Serrano, 406 F.3d 1208, 1216 (10th\n\nCir. 2005) (rejecting claim of government interference with witness\n\non similar facts).6\n\n                   FORFEITURE AND SENTENCING ERROR CLAIMS\n\n              A.      Forfeiture\n\n              After   finding     Hall     guilty   on    all   counts,    the   jury\n\nreturned forfeiture findings concerning Hall's drug trafficking and\n\nmoney laundering activities.             See 21 U.S.C. § 853 (forfeiture for\n\ndrug       trafficking);     18   U.S.C.     §   982     (forfeiture      for    money\n\nlaundering).       After the jury returned these findings, the court\n\nentered a forfeiture order pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2. In\n\nregard to the drug trafficking forfeiture, the court imposed a\n\nmoney      judgment   in   the    amount    of   $511,321.22     and   ordered    the\n\nforfeiture of specific items of personal and real property which\n\n\n       6\n      Hall also claims that the trial was conducted in such a way\nthat it denied him due process of law.     He offers a litany of\ncomplaints to support the claim.     We have reviewed the entire\ntranscript of Hall's trial and conclude that the district court\npresided ably over this complex case, assuring that Hall's\nprocedural rights were protected at every turn.\n\n                                         -25-\n\fthe jury found were connected Hall's drug activities.                           The money\n\nlaundering forfeiture order commanded Hall to turn over specific\n\nitems of property (in accord with the jury's findings) but did not\n\nimpose an additional money judgment.                     Both orders permitted the\n\ngovernment        to    seize    \"substitute         property\"         under      certain\n\ncircumstances to satisfy the forfeiture amount.7\n\n              Hall's first challenge concerns the district court's\n\nentry    of   a   money    judgment     as    part       of   the   drug     trafficking\n\nforfeiture.       A money judgment permits the government to collect on\n\nthe forfeiture order in the same way that a successful plaintiff\n\ncollects a money judgment from a civil defendant.                      Thus, even if a\n\ndefendant does not have sufficient funds to cover the forfeiture at\n\nthe time of the conviction, the government may seize future assets\n\nto satisfy the order.           Relying on United States v. Croce, 334 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 781 (E.D. Pa. 2004), Hall argues that a court may not\n\nissue a money judgment as part of a forfeiture order.\n\n              Croce is at odds with the law of this circuit.                             In\n\nCandelaria-Silva,         166   F.3d   at    42,    we    ruled     that    a   \"criminal\n\nforfeiture may take several forms [including] an in personam\n\njudgment      against     the   defendant     for    the      amount    of      money   the\n\ndefendant obtained as proceeds of the offense.\"                            This position\n\n\n     7\n      Substitute property may be seized by the government to\nsatisfy a forfeiture order where, by an act or omission, the\ndefendant has prevented the government from tracing his illegally\nobtained assets. See United States v. Candelaria-Silva, 166 F.3d\n19, 42 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                        -26-\n\faccords with the several appellate decisions that have addressed\n\nthe question.   See United States v. Huber, 404 F.3d 1047, 1056 (8th\n\nCir. 2005); United States v. Baker, 227 F.3d 955, 970 (7th Cir.\n\n2000); United States v. Lester, 85 F.3d 1409, 1413 (9th Cir. 1996);\n\nUnited States v. Robilotto, 828 F.2d 940, 948-49 (2d Cir. 1987);\n\nUnited States v. Ginsburg, 773 F.2d 798, 801-03 (7th Cir. 1985) (en\n\nbanc).\n\n          There   are   two   primary   reasons   for   permitting   money\n\njudgments as part of criminal forfeiture orders.         First, criminal\n\nforfeiture is a sanction against the individual defendant rather\n\nthan a judgment against the property itself.       See United States   v.\n\nNava, 404 F.3d 1119, 1124 (9th Cir. 2005); United States v. Cunan,\n\n156 F.3d 110, 116 n.7 (1st Cir. 1998).            Because the sanction\n\n\"follows the defendant as a part of the penalty,\"         the government\n\nneed not prove that the defendant actually has the forfeited\n\nproceeds in his possession at the time of conviction. Robilotto,\n\n828 F.2d at 948-49.     Second, permitting a money judgment, as part\n\nof a forfeiture order, prevents a drug dealer from ridding himself\n\nof his ill-gotten gains to avoid the forfeiture sanction.              In\n\nrejecting an argument against the use of money judgments pursuant\n\nto the RICO forfeiture statute, the Seventh Circuit explained:\n\n          What the defendant's argument overlooks\n          is the fact that a racketeer who\n          dissipates profits or proceeds of his\n          racketeering activity on wine, women,\n          and song has profited from organized\n          crime to the same extent as if he had\n\n                         -27-\n\f           put the money in his bank account.\n           Every dollar that the racketeer derives\n           from illicit activities and then spends\n           on such items as food, entertainment,\n           college tuition, and charity, is a\n           dollar    that should not have been\n           available for him to spend for those\n           purposes.   In order to truly separate\n           the racketeer from his dishonest gains,\n           therefore, the statute requires him to\n           forfeit to the United States the total\n           amount   of   the   proceeds   of   his\n           racketeering activity, regardless of\n           whether the specific dollars received\n           from that activity are still in his\n           possession.\n\nGinsburg, 773 F.2d at 802.        The policy rationale for permitting a\n\nmoney judgment as part of a forfeiture in a racketeering case\n\napplies equally to a forfeiture in a drug case.           See Nava, 404 F.3d\n\nat 1124 n.1 (stating that RICO forfeiture cases are useful in\n\ninterpreting the drug forfeiture statute because the statutes are\n\n\"substantially identical\").         The district court did not err in\n\nentering   a   money   judgment    as   part   of   the   drug   trafficking\n\nforfeiture.8\n\n           Hall next contends that the forfeiture orders wrongly\n\npermit the government to seize substitute property. He argues that\n\nthe power to forfeit substitute property rests exclusively with the\n\ncourt.\n\n\n     8\n      Hall also contends that, even if the court could enter a\nmoney judgment, it could not enter both a money judgment and a\nforfeiture of specific assets as part of the same order. Hall has\ncited no authority for this proposition, and there are several\ncases in which such hybrid orders have been entered. See, e.g.,\nBaker, 227 F.3d at 959; Candelaria-Silva, 166 F.3d at 42.\n\n                                    -28-\n\f               Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(e) provides the\n\nprocedure for the forfeiture of substitute property.                    It states:\n\n\"On the government's motion, the court may at anytime enter an\n\norder of forfeiture or amend an existing order of forfeiture to\n\ninclude property . . .\" that is substitute property under an\n\napplicable statute.         Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2(e)(1).         The forfeiture\n\norders    in    this   case   state   that    the   government    may    \"forfeit\"\n\nsubstitute property.          It is not clear whether this means that the\n\ngovernment may move for forfeiture or may seize the substitute\n\nproperty without any action by the court.\n\n               The government acknowledges that only the court can order\n\nthe   forfeiture       of   substitute     property.      In     light    of   this\n\nacknowledgment and the plain language of Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e)(1),\n\nwe interpret the forfeiture orders in this case to permit the\n\ngovernment to move for substitute property but to reserve for the\n\ncourt the authority to order the property forfeited.9\n\n                       B.     Sentencing\n\n               Hall raises several challenges to his sentence.                   He\n\n\n      9\n      Hall also asserts that the forfeiture of his real property\nholdings was erroneous because there was insufficient evidence for\nthe jury to have found a nexus between his real estate holdings and\nhis drug trafficking and money laundering activities. We disagree.\nThe jury could have found that Hall renovated his property with\ndrug proceeds and that he used one of the properties to receive a\nshipment of drugs.    This evidence is sufficient to support the\njury's forfeiture finding. See United States v. Desmarais, 938\nF.2d 347, 353 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Parcels of Land,\n903 F.2d 36, 39 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                       -29-\n\fclaims that the district court clearly erred in its drug quantity\n\ncalculation and in its application of the obstruction of justice\n\nenhancement. He also claims that the court should have awarded him\n\na downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.                  Finally,\n\nhe claims that he is entitled to re-sentencing because the district\n\ncourt treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory.\n\n           In deciding Hall's sentence, the district court applied\n\nthe grouping rules under the Sentencing Guidelines. See U.S.S.G.\n\n3D1.2.   The application of these rules led the court to determine\n\nthat   Hall's    period   of    incarceration      would   be    based    on   his\n\nconviction for the drug trafficking conspiracy because it resulted\n\nin the highest offense level.\n\n           To    calculate     the   offense   level     for    the   conspiracy\n\nconviction,     the   court    concluded    that   the   conspiracy      involved\n\nbetween 700 and 1000 kilograms of marijuana, which led to an\n\noffense level of 30.      The court then increased the offense level\n\nto 34 because of Hall's leadership role and his attempt to obstruct\n\njustice by trying to convince Redihan not to testify against him.\n\nWhen combined with a criminal history category of I, Hall's offense\n\nlevel yielded a sentencing range of 151 to 188 months. The court\n\nsentenced Hall to 151 months' imprisonment.\n\n                          1.     Drug Quantity\n\n           The government bears the burden of proving drug quantity\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence.            See United States v. Sklar,\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f920 F.2d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 1990). In determining the drug quantity\n\ninvolved in an offense, the district court \"may choose between\n\nplausible estimates of drug quantity but must err on the side of\n\ncaution.\"    United States v. Marks, 365 F.3d 101, 105 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   We review the district court's drug quantity calculation\n\nfor clear error. See id.\n\n            The court estimated the drug quantity involved in the\n\nconspiracy by determining the total profit that Hall earned from\n\nhis drug activities and the profit that Hall made per pound.     By\n\ndividing the total profit by the profit per pound, the court\n\ndetermined that the conspiracy involved between 700 and 1000\n\nkilograms of marijuana.    We have previously approved this method\n\nfor ascertaining drug quantity.    See United States v. Gerante, 891\n\nF.2d 364, 369 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n            Nevertheless, Hall contends that the district court's\n\nquantity estimation was clearly erroneous because the court relied\n\non unreliable evidence in determining Hall's drug profits.       We\n\ndisagree.    The court determined that Hall's overall drug profits\n\ntotaled $519,000, which was consistent with evidence showing that\n\nHall's unreported taxable income was $518,929.       The court also\n\ndetermined that Hall's profit per pound was approximately $300. It\n\nbased this determination, in part, on Hall's own statement during\n\nthe sentencing hearing that he earned between $200 and $400 profit\n\nper pound of marijuana.    This evidence provided a reasonable basis\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\ffor the court to set the variables which it used to calculate the\n\ndrug quantity.\n\n                       2. Obstruction of Justice Enhancement\n\n           Section 3C1.1 of the Guidelines mandates a two-level\n\nenhancement where the defendant \"willfully . . . attempted to\n\nobstruct or impede the administration of justice during the course\n\nof the . . . prosecution.\"   One recognized way in which a defendant\n\ncan obstruct justice is by threatening, intimidating or coercing a\n\nwitness.   See U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 cmt. 4.    The district court found\n\nthat Hall obstructed justice by trying to coerce Redihan not to\n\ntestify against him.\n\n           Hall contends that the district court erred in applying\n\nthe enhancement because it did not make a particularized finding as\n\nto whether Hall had a specific intent to obstruct justice.       We\n\nrecently declined to decide whether there must be a particularized\n\nfinding that the defendant had a specific intent to obstruct\n\njustice to impose a § 3C1.1 enhancement.      See United States v.\n\nFournier, 361 F.3d 42, 43 (1st Cir. 2004) (per curiam).    We again\n\ndecline to decide this question because the evidence clearly\n\nsupports the district court's ultimate finding that Hall attempted\n\nto obstruct justice.   See id.\n\n           The record demonstrates that Hall told Redihan \"not to\n\nsay   anything, and that [Hall] would never say anything about\n\n[Redihan].\" The district court reasonably concluded that Hall was\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\ftrying to silence Redihan by promising him that he would not\n\ndisclose Redihan's criminal conduct if Redihan refused to testify\n\nagainst him.   Hall argues that he merely meant to advise Redihan of\n\nhis right to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\n\nincrimination.   But, absent a showing of clear error, the meaning\n\nof Hall's comment is for the district court to decide.         See United\n\nStates v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 228 (1st Cir. 1991).       The district\n\ncourt's interpretation of Hall's conduct was not clearly erroneous\n\nin these circumstances.10\n\n                         3.     Acceptance of Responsibility\n\n           Hall's challenge to the district court's denial of a\n\ndownward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is entirely\n\nwithout merit.   See U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.       Under most circumstances, a\n\ndefendant who goes to trial is not entitled to acceptance of\n\nresponsibility credit.    See United States v. Mikutowicz, 365 F.3d\n\n65, 76 (1st Cir. 2004).       Moreover, acceptance of responsibility is\n\nnot generally available to a defendant whose sentence has been\n\nenhanced for obstructing justice.          See Fournier, 361 F.3d at 44.\n\nHall went to trial and attempted to obstruct justice in the\n\nprocess.   On these facts, the district was not clearly wrong to\n\n\n     10\n       Hall also challenges the district court's measure of the\namount of funds laundered for purposes of calculating the offense\nlevel for the money laundering counts.      Because Hall does not\ndispute that the drug conspiracy governs for purposes of\ndetermining Hall's punishment under the Guidelines, this challenge\nis moot. See United States v. Cruz, 156 F.3d 22, 29-30 (1st Cir.\n1998).\n\n                                    -33-\n\fconclude that Hall failed to accept responsibility for his crimes.\n\n                     4. Mandatory Guidelines\n\n             Finally, by way of supplemental briefing, Hall argues\n\nthat   the   district      court   erred    by   viewing    the    Guidelines    as\n\nmandatory in determining his sentence.                    See United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).                He does not dispute\n\nthat he failed to raise this argument below, and we therefore apply\n\nthe plain error standard. See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399\n\nF.3d 68, 76-77 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             Under   our    post-Booker      plain   error       cases,   we   will\n\nordinarily remand for resentencing if the defendant demonstrates\n\n\"either by [evidence] in the existing record or by plausible\n\nproffer [that] there is a reasonable indication that the district\n\n[court] might well have reached a different result under advisory\n\nguidelines.\"     United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).     The record discloses the district court’s unease with\n\nthe    degree   of   speculation      involved       in    the    drug    quantity\n\ncalculation, as well as the court’s recognition of Hall’s difficult\n\nchildhood and later good works.            Without forecasting whether these\n\nconsiderations would justify a more favorable sentence, we are\n\npersuaded by the record that the district court at least might be\n\ninclined to impose such a sentence on remand.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n             For the reasons set forth, we affirm all counts of\n\n\n                                      -34-\n\fconviction and the forfeiture orders but vacate Hall's sentence and\n\nremand for resentencing.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -35-\n\f",

The government also brought two forfeiture counts to obtain assets related to Hall's illegal conduct, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853; 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982. After a ten-day jury trial, Hall was convicted on all counts. He was sentenced to 151 months of imprisonment on the conspiracy and money laundering convictions, to be served concurrently with 60 months of imprisonment on each of the tax evasion convictions. He also was ordered to forfeit his illegally obtained assets. On appeal, Hall claims that there was insufficient evidence of a drug conspiracy or money laundering and alleges a host of trial and sentencing errors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review Hall's sufficiency of the evidence claims <i>de novo, see United States v. Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 404 F.3d 470, 480 (1st Cir.2005), and apply the following standard:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must determine whether the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the government&#8212;a perspective that requires us to draw every reasonable inference and resolve credibility conflicts in a manner consistent with the verdict&#8212;would permit a rational trier of fact to find each element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The government can meet this burden by either direct or circumstantial evidence, or by any combination of the two. Moreover, the government need not disprove every hypothesis consistent with the defendant's innocence; rather, it is enough that a rational jury could look objectively at the proof and supportably conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's guilt has been established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

It is enough to say that Hall understates the strength of the government's evidence. There was proof that from 1995 to 1999 Hall bought large amounts of marijuana from an individual named John Redihan. Redihan testified that he was aware that Hall's purpose was to resell the drugs for profit and that, on occasion, he assisted Hall in these efforts. <i>See United States v. Berrios,</i> 132 F.3d 834, 841-42 (1st Cir.1998) (concluding that there was sufficient proof of a distribution conspiracy where seller knew that buyer was purchasing drugs for the purpose of selling it to others and intended to facilitate the resales). Moreover, Hall enlisted several other individuals to help him in the storage, preparation, and selling of the drugs. For example, an individual named William Lee sold marijuana for Hall, and a married couple, George and Brenda Elliot, assisted Hall by letting him store drugs in their home, helping him weigh the drugs, picking up marijuana deliveries from Redihan, and participating in Hall's debt collection efforts. This evidence sufficiently established Hall's participation in a conspiracy to distribute marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Money Laundering</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government charged Hall with 163 counts of concealment money laundering under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) for his use of the drug conspiracy proceeds. To sustain a conviction under &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), the government must prove: (1) that Hall knowingly conducted a financial transaction, (2) that he knew that the transaction involved funds that were proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, (3) that the funds were proceeds of a specified unlawful activity, and (4) that Hall engaged in the financial transaction knowing that it was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of such unlawful activity. <i>See United States v. Cornier-Ortiz,</i> 361 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir.2004). Hall's sufficiency claims relate primarily to the government's proof on the \"conceal or disguise\" element. He asserts that all of the financial transactions were conducted above board and were thus not meant to conceal or disguise anything. In essence, Hall's argument is that the government proved only that he spent or invested drug money and that this evidence is inadequate to sustain a conviction under &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the money laundering statute does not criminalize the mere spending or investing of illegally obtained assets. <i>See United States v. Corchado-Peralta,</i> 318 F.3d 255, 259 (1st Cir.2003). Instead, at least one purpose for the expenditure must be to conceal or disguise the assets. <i>See id.</i> Proof of this element may be based on direct evidence, such as the defendant's own statements; or circumstantial evidence, like the use of a third-party to disguise the transaction; or unusual secrecy in making the transaction. <i>See Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 404 F.3d at 483.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case the government charged a series of financial transactions as separate counts. <i>See United States v. Marshall,</i> 248 F.3d 525, 540 (6th Cir.2001). We must therefore examine the government's proof on each count to determine its sufficiency. <i>See United States v. Shepard,</i> 396 F.3d 1116, 1121 (10th Cir.2005). The 163 counts essentially involve loans to friends and colleagues and related transactions, purchases of cars and other vehicles, expenditures to renovate property, and establishing a construction business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Loans and Related Transactions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. Cosby/Brown Loans (Counts 2-97)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Hall offered to loan $30,000 to Danny Cosby and his girlfriend, Susan Brown, to buy a parcel of land. Cosby and Brown accepted Hall's offer and, after executing a mortgage to secure the loan, Hall gave them the loan proceeds in cash. In 1996, Cosby and Brown borrowed another $25,000, which Hall also paid out in cash. Over the next several years, Hall negotiated 96 repayment checks from Cosby and Brown, including a $33,000 check to pay off the remainder of the loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Cosby and Brown asked Hall where he got the money for the loans, he told them that he got most of it from an inheritance from his father. But there was evidence that Hall's father had intentionally omitted him from his will and that Hall did not receive anything from his father's estate. There also was testimony that, in regard to a loan to another person, Hall stated that the reason he wanted to loan money was to \"get some of his money more legal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government charged each negotiation of a loan repayment check as a separate money laundering count. Hall claims that there \"was nothing suspicious about the loan\" repayments because he made no attempt to conceal his identity when dealing with Cosby and Brown in making the loans or negotiating the repayments. This argument misconstrues the purpose of &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i). The statute criminalizes conduct designed to conceal or disguise the source of the drug proceeds even if the defendant does not conceal his own identity in the process. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Norman,</i> 143 F.3d 375, 377-78 (8th Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Starke,</i> 62 F.3d 1374, 1384 (11th Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Kinzler,</i> 55 F.3d 70, 73 (2d Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Lovett,</i> 964 F.2d 1029, 1034 n. 3 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Hall arranged the loans himself and negotiated the checks in his own name, there was evidence that one purpose for the loans was to disguise the illegal origin of the loan funds. Hall admitted as much when he claimed to another individual that he wanted to loan money to \"get some of his money more legal.\" Hall made this comment regarding a different loan, but the jury could infer that the same motivation applied to other similar loans which Hall made while running his marijuana trafficking operation. Additionally, Hall intentionally misled the borrowers about the source of the proceeds by telling them that he obtained the money from a family inheritance. Such a misstatement is probative of concealment. <i>See United States v. Tekle,</i> 329 F.3d 1108, 1114 (9th Cir.2003) (affirming money laundering conviction based on evidence that defendant lied about the origin of funds that he used to purchase a home); <i>United States v. Wilson,</i> 77 F.3d 105, 109 (5th Cir.1996) (affirming money laundering conviction where defendant said that money was from an inheritance to \"cover\" for the cash purchase). This evidence is sufficient to sustain the convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. Moving Funds to an E*Trade Account (Count 98)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned above, Cosby and Brown provided Hall with a $33,000 check to pay off their debt. After receiving the check, Hall placed these funds in his bank account for a few days before moving them to an E*Trade investment account. The government charged the moving of the funds as money laundering. Hall claims that \"there was absolutely nothing about the transaction that suggested concealment or an intent to conceal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that there is nothing about the transfer of money from Hall's bank account to his E*Trade account that, standing alone, necessarily suggests an intent to conceal. But the transfer cannot be viewed in isolation. It was part of the series of transactions that began with the loans to Cosby and Brown. \"A design to conceal on a particular transaction may be imputed to a subsequent transaction if the subsequent transaction, while innocent on its face, is part of a larger money laundering scheme.\" <i>United States v. Burns,</i> 162 F.3d 840, 848-49 (5th Cir.1998) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). This is so because a \"launderer can never be sure that he has run the money through enough laundering cycles to make it clean enough so that the government can't find the stains.\" B. Williams &amp; F. Whitney, <i>Federal Money Laundering: Crimes and Forfeitures</i> &#167; 5.1.6.4 (1999). Given the proof that the original loans to Cosby and Brown were motivated by Hall's desire to conceal the source of the funds, the jury could infer that Hall's continued shuffling of the money through accounts was an attempt to further separate the money from its illegal source. <i>See Burns,</i> 162 F.3d at 848-49 (affirming money laundering conviction based on bank deposit which when viewed in isolation was innocent, but when viewed in context was part of a scheme to launder funds).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii. Recording a Mortgage (Count 161)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As security for a loan that Hall made to Felicity Hyde (Count 160), Hall recorded a mortgage on property that Hyde owned. The government charged the recording of the mortgage as a separate count of money laundering. Hall contends that the recording of the mortgage does not constitute money laundering because it is not a \"financial transaction\" as defined under the money laundering statute. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(3)(c)(4). This argument was not raised below, and therefore our review is for plain error. <i>See United States v. Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold for relief under the plain error standard, Hall must show that the district court committed a clear and obvious error by not dismissing this count on the ground that recording the mortgage was not a financial transaction. <i>See United States v. Marino,</i> 277 F.3d 11, 32 (1st Cir.2002). The money laundering statute defines a financial transaction as a transaction which \"in any way or degree affects interstate commerce\" and, among other things \"involves the transfer of title to any real property.\" This definition is construed broadly. <i>Federal Money Laundering, supra</i> &#167; 2.3 (citing S. Rep. 99-433 at 13 (1986)). A mortgage is \"a <i>conveyance</i> of <i>title</i> to property that is given as security for the payment of a debt . . . that will become void upon payment. . . according to the stipulated terms.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 1031 (8th ed.1999) (emphasis supplied). The recording of the mortgage thus memorialized and made efficacious \"transfer of title to any real property,\" and would seem to constitute a \"financial transaction.\" In any event, we are aware of no caselaw to the contrary, and therefore the district court's error, if any, was not clear or obvious. <i>See Patel,</i> 370 F.3d at 118.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Vehicle Purchases</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. Pickup Truck (Count 99)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1997, Hall purchased a used one-ton pickup truck. Hall found an advertisement for the truck in a local magazine and called the owner, Mark Stevens, to inquire about it. After a few contacts, Hall and Stevens agreed on a $12,000 purchase price. Hall asked that Stevens deliver the truck to his house. Although Stevens found that request peculiar, he complied and upon delivering the truck received from Hall $12,000 in cash in the form of wrapped packages of $20 bills. Hall contends that this evidence does not suggest an effort by him to conceal the funds used for the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The conversion of cash into goods or services as a way of concealing or disguising [a] wellspring of . . . cash is a central concern of the money laundering statute.\" <i>United States v. Jackson,</i> 935 F.2d 832, 841 (7th Cir.1991). \"Because cash is a frequent by-product of many kinds of illegal activity, converting . . . cash into useable funds is probative of money laundering. Thus, spending large amounts of cash to buy cars. . . may suggest an intent to conceal.\" <i>Federal Money Laundering supra</i> at &#167; 5.16.11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury heard evidence that Hall paid for the truck with wrapped packages of small bills. Hall's use of small bills made it more difficult for anyone to trace the truck payment. <i>See United States v. Misher,</i> 99 F.3d 664, 668-69 (5th Cir.1996) (concluding that proof that drug dealer purchased pickup truck with $10 and $20 bills was sufficient for the jury to conclude that a purpose of the purchase was to conceal the source of the funds); <i>United States v. Heater,</i> 63 F.3d 311, 319 (4th Cir.1995) (concluding that proof that defendant made several large purchases using small bills which exceeded his lawful income was sufficient to sustain money laundering conviction). Additionally, as we will discuss below, the government introduced evidence of other vehicle purchases for which there was additional proof that Hall made the purchases to conceal his drug income. The jury could have relied on this evidence to conclude that the pickup truck purchase was part of a single pattern of concealment. Taken in total, this evidence suffices to sustain the conviction on count 99.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. 1988 Ford Dump Truck (Counts 100-01)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1997, Hall provided his sister, Andrea Read, with $16,000 cash to purchase a money order in her name payable to O'Connor GMC. Hall used the money order along with an additional $500 in cash to purchase a dump truck. Hall's use of his sister's name in purchasing the money order is evidence of his intent to conceal because it indicates that he was attempting to disguise the source of the proceeds by having it pass through another person's control. <i>See United States v. Willey,</i> 57 F.3d 1374, 1385 (5th Cir.1995) (stating that \"using a third party, for example, . . . a relative, to purchase goods on one's behalf . . . usually constitutes sufficient proof of a design to conceal\"). Moreover, Redihan testified that Hall told him that he had set up a fictitious \"inheritance account\" in which the money \"was cleaned\" and used to purchase construction equipment such as a dump truck. Thus, the jury could have found that this purchase was part of the money laundering scheme.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii. 1932 Ford Coupe (Count 102)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1997, Hall purchased a restored 1932 Ford Coupe from Terrence Blair for $24,000. When Blair delivered the car to Hall, Hall gave him a paper bag filled with cash. At Hall's request, Blair wrote the bill of sale for only $5,000. In addition to the use of cash to make the purchase, Hall's request for a false bill of sale suggests concealment because it permitted Hall to include an additional $19,000 in the purchase price that could not easily be traced. <i>See Wilson,</i> 77 F.3d at 109 (affirming money laundering conviction where defendant asked seller of car to say that he sold the car to him for half of the actual purchase price).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Renovations and Fire Island Construction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. Renovations to Hall's Real Estate Holdings (Counts 162-163)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997 and 1998, Hall paid almost $100,000 for supplies and labor to renovate property that he owned in Camden and Northport, Maine. Hall argues that he organized the work himself and therefore there was no effort on his part to conceal or disguise the drug funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, as discussed above, the issue is not whether Hall hid his identity in performing these renovations but rather whether one purpose of the transaction was to conceal or disguise drug proceeds. <i>See supra</i> at 6-7. The government presented evidence that Hall paid for the labor and materials using mostly cash and that he did not keep records of the labor costs. The evidence also established that Hall spent far in excess of his declared income to make these renovations. <i>See United States v. Webster,</i> 960 F.2d 1301, 1308 (5th Cir.1992) (holding that \"a differential between [a drug dealer's] legitimate income and cash flow is sufficient for a money laundering conviction\"). A jury could conclude that Hall's expenditures of large amounts of cash, far in excess of his reported income, coupled with his non-existent bookkeeping practices demonstrated that he renovated the properties as a way to disguise illegally obtained cash by converting the money into expensive real estate holdings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii. Transferring Assets to Fire Island Construction (Count 164)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final count of money laundering charged Hall with transferring over $80,000 in assets to a construction company that he established called Fire Island Construction. Hall again claims that the government failed to prove the concealment element of the offense. Hall's objection to this count fails on the basis of his statements to others. <i>See Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 404 F.3d at 483. There was testimony that Hall said that he established Fire Island Construction \"to make him look legitimate\" and that he transferred construction equipment to Fire Island as part of a scheme to \"clean up some [of the] money.\" The jury could infer from this testimony that Hall's creation of Fire Island Construction and the subsequent transfer of property to the company was at least partially motivated by his desire to disguise the source of his drug proceeds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>TRIAL-ERROR CLAIMS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Brady Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall claims that the government committed a <i>Brady</i> violation by withholding information concerning the extent of Redihan's prior criminal history. <i>See Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) (holding that prosecution violates defendant's due process rights by withholding evidence from defense that is material to either guilt or punishment); <i>Giglio v. United States,</i> 405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) (applying <i>Brady</i> to impeachment evidence). Before trial, the government disclosed Redihan's prior convictions, including a 1998 drug conviction in Rhode Island. As part of the disclosure, the government told defense counsel that the Rhode Island conviction involved the sale of Percodan and steroids, but after trial, it was discovered, through the preparation of Hall's presentence report, that the conviction also involved allegations of marijuana distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall asserts that this omission prejudiced his defense. One of Hall's defenses was that, while he sold small amounts of marijuana, he was not involved in the large-scale trafficking charged in the indictment. Hall argues that evidence concerning the nature of Redihan's Rhode Island conviction was important because it would have shown that Redihan lied when he testified that Hall was his major customer during the period of the charged conspiracy. He posits that, if he could have shown that Redihan was supplying drugs to many people, the jury would have been less likely to believe that Redihan was selling him such large quantities of marijuana. The government counters that there was no <i>Brady</i> violation because it was unaware of the marijuana aspects of the Rhode Island conviction until after the trial, and in any event the unavailability of this information was not prejudicial to Hall's defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall's <i>Brady</i> argument fails because there is no evidence that, prior to the conclusion of the trial, the government had information concerning the marijuana aspect of Redihan's Rhode Island conviction. The information that Redihan's Rhode Island conviction concerned marijuana trafficking came from a police report which the government states that it learned about only after the probation department discovered it during Hall's presentence investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's obligations under <i>Brady</i> only extend to information in its possession, custody, or control. <i>See United States v. Josleyn,</i> 206 F.3d 144, 153-54 (1st Cir.2000). Nevertheless, Hall contends that the government had a duty to learn and disclose the details of Redihan's Rhode Island convictions and not just the fact of the conviction. While a prosecutor must disclose information maintained by government agents even if the prosecutor herself does not possess the information, <i>see Strickler v. Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999), this duty does not extend to information possessed by government agents not working with the prosecution, <i>see United States v. Bender,</i> 304 F.3d 161, 164 (1st Cir.2002). The information concerning the details of Redihan's conviction was maintained by the Rhode Island state courts, and there is no evidence that the federal prosecutor or any agent working on her behalf had this information prior to or during trial. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even assuming the government had to disclose the details of Redihan's Rhode Island conviction, Hall has not shown sufficient prejudice to warrant relief. <i>Brady</i> prejudice exists where \"there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict.\" <i>Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936. Hall elicited from Redihan, on cross-examination, that he was a convicted drug dealer and that he had distributed drugs in Rhode Island. Additional detail about the Rhode Island conviction would have been mostly cumulative. <i>See Lavallee v. Coplan,</i> 374 F.3d 41, 46 (1st Cir.2004). There also was substantial evidence of Hall's participation in a drug conspiracy aside from Redihan's testimony. Several other members of the conspiracy testified about Hall's criminal conduct. In sum, we are persuaded the disputed information, if known to Hall, would not have affected the trial's outcome. <i>See United States v. Schneiderhan,</i> 404 F.3d 73, 79 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Redihan's Plea Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall next challenges the admission of Redihan's plea agreement for conspiring with Hall to distribute drugs. While Hall's brief is not explicit, he appears to object to the admission of the plea agreement because the agreement was conditioned on Redihan's truthful testimony at Hall's trial. According to Hall, admitting the agreement had the effect of bolstering Redihan's credibility in the jury's eyes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously concluded that \"informing the jury of the contents of a plea agreement of, at least, normal stripe,\" is permissible. <i>See United States v. Martin,</i> 815 F.2d 818, 821 (1st Cir.1987). Hall has not presented any claim that Redihan's plea agreement was atypical or outside the rule stated in <i>Martin.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall also claims that the district court did not provide an appropriate cautionary instruction concerning the jury's consideration of the plea agreement. We disagree. The court instructed the jury that \"[s]ome people [testifying pursuant to a plea agreement] are entirely truthful when testifying. Still, you should consider the testimony of these individuals with particular caution. They may have had reason to make up stories or exaggerate what others did because they wanted to help themselves.\" Hall did not object to this instruction or propose other language, and the instruction was not clearly erroneous as given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Money Laundering Jury Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next challenge concerns the jury instruction on the concealment element of money laundering. The district court instructed that the concealment element was satisfied if the jury concluded that \"Hall knew that the transaction in question was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of the marijuana trafficking.\" Hall objected to this instruction on the ground that the instruction did not sufficiently convey that he had to intend specifically to conceal the drug proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review challenges to the wording of a jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Tom,</i> 330 F.3d 83, 91 (1st Cir.2003). The court's instruction closely tracked the language of the statute, which is a strong indicator that the charge passes muster. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Rosa,</i> 705 F.2d 1375, 1381 (1st Cir.1983). In any event, the instruction clearly conveyed that Hall had to intend the transactions to conceal drug proceeds by requiring such a design on Hall's part. The instructions were thus adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Agent Giguere's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Near the close of its case, the government called Internal Revenue Service Agent Rodney Giguere to testify concerning his investigation of Hall's finances. Relying on our recent decisions in <i>United States v. Garc&#237;a-Morales,</i> 382 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir.2004) and <i>United States v. Casas,</i> 356 F.3d 104, 119-120 (1st Cir.2004), Hall challenges Giguere's testimony as improper overview testimony. He also suggests Giguere provided prejudicial summary testimony. Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See United</i> <i>States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall's reliance on <i>Garc&#237;a-Morales</i> and <i>Casas</i> is misplaced. In both cases, we were addressing the problem of the prosecution beginning its case-in-chief by calling a government agent to provide an overview of its case. We criticized that practice because \"such testimony raises the very real specter that the jury verdict could be influenced by statements of fact or credibility assessments in the overview but not in evidence.\" <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 119.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Giguere did not testify until near the end of the government's case-in-chief. Most of his testimony concerned his description of his investigation into Hall's activities. This testimony was appropriate because it was based on Giguere's personal knowledge. <i>See Garc&#237;a-Morales,</i> 382 F.3d at 16. On a couple of occasions, Giguere testified to hearsay statements made to him during the investigation. But Hall did not object to Giguere's answers, and the testimony was hardly prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Giguere provided summary testimony, it concerned the travel of Hall's funds in and out of various accounts and was based on testimony and documents in evidence. This sort of testimony is permissible to summarize complex aspects of a case such as the financial dealings of a defendant. <i>See Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 120 n. 4. Furthermore, the court cautioned the jury that it should rely on its own memory of the facts and not the summary provided by Giguere. We discern no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall alleges that the government violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by threatening certain witnesses with severe consequences if they did not testify on the government's behalf. Specifically, one witness, Andrea Read, testified that government agents told her that she would face prosecution if she did not tell them \"what they wanted to hear,\" and a second witness, Steven Hiscock, testified that a government agent told him that, if he did not cooperate, the government \"would take his home.\" Both witnesses testified on behalf of the government and were examined about the nature of the threats and the effect, if any, these threats had on their testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that a due process violation can occur where the government intimidates or harasses potential defense witnesses to discourage them from testifying. <i>See United States v. Angiulo,</i> 897 F.2d 1169, 1192 (1st Cir.1990). Hall has cited a series of cases in which appellate courts have overturned convictions where the prosecution coerced a potential witness not to testify on behalf of the defendant. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Morrison,</i> 535 F.2d 223, 226 (3d Cir.1976); <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 478 F.2d 976, 978-79 (D.C.Cir.1973). These case are distinguishable because, here, the challenged conduct was intended to <i>encourage</i> witnesses to testify. <i>Angiulo</i> and the cases cited by Hall recognize a constitutional problem when the defendant is precluded from putting on the defense of his choice because the government threatens a person into not testifying. <i>See also Webb v. Texas,</i> 409 U.S. 95, 98, 93 S.Ct. 351, 34 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972) (per curiam) (stating that threatening comments by a judge that \"effectively drove the witness off the stand\" violated the defendant's constitutional right to present his defense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall does not claim that he was deprived of testimony but rather that Read and Hiscock may have testified falsely because of the government's alleged threats. The problem is a complicated one because in many cases the government has to press unwilling witnesses, out of fear or friendship, to provide testimony that they are reluctant to give. There is no blanket rule against inducements by the government to witnesses to produce truthful testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume that, in extreme circumstances, government misconduct, could occur through improper efforts to shape testimony to the government's liking. In this instance, however, there was conflicting testimony as to whether the government actually threatened Read or Hiscock and defense counsel was allowed to cross-examine on the issue, leaving it to the jury to evaluate witness credibility in light of the evidence concerning the alleged threats. We do not find a constitutional violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall also asserts that his constitutional rights were violated by the government convincing his wife, Jill Hall, to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and to decline to testify on his behalf during sentencing. Before Ms. Hall testified, the government informed the court that Ms. Hall was a target of an investigation for conduct related to the crimes for which her husband had been convicted. In response to the government's representation, the court summoned Ms. Hall's lawyer to discuss with her the possible consequences of her testimony. After Ms. Hall and her lawyer consulted, she decided to invoke her privilege not to testify, and the court upheld her invocation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these facts, the government did not substantially interfere with Hall's ability to call his wife as a witness. The court found that Ms. Hall properly invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege. There is no evidence that the government acted in bad faith by notifying the court that Ms. Hall was the target of an investigation. Moreover, the court handled the matter appropriately by alerting Ms. Hall to the possible consequences of testifying and assuring that an attorney was present to counsel Ms. Hall on her decision of whether to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege. <i>See United States v. Serrano,</i> 406 F.3d 1208, 1216 (10th Cir.2005) (rejecting claim of government interference with witness on similar facts).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FORFEITURE AND SENTENCING ERROR CLAIMS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Forfeiture</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After finding Hall guilty on all counts, the jury returned forfeiture findings concerning Hall's drug trafficking and money laundering activities. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853 (forfeiture for drug trafficking); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982 (forfeiture for money laundering). After the jury returned these findings, the court entered a forfeiture order pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2. In regard to the drug trafficking forfeiture, the court imposed a money judgment in the amount of $511,321.22 and ordered the forfeiture of specific items of personal and real property which the jury found were connected Hall's drug activities. The money laundering forfeiture order commanded Hall to turn over specific items of property (in accord with the jury's findings) but did not impose an additional money judgment. Both orders permitted the government to seize \"substitute property\" under certain circumstances to satisfy the forfeiture amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall's first challenge concerns the district court's entry of a money judgment as part of the drug trafficking forfeiture. A money judgment permits the government to collect on the forfeiture order in the same way that a successful plaintiff collects a money judgment from a civil defendant. Thus, even if a defendant does not have sufficient funds to cover the forfeiture at the time of the conviction, the government may seize future assets to satisfy the order. Relying on <i>United States v. Croce,</i> 334 F.Supp.2d 781 (E.D.Pa.2004), Hall argues that a court may not issue a money judgment as part of a forfeiture order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Croce</i> is at odds with the law of this circuit. In <i>Candelaria-Silva,</i> 166 F.3d at 42, we ruled that a \"criminal forfeiture may take several forms [including] an in personam judgment against the defendant for the amount of money the defendant obtained as proceeds of the offense.\" This position accords with the several appellate decisions that have addressed the question. <i>See United States v. Huber,</i> 404 F.3d 1047, 1056 (8th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Baker,</i> 227 F.3d 955, 970 (7th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Lester,</i> 85 F.3d 1409, 1413 (9th Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Robilotto,</i> 828 F.2d 940, 948-49 (2d Cir.1987); <i>United States v. Ginsburg,</i> 773 F.2d 798, 801-03 (7th Cir.1985) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two primary reasons for permitting money judgments as part of criminal forfeiture orders. First, criminal forfeiture is a sanction against the individual defendant rather than a judgment against the property itself. <i>See United States v. Nava,</i> 404 F.3d 1119, 1124 (9th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Cunan,</i> 156 F.3d 110, 116 n. 7 (1st Cir.1998). Because the sanction \"follows the defendant as a part of the penalty,\" the government need not prove that the defendant actually has the forfeited proceeds in his possession at the time of conviction. <i>Robilotto,</i> 828 F.2d at 948-49. Second, permitting a money judgment, as part of a forfeiture order, prevents a drug dealer from ridding himself of his ill-gotten gains to avoid the forfeiture sanction. In rejecting an argument against the use of money judgments pursuant to the RICO forfeiture statute, the Seventh Circuit explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What the defendant's argument overlooks is the fact that a racketeer who dissipates profits or proceeds of his racketeering activity on wine, women, and song has profited from organized crime to the same extent as if he had put the money in his bank account. Every dollar that the racketeer derives from illicit activities and then spends on such items as food, entertainment, college tuition, and charity, is a dollar that should not have been available for him to spend for those purposes. In order to truly separate the racketeer from his dishonest gains, therefore, the statute requires him to forfeit to the United States the total amount of the proceeds of his racketeering activity, regardless of whether the specific dollars received from that activity are still in his possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ginsburg,</i> 773 F.2d at 802. The policy rationale for permitting a money judgment as part of a forfeiture in a racketeering case applies equally to a forfeiture in a drug case. <i>See Nava,</i> 404 F.3d at 1124 n. 1 (stating that RICO forfeiture cases are useful in interpreting the drug forfeiture statute because the statutes are \"substantially identical\"). The district court did not err in entering a money judgment as part of the drug trafficking forfeiture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall next contends that the forfeiture orders wrongly permit the government to seize substitute property. He argues that the power to forfeit substitute property rests exclusively with the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(e) provides the procedure for the forfeiture of substitute property. It states: \"On the government's motion, the court may at anytime enter an order of forfeiture or amend an existing order of forfeiture to include property . . .\" that is substitute property under an applicable statute. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(e)(1). The forfeiture orders in this case state that the government may \"forfeit\" substitute property. It is not clear whether this means that the government may move for forfeiture or may seize the substitute property without any action by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government acknowledges that only the court can order the forfeiture of substitute property. In light of this acknowledgment and the plain language of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e)(1), we interpret the forfeiture orders in this case to permit the government to <i>move</i> for substitute property but to reserve for the court the authority to order the property forfeited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall raises several challenges to his sentence. He claims that the district court clearly erred in its drug quantity calculation and in its application of the obstruction of justice enhancement. He also claims that the court should have awarded him a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Finally, he claims that he is entitled to re-sentencing because the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding Hall's sentence, the district court applied the grouping rules under the Sentencing Guidelines. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. 3D1.2. The application of these rules led the court to determine that Hall's period of incarceration would be based on his conviction for the drug trafficking conspiracy because it resulted in the highest offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To calculate the offense level for the conspiracy conviction, the court concluded that the conspiracy involved between 700 and 1000 kilograms of marijuana, which led to an offense level of 30. The court then increased the offense level to 34 because of Hall's leadership role and his attempt to obstruct justice by trying to convince Redihan not to testify against him. When combined with a criminal history category of I, Hall's offense level yielded a sentencing range of 151 to 188 months. The court sentenced Hall to 151 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Drug Quantity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government bears the burden of proving drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See United States v. Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d 107, 112 (1st Cir.1990). In determining the drug quantity involved in an offense, the district court \"may choose between plausible estimates of drug quantity but must err on the side of caution.\" <i>United States v. Marks,</i> 365 F.3d 101, 105 (1st Cir.2004). We review the district court's drug quantity calculation for clear error. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court estimated the drug quantity involved in the conspiracy by determining the total profit that Hall earned from his drug activities and the profit that Hall made per pound. By dividing the total profit by the profit per pound, the court determined that the conspiracy involved between 700 and 1000 kilograms of marijuana. We have previously approved this method for ascertaining drug quantity. <i>See United States v. Gerante,</i> 891 F.2d 364, 369 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Hall contends that the district court's quantity estimation was clearly erroneous because the court relied on unreliable evidence in determining Hall's drug profits. We disagree. The court determined that Hall's overall drug profits totaled $519,000, which was consistent with evidence showing that Hall's unreported taxable income was $518,929. The court also determined that Hall's profit per pound was approximately $300. It based this determination, in part, on Hall's own statement during the sentencing hearing that he earned between $200 and $400 profit per pound of marijuana. This evidence provided a reasonable basis for the court to set the variables which it used to calculate the drug quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Obstruction of Justice Enhancement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3C1.1 of the Guidelines mandates a two-level enhancement where the defendant \"willfully ... attempted to obstruct or impede the administration of justice during the course of the ... prosecution.\" One recognized way in which a defendant can obstruct justice is by threatening, intimidating or coercing a witness. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 cmt. 4. The district court found that Hall obstructed justice by trying to coerce Redihan not to testify against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall contends that the district court erred in applying the enhancement because it did not make a particularized finding as to whether Hall had a specific intent to obstruct justice. We recently declined to decide whether there must be a particularized finding that the defendant had a specific intent to obstruct justice to impose a &#167; 3C1.1 enhancement. <i>See United States v. Fournier,</i> 361 F.3d 42, 43 (1st Cir.2004) (per curiam). We again decline to decide this question because the evidence clearly supports the district court's ultimate finding that Hall attempted to obstruct justice. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record demonstrates that Hall told Redihan \"not to say anything, and that [Hall] would never say anything about [Redihan].\" The district court reasonably concluded that Hall was trying to silence Redihan by promising him that he would not disclose Redihan's criminal conduct if Redihan refused to testify against him. Hall argues that he merely meant to advise Redihan of his right to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. But, absent a showing of clear error, the meaning of Hall's comment is for the district court to decide. <i>See United States v. Akitoye,</i> 923 F.2d 221, 228 (1st Cir.1991). The district court's interpretation of Hall's conduct was not clearly erroneous in these circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall's challenge to the district court's denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is entirely without merit. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1. Under most circumstances, a defendant who goes to trial is not entitled to acceptance of responsibility credit. <i>See United States v. Mikutowicz,</i> 365 F.3d 65, 76 (1st Cir.2004). Moreover, acceptance of responsibility is not generally available to a defendant whose sentence has been enhanced for obstructing justice. <i>See Fournier,</i> 361 F.3d at 44. Hall went to trial and attempted to obstruct justice in the process. On these facts, the district was not clearly wrong to conclude that Hall failed to accept responsibility for his crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Mandatory Guidelines</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, by way of supplemental briefing, Hall argues that the district court erred by viewing the Guidelines as mandatory in determining his sentence. <i>See United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He does not dispute that he failed to raise this argument below, and we therefore apply the plain error standard. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76-77 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under our post-<i>Booker</i> plain error cases, we will ordinarily remand for resentencing if the defendant demonstrates \"either by [evidence] in the existing record or by plausible proffer [that] there is a reasonable indication that the district [court] might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005). The record discloses the district court's unease with the degree of speculation involved in the drug quantity calculation, as well as the court's recognition of Hall's difficult childhood and later good works. Without forecasting whether these considerations would justify a more favorable sentence, we are persuaded by the record that the district court at least might be inclined to impose such a sentence on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth, we <i>affirm</i> all counts of conviction and the forfeiture orders but <i>vacate</i> Hall's sentence and <i>remand</i> for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Counts 119-121, 125-150, 155-157 and 160 also concern loan repayments Hall received and Hall's subsequent distribution of the loan proceeds. For each count, there was evidence similar to the proof presented for counts 2-98. Hall has not provided additional grounds for overturning these convictions. We therefore affirm these convictions for substantially the same reasons that we affirm the convictions for counts 2-98</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Redihan's testimony is also sufficient to affirm the convictions on counts 103-118 and 122-124 which relate to Hall's purchase of other pieces of construction equipment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> There was evidence that Hall requested false bills of sale for his purchases of a 1970 Volkswagon (count 154) and a 1965 Corvette (count 158). We affirm these convictions on this basis. We also affirm the conviction concerning Hall's purchase of a 1995 Volvo (count 151), as there was evidence that Hall attempted to conceal certain loan repayment funds by purchasing this vehicle. Additionally, we affirm the conviction concerning Hall's purchase of an all-terrain vehicle (count 159) on the ground that the jury could conclude that this purchase (made in cash) was part of the same laundering scheme as the other vehicle purchases. Hall has not challenged the convictions on counts 152 and 153 which relate to his purchase of a 1992 Ford Explorer</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Hall also argues that these counts should have been dismissed because the government did not charge each expenditure related to the renovations as a separate offense. He argues that each renovation expenditure was a distinct transaction and therefore should have been charged separately. This argument was first raised on appeal, and we therefore limit ourselves to plain error review. The term transaction \"may comprehend a series of many occurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship.\"<i>Moore v. N.Y. Cotton Exchange,</i> 270 U.S. 593, 610, 46 S.Ct. 367, 70 L.Ed. 750 (1926). It was not clearly wrong for the district court to view Hall's numerous renovation expenditures as one transaction even though it was comprised of several \"subtransactions.\" <i>Federal Money Laundering supra</i> at &#167; 2.2.2.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Hall also challenges his money laundering convictions on the ground that the government failed to establish a nexus between the money laundering transactions and interstate commerce as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(3)(B). This argument was not raised below. While Hall claims that \"many of the transactions\" fail the interstate commerce requirement, he has provided us with only a skeletal argument and has not cited any authority to support his claim. This sort of underdeveloped argument is inadequate for Hall to sustain his \"heavy burden\" of demonstrating plain error for this unpreserved claim<i>United States v. Moran,</i> 393 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Hall also claims that the trial was conducted in such a way that it denied him due process of law.

Hall has cited no authority for this proposition, and there are several cases in which such hybrid orders have been entered<i>See, e.g., Baker,</i> 227 F.3d at 959; <i>Candelaria-Silva,</i> 166 F.3d at 42.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Hall also asserts that the forfeiture of his real property holdings was erroneous because there was insufficient evidence for the jury to have found a nexus between his real estate holdings and his drug trafficking and money laundering activities. We disagree. The jury could have found that Hall renovated his property with drug proceeds and that he used one of the properties to receive a shipment of drugs. This evidence is sufficient to support the jury's forfeiture finding<i>See United States v. Desmarais,</i> 938 F.2d 347, 353 (1st Cir.1991); <i>United States v.

The government can meet this burden by either direct or circumstantial evidence, or by any combination of the two. Moreover, the government need not disprove every hypothesis consistent with the defendant's innocence; rather, it is enough that a rational jury could look objectively at the proof and supportably conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's guilt has been established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Drug Conspiracy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall contends that there was insufficient evidence of his participation in a drug trafficking conspiracy because the government established only that he purchased marijuana from another individual and resold it. According to Hall, proof of a buyer/seller relationship is not sufficient to establish a drug conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention does not warrant extended discussion. It is enough to say that Hall understates the strength of the government's evidence. There was proof that from 1995 to 1999 Hall bought large amounts of marijuana from an individual named John Redihan. Redihan testified that he was aware that Hall's purpose was to resell the drugs for profit and that, on occasion, he assisted Hall in these efforts. <i>See United States v. Berrios,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749864\"><a href=\"/opinion/749864/united-states-v-george-berrios-aka-antonio-candelario-united-states-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span>, 841-42 (1st Cir.1998) (concluding that there was sufficient proof of a distribution conspiracy where seller knew that buyer was purchasing drugs for the purpose of selling it to others and intended to facilitate the resales). Moreover, Hall enlisted several other individuals to help him in the storage, preparation, and selling of the drugs. For example, an individual named William Lee sold marijuana for Hall, and a married couple, George and Brenda Elliot, assisted Hall by letting him store drugs in their home, helping him weigh the drugs, picking up marijuana deliveries from Redihan, and participating in Hall's debt collection efforts. This evidence sufficiently established Hall's participation in a conspiracy to distribute marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Money Laundering</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government charged Hall with 163 counts of concealment money laundering under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) for his use of the drug conspiracy proceeds. To sustain a conviction under &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), the government must prove: (1) that Hall knowingly conducted a financial transaction, (2) that he knew that the transaction involved funds that were proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, (3) that the funds were proceeds of a specified unlawful activity, and (4) that Hall engaged in the financial transaction knowing that it was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of such unlawful activity. <i>See United States v. Cornier-Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200912\"><a href=\"/opinion/200912/united-states-v-cornier-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2004). Hall's sufficiency claims relate primarily to the government's proof on the \"conceal or disguise\" element. He asserts that all of the financial transactions were conducted above board and were thus not meant to conceal or disguise anything. In essence, Hall's argument is that the government proved only that he spent or invested drug money and that this evidence is inadequate to sustain a conviction under &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the money laundering statute does not criminalize the mere spending or investing of illegally obtained assets. <i>See United States v. Corchado-Peralta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200312\"><a href=\"/opinion/200312/united-states-v-corchardo-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 259 (1st Cir.2003). Instead, at least one purpose for the expenditure must be to conceal or disguise the assets. <i>See id.</i> Proof of this element may be based on direct evidence, such as the defendant's own statements; or circumstantial evidence, like the use of a third-party to disguise the transaction; or unusual secrecy in making the transaction. <i>See Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 404 F.3d at 483.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case the government charged a series of financial transactions as separate counts. <i>See United States v. Marshall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773040\"><a href=\"/opinion/773040/united-states-v-christopher-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 540 (6th Cir.2001). We must therefore examine the government's proof on each count to determine its sufficiency. <i>See United States v. Shepard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165480\"><a href=\"/opinion/165480/united-states-v-shepard-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1116</span></a></span>, 1121 (10th Cir.2005). The 163 counts essentially involve loans to friends and colleagues and related transactions, purchases of cars and other vehicles, expenditures to renovate property, and establishing a construction business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Loans and Related Transactions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. Cosby/Brown Loans (Counts 2-97)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Hall offered to loan $30,000 to Danny Cosby and his girlfriend, Susan Brown, to buy a parcel of land. Cosby and Brown accepted Hall's offer and, after executing a mortgage to secure the loan, Hall gave them the loan proceeds in cash. In 1996, Cosby and Brown borrowed another $25,000, which Hall also paid out in cash. Over the next several years, Hall negotiated 96 repayment checks from Cosby and Brown, including a $33,000 check to pay off the remainder of the loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Cosby and Brown asked Hall where he got the money for the loans, he told them that he got most of it from an inheritance from his father. But there was evidence that Hall's father had intentionally omitted him from his will and that Hall did not receive anything from his father's estate. There also was testimony that, in regard to a loan to another person, Hall stated that the reason he wanted to loan money was to \"get some of his money more legal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government charged each negotiation of a loan repayment check as a separate money laundering count. Hall claims that there \"was nothing suspicious about the loan\" repayments because he made no attempt to conceal his identity when dealing with Cosby and Brown in making the loans or negotiating the repayments. This argument misconstrues the purpose of &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i). The statute criminalizes conduct designed to conceal or disguise the source of the drug proceeds even if the defendant does not conceal his own identity in the process. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Norman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754176\"><a href=\"/opinion/754176/united-states-v-albion-norman/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 377-78 (8th Cir.1998); <i>United States v.

Hall admitted as much when he claimed to another individual that he wanted to loan money to \"get some of his money more legal.\" Hall made this comment regarding a different loan, but the jury could infer that the same motivation applied to other similar loans which Hall made while running his marijuana trafficking operation. Additionally, Hall intentionally misled the borrowers about the source of the proceeds by telling them that he obtained the money from a family inheritance. Such a misstatement is probative of concealment. <i>See United States v. Tekle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782061\"><a href=\"/opinion/782061/united-states-v-solomon-tekle/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></a></span>, 1114 (9th Cir.2003) (affirming money laundering conviction based on evidence that defendant lied about the origin of funds that he used to purchase a home); <i>United States v.

After receiving the check, Hall placed these funds in his bank account for a few days before moving them to an E*Trade investment account. The government charged the moving of the funds as money laundering. Hall claims that \"there was absolutely nothing about the transaction that suggested concealment or an intent to conceal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that there is nothing about the transfer of money from Hall's bank account to his E*Trade account that, standing alone, necessarily suggests an intent to conceal. But the transfer cannot be viewed in isolation. It was part of the series of transactions that began with the loans to Cosby and Brown. \"A design to conceal on a particular transaction may be imputed to a subsequent transaction if the subsequent transaction, while innocent on its face, is part of a larger money laundering scheme.\" <i>United States v. Burns,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759764\"><a href=\"/opinion/759764/united-states-v-willie-burns-martanette-alexander-gregory-eugene-august/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></a></span>, 848-49 (5th Cir.1998) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). This is so because a \"launderer can never be sure that he has run the money through enough laundering cycles to make it clean enough so that the government can't find the stains.\" B. Williams &amp; F. Whitney, <i>Federal Money Laundering: Crimes and Forfeitures</i> &#167; 5.1.6.4 (1999). Given the proof that the original loans to Cosby and Brown were motivated by Hall's desire to conceal the source of the funds, the jury could infer that Hall's continued shuffling of the money through accounts was an attempt to further separate the money from its illegal source. <i>See Burns,</i> 162 F.3d at 848-49 (affirming money laundering conviction based on bank deposit which when viewed in isolation was innocent, but when viewed in context was part of a scheme to launder funds).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii. Recording a Mortgage (Count 161)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As security for a loan that Hall made to Felicity Hyde (Count 160), Hall recorded a mortgage on property that Hyde owned. The government charged the recording of the mortgage as a separate count of money laundering. Hall contends that the recording of the mortgage does not constitute money laundering because it is not a \"financial transaction\" as defined under the money laundering statute. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(3)(c)(4). This argument was not raised below, and therefore our review is for plain error. <i>See United States v. Capozzi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200671\"><a href=\"/opinion/200671/united-states-v-capozzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 335 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold for relief under the plain error standard, Hall must show that the district court committed a clear and obvious error by not dismissing this count on the ground that recording the mortgage was not a financial transaction. <i>See United States v. Marino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199776\"><a href=\"/opinion/199776/united-states-v-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2002). The money laundering statute defines a financial transaction as a transaction which \"in any way or degree affects interstate commerce\" and, among other things \"involves the transfer of title to any real property.\" This definition is construed broadly. <i>Federal Money Laundering, supra</i> &#167; 2.3 (citing S. Rep. 99-433 at 13 (1986)). A mortgage is \"a <i>conveyance</i> of <i>title</i> to property that is given as security for the payment of a debt . . . that will become void upon payment. . . according to the stipulated terms.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 1031 (8th ed.1999) (emphasis supplied). The recording of the mortgage thus memorialized and made efficacious \"transfer of title to any real property,\" and would seem to constitute a \"financial transaction.\" In any event, we are aware of no caselaw to the contrary, and therefore the district court's error, if any, was not clear or obvious. <i>See Patel,</i> 370 F.3d at 118.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

Hall found an advertisement for the truck in a local magazine and called the owner, Mark Stevens, to inquire about it. After a few contacts, Hall and Stevens agreed on a $12,000 purchase price. Hall asked that Stevens deliver the truck to his house. Although Stevens found that request peculiar, he complied and upon delivering the truck received from Hall $12,000 in cash in the form of wrapped packages of $20 bills. Hall contends that this evidence does not suggest an effort by him to conceal the funds used for the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The conversion of cash into goods or services as a way of concealing or disguising [a] wellspring of . . . cash is a central concern of the money laundering statute.\" <i>United States v.

Additionally, as we will discuss below, the government introduced evidence of other vehicle purchases for which there was additional proof that Hall made the purchases to conceal his drug income. The jury could have relied on this evidence to conclude that the pickup truck purchase was part of a single pattern of concealment.

Hall used the money order along with an additional $500 in cash to purchase a dump truck. Hall's use of his sister's name in purchasing the money order is evidence of his intent to conceal because it indicates that he was attempting to disguise the source of the proceeds by having it pass through another person's control. <i>See United States v.

Moreover, Redihan testified that Hall told him that he had set up a fictitious \"inheritance account\" in which the money \"was cleaned\" and used to purchase construction equipment such as a dump truck. Thus, the jury could have found that this purchase was part of the money laundering scheme.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iii. 1932 Ford Coupe (Count 102)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1997, Hall purchased a restored 1932 Ford Coupe from Terrence Blair for $24,000. When Blair delivered the car to Hall, Hall gave him a paper bag filled with cash. At Hall's request, Blair wrote the bill of sale for only $5,000. In addition to the use of cash to make the purchase, Hall's request for a false bill of sale suggests concealment because it permitted Hall to include an additional $19,000 in the purchase price that could not easily be traced. <i>See Wilson,</i> 77 F.3d at 109 (affirming money laundering conviction where defendant asked seller of car to say that he sold the car to him for half of the actual purchase price).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3.

The government presented evidence that Hall paid for the labor and materials using mostly cash and that he did not keep records of the labor costs. The evidence also established that Hall spent far in excess of his declared income to make these renovations. <i>See United States v.

A jury could conclude that Hall's expenditures of large amounts of cash, far in excess of his reported income, coupled with his non-existent bookkeeping practices demonstrated that he renovated the properties as a way to disguise illegally obtained cash by converting the money into expensive real estate holdings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ii.

Hall again claims that the government failed to prove the concealment element of the offense. Hall's objection to this count fails on the basis of his statements to others. <i>See Cruzado-Laureano,</i> 404 F.3d at 483. There was testimony that Hall said that he established Fire Island Construction \"to make him look legitimate\" and that he transferred construction equipment to Fire Island as part of a scheme to \"clean up some [of the] money.\" The jury could infer from this testimony that Hall's creation of Fire Island Construction and the subsequent transfer of property to the company was at least partially motivated by his desire to disguise the source of his drug proceeds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>TRIAL-ERROR CLAIMS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Before trial, the government disclosed Redihan's prior convictions, including a 1998 drug conviction in Rhode Island. As part of the disclosure, the government told defense counsel that the Rhode Island conviction involved the sale of Percodan and steroids, but after trial, it was discovered, through the preparation of Hall's presentence report, that the conviction also involved allegations of marijuana distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall asserts that this omission prejudiced his defense. One of Hall's defenses was that, while he sold small amounts of marijuana, he was not involved in the large-scale trafficking charged in the indictment. Hall argues that evidence concerning the nature of Redihan's Rhode Island conviction was important because it would have shown that Redihan lied when he testified that Hall was his major customer during the period of the charged conspiracy. He posits that, if he could have shown that Redihan was supplying drugs to many people, the jury would have been less likely to believe that Redihan was selling him such large quantities of marijuana. The government counters that there was no <i>Brady</i> violation because it was unaware of the marijuana aspects of the Rhode Island conviction until after the trial, and in any event the unavailability of this information was not prejudicial to Hall's defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall's <i>Brady</i> argument fails because there is no evidence that, prior to the conclusion of the trial, the government had information concerning the marijuana aspect of Redihan's Rhode Island conviction. The information that Redihan's Rhode Island conviction concerned marijuana trafficking came from a police report which the government states that it learned about only after the probation department discovered it during Hall's presentence investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's obligations under <i>Brady</i> only extend to information in its possession, custody, or control. <i>See United States v.

Nevertheless, Hall contends that the government had a duty to learn and disclose the details of Redihan's Rhode Island convictions and not just the fact of the conviction. While a prosecutor must disclose information maintained by government agents even if the prosecutor herself does not possess the information, <i>see Strickler v. Greene,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 280, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span> (1999), this duty does not extend to information possessed by government agents not working with the prosecution, <i>see United States v.

The information concerning the details of Redihan's conviction was maintained by the Rhode Island state courts, and there is no evidence that the federal prosecutor or any agent working on her behalf had this information prior to or during trial. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even assuming the government had to disclose the details of Redihan's Rhode Island conviction, Hall has not shown sufficient prejudice to warrant relief. <i>Brady</i> prejudice exists where \"there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict.\" <i>Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 281-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1936</span></a></span>. Hall elicited from Redihan, on cross-examination, that he was a convicted drug dealer and that he had distributed drugs in Rhode Island. Additional detail about the Rhode Island conviction would have been mostly cumulative. <i>See Lavallee v. Coplan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201107\"><a href=\"/opinion/201107/lavallee-v-coplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.2004). There also was substantial evidence of Hall's participation in a drug conspiracy aside from Redihan's testimony. Several other members of the conspiracy testified about Hall's criminal conduct. In sum, we are persuaded the disputed information, if known to Hall, would not have affected the trial's outcome. <i>See United States v. Schneiderhan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201529\"><a href=\"/opinion/201529/united-states-v-schneiderhan/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Redihan's Plea Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall next challenges the admission of Redihan's plea agreement for conspiring with Hall to distribute drugs. While Hall's brief is not explicit, he appears to object to the admission of the plea agreement because the agreement was conditioned on Redihan's truthful testimony at Hall's trial. According to Hall, admitting the agreement had the effect of bolstering Redihan's credibility in the jury's eyes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously concluded that \"informing the jury of the contents of a plea agreement of, at least, normal stripe,\" is permissible. <i>See United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486369\"><a href=\"/opinion/486369/united-states-v-william-martin-united-states-of-america-v-james-rekrut/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span>, 821 (1st Cir.1987). Hall has not presented any claim that Redihan's plea agreement was atypical or outside the rule stated in <i>Martin.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall also claims that the district court did not provide an appropriate cautionary instruction concerning the jury's consideration of the plea agreement. We disagree. The court instructed the jury that \"[s]ome people [testifying pursuant to a plea agreement] are entirely truthful when testifying. Still, you should consider the testimony of these individuals with particular caution. They may have had reason to make up stories or exaggerate what others did because they wanted to help themselves.\" Hall did not object to this instruction or propose other language, and the instruction was not clearly erroneous as given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Money Laundering Jury Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next challenge concerns the jury instruction on the concealment element of money laundering. The district court instructed that the concealment element was satisfied if the jury concluded that \"Hall knew that the transaction in question was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds of the marijuana trafficking.\" Hall objected to this instruction on the ground that the instruction did not sufficiently convey that he had to intend specifically to conceal the drug proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review challenges to the wording of a jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v.

The court's instruction closely tracked the language of the statute, which is a strong indicator that the charge passes muster. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Rosa,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1375</span></span>, 1381 (1st Cir.1983). In any event, the instruction clearly conveyed that Hall had to intend the transactions to conceal drug proceeds by requiring such a design on Hall's part. The instructions were thus adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Agent Giguere's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Near the close of its case, the government called Internal Revenue Service Agent Rodney Giguere to testify concerning his investigation of Hall's finances. Relying on our recent decisions in <i>United States v. Garc&#237;a-Morales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201227\"><a href=\"/opinion/201227/united-states-v-garcia-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16-17 (1st Cir.2004) and <i>United States v.

He also suggests Giguere provided prejudicial summary testimony. Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See United</i> <i>States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200773\"><a href=\"/opinion/200773/united-states-v-perez-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall's reliance on <i>Garc&#237;a-Morales</i> and <i>Casas</i> is misplaced. In both cases, we were addressing the problem of the prosecution beginning its case-in-chief by calling a government agent to provide an overview of its case. We criticized that practice because \"such testimony raises the very real specter that the jury verdict could be influenced by statements of fact or credibility assessments in the overview but not in evidence.\" <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 119.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Giguere did not testify until near the end of the government's case-in-chief. Most of his testimony concerned his description of his investigation into Hall's activities. This testimony was appropriate because it was based on Giguere's personal knowledge. <i>See Garc&#237;a-Morales,</i> 382 F.3d at 16. On a couple of occasions, Giguere testified to hearsay statements made to him during the investigation. But Hall did not object to Giguere's answers, and the testimony was hardly prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Giguere provided summary testimony, it concerned the travel of Hall's funds in and out of various accounts and was based on testimony and documents in evidence. This sort of testimony is permissible to summarize complex aspects of a case such as the financial dealings of a defendant. <i>See Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 120 n. 4. Furthermore, the court cautioned the jury that it should rely on its own memory of the facts and not the summary provided by Giguere. We discern no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall alleges that the government violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by threatening certain witnesses with severe consequences if they did not testify on the government's behalf. Specifically, one witness, Andrea Read, testified that government agents told her that she would face prosecution if she did not tell them \"what they wanted to hear,\" and a second witness, Steven Hiscock, testified that a government agent told him that, if he did not cooperate, the government \"would take his home.\" Both witnesses testified on behalf of the government and were examined about the nature of the threats and the effect, if any, these threats had on their testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that a due process violation can occur where the government intimidates or harasses potential defense witnesses to discourage them from testifying. <i>See United States v. Angiulo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537726\"><a href=\"/opinion/537726/united-states-v-gennaro-j-angiulo-donato-f-angiulo-samuel-s-granito/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span>, 1192 (1st Cir.1990). Hall has cited a series of cases in which appellate courts have overturned convictions where the prosecution coerced a potential witness not to testify on behalf of the defendant. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"335278\"><a href=\"/opinion/335278/united-states-v-walter-morrison-aka-skip-morrison-appeal-of-nick/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 226 (3d Cir.1976); <i>United States v.

These case are distinguishable because, here, the challenged conduct was intended to <i>encourage</i> witnesses to testify. <i>Angiulo</i> and the cases cited by Hall recognize a constitutional problem when the defendant is precluded from putting on the defense of his choice because the government threatens a person into not testifying. <i>See also Webb v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108634\"><a href=\"/opinion/108634/webb-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 98, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108634\"><a href=\"/opinion/108634/webb-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The problem is a complicated one because in many cases the government has to press unwilling witnesses, out of fear or friendship, to provide testimony that they are reluctant to give. There is no blanket rule against inducements by the government to witnesses to produce truthful testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume that, in extreme circumstances, government misconduct, could occur through improper efforts to shape testimony to the government's liking. In this instance, however, there was conflicting testimony as to whether the government actually threatened Read or Hiscock and defense counsel was allowed to cross-examine on the issue, leaving it to the jury to evaluate witness credibility in light of the evidence concerning the alleged threats. We do not find a constitutional violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall also asserts that his constitutional rights were violated by the government convincing his wife, Jill Hall, to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and to decline to testify on his behalf during sentencing. Before Ms. Hall testified, the government informed the court that Ms. Hall was a target of an investigation for conduct related to the crimes for which her husband had been convicted. In response to the government's representation, the court summoned Ms. Hall's lawyer to discuss with her the possible consequences of her testimony. After Ms. Hall and her lawyer consulted, she decided to invoke her privilege not to testify, and the court upheld her invocation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these facts, the government did not substantially interfere with Hall's ability to call his wife as a witness. The court found that Ms. Hall properly invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege. There is no evidence that the government acted in bad faith by notifying the court that Ms. Hall was the target of an investigation. Moreover, the court handled the matter appropriately by alerting Ms. Hall to the possible consequences of testifying and assuring that an attorney was present to counsel Ms. Hall on her decision of whether to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege. <i>See United States v.

After the jury returned these findings, the court entered a forfeiture order pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2. In regard to the drug trafficking forfeiture, the court imposed a money judgment in the amount of $511,321.22 and ordered the forfeiture of specific items of personal and real property which the jury found were connected Hall's drug activities. The money laundering forfeiture order commanded Hall to turn over specific items of property (in accord with the jury's findings) but did not impose an additional money judgment. Both orders permitted the government to seize \"substitute property\" under certain circumstances to satisfy the forfeiture amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall's first challenge concerns the district court's entry of a money judgment as part of the drug trafficking forfeiture. A money judgment permits the government to collect on the forfeiture order in the same way that a successful plaintiff collects a money judgment from a civil defendant. Thus, even if a defendant does not have sufficient funds to cover the forfeiture at the time of the conviction, the government may seize future assets to satisfy the order. Relying on <i>United States v. Croce,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2520695\"><a href=\"/opinion/2520695/united-states-v-croce/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In <i>Candelaria-Silva,</i> 166 F.3d at 42, we ruled that a \"criminal forfeiture may take several forms [including] an in personam judgment against the defendant for the amount of money the defendant obtained as proceeds of the offense.\" This position accords with the several appellate decisions that have addressed the question. <i>See United States v.

First, criminal forfeiture is a sanction against the individual defendant rather than a judgment against the property itself. <i>See United States v. Nava,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1119</span></span>, 1124 (9th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Cunan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198126\"><a href=\"/opinion/198126/united-states-v-cunan/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 116 n. 7 (1st Cir.1998). Because the sanction \"follows the defendant as a part of the penalty,\" the government need not prove that the defendant actually has the forfeited proceeds in his possession at the time of conviction. <i>Robilotto,</i> 828 F.2d at 948-49. Second, permitting a money judgment, as part of a forfeiture order, prevents a drug dealer from ridding himself of his ill-gotten gains to avoid the forfeiture sanction. In rejecting an argument against the use of money judgments pursuant to the RICO forfeiture statute, the Seventh Circuit explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What the defendant's argument overlooks is the fact that a racketeer who dissipates profits or proceeds of his racketeering activity on wine, women, and song has profited from organized crime to the same extent as if he had put the money in his bank account. Every dollar that the racketeer derives from illicit activities and then spends on such items as food, entertainment, college tuition, and charity, is a dollar that should not have been available for him to spend for those purposes. In order to truly separate the racketeer from his dishonest gains, therefore, the statute requires him to forfeit to the United States the total amount of the proceeds of his racketeering activity, regardless of whether the specific dollars received from that activity are still in his possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ginsburg,</i> 773 F.2d at 802. The policy rationale for permitting a money judgment as part of a forfeiture in a racketeering case applies equally to a forfeiture in a drug case. <i>See Nava,</i> 404 F.3d at 1124 n. 1 (stating that RICO forfeiture cases are useful in interpreting the drug forfeiture statute because the statutes are \"substantially identical\"). The district court did not err in entering a money judgment as part of the drug trafficking forfeiture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall next contends that the forfeiture orders wrongly permit the government to seize substitute property. He argues that the power to forfeit substitute property rests exclusively with the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(e) provides the procedure for the forfeiture of substitute property. It states: \"On the government's motion, the court may at anytime enter an order of forfeiture or amend an existing order of forfeiture to include property . . .\" that is substitute property under an applicable statute. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(e)(1). The forfeiture orders in this case state that the government may \"forfeit\" substitute property. It is not clear whether this means that the government may move for forfeiture or may seize the substitute property without any action by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government acknowledges that only the court can order the forfeiture of substitute property. In light of this acknowledgment and the plain language of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e)(1), we interpret the forfeiture orders in this case to permit the government to <i>move</i> for substitute property but to reserve for the court the authority to order the property forfeited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall raises several challenges to his sentence. He claims that the district court clearly erred in its drug quantity calculation and in its application of the obstruction of justice enhancement. He also claims that the court should have awarded him a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Finally, he claims that he is entitled to re-sentencing because the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding Hall's sentence, the district court applied the grouping rules under the Sentencing Guidelines. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. 3D1.2. The application of these rules led the court to determine that Hall's period of incarceration would be based on his conviction for the drug trafficking conspiracy because it resulted in the highest offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To calculate the offense level for the conspiracy conviction, the court concluded that the conspiracy involved between 700 and 1000 kilograms of marijuana, which led to an offense level of 30. The court then increased the offense level to 34 because of Hall's leadership role and his attempt to obstruct justice by trying to convince Redihan not to testify against him. When combined with a criminal history category of I, Hall's offense level yielded a sentencing range of 151 to 188 months. The court sentenced Hall to 151 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Drug Quantity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government bears the burden of proving drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See United States v. Sklar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 112 (1st Cir.1990). In determining the drug quantity involved in an offense, the district court \"may choose between plausible estimates of drug quantity but must err on the side of caution.\" <i>United States v. Marks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200982\"><a href=\"/opinion/200982/united-states-v-marks/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 105 (1st Cir.2004). We review the district court's drug quantity calculation for clear error. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court estimated the drug quantity involved in the conspiracy by determining the total profit that Hall earned from his drug activities and the profit that Hall made per pound. By dividing the total profit by the profit per pound, the court determined that the conspiracy involved between 700 and 1000 kilograms of marijuana. We have previously approved this method for ascertaining drug quantity. <i>See United States v. Gerante,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533564\"><a href=\"/opinion/533564/united-states-v-joseph-gerante/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 369 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Hall contends that the district court's quantity estimation was clearly erroneous because the court relied on unreliable evidence in determining Hall's drug profits. We disagree. The court determined that Hall's overall drug profits totaled $519,000, which was consistent with evidence showing that Hall's unreported taxable income was $518,929. The court also determined that Hall's profit per pound was approximately $300. It based this determination, in part, on Hall's own statement during the sentencing hearing that he earned between $200 and $400 profit per pound of marijuana. This evidence provided a reasonable basis for the court to set the variables which it used to calculate the drug quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Obstruction of Justice Enhancement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3C1.1 of the Guidelines mandates a two-level enhancement where the defendant \"willfully ... attempted to obstruct or impede the administration of justice during the course of the ... prosecution.\" One recognized way in which a defendant can obstruct justice is by threatening, intimidating or coercing a witness. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 cmt. 4. The district court found that Hall obstructed justice by trying to coerce Redihan not to testify against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall contends that the district court erred in applying the enhancement because it did not make a particularized finding as to whether Hall had a specific intent to obstruct justice. We recently declined to decide whether there must be a particularized finding that the defendant had a specific intent to obstruct justice to impose a &#167; 3C1.1 enhancement. <i>See United States v. Fournier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785411\"><a href=\"/opinion/785411/united-states-v-richard-fournier/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2004) (per curiam). We again decline to decide this question because the evidence clearly supports the district court's ultimate finding that Hall attempted to obstruct justice. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record demonstrates that Hall told Redihan \"not to say anything, and that [Hall] would never say anything about [Redihan].\" The district court reasonably concluded that Hall was trying to silence Redihan by promising him that he would not disclose Redihan's criminal conduct if Redihan refused to testify against him. Hall argues that he merely meant to advise Redihan of his right to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. But, absent a showing of clear error, the meaning of Hall's comment is for the district court to decide. <i>See United States v. Akitoye,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554021\"><a href=\"/opinion/554021/united-states-v-adegboyega-akitoye/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 228 (1st Cir.1991). The district court's interpretation of Hall's conduct was not clearly erroneous in these circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall's challenge to the district court's denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is entirely without merit. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1. Under most circumstances, a defendant who goes to trial is not entitled to acceptance of responsibility credit. <i>See United States v. Mikutowicz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200974\"><a href=\"/opinion/200974/united-states-v-mikutowicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2004). Moreover, acceptance of responsibility is not generally available to a defendant whose sentence has been enhanced for obstructing justice. <i>See Fournier,</i> 361 F.3d at 44. Hall went to trial and attempted to obstruct justice in the process. On these facts, the district was not clearly wrong to conclude that Hall failed to accept responsibility for his crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Mandatory Guidelines</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, by way of supplemental briefing, Hall argues that the district court erred by viewing the Guidelines as mandatory in determining his sentence. <i>See United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). He does not dispute that he failed to raise this argument below, and we therefore apply the plain error standard. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 76-77 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under our post-<i>Booker</i> plain error cases, we will ordinarily remand for resentencing if the defendant demonstrates \"either by [evidence] in the existing record or by plausible proffer [that] there is a reasonable indication that the district [court] might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201512\"><a href=\"/opinion/201512/united-states-v-heldeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir.2005). The record discloses the district court's unease with the degree of speculation involved in the drug quantity calculation, as well as the court's recognition of Hall's difficult childhood and later good works. Without forecasting whether these considerations would justify a more favorable sentence, we are persuaded by the record that the district court at least might be inclined to impose such a sentence on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth, we <i>affirm</i> all counts of conviction and the forfeiture orders but <i>vacate</i> Hall's sentence and <i>remand</i> for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Counts 119-121, 125-150, 155-157 and 160 also concern loan repayments Hall received and Hall's subsequent distribution of the loan proceeds.

We affirm these convictions on this basis. We also affirm the conviction concerning Hall's purchase of a 1995 Volvo (count 151), as there was evidence that Hall attempted to conceal certain loan repayment funds by purchasing this vehicle. Additionally, we affirm the conviction concerning Hall's purchase of an all-terrain vehicle (count 159) on the ground that the jury could conclude that this purchase (made in cash) was part of the same laundering scheme as the other vehicle purchases. Hall has not challenged the convictions on counts 152 and 153 which relate to his purchase of a 1992 Ford Explorer</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Hall also argues that these counts should have been dismissed because the government did not charge each expenditure related to the renovations as a separate offense. He argues that each renovation expenditure was a distinct transaction and therefore should have been charged separately. This argument was first raised on appeal, and we therefore limit ourselves to plain error review. The term transaction \"may comprehend a series of many occurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship.\"<i>Moore v. N.Y.

This argument was not raised below. While Hall claims that \"many of the transactions\" fail the interstate commerce requirement, he has provided us with only a skeletal argument and has not cited any authority to support his claim. This sort of underdeveloped argument is inadequate for Hall to sustain his \"heavy burden\" of demonstrating plain error for this unpreserved claim<i>United States v.
