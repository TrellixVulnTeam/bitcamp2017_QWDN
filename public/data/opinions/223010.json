Appellant National Organization\n\nfor Marriage (\"NOM\") appeals the denial of a preliminary injunction\n\nin   its   challenge   to the     constitutionality     of   a   Rhode   Island\n\nelection law requiring the reporting of so-called \"independent\n\nexpenditures.\"         NOM   argues      that   Rhode   Island's     reporting\n\nrequirement is both overbroad under the First Amendment and so\n\nvague in its terms as to violate due process.           The district court,\n\nnoting the minimal burden imposed by the law and the valuable\n\ngovernmental interest underlying it, concluded that NOM had failed\n\nto show a likelihood of success on the merits of its challenge.\n\nAfter careful review, we find no abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict court's denial of preliminary relief.                   We therefore\n\naffirm.\n\n            Our   opinion    in   this    appeal   accompanies     an    opinion\n\nresolving a separate set of challenges to provisions of Maine's\n\nelection laws,     including      an   independent   expenditure     reporting\n\nrequirement similar to Rhode Island's. See Nat'l Org. for Marriage\n\nv. McKee, Nos. 10-2000 & 10-2049 (1st Cir. 2011).                The vagueness\n\nand overbreadth arguments NOM presses here are substantially the\n\nsame as those addressed in our companion opinion.                We therefore\n\nrely heavily here on our more thorough discussion in the Maine\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f                                         I.\n\n                In September 2010, NOM filed a verified complaint in the\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Rhode Island challenging the\n\nconstitutionality of several aspects of Rhode Island's Campaign\n\nContributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-\n\n25-1       et   seq.,   on   vagueness   and   First   Amendment   overbreadth\n\ngrounds.1 Specifically, NOM's complaint targeted provisions of the\n\nstate's election laws governing (1) registration of political\n\naction committees (\"PACs\"), id. § 17-25-3(10); (2) contributions to\n\nand expenditures on behalf of candidates, id. § 17-25-10.1(h)(1),\n\n(j); and (3) reporting of independent expenditures, id. § 17-25-10.\n\nThe complaint alleged that NOM sought, in the lead-up to the 2010\n\nelections as well as in future election cycles, to \"engage in\n\nmultiple forms of speech in Rhode Island, including radio ads,\n\ntelevision ads, direct mail, and publicly accessible internet\n\npostings\" that would \"clearly identify candidates for state or\n\nlocal office in Rhode Island.\"           The complaint further alleged that\n\nNOM would refrain from engaging in such activities if it had to\n\nregister as a PAC to do so.         If no PAC registration were required,\n\nhowever, NOM would proceed with its activities and \"comply with the\n\nindependent expenditure reporting requirements under protest.\"\n\n\n       1\n       This initial complaint was dismissed by the district court\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 on the ground that the\n\"pertinent factual allegations in the complaint [were] buried\"\namidst \"conclusory and argumentative passages.\"      NOM filed an\namended complaint in October.\n\n                                         -3-\n\f              NOM's motion for a preliminary injunction came before the\n\ndistrict court for a hearing on October 21, 2010.             At the hearing,\n\nin light of prior assurances from the defendants that NOM could\n\nengage in its intended speech without registering as a PAC,2 the\n\ndistrict court narrowed the issues to NOM's challenge to the\n\nindependent expenditure reporting provision.                 Finding that the\n\nreporting requirement was not \"terribly burdensome\" and served an\n\nimportant public interest of informing voters \"as to the origins of\n\n. . . speech,\" the district court held that NOM had not met its\n\nburden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits. The\n\ncourt therefore denied NOM's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\n                                        II.\n\n              On interlocutory appeal from the district court's denial\n\nof its motion for preliminary relief, NOM argues that the court\n\nerred    as   a   matter   of   law     in    concluding   that   NOM   had   not\n\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its challenge\n\nto Rhode Island's independent expenditure statute.                We review the\n\ndenial of a preliminary injunction under a deferential standard,\n\nreversing only upon finding a mistake of law, a clear error in\n\nfact-finding,     or   other    abuse    of    discretion,   González-Droz     v.\n\n\n\n     2\n       Prior to filing suit, NOM sought an advisory opinion from\nthe Rhode Island Board of Elections as to whether it would be\nrequired to form a PAC to engage in its speech. The Board issued\nan opinion indicating that NOM could proceed with its speech\nwithout forming a PAC, and the defendants reiterated this point in\nresponding to NOM's motion for preliminary relief.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fGonzález-Colon, 573 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 2009).                 In ruling on a\n\nmotion for preliminary relief, a district court must consider\n\nseveral    factors,    among    which    likelihood     of     success     carries\n\nparticular weight.3     Id.\n\n            NOM    offers    two   lines      of   argument    challenging     the\n\nconstitutionality of the independent expenditure provision, the\n\nfirst based on First Amendment overbreadth grounds and the second\n\non due process vagueness grounds.              After examination of each of\n\nthese, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's\n\nholding that NOM failed to show a likelihood of success.\n\nA.   First Amendment Challenges\n\n            Campaign finance disclosure laws challenged on First\n\nAmendment   grounds    are     subject   to    \"exacting      scrutiny,\"   \"which\n\nrequires    a     'substantial     relation'       between      the   disclosure\n\nrequirement and a 'sufficiently important' governmental interest.\"\n\nCitizens United v. FEC, 130 S. Ct. 876, 914 (2010) (quoting Buckley\n\nv. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 64, 66 (1976)).                 As the district court\n\ncorrectly concluded, Rhode Island's independent expenditure law\n\nrequires only disclosure, and, as a disclosure law, is adequately\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       The other factors a district court must consider are \"the\npotential for irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction,\"\n\"whether issuing an injunction will burden the defendants less than\ndenying an injunction would burden the plaintiffs,\" and \"the\neffect, if any, on the public interest.\" Bos. Duck Tours, LP v.\nSuper Duck Tours, LLC, 531 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n                                        -5-\n\fsupported by a governmental interest in providing information to\n\nthe electorate.\n\n            In pertinent part, Rhode Island's independent expenditure\n\nprovision provides that any person \"not acting in concert with any\n\nother person or group\" who makes expenditures aggregating over $100\n\nin a given calendar year \"to support or defeat a candidate\" must\n\nfile a report within seven days with (1) the Rhode Island Board of\n\nElections (the \"Board\") and (2) the treasurer of the candidate \"on\n\nwhose behalf the expenditure . . . was made.\"   R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-\n\n25-10(b).    The report, which is filed on a one-page form provided\n\nby the Board, simply requires disclosure of the name and contact\n\ninformation of the person making the expenditure, identification of\n\nthe candidate or candidates the expenditures were made to support\n\nor defeat, and the date, amount, recipient, and purpose of each\n\nexpenditure.      The individual submitting the report must also\n\ncertify that the expenditures were not made in concert with any\n\nother person or group.\n\n            These disclosure requirements are substantially the same\n\nas those imposed by Maine's independent expenditure provision,\n\nwhich we uphold today in our companion opinion.      As with Maine's\n\nlaw, the disclosures required by the provision here impose no great\n\nburden on the exercise of election-related speech.       All that is\n\nrequired is the completion of a one-page form, which can be filled\n\nout and submitted to the Board online.        This relatively small\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fimposition serves the recognizedly important government interest in\n\n\"provid[ing] the electorate with information as to where political\n\ncampaign money comes from and how it is spent.\"    Buckley, 424 U.S.\n\nat 66 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          NOM nonetheless argues that the district court erred on\n\nseveral grounds in finding insufficient likelihood of success on\n\nthe merits to warrant preliminary relief. First, NOM contends that\n\nRhode Island's independent expenditure law is unconstitutionally\n\noverbroad because it extends beyond regulation of express advocacy.\n\nAs we explain in our companion opinion, the Supreme Court has\n\nexplicitly rejected the contention that disclosure laws must be\n\nlimited to regulation of express advocacy, Citizens United, 130 S.\n\nCt. at 915, and thus this argument finds no support.\n\n          Second, NOM argues that Rhode Island lacks a sufficiently\n\nimportant interest to support the $100 threshold at which the\n\nindependent   expenditure   reporting   requirement   applies,   and\n\ntherefore the law fails exacting scrutiny.   We reject an identical\n\nargument with respect to Maine's $100 independent expenditure\n\nreporting threshold in our companion opinion.     As we note in that\n\ncase, this sort of monetary threshold for a disclosure law is not\n\nsubject to exacting scrutiny, but instead will be upheld unless it\n\nis \"'wholly without rationality.'\" Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano,\n\n4 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 83).\n\nWe cannot say that the $100 threshold fails that standard.\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f          Third, NOM challenges the requirement that independent\n\nexpenditure reports be provided to the candidate \"on whose behalf\"\n\nthe expenditure is made,4 R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b), contending\n\nthat this aspect of the law bears no relation to the government's\n\ninterest in the disclosure of information.5             We disagree.       To be\n\nsure, the report-to-candidate requirement is not as closely related\n\nto the government's informational interest as the report-to-Board\n\nrequirement.     However, prompt notification to a candidate of the\n\nexpenditure     of   money   on   her   behalf       indirectly   serves     the\n\ninformational    interest    by   permitting     a   candidate    to   distance\n\nherself from individuals or organizations whose views she does not\n\nshare.   As Buckley observed, \"[t]he sources of a candidate's\n\nfinancial support . . . alert the voter to the interests to which\n\na candidate is most likely to be responsive,\" 424 U.S. at 67, and\n\n\n     4\n       As we explain below, see infra Part II.B, the statutory\ncontext makes plain that this language requires that a report be\nprovided to the candidate who stands to benefit from the\nindependent expenditure.\n     5\n      NOM relies for this argument on the Tenth Circuit's decision\nin Citizens for Responsible Government State Political Action\nCommittee v. Davidson, 236 F.3d 1174, 1196-98 (10th Cir. 2000),\nwhich held unconstitutional portions of a Colorado independent\nexpenditure reporting provision. Davidson provides little support\nfor NOM's argument.    Not only did the court there incorrectly\nsubject the disclosure requirement to strict rather than exacting\nscrutiny, but the requirement under review also imposed a far\ngreater burden than does Rhode Island's provision. Colorado's law\nrequired submittal of a report to every candidate in a race, not\njust the candidate on whose behalf the expenditure was made, and\nspecified that reports be submitted within twenty-four hours of an\nindependent expenditure (versus seven days under Rhode Island's\nstatute).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthus       the    imperative   for    accurate    information     about   electoral\n\ncandidates is well served by facilitating candidate response to\n\nsupport from parties unaffiliated with the candidate's campaign.\n\nThe report-to-candidate requirement also contributes to the proper\n\nfunctioning of Rhode Island's regulatory regime, as candidates are\n\nrequired to report all expenditures on their behalf to the Board.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b); cf. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 67-68\n\n(noting          the   collection    of   data   for   purposes   of   enforcing   a\n\nregulatory regime to be an important government interest supporting\n\ndisclosure).6\n\n                  In sum, NOM identifies no error of law or clear error of\n\nfact-finding in the district court's holding that NOM did not\n\nsatisfy its burden of showing a likelihood of success on the First\n\nAmendment challenge.           Absent such error or other indicia of abuse\n\nof discretion, NOM's arguments fail.\n\nB.   Vagueness Challenges\n\n                  In denying preliminary relief, the district court did not\n\nexpressly address NOM's arguments that portions of Rhode Island's\n\nindependent expenditure provision are unconstitutionally vague.\n\n\n       6\n       NOM notes that candidates could simply obtain the reported\ninformation from the Board, as the independent expenditure reports\nare publicly available.    While that may be so, the incremental\nburden involved here is negligible -- the person making an\nindependent expenditure does not need to prepare a separate or\ndifferent report, but merely must send to the candidate a second\ncopy of a report already prepared for the Board -- and we see some\nbenefit in direct and prompt notification to the candidates of\nexpenditures on their behalf.\n\n                                           -9-\n\fRegardless, as we briefly explain, NOM's vagueness contentions are\n\nwithout merit.7\n\n           NOM argues that two specific instances of language in the\n\nindependent expenditure provision raise vagueness problems: the\n\nword \"support,\" in the phrase \"to support or defeat a candidate,\"\n\nand the phrase \"on whose behalf.\"       R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b).\n\nAs   we   explain   in   our   companion    opinion,   \"a   statute   is\n\nunconstitutionally vague only if it 'prohibits . . . an act in\n\nterms so uncertain that persons of average intelligence would have\n\nno choice but to guess at its meaning and modes of application.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir. 2005) (en\n\nbanc) (quoting United States v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)).   Measured against this standard, neither phrase challenged\n\nby NOM offends due process.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       We note that two of the vagueness arguments NOM makes before\nthis court were never presented to the district court, and thus\ncannot be pressed on appeal. See Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria v.\nWiscovitch-Rentas (In re Net-Velázquez), 625 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir.\n2010). These arguments both focus on a regulation interpreting the\nindependent expenditure statute. The regulation defines the phrase\n\"expressly advocating\" to include communications or words \"which\n[i]n context can have no other meaning than to urge the election or\ndefeat of one or more clearly identified candidates.\" 23-1 R.I.\nCode R. § 25:2(6).         NOM argues that this definition is\nunconstitutionally vague due to its use of a purportedly proscribed\n\"appeal-to-vote test\" and because it allows reference to context in\ndetermining whether a communication qualifies as express advocacy.\nNOM may be able to raise these issues before the district court --\nthough we note that we reject substantially identical arguments in\nthe companion case -- but we will not consider them in this appeal.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f           Rhode Island's independent expenditure statute requires\n\nthe   reporting    of   expenditures     aggregating   over       $100,   made\n\nindependently of a candidate, \"to support or defeat a candidate.\"\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b). In this context, the word \"support\"\n\n\"clearly set[s] forth the confines within which potential . . .\n\nspeakers must act in order to avoid triggering the provision.\"\n\nMcConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 170 n.64 (2003), overruled on other\n\ngrounds by Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. 876.             Both we (in our\n\ncompanion opinion) and the Supreme Court have held, in very similar\n\nstatutory settings, that the word \"support\" is sufficiently clear.\n\nSee id. Particularly when paired with the word \"defeat,\" \"support\"\n\n\"'provide[s] explicit standards for those who apply them' and\n\n'give[s]   the    person   of   ordinary    intelligence      a    reasonable\n\nopportunity to know what is prohibited.\"       Id. (quoting        Grayned v.\n\nCity of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972)).8\n\n           Nor do we find \"on whose behalf\" lacking clarity.               The\n\nprovision requires that reports of independent expenditures be\n\nsubmitted to the Board and \"to the campaign treasurer of the\n\n\n\n      8\n      Though we find \"support\" to be clear on its face, we note as\nwell that the Board has promulgated regulations further narrowing\nand sharpening the text.     Those regulations provide that the\nreporting requirement is triggered when an expenditure is made\n\"expressly advocating the support or defeat of a candidate,\" 23-1\nR.I. Code R. § 25:3, and define \"expressly advocating\" to include\n\"communications of slogans or individual words which [i]n context\ncan have no other reasonable meaning than to urge the election or\ndefeat of one or more clearly identified candidates,\" id. §\n25:2(6).\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcandidate . . .      on whose behalf the expenditure . . . was made.\"\n\nR.I. Gen.    Laws    §    17-25-10(b).      The   legislature's   failure   to\n\nexpressly define the phrase \"on whose behalf\" does not, as NOM\n\nsuggests, render the phrase vague.          As we have noted, \"[t]he mere\n\nfact that a regulation requires interpretation does not make it\n\nvague.\"    Ridley v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 390 F.3d 65, 93 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); see also Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 794\n\n(1989) (\"[P]erfect clarity and precise guidance have never been\n\nrequired even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.\").\n\nIn   the   context   of    the   statute,   which   requires   reporting    of\n\nexpenditures \"to support or defeat a candidate,\" the meaning of\n\nthis phrase is plain: a report must be submitted to the candidate\n\nwho stands to benefit from the independent expenditure's advocacy.\n\n            Because NOM's vagueness arguments are without merit, the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying preliminary\n\nrelief without explicitly reaching the question of vagueness.\n\n                                     III.\n\n            For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's order denying NOM's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f",

McKee,</i> 649 F.3d 34 (1st Cir.2011). The vagueness and overbreadth arguments NOM presses here are substantially the same as those addressed in our companion opinion. We therefore rely heavily here on our more thorough discussion in the Maine opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> I.</h2>\n<p>In September 2010, NOM filed a verified complaint in the District Court for the District of Rhode Island challenging the constitutionality of several aspects of Rhode Island's Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-1 et seq., on vagueness and First Amendment overbreadth grounds.<sup>[1]</sup> Specifically, NOM's complaint targeted provisions of the state's election laws governing (1) registration of political action committees (\"PACs\"), <i>id.</i> § 17-25-3(10); (2) contributions to and expenditures on behalf of candidates, <i>id.</i> § 17-25-10.1(h)(1), (j); and (3) reporting of independent expenditures, <i>id.</i> § 17-25-10. The complaint alleged that NOM sought, in the lead-up to the 2010 elections as well as in future election cycles, to \"engage in multiple forms of speech in Rhode Island, including radio ads, television ads, direct mail, and publicly accessible internet postings\" that would \"clearly identify candidates for state or local office in Rhode Island.\" The complaint further alleged that NOM would refrain from engaging in such activities if it had to register as a PAC to do so. If no PAC registration were required, however, NOM would proceed with its activities and \"comply with the independent expenditure reporting requirements under protest.\"</p>\n<p>NOM's motion for a preliminary injunction came before the district court for a hearing on October 21, 2010. At the hearing, in light of prior assurances from the defendants that NOM could engage in its intended speech without registering as a PAC,<sup>[2]</sup> the district court narrowed the issues to NOM's challenge to the independent expenditure reporting provision. Finding that the reporting requirement was not \"terribly burdensome\" and served an important public interest of informing voters \"as to the origins of ... speech,\" the district court held that NOM had not met its burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits. The court therefore denied NOM's motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On interlocutory appeal from the district court's denial of its motion for preliminary relief, NOM argues that the court erred as a matter of law in concluding that NOM had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its challenge to Rhode Island's independent expenditure statute. We review the denial of a preliminary injunction under a deferential standard, reversing only upon finding a mistake of law, a clear error in fact-finding, or other abuse of discretion, <i>González-Droz v. González-Colon,</i> 573 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.2009). In ruling on a motion for preliminary relief, a district court must consider several factors, among which likelihood of success carries particular weight.<sup>[3]</sup><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*118</span> NOM offers two lines of argument challenging the constitutionality of the independent expenditure provision, the first based on First Amendment overbreadth grounds and the second on due process vagueness grounds. After examination of each of these, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's holding that NOM failed to show a likelihood of success.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. First Amendment Challenges</h2>\n<p>Campaign finance disclosure laws challenged on First Amendment grounds are subject to \"exacting scrutiny,\" \"which requires a `substantial relation' between the disclosure requirement and a `sufficiently important' governmental interest.\" <i>Citizens United v. FEC,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 876, 914, 175 L.Ed.2d 753 (2010) (quoting <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 64, 66, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976)). As the district court correctly concluded, Rhode Island's independent expenditure law requires only disclosure, and, as a disclosure law, is adequately supported by a governmental interest in providing information to the electorate.</p>\n<p>In pertinent part, Rhode Island's independent expenditure provision provides that any person \"not acting in concert with any other person or group\" who makes expenditures aggregating over $100 in a given calendar year \"to support or defeat a candidate\" must file a report within seven days with (1) the Rhode Island Board of Elections (the \"Board\") and (2) the treasurer of the candidate \"on whose behalf the expenditure ... was made.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b). The report, which is filed on a one-page form provided by the Board, simply requires disclosure of the name and contact information of the person making the expenditure, identification of the candidate or candidates the expenditures were made to support or defeat, and the date, amount, recipient, and purpose of each expenditure. The individual submitting the report must also certify that the expenditures were not made in concert with any other person or group.</p>\n<p>These disclosure requirements are substantially the same as those imposed by Maine's independent expenditure provision, which we uphold today in our companion opinion. As with Maine's law, the disclosures required by the provision here impose no great burden on the exercise of election-related speech. All that is required is the completion of a one-page form, which can be filled out and submitted to the Board online. This relatively small imposition serves the recognizedly important government interest in \"provid[ing] the electorate with information as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 66, 96 S.Ct. 612 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>NOM nonetheless argues that the district court erred on several grounds in finding insufficient likelihood of success on the merits to warrant preliminary relief. First, NOM contends that Rhode Island's independent expenditure law is unconstitutionally overbroad because it extends beyond regulation of express advocacy. As we explain in our companion opinion, the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected the contention that disclosure laws must be limited to regulation of express advocacy, <i>Citizens United,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 915, and thus this argument finds no support.</p>\n<p>Second, NOM argues that Rhode Island lacks a sufficiently important interest to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*119</span> support the $100 threshold at which the independent expenditure reporting requirement applies, and therefore the law fails exacting scrutiny. We reject an identical argument with respect to Maine's $100 independent expenditure reporting threshold in our companion opinion. As we note in that case, this sort of monetary threshold for a disclosure law is not subject to exacting scrutiny, but instead will be upheld unless it is \"`wholly without rationality.'\" <i>Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano,</i> 4 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 83, 96 S.Ct. 612). We cannot say that the $100 threshold fails that standard.</p>\n<p>Third, NOM challenges the requirement that independent expenditure reports be provided to the candidate \"on whose behalf\" the expenditure is made,<sup>[4]</sup> R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b), contending that this aspect of the law bears no relation to the government's interest in the disclosure of information.<sup>[5]</sup> We disagree. To be sure, the report-to-candidate requirement is not as closely related to the government's informational interest as the report-to-Board requirement. However, prompt notification to a candidate of the expenditure of money on her behalf indirectly serves the informational interest by permitting a candidate to distance herself from individuals or organizations whose views she does not share. As <i>Buckley</i> observed, \"[t]he sources of a candidate's financial support... alert the voter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive,\" 424 U.S. at 67, 96 S.Ct. 612, and thus the imperative for accurate information about electoral candidates is well served by facilitating candidate response to support from parties unaffiliated with the candidate's campaign. The report-to-candidate requirement also contributes to the proper functioning of Rhode Island's regulatory regime, as candidates are required to report all expenditures on their behalf to the Board. R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b); <i>cf. </i><i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 67-68, 96 S.Ct. 612 (noting the collection of data for purposes of enforcing a regulatory regime to be an important government interest supporting disclosure).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>In sum, NOM identifies no error of law or clear error of fact-finding in the district court's holding that NOM did not satisfy its burden of showing a likelihood of success on the First Amendment challenge. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*120</span> Absent such error or other indicia of abuse of discretion, NOM's arguments fail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Vagueness Challenges</h2>\n<p>In denying preliminary relief, the district court did not expressly address NOM's arguments that portions of Rhode Island's independent expenditure provision are unconstitutionally vague. Regardless, as we briefly explain, NOM's vagueness contentions are without merit.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>NOM argues that two specific instances of language in the independent expenditure provision raise vagueness problems: the word \"support,\" in the phrase \"to support or defeat a candidate,\" and the phrase \"on whose behalf.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b). As we explain in our companion opinion, \"a statute is unconstitutionally vague only if it `prohibits... an act in terms so uncertain that persons of average intelligence would have no choice but to guess at its meaning and modes of application.'\" <i>United States v. Councilman,</i> 418 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc) (quoting <i>United States v. Hussein,</i> 351 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.2003)). Measured against this standard, neither phrase challenged by NOM offends due process.</p>\n<p>Rhode Island's independent expenditure statute requires the reporting of expenditures aggregating over $100, made independently of a candidate, \"to support or defeat a candidate.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b). In this context, the word \"support\" \"clearly set[s] forth the confines within which potential ... speakers must act in order to avoid triggering the provision.\" <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 170 n. 64, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003), <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>Citizens United,</i> 130 S.Ct. 876. Both we (in our companion opinion) and the Supreme Court have held, in very similar statutory settings, that the word \"support\" is sufficiently clear. <i>See id.</i> Particularly when paired with the word \"defeat,\" \"support\" \"'provide[s] explicit standards for those who apply them' and `give[s] the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Grayned v. City of Rockford,</i> 408 U.S. 104, 108-09, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972)).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor do we find \"on whose behalf\" lacking clarity. The provision requires that reports of independent expenditures be submitted to the Board and \"to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> campaign treasurer of the candidate ... on whose behalf the expenditure ... was made.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b). The legislature's failure to expressly define the phrase \"on whose behalf\" does not, as NOM suggests, render the phrase vague. As we have noted, \"[t]he mere fact that a regulation requires interpretation does not make it vague.\" <i>Ridley v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,</i> 390 F.3d 65, 93 (1st Cir. 2004); <i>see also </i><i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism,</i> 491 U.S. 781, 794, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989) (\"[P]erfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.\"). In the context of the statute, which requires reporting of expenditures \"to support or defeat a candidate,\" the meaning of this phrase is plain: a report must be submitted to the candidate who stands to benefit from the independent expenditure's advocacy.</p>\n<p>Because NOM's vagueness arguments are without merit, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying preliminary relief without explicitly reaching the question of vagueness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court's order denying NOM's motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  This initial complaint was dismissed by the district court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 on the ground that the \"pertinent factual allegations in the complaint [were] buried\" amidst \"conclusory and argumentative passages.\" NOM filed an amended complaint in October.</p>\n<p>[2]  Prior to filing suit, NOM sought an advisory opinion from the Rhode Island Board of Elections as to whether it would be required to form a PAC to engage in its speech. The Board issued an opinion indicating that NOM could proceed with its speech without forming a PAC, and the defendants reiterated this point in responding to NOM's motion for preliminary relief.</p>\n<p>[3]  The other factors a district court must consider are \"the potential for irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction,\" \"whether issuing an injunction will burden the defendants less than denying an injunction would burden the plaintiffs,\" and \"the effect, if any, on the public interest.\" <i>Bos. Duck Tours, LP v. Super Duck Tours, LLC,</i> 531 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[4]  As we explain below, <i>see infra</i> Part II.B, the statutory context makes plain that this language requires that a report be provided to the candidate who stands to benefit from the independent expenditure.</p>\n<p>[5]  NOM relies for this argument on the Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>Citizens for Responsible Government State Political Action Committee v. Davidson,</i> 236 F.3d 1174, 1196-98 (10th Cir.2000), which held unconstitutional portions of a Colorado independent expenditure reporting provision. <i>Davidson</i> provides little support for NOM's argument. Not only did the court there incorrectly subject the disclosure requirement to strict rather than exacting scrutiny, but the requirement under review also imposed a far greater burden than does Rhode Island's provision. Colorado's law required submittal of a report to <i>every</i> candidate in a race, not just the candidate on whose behalf the expenditure was made, and specified that reports be submitted within twenty-four hours of an independent expenditure (versus seven days under Rhode Island's statute).</p>\n<p>[6]  NOM notes that candidates could simply obtain the reported information from the Board, as the independent expenditure reports are publicly available. While that may be so, the incremental burden involved here is negligible  the person making an independent expenditure does not need to prepare a separate or different report, but merely must send to the candidate a second copy of a report already prepared for the Board  and we see some benefit in direct and prompt notification to the candidates of expenditures on their behalf.</p>\n<p>[7]  We note that two of the vagueness arguments NOM makes before this court were never presented to the district court, and thus cannot be pressed on appeal. <i>See Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria v. Wiscovitch-Rentas</i> (<i>In re Net-Velázquez</i>), 625 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir.2010). These arguments both focus on a regulation interpreting the independent expenditure statute. The regulation defines the phrase \"expressly advocating\" to include communications or words \"which [i]n context can have no other meaning than to urge the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidates.\" 23-1 R.I.Code R. § 25:2(6). NOM argues that this definition is unconstitutionally vague due to its use of a purportedly proscribed \"appeal-to-vote test\" and because it allows reference to context in determining whether a communication qualifies as express advocacy. NOM may be able to raise these issues before the district court  though we note that we reject substantially identical arguments in the companion case  but we will not consider them in this appeal.</p>\n<p>[8]  Though we find \"support\" to be clear on its face, we note as well that the Board has promulgated regulations further narrowing and sharpening the text. Those regulations provide that the reporting requirement is triggered when an expenditure is made \"expressly advocating the support or defeat of a candidate,\" 23-1 R.I.Code R. § 25:3, and define \"expressly advocating\" to include \"communications of slogans or individual words which [i]n context can have no other reasonable meaning than to urge the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidates,\" <i>id.</i> § 25:2(6).</p>\n\n</div>",

The district court, noting the minimal burden imposed by the law and the valuable governmental interest underlying it, concluded that NOM had failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of its challenge. After careful review, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of preliminary relief. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p>Our opinion in this appeal accompanies an opinion resolving a separate set of challenges to provisions of Maine's election laws, including an independent expenditure reporting requirement similar to Rhode Island's. <i>See </i><i>Nat'l Org. for Marriage v.

The vagueness and overbreadth arguments NOM presses here are substantially the same as those addressed in our companion opinion. We therefore rely heavily here on our more thorough discussion in the Maine opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*117</span> I.</h2>\n<p>In September 2010, NOM filed a verified complaint in the District Court for the District of Rhode Island challenging the constitutionality of several aspects of Rhode Island's Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-1 et seq., on vagueness and First Amendment overbreadth grounds.<sup>[1]</sup> Specifically, NOM's complaint targeted provisions of the state's election laws governing (1) registration of political action committees (\"PACs\"), <i>id.</i> § 17-25-3(10); (2) contributions to and expenditures on behalf of candidates, <i>id.</i> § 17-25-10.1(h)(1), (j); and (3) reporting of independent expenditures, <i>id.</i> § 17-25-10. The complaint alleged that NOM sought, in the lead-up to the 2010 elections as well as in future election cycles, to \"engage in multiple forms of speech in Rhode Island, including radio ads, television ads, direct mail, and publicly accessible internet postings\" that would \"clearly identify candidates for state or local office in Rhode Island.\" The complaint further alleged that NOM would refrain from engaging in such activities if it had to register as a PAC to do so. If no PAC registration were required, however, NOM would proceed with its activities and \"comply with the independent expenditure reporting requirements under protest.\"</p>\n<p>NOM's motion for a preliminary injunction came before the district court for a hearing on October 21, 2010. At the hearing, in light of prior assurances from the defendants that NOM could engage in its intended speech without registering as a PAC,<sup>[2]</sup> the district court narrowed the issues to NOM's challenge to the independent expenditure reporting provision. Finding that the reporting requirement was not \"terribly burdensome\" and served an important public interest of informing voters \"as to the origins of ... speech,\" the district court held that NOM had not met its burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits.

Vagueness Challenges</h2>\n<p>In denying preliminary relief, the district court did not expressly address NOM's arguments that portions of Rhode Island's independent expenditure provision are unconstitutionally vague. Regardless, as we briefly explain, NOM's vagueness contentions are without merit.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>NOM argues that two specific instances of language in the independent expenditure provision raise vagueness problems: the word \"support,\" in the phrase \"to support or defeat a candidate,\" and the phrase \"on whose behalf.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b). As we explain in our companion opinion, \"a statute is unconstitutionally vague only if it `prohibits... an act in terms so uncertain that persons of average intelligence would have no choice but to guess at its meaning and modes of application.'\" <i>United States v. Councilman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201757\"><a href=\"/opinion/201757/united-states-v-councilman/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2005) (en banc) (quoting <i>United States v. Hussein,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200713\"><a href=\"/opinion/200713/united-states-v-hussein/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2003)). Measured against this standard, neither phrase challenged by NOM offends due process.</p>\n<p>Rhode Island's independent expenditure statute requires the reporting of expenditures aggregating over $100, made independently of a candidate, \"to support or defeat a candidate.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b). In this context, the word \"support\" \"clearly set[s] forth the confines within which potential ... speakers must act in order to avoid triggering the provision.\" <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 170 n. 64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span>. Both we (in our companion opinion) and the Supreme Court have held, in very similar statutory settings, that the word \"support\" is sufficiently clear. <i>See id.</i> Particularly when paired with the word \"defeat,\" \"support\" \"'provide[s] explicit standards for those who apply them' and `give[s] the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Grayned v. City of Rockford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108598\"><a href=\"/opinion/108598/grayned-v-city-of-rockford/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 108-09, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108598\"><a href=\"/opinion/108598/grayned-v-city-of-rockford/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (1972)).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor do we find \"on whose behalf\" lacking clarity. The provision requires that reports of independent expenditures be submitted to the Board and \"to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*121</span> campaign treasurer of the candidate ... on whose behalf the expenditure ... was made.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b). The legislature's failure to expressly define the phrase \"on whose behalf\" does not, as NOM suggests, render the phrase vague. As we have noted, \"[t]he mere fact that a regulation requires interpretation does not make it vague.\" <i>Ridley v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201356\"><a href=\"/opinion/201356/ridley-v-mbta/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 93 (1st Cir. 2004); <i>see also </i><i>Ward v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span> (1989) (\"[P]erfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations that restrict expressive activity.\"). In the context of the statute, which requires reporting of expenditures \"to support or defeat a candidate,\" the meaning of this phrase is plain: a report must be submitted to the candidate who stands to benefit from the independent expenditure's advocacy.</p>\n<p>Because NOM's vagueness arguments are without merit, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying preliminary relief without explicitly reaching the question of vagueness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court's order denying NOM's motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  This initial complaint was dismissed by the district court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 on the ground that the \"pertinent factual allegations in the complaint [were] buried\" amidst \"conclusory and argumentative passages.\" NOM filed an amended complaint in October.</p>\n<p>[2]  Prior to filing suit, NOM sought an advisory opinion from the Rhode Island Board of Elections as to whether it would be required to form a PAC to engage in its speech. The Board issued an opinion indicating that NOM could proceed with its speech without forming a PAC, and the defendants reiterated this point in responding to NOM's motion for preliminary relief.</p>\n<p>[3]  The other factors a district court must consider are \"the potential for irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction,\" \"whether issuing an injunction will burden the defendants less than denying an injunction would burden the plaintiffs,\" and \"the effect, if any, on the public interest.\" <i>Bos. Duck Tours, LP v. Super Duck Tours, LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[4]  As we explain below, <i>see infra</i> Part II.B, the statutory context makes plain that this language requires that a report be provided to the candidate who stands to benefit from the independent expenditure.</p>\n<p>[5]  NOM relies for this argument on the Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>Citizens for Responsible Government State Political Action Committee v. Davidson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771682\"><a href=\"/opinion/771682/citizens-for-responsible-government-state-political-action-committee-steve/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></a></span>, 1196-98 (10th Cir.2000), which held unconstitutional portions of a Colorado independent expenditure reporting provision. <i>Davidson</i> provides little support for NOM's argument. Not only did the court there incorrectly subject the disclosure requirement to strict rather than exacting scrutiny, but the requirement under review also imposed a far greater burden than does Rhode Island's provision. Colorado's law required submittal of a report to <i>every</i> candidate in a race, not just the candidate on whose behalf the expenditure was made, and specified that reports be submitted within twenty-four hours of an independent expenditure (versus seven days under Rhode Island's statute).</p>\n<p>[6]  NOM notes that candidates could simply obtain the reported information from the Board, as the independent expenditure reports are publicly available. While that may be so, the incremental burden involved here is negligible  the person making an independent expenditure does not need to prepare a separate or different report, but merely must send to the candidate a second copy of a report already prepared for the Board  and we see some benefit in direct and prompt notification to the candidates of expenditures on their behalf.</p>\n<p>[7]  We note that two of the vagueness arguments NOM makes before this court were never presented to the district court, and thus cannot be pressed on appeal. <i>See Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria v. Wiscovitch-Rentas</i> (<i>In re Net-Velázquez</i>), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2010). These arguments both focus on a regulation interpreting the independent expenditure statute. The regulation defines the phrase \"expressly advocating\" to include communications or words \"which [i]n context can have no other meaning than to urge the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidates.\" 23-1 R.I.Code R. § 25:2(6). NOM argues that this definition is unconstitutionally vague due to its use of a purportedly proscribed \"appeal-to-vote test\" and because it allows reference to context in determining whether a communication qualifies as express advocacy. NOM may be able to raise these issues before the district court  though we note that we reject substantially identical arguments in the companion case  but we will not consider them in this appeal.</p>\n<p>[8]  Though we find \"support\" to be clear on its face, we note as well that the Board has promulgated regulations further narrowing and sharpening the text. Those regulations provide that the reporting requirement is triggered when an expenditure is made \"expressly advocating the support or defeat of a candidate,\" 23-1 R.I.Code R. § 25:3, and define \"expressly advocating\" to include \"communications of slogans or individual words which [i]n context can have no other reasonable meaning than to urge the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidates,\" <i>id.</i> § 25:2(6).</p>\n\n</div>",
