Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499-\n\n500(1975)).\n\n\n          Whether   styled   as  a   constitutional   or\n          prudential limit on standing, the Court has\n          sometimes determined that where large numbers\n          of Americans suffer alike, the political\n          process, rather than the judicial process, may\n          provide the more appropriate remedy for a\n          widely   shared  grievance.   [Such   judicial\n          language], however, invariably appears in\n          cases where the harm at issue is not only\n          widely shared, but is also of an abstract and\n          indefinite nature - for example, harm to the\n          \"common concern for obedience to law.\" . . .\n          Often the fact that an interest is abstract\n          and the fact that it is widely shared go hand\n          in hand.      But their association is not\n          invariable, and where harm is concrete, though\n          widely shared, the Court has found \"injury in\n          fact.\"\n\nFEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 24 (1998).\n\n          Chardon-Dubos claims that Public Law 600 and Puerto\n\nRico's   Commonwealth     status,     which    resulted    represent      an\n\nunconstitutional disposition of Congress's sovereign territorial\n\npowers under art. IV, §3 of the United States Constitution (\"the\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fTerritorial   Clause\").1      Public   Law   600,   64   Stat.   319\n\n(1950)(codified at 48 U.S.C. § 731b, et seq.) authorized Puerto\n\nRico to enact a constitution for local self-government, which\n\nconstitution was approved by Public Law 447, 66 Stat. 327 (1952).\n\n          To satisfy the injury in fact requirement, Chardon-Dubos\n\nwas required to show some \"invasion of a legally protected interest\n\nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized[] and (b) actual or\n\nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" Lujan v. Defenders of\n\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).    He was also required to plead\n\na \"causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained\n\nof\" and that it is \"'likely,' as opposed to merely 'speculative,'\n\nthat the injury will be 'redressed by a favorable decision.'\" Id.\n\nat 560-61.\n\n          The injury that Chardon-Dubos alleged in his amended\n\ncomplaint was conjectural.   The amended complaint alleged that the\n\nFederal Government's failure to exercise sovereignty over Puerto\n\nRico resulted in the Puerto Rican government choosing to spend\n\nmoney lobbying Congress on the issue of Puerto Rico's status, which\n\nin turn reduced government expenditures for other purposes, causing\n\nprice increases and reduced services to Chardon-Dubos as a resident\n\n\n\n     1\n       The Territorial Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2,\nprovides that \"[t]he Congress shall have Power to dispose of and\nmake all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or\nother Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this\nConstitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of\nthe United States, or of any particular State.\"\n\n                                -4-\n\fof Puerto Rico.         In    a d d i t ion     to the cl a i m e d i n j u r y ' s\n\ndeficiencies, \"the line of causation between [Congress' challenged\n\naction] and such injury is not apparent from the complaint.\" Warth,\n\n422 U.S. at 508.        Chardon-Dubos failed to allege a sufficiently\n\ndirect causal link between the claimed violation (enactment of\n\nPublic Law 600) and the claimed personal injury (increased prices\n\nand reduced services for residents of Puerto Rico).                  The causal\n\nconnection depended upon speculation about how the Puerto Rico\n\nlegislature would spend funds and how such decisions would impact\n\nthe local economy. \"[A] party seeking federal jurisdiction cannot\n\nrely on such '[s]peculative inferences . . . to connect [his]\n\ninjury      to    the   challenged    actions        of    [the    defendant].\"\n\nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 346 (2006); see Biszko\n\nv. RIHT Fin. Corp., 758 F.2d 769, 771 (1st Cir. 1985)(stating that\n\n\"'broad allegations of speculative injury will not suffice'\")\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n             To the extent that Chardon-Dubos claims standing simply\n\nas a taxpayer, \"[i]t has been . . . clear for more than three-\n\nquarters of a century that, with certain narrow exceptions not\n\nimplicated here, taxpayers, as such, lack generalized standing to\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of governmental action.\" Osediacz\n\nv.   City    of   Cranston,   414    F.3d     136,   142   (1st    Cir.    2005).\n\nSpecifically, a \"plaintiff's standing . . . cannot be grounded on\n\nthe mere fact that []he pays taxes to a municipality which, in\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fturn, expends funds to further an unconstitutional exercise of\n\ngovernmental power.\" Id.\n\n           Chardon-Dubos argues that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to alter or amend the judgment to permit him to\n\namend his complaint further to include the factual allegations of\n\npersonal injury in support of standing contained in his \"Verified\n\nStatement\" in his opposition to the government's motion to dismiss.\n\nEven if the motion to amend had been properly before the district\n\ncourt, \"[a]n order denying leave to amend will be overturned only\n\nwhere the district court has abused its discretion.\" Epstein v.\n\nC.R. Bard, Inc., 460 F.3d 183, 190 (1st Cir. 2006).   The \"Verified\n\nStatement\" was filed more than a year after the filing of the\n\noriginal complaint and the government's motion to dismiss.      The\n\nfacts allegedly occurred prior to the filing of the original\n\ncomplaint.   Moreover, it does not appear that the newly alleged\n\nfacts could establish Chardon-Dubos' standing to challenge Public\n\nLaw 600.   Therefore, there was no abuse of discretion. See id. at\n\n191.\n\n           The district court judgment dismissing the complaint with\n\nprejudice and its order denying the motion to alter or amend that\n\njudgment are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",

The \"Verified\n\nStatement\" was filed more than a year after the filing of the\n\noriginal complaint and the government's motion to dismiss.      The\n\nfacts allegedly occurred prior to the filing of the original\n\ncomplaint.   Moreover, it does not appear that the newly alleged\n\nfacts could establish Chardon-Dubos' standing to challenge Public\n\nLaw 600.   Therefore, there was no abuse of discretion.
