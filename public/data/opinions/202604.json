ALLEN, III,\n\n                       Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                    v.\n\n                    YORK COUNTY JAIL, ET AL.,\n\n                      Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n           [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bert J. Allen, III on brief pro se.\n     Michael J. Schmidt and Wheeler & Arey, P.A., on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                          January 23, 2007\n\f           Per Curiam. Bert J. Allen, III, pro se, appeals from the\n\ndistrict court's entry of judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 50(a) in favor of defendant Tammy Legnard and the jury\n\nverdict entered in favor of defendant Daniel Dubois in this civil\n\nrights action.    Allen's claims arose from injuries he suffered at\n\nthe hands of other inmates while he was confined at the York County\n\nJail in Sanford, Maine, as a pretrial detainee; specifically, Allen\n\nasserted that he was sexually assaulted by two inmates at the\n\nbehest of defendant Dubois, and that on another occasion he was\n\ninjured   when   inmates   pelted   him   with   rocks   during   a   prison\n\nevacuation in August 2000.     Allen claimed that these injuries were\n\nthe result of the deliberate indifference of defendants, both\n\ncorrections officers at the prison, to his health and safety, in\n\nviolation of his Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights as a\n\npretrial detainee.\n\n           On appeal, Allen first argues that the district court\n\nerred in granting defendant Legnard's motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).          To the extent Allen\n\nchallenges the timing of the motion or the ruling on the motion,\n\nhis argument is baseless; Rule 50(a) expressly authorizes the\n\nprocedure that was followed. Allen's challenge to the substance of\n\nthe ruling is also unavailing.      Although the evidence showed that\n\nLegnard put Allen in a cell with inmates who had sexually assaulted\n\nhim a few days after the assault occurred, she testified that she\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fwas unaware that the assault had occurred and that she removed\n\nAllen from the holding cell as soon as he requested it.           Allen does\n\nnot cite any evidence to refute that testimony, and he does not\n\nallege that he suffered any injury as a result of the post-assault\n\nconfinement.    Allen also fails to cite any evidence that would\n\nrefute Legnard's testimony that she was not present at the prison\n\nduring the rock-throwing incident. Since the focus of a deliberate\n\nindifference claim is what the officers knew and what they did in\n\nresponse to a known risk, Burrell v. Hampshire County, 307 F.3d 1,\n\n8 (1st Cir. 2002), see Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 845 (1994),\n\nthe district court's grant of Legnard's motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law was proper.\n\n          Allen next argues that the district court erred in\n\npermitting    defendants    to   introduce   a   redacted   version    of   a\n\nvideotaped deposition of an unavailable witness at trial. Since it\n\nappears that the redacted content was limited to material properly\n\nruled inadmissible by the trial court, however, the district\n\ncourt's ruling was not in error.\n\n          Allen also asserts that the district court erred in\n\ninstructing    the   jury   to   apply    the    standard   of    deliberate\n\nindifference applicable to claims brought by convicted inmates\n\nunder the Eighth Amendment; he suggests that a different standard\n\nshould have been applied because, as he was a pretrial detainee,\n\nhis claims were brought under the Fourth Amendment.              However, we\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fhave made clear that the Eighth Amendment standard is to be applied\n\nto deliberate indifference claims brought by pretrial detainees.\n\nSee Burrell, 307 F.3d at 7.       Allen's assignment of error is\n\ntherefore unfounded.\n\n          We have carefully considered Allen's remaining issues and\n\nfind them to be without merit.\n\n          Affirmed.    See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
