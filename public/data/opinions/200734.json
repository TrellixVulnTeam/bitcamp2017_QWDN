Torres-Pabon, Assistant United States Attorney, were\non brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        November 20, 2003\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        This massive drug conspiracy case\n\nfrom Puerto      Rico   involved   a   six-month     trial       and   resulted   in\n\nconvictions of the eleven defendants who appeal, eight of whom\n\nreceived life sentences and three of whom received sentences of\n\nmore than twenty years.\n\n           The    government      charged    this    case    as    involving      one\n\noverarching      conspiracy    from    January      1990    to    March   1994    to\n\ndistribute drugs at Bitumul (Israel Ward) in Hato Rey, San Juan,\n\nPuerto Rico and to protect that distribution through multiple\n\nmurders.      Twenty-two      defendants     were   indicted      on    charges    of\n\nconspiracy with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of\n\ncocaine, more than five kilograms of cocaine base, more than five\n\nkilograms of heroin, and more than 100 kilograms of marijuana over\n\na four-year period, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).                   Two of\n\nthese defendants,       William    Soto-Beníquez      and    Juan      Soto-Ramírez\n\n(a/k/a Pipo), were also charged with violating the Continuing\n\nCriminal Enterprise (CCE) statute, 21 U.S.C. § 848(a) and (b). The\n\ngovernment alleged that Soto-Ramírez headed the conspiracy and that\n\nSoto-Beníquez was the triggerman and principal supplier.                          The\n\nremaining nine appellants were charged with playing various roles\n\nin distributing drugs or protecting the distribution of drugs.\n\n           The original twenty-two defendants were separated into\n\ntwo groups.    The first group of eleven, comprised of those who the\n\ngovernment said were more major players in the conspiracy, were\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\ftried before a jury from December 28, 1998 to June 25, 1999.                      The\n\njury convicted all eleven defendants on all counts with which they\n\nwere charged.\n\n           The     two    CCE   defendants          were     sentenced    to      life\n\nimprisonment on Count One, the CCE count, while Count Two, the\n\nconspiracy count, was dismissed as to them under the rule of\n\nRutledge   v.    United   States,   517      U.S.    292    (1996).      Six   other\n\ndefendants were also sentenced to life imprisonment:                        Alicea-\n\nTorres, Fernández-Malavé, Vega-Pacheco, García-García, Vega-Cosme,\n\nand   Cintrón-Caraballo.         The   remaining           three   --   Vega-Colón,\n\nGonzalez-Ayala, and de León Maysonet -- were each sentenced to 292\n\nmonths of imprisonment.\n\n           These    appeals     present      three    substantial       issues:      a\n\nmultiple conspiracy issue, an issue of improper argument by the\n\ngovernment in its rebuttal closing argument, and a set of Apprendi\n\nsentencing issues.        Defendants' key theme on appeal is that the\n\ngovernment overcharged the conspiracy in at least two significant\n\nrespects. First, defendants argue that, assuming Soto-Beníquez and\n\nSoto-Ramírez did distribute drugs to points in Bitumul from 1990\n\nuntil late 1992 or early 1993, the drug points were largely\n\nindependent; the fact of a common supplier does not mean the\n\nindependent drug point operators agreed to a conspiracy, much less\n\nto the ensuing murders.         Second, defendants argue that, by late\n\n1992, both Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez were out of action: one\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fhad been imprisoned and the other had left for Florida after\n\nnarrowly escaping an attempt on his life.           Any conspiracy was by\n\nthen concluded, defendants assert, and the government's attempts to\n\ninclude another year's worth of events, until March 1994, in the\n\nconspiracy were improper.        Those events involved a different and\n\nrival drug dealer, Rodríguez-López (a/k/a El Bebo), and took place\n\npartly in another town called Fajardo.          The defendants argue that\n\nif their theory as to multiple conspiracies is correct, then there\n\nare significant ramifications that affect the application of the\n\nstatute    of     limitations,     the      admissibility       of   testimony\n\n(particularly, evidence of fifteen horrific            murders), the refusal\n\nto sever certain defendants, and various sentencing determinations.\n\n           The defendants also complain, with justification, about\n\nthe government's poor record of pre-trial production of required\n\nmaterials, as well as its belated springing of requested sentencing\n\nenhancements      on   certain    defendants     after    the    Pre-Sentence\n\nInvestigative Report (PSR) had been prepared and the defendants'\n\nobjections to it had been served.           The trial court was obviously\n\nfrustrated      with   the   government's    conduct     in   this   case   and\n\nthreatened three times to dismiss the indictment, but in the end\n\ndid not.   Post-trial, the court also found the evidence sufficient\n\nto support the convictions.\n\n             Over twenty-five issues are raised in these appeals and\n\nare discussed in the sequence of events leading to and through\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\ftrial, with the exception of the multiple conspiracies issue, which\n\nwe discuss first.\n\n                                      I.\n\n              The facts are stated, for sufficiency of the evidence\n\npurposes, as a reasonable jury could have found them, in the light\n\nmost favorable to the verdict.\n\n              The government's case turned on the testimony of several\n\ncooperating co-conspirators -- Ramón Cesário-Soto,              Victor Negrón-\n\nMaldonado (a/k/a Pitosito), and Luis Torrens-Alicea (a/k/a Pito\n\nSalsa)   --    as   well   as   the   testimony   of   police    officers   and\n\ninvestigators.\n\n              The case centers around six drug points in the Bitumul\n\nWard of Hato Rey, San Juan, Puerto Rico: (1) Callejón Nueve,\n\noperated by Juan Soto-Ramírez and later by Negrón-Maldonado, (2) La\n\nPared, also operated by Soto-Ramírez, (3) Street B between La Pared\n\nand Callejón Nueve, operated by Juan Cintrón-Caraballo and supplied\n\nby Soto-Ramírez, (4) El Palo on Laguna Street, operated by Alberto\n\nSantiago-Figueroa, a defendant not participating in this trial, and\n\nsupplied by Soto-Ramírez, (5) Cuba Street, which included two\n\ndistribution points operated by Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez, and\n\n(6) Laguna Street, operated by Miguel Vega-Cosme.               These points,\n\nwhich began operation around 1990, dealt in crack cocaine, cocaine,\n\nheroin, and marijuana.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f           Soto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez were the leaders of the\n\noperation.     Soto-Ramírez operated or supplied almost all of the\n\ndrug points.      His house at Callejón Dos was used by various\n\ndefendants to prepare crack and heroin for distribution at the six\n\ndrug points and to store weapons to defend and acquire territory\n\nfor the drug points.    When defendant Miguel Vega-Cosme established\n\nhis drug point on Laguna Street with his son, defendant Miguel\n\nVega-Colón, he first requested permission from Soto-Ramírez.\n\n             Soto-Beníquez served as the triggerman and principal\n\nsupplier. He ultimately supplied most of the narcotics sold at the\n\ndrug points and owned many of the weapons used to kill rival gang\n\nmembers.     Cesário-Soto described him as \"one with ranks\" in the\n\ndrug world.\n\n             The remaining defendants were involved in running one or\n\nmore of the six drug points.     Eduardo Alicea-Torres sold drugs at\n\nthe Cuba Street and Callejón Dos drug points from 1990 until at\n\nleast 1991, and later began his own drug point.     Ramon Fernández-\n\nMalavé packaged crack and cocaine for Soto-Ramírez and cooperating\n\ngovernment witness Negrón-Maldonado in 1992.    Carmelo Vega-Pacheco\n\npackaged drugs for Soto-Ramírez and Negrón-Maldonado through 1992,\n\nand sold narcotics at the Cuba Street drug points in 1990 and 1991.\n\nArmando García-García sold narcotics at the Cuba Street drug points\n\nfrom 1990 to 1991, packaged drugs in 1992, and sold drugs at\n\nCallejón Nueve in 1993.     From 1990 to 1992, Jose de León Maysonet\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fstored narcotics and weapons for the drug points, and after 1992,\n\nhe sold narcotics at Callejón Nueve.         Juan Cintrón-Caraballo\n\noperated the Street B drug point throughout the charged conspiracy.\n\nMiguel Vega-Cosme supplied Soto-Ramírez with narcotics and operated\n\na drug point at Laguna Street from 1990 until 1994 with Soto-\n\nRamírez's permission.   Vega-Cosme also supplied ammunition used in\n\nshootings of rival gang members in 1992 and 1993, and negotiated on\n\nbehalf of the group in seeking to resolve its differences with the\n\nrival Chacho gang.      Miguel Vega-Colón, the son of Vega-Cosme,\n\npackaged crack cocaine, heroin, and marijuana for his father and\n\nstood as an armed guard at the Callejón Nueve drug point, a point\n\nseparate from the one his father ran on Laguna Street.\n\n          Several of the defendants were involved in a series of\n\nmurders undertaken to defend and acquire territory in Bitumul on\n\nbehalf of the conspiracy.   The first of these killings occurred on\n\nFebruary 10, 1991. Soto-Ramírez confessed to Negrón-Maldonado that\n\nhe, along with two deceased members of the conspiracy, killed\n\nDagoberto Robles-Rodríguez because he felt threatened by Robles-\n\nRodríguez.   Soto-Ramírez then gained control of Robles-Rodríguez's\n\nheroin point on Cuba Street.   Soto-Ramírez pled guilty in a Puerto\n\nRico court to Robles-Rodríguez's homicide.\n\n          Another killing occurred on February 20, 1991.         As\n\ngovernment informant Ana Luz Dones-Arroyo was leading undercover\n\npolice officer Efrain Hernández de León to the location at Callejón\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fDos where Soto-Ramírez and others stored their weapons, both were\n\ngunned down. Soto-Ramírez shot Dones-Arroyo, and defendant Alicea-\n\nTorres killed the police officer and disposed of the body.                 A\n\nballistics expert testified that the same two weapons used in the\n\nmurder of Robles-Rodríguez were used to kill Dones-Arroyo and\n\nHernández de León.\n\n           According to Negrón-Maldonado's testimony, several more\n\nmurders occurred after these two.           On July 20, 1991, Soto-Ramírez\n\nordered the murder of one of his sellers at the Cuba Street drug\n\npoint, Fernando Agosto-Villegas, because two-eighths of a kilogram\n\nof   cocaine   and   a   machine   gun   belonging   to   Soto-Ramírez   were\n\nmissing.   On May 12, 1992, Soto-Beníquez ordered the murder of\n\nHeriberto Rivera-González in retribution for the death of Jose\n\nCosme-Sobrado (a/k/a Canito), who had been managing several of\n\nSoto-Ramírez's drug points.          Rivera-González was suspected of\n\nparticipating in the murder of Cosme-Sobrado earlier that day.\n\nDefendant Cintrón-Caraballo, cooperating government witness Negrón-\n\nMaldonado, and two other members of the group kidnapped Rivera-\n\nGonzález and brought him to Callejón Dos, where Negrón-Maldonado\n\nand others killed him.        Finally, on November 25, 1992, Negrón-\n\nMaldonado, Soto-Beníquez, and another co-conspirator not on trial\n\nhere, Juan Antonio Rodríguez-López, killed Reynaldo Cancel-Robles.\n\nSoto-Beníquez supplied a drug dealer named \"Cuelli,\" who owned a\n\ndrug point outside Bitumul in the Vista Hermosa housing project.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fCancel-Robles was killed because he had ousted \"Cuelli\" from this\n\ndrug point.\n\n          On December 20, 1992, gang warfare broke out between the\n\ngroup and members of a rival gang led by \"Chacho.\"      A shootout\n\noccurred between the two gangs, in which Angel Rivera-Pagán, a\n\nmember of Soto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez's group, was killed.\n\nEight days later, Negrón-Maldonado, Rodríguez-López, and others\n\nretaliated by murdering Roberto Vasallo-Morninglane, a member of\n\nthe Chacho gang.\n\n          The gang warfare continued, and several days later, on\n\nJanuary 10, 1993, defendant Vega-Pacheco, government witnesses\n\nCesário-Soto and Negrón-Maldonado, Rodríguez-López, and others went\n\nto the Quintana housing project and killed five more people, two of\n\nwhom were members of the Chacho gang.     Vega-Pacheco later pled\n\nguilty in a Puerto Rico court to participating in those five\n\nmurders, which came to be known as the Quintana massacre.\n\n          Yet another murder took place on March 7, 1993, when\n\ndefendant Fernández-Malavé killed Tito Dones-Sanchez.        Negrón-\n\nMaldonado and Cesário-Soto testified that Fernández-Malavé opened\n\nfire on a white van after Cintrón-Caraballo and other dealers at\n\nthe Callejón Nueve drug point saw it driving nearby and suspected\n\nthat those inside were members of the rival El Visco gang.    Dones-\n\nSanchez was later found dead inside a white van of the same\n\ndescription, which a municipal police officer had witnessed leaving\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fthe Bitumul area.   Fernández-Malavé pled guilty in a Puerto Rico\n\ncourt to the murder of Dones-Sanchez.\n\n           While these murders were occurring in 1992 and 1993, some\n\nchanges occurred in the leadership of the group.      On January 8,\n\n1992, Soto-Ramírez was incarcerated after pleading guilty in a\n\nPuerto Rico court to various crimes, including attempted murder.\n\nAfter Soto-Beníquez was shot in an assassination attempt, he ceased\n\nactivities in Bitumul in December 1992 and moved to Florida in\n\n1993.   While Soto-Ramírez was in prison, Cosme-Sobrado managed\n\nthree of Soto-Ramírez's drug points until Cosme-Sobrado was killed\n\non May 12, 1992. Negrón-Maldonado then took over managing the\n\npoints until he left for Philadelphia in June or July 1993.    When\n\nmanaging the points, both Cosme-Sobrado and Negrón-Maldonado took\n\ninstructions from Soto-Ramírez through telephone calls from prison\n\nand forwarded the proceeds from the drug points to Soto-Ramírez's\n\nwife.\n\n           In June or July 1993, Rodríguez-López, a former member of\n\nthe group, returned to Bitumul from Fajardo, where he had fled\n\nafter the Quintana massacre.    Rodríguez-López had teamed up with\n\ndefendant Rene Gonzalez-Ayala and government witness Torrens-Alicea\n\nto steal a two hundred kilogram shipment of cocaine at a beach in\n\nFajardo.   Without consulting anyone in Bitumul, Rodríguez-López\n\nbrought the cocaine back to Bitumul and established a \"new\" drug\n\npoint at Callejón Nueve, where Soto-Ramírez's drug point had been\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fabandoned.      Rodríguez-López      employed    several   members   of   the\n\noriginal group in setting up the new drug point, including García-\n\nGarcía and de León Maysonet, but he also brought in individuals\n\nfrom outside Bitumul, including Gonzalez-Ayala and Torrens-Alicea.\n\n             Tension arose between Rodríguez-López and the members of\n\nthe original group, in particular Cintrón-Caraballo and Negrón-\n\nMaldonado, over the influx of outsiders working at the new drug\n\npoint at Callejón Nueve.      Torrens-Alicea testified, however, that\n\nafter Negrón-Maldonado returned from Philadelphia, he \"ironed out\"\n\nthese differences with Rodríguez-López over the course of two\n\nmeetings in August or September 1993.\n\n             Around   that   time,   several    defendants   again   became\n\ninvolved in violent activities.             According to Torrens-Alicea's\n\ntestimony, on September 12, 1993, de León Maysonet, Gonzalez-Ayala,\n\nGarcía-García, and three other members of the gang went to Fajardo\n\nto find and kill an individual named Vitito, who had been hired to\n\nkill those responsible for the stolen cocaine in Fajardo.                 They\n\nnever found Vitito. Instead, de León Maysonet, Gonzalez-Ayala, and\n\nanother member of the gang were arrested in Fajardo while in\n\npossession of a firearm and eleven decks of heroin; both de León\n\nMaysonet and Gonzalez-Ayala pled guilty in Puerto Rico court to the\n\ncharges.     On October 11, 1993, Torrens-Alicia, García-García, and\n\ntwo others killed Oscar Nazario-Rivera in Floral Park, Hato Rey,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fbecause he was a member of the Chacho gang and had threatened\n\nRodríguez-López.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            On April 10, 1997, a federal grand jury in Puerto Rico\n\nreturned a two-count indictment against the eleven appellants,\n\nalong with ten other defendants.         Count One charged Soto-Beníquez\n\nand Soto-Ramírez with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 848(a) and (b).          Count Two charged that\n\nfrom about January 1, 1990, until about March 7, 1994, all twenty-\n\none defendants conspired to distribute more than five kilograms of\n\nheroin, more     than   five   kilograms   of     cocaine,   more   than   five\n\nkilograms   of   cocaine   base,   and     more    than    100   kilograms   of\n\nmarijuana, as prohibited by 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846.\n\n            Rodríguez-López, who became a cooperating witness in the\n\npre-trial stage of the case, testified to the grand jury.                    The\n\ngovernment eventually discovered that he had lied before the grand\n\njury about his presence at a murder.         The government informed the\n\ngrand jury about the false testimony, and on December 14, 1998,\n\nobtained a superseding indictment.         In the superseding indictment,\n\nthe government alleged the same charges against the same twenty-one\n\ndefendants listed in the original indictment.             The government also\n\nadded Rodríguez-López as a defendant to the conspiracy charge of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fthe superseding indictment, thus raising the total number of\n\ndefendants to twenty-two.\n\n            On December 28, 1998, the district court divided the\n\ntwenty-two defendants into two groups for trial purposes.          At that\n\npoint, sixteen of the original twenty-two defendants were slated to\n\ngo to trial.     The district court selected the eleven appellants as\n\nthe first group to be tried.        After an eighty-six-day trial, the\n\njury returned a guilty verdict as to all eleven defendants on all\n\ncounts for which they were charged.\n\n           All eleven defendants appealed.       This court consolidated\n\ntheir appeals.\n\n                                    III.\n\nA.     Sufficiency of the Evidence Proving a Single Conspiracy\n       (García-García, de León Maysonet, Gonzalez-Ayala)\n\n            To join a drug conspiracy, a defendant must agree with\n\nothers to advance the aim of the conspiracy -- here, to possess\n\ndrugs for distribution.      United States v. Garcia-Torres, 280 F.3d\n\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002).       Advancing the aim of the conspiracy can\n\ninvolve performing ancillary functions such as processing and\n\ncooking drugs, procuring weapons, collecting monies, enforcing\n\ndiscipline, chastising rivals, accounting, and the like, as long as\n\nsuch   actions    are   performed   with   the   aim   of   furthering   the\n\nconspiracy.      See id.    To hold that defendants have \"joined\" a\n\nconspiracy, there must be sufficient evidence both that they knew\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fabout the conspiracy and that they knew the ancillary service would\n\nadvance that conspiracy.     Id.\n\n            Special issues arise when defendants argue that there\n\nwere multiple conspiracies and that their activities were not part\n\nof the conspiracy charged.    The initial issue -- and the only issue\n\nwe need to reach here -- is whether the government proved the\n\nconspiracy charged in the indictment.       This issue, assuming a\n\nproperly instructed jury, resolves into a sufficiency-of-evidence\n\nquestion.     United States v. Martinez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105, 113 &\n\nn.2 (1st Cir. 2002); United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 773-74\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).     If the evidence is sufficient to support the\n\njury's finding that all the defendants are guilty of the single\n\nconspiracy charged, then no error has occurred.1\n\n            A number of factors come into play in determining whether\n\nthe evidence establishes a single conspiracy,2 including (1) the\n\n\n     1\n          If the evidence instead establishes agreements different\nfrom those charged, the next issue is variance.      The reviewing\ncourt asks whether the evidence is sufficient to permit a properly\ninstructed jury to convict the defendant of a similar related\nconspiracy, and if so, whether the variance between the two\nconspiracies affected the substantial rights of the defendant.\nUnited States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d 855, 858 (1st Cir. 1987); see also\nKotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 774 (1946). We need not\nreach this step of the inquiry in this case because we find\nsufficient evidence to support the finding of a single conspiracy.\n     2\n          In some cases, the indictment itself sets forth\ndifferent, often sequential conspiracies in multiple counts. See,\ne.g., United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722 (1st Cir. 1991).\nDefendants then may argue that there is only one conspiracy, not\ntwo, and that they may not be sentenced for two conspiracies\nwithout violating the double jeopardy clause. Id. at 732. This\n\n                                   -18-\n\fexistence of a common purpose, such as selling drugs for profit,\n\n(2) the interdependency of various elements in the plan, such as\n\nwhether the success of an individual's own drug transactions\n\ndepends on the health and success of the drug trafficking network\n\nthat   supplies    him,    and    (3)    the    degree   of   overlap    among    the\n\nparticipants.     See Martinez-Medina, 279 F.3d at 114; United States\n\nv. Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263, 268 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.\n\nPortela, 167 F.3d 687, 697 (1st Cir. 1999).                         We look to the\n\ntotality of the evidence to see if it supports a finding of a\n\nsingle conspiracy. Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d at 268; Portela, 167 F.3d\n\nat 696.   The government need not show that each conspirator knew of\n\nor had contact with all other members.                Nor need it show that the\n\nconspirators      knew    all    of    the   details     of   the    conspiracy    or\n\nparticipated in every act in furtherance of the conspiracy. United\n\nStates v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1032 (1st Cir. 1993).                  Changes\n\nin the cast of characters do not preclude a finding of a single\n\noverarching conspiracy.          United States v. Shea, 211 F.3d 658, 665\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           The    defendants          present   two   main    challenges    to    the\n\nsufficiency of evidence proving a single conspiracy.                    First, they\n\nargue that there was no conspiracy at all because Soto-Ramírez and\n\nSoto-Beníquez were simply common distributors to a number of\n\n\n\ncourt uses a similar totality of the circumstances, multi-factored\napproach in analyzing a claim of that type. Id. at 734.\n\n                                         -19-\n\fdiverse and independent drug points.          This argument is belied by\n\nthe record, which shows a great deal more than common distribution.\n\nThe evidence establishes not only that Soto-Ramírez and Soto-\n\nBeníquez were the primary suppliers of the six drug points, but\n\nalso that the six drug points shared a common system of defense.\n\nVarious defendants stood guard at drug points owned by other co-\n\nconspirators to protect them from rival gang members. For example,\n\nVega-Colón, who worked at his father's point on Laguna Street, also\n\nstood as an armed guard at Rodríguez-López's point on Callejón\n\nNueve.   Those   standing   guard   at     different   drug   points   shared\n\nresources with each other.       They communicated among themselves via\n\nwalkie-talkies    or   radios,   issuing     alerts    when   the   police   or\n\nunfamiliar cars from outside Bitumul were in the area.              They also\n\nshared rifles purchased and stored by Soto-Beníquez, and ammunition\n\npurchased by Vega-Cosme after taking up collections from each of\n\nthe drug points.       When the drug points were threatened by rival\n\ngangs, members of the group would join together to guard vulnerable\n\npoints from attack.       After the shootout with the Chacho gang in\n\nDecember 1992, Negrón-Maldonado, Fernández-Malavé, and Vega-Pacheco\n\nstood guard together at Callejón Dos. And after the conspiracy was\n\nthreatened by members of the El Vizco gang, Soto-Beníquez, Negrón-\n\nMaldonado, Fernández-Malavé, and Cintrón-Caraballo stood guard\n\ntogether at the Street B drug point.            The six drug points also\n\nnegotiated as a group in settling disputes with rival gangs.             When\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fwar broke out against the Chacho gang at the end of 1992, Vega-\n\nCosme met with Chacho to negotiate on behalf of all six drug points\n\nbecause the war was interfering with drug sales at the Bitumul\n\npoints.\n\n            Furthermore, members of the group jointly avenged the\n\ndeaths of others involved in the operation of the six drug points.\n\nAfter the death of Cosme-Sobrado, who managed Soto-Ramírez's drug\n\npoints while he was in prison, members of the group met at Callejón\n\nDos.   Individuals from different drug points attended the meeting,\n\nincluding Soto-Beníquez and Alicea-Torres (Cuba Street point),\n\nVega-Cosme and Vega-Colón (Laguna Street point), Cintrón-Caraballo\n\n(Street B point), and Negrón-Maldonado (Callejón Nueve point).       As\n\na result of the meeting, Negrón-Maldonado and Cintrón-Caraballo\n\ncame together to kidnap and murder Rivera-González, whom Soto-\n\nRamírez's   wife   suspected   of   participating   in   Cosme-Sobrado's\n\nmurder.\n\n            In addition to this system of common defense, the co-\n\nconspirators had agreements regarding the distribution of narcotics\n\nat the drug points.    Vega-Cosme and Negrón-Maldonado met at least\n\nthree times to assign colors to the caps of crack capsules sold at\n\ndifferent points in the Bitumul Ward so that their origin could be\n\nidentified and competition between the points avoided.        Vega-Cosme\n\nalso asked Soto-Ramírez for permission before setting up his drug\n\npoint with his son Vega-Colón on Laguna Street.\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\f           The evidence supports the jury's finding that each of the\n\ndefendants joined in this common enterprise.    First, the evidence\n\nestablishes that each defendant joined in the common defense of the\n\npoints.    Seven of the defendants -- Soto-Ramírez, Soto-Beníquez,\n\nAlicea-Torres, Vega-Pacheco, Fernández-Malavé, García-García, and\n\nCintrón-Caraballo -- ordered or participated in murders to protect\n\nthe drug points.    Soto-Ramírez and Alicea-Torres killed a police\n\nofficer and a government informant who were about to discover the\n\ngroup's stash of weapons used to protect the drug points.     Soto-\n\nRamírez ordered the murder of one of his drug dealers when some\n\ncocaine and a machine gun disappeared, sending the message that\n\nthose who broke ranks and stole from the group would be punished.\n\nSee United States v. Rodriguez, 162 F.3d 135, 143 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(finding the beating of a member of the conspiracy suspected of\n\nbeing an informant to be in furtherance of the conspiracy because\n\nit served to \"maintain[] discipline in [the conspiracy's] ranks\").\n\nOn Soto-Beníquez's orders, Cintrón-Caraballo kidnapped Rivera-\n\nGonzález and brought him to Bitumul to be killed to avenge the\n\ndeath of Cosme-Sobrado.   Vega-Pacheco participated in the Quintana\n\nmassacre to avenge the death of Rivera-Pagán, a member of the\n\ngroup.    While defending the group's territory at Callejón Nueve,\n\nFernández-Malavé killed Tito Dones-Sanchez by opening fire on a van\n\nsuspected of containing rival gang members.    García-García killed\n\na member of the rival Chacho gang who threatened Rodríguez-López.\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f              Although not direct participants in those murders, the\n\nremaining four defendants also contributed to the common defense of\n\nthe drug points.            We put aside, for the moment, the issue of\n\nwhether   the    group's      post-1993      activities    involved     a   separate\n\nconspiracy.      De León Maysonet and Gonzalez-Ayala went to Fajardo\n\nfor the purpose of killing someone who threatened Rodríguez-López.\n\nVega-Cosme supplied ammunition for shootings of rival gang members\n\nin 1992 and 1993 and negotiated on behalf of the group with the\n\nChacho gang.      Vega-Colón stood as an armed guard at Rodríguez-\n\nLópez's point on Callejón Nueve.\n\n              Second, in addition to evidence that each defendant\n\nparticipated in the system of common defense, there is evidence\n\nthat each defendant participated in the common enterprise of\n\nselling drugs through the six points.              We again put aside for the\n\nmoment whether the group's post-1993 activities involved a separate\n\nconspiracy.      Soto-Ramírez controlled several drug points, and his\n\nhouse   was    used    to    prepare   and    package     crack   and   heroin   for\n\ndistribution at several of the drug points.                Soto-Beníquez was the\n\nprimary supplier of cocaine and crack to the six drug points.\n\nAlicea-Torres and Vega-Pacheco sold narcotics for points owned by\n\nSoto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez from 1990 to 1991. Fernández-Malavé\n\npackaged crack cocaine, cocaine, and heroin from 1992 to 1993, and\n\npackaged cocaine specifically for Soto-Ramírez from May 1992 to\n\nDecember 1992.        García-García sold narcotics for Soto-Beníquez and\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fSoto-Ramírez     from    1990    to   1991,       packaged   narcotics    in   1992,\n\nreturned   to    selling     narcotics        for    Rodríguez-López      in   1993.\n\nCintrón-Caraballo supervised a drug point for crack cocaine and\n\ndistributed cocaine and crack cocaine for Soto-Ramírez throughout\n\nthe duration of the conspiracy.              Gonzalez-Ayala helped Rodríguez-\n\nLópez steal 200 kilograms of cocaine for the conspiracy in 1993 and\n\nsubsequently     packaged       and   distributed      it.     De    Leon-Maysonet\n\npackaged and stored narcotics for the conspiracy from 1990 to 1992\n\nand then sold narcotics at the Callejón Nueve point in 1993.\n\nVega-Cosme supplied ammunition and narcotics to Soto-Ramírez and\n\ndistributed heroin at a drug point with Soto-Ramírez's permission\n\nthroughout      the     duration      of     the    conspiracy.        Vega-Colón,\n\nVega-Cosme's son, packaged crack, heroin, and marijuana for his\n\nfather's point.\n\n           The    second    argument         challenging     the    sufficiency   of\n\nevidence proving a single conspiracy is presented by defendants\n\nGarcía-García, de León Maysonet and Gonzalez-Ayala.                      They argue\n\nthat the government overreached in counting as part of one massive\n\nconspiracy a separate, later, and antagonistic drug-selling group.\n\nThe three defendants argue that they cannot be guilty of the\n\ncontinuing conspiracy when they were in competition with the\n\noriginal conspiracy and the original conspirators were out to kill\n\nthe head of their drug group.              They concede that the evidence does\n\nshow their involvement with separate drug points. But the evidence\n\n\n                                           -24-\n\fdoes not, they contend, show that they participated in an overall\n\ndrug conspiracy headed by Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez.      They\n\nargue that this conspiracy effectively ended by the summer of 1993.\n\nIn January 1992, Soto-Ramírez was arrested and incarcerated.   And\n\nWilliam Soto-Beníquez, after escaping death in a shootout, ceased\n\nactivities in Bitumul in December 1992 and moved to Florida in\n\n1993. Cosme-Sobrado, who succeeded Soto-Ramírez, was killed on May\n\n12, 1992, and Victor Negrón-Maldonado left for Philadelphia in June\n\nor July 1993.\n\n          The three defendants argue that later events centered\n\naround a separate conspiracy, led by Rodríguez-López.   Rodríguez-\n\nLópez, who had originally been part of the conspiracy headed by\n\nSoto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez, left Bitumul for Fajardo in the\n\nsummer of 1993 to avoid being arrested for his involvement in the\n\nQuintana massacre.     While in Fajardo, he stole a 200 kilogram\n\nshipment of cocaine.   Upon his return to San Juan in June or July\n\nof 1993, and without consulting anyone in Bitumul, Rodríguez-López\n\nreestablished a drug point at Callejón Nueve with the stolen\n\ncocaine, employing outsiders from Fajardo to operate the point.\n\nNegrón-Maldonado testified that while he was in Philadelphia, he\n\nhad telephone conversations with people in Bitumul, including\n\nCintrón-Caraballo, who wanted to kill Rodríguez-López for bringing\n\noutsiders into the Bitumul operation; Torrens-Alicea confirmed that\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fsome members of the original group \"were out to kill\" Rodríguez-\n\nLópez.\n\n           Each of the three defendants argues that the multiple\n\nconspiracies theory affects his liability in a different way.\n\nGonzalez-Ayala contends that, at most, he was a member only of a\n\nlater uncharged conspiracy headed by Rodríguez-López; he did not\n\njoin any conspiracy at all until the summer of 1993, when he helped\n\nRodríguez-López steal the shipment of cocaine and returned with\n\nRodríguez-López     to     set   up   the   drug   point   at   Callejón    Nueve.\n\nGonzalez-Ayala thus contends that no evidence ties him to the other\n\nBitumul drug points or the earlier murders connected with those\n\ndrug points.\n\n           De León Maysonet contends that he was prejudiced by the\n\ngovernment's      single     conspiracy       theory   because     all     of   his\n\nparticipation in the original conspiracy occurred while he was a\n\nminor.    He was nonetheless held liable as an adult because he\n\nsupposedly ratified the conspiracy by continuing to participate\n\nafter he turned eighteen on January 12, 1992.                   United States v.\n\nWelch, 15 F.3d 1202, 1211-12 (1st Cir. 1993).                      He contends,\n\nhowever, that the only acts of ratification presented by the\n\ngovernment occurred after the original conspiracy had ended and\n\nRodríguez-López had taken over.\n\n           García-García argues that the government's presentation\n\nof   a   single    overarching        conspiracy,      rather     than   multiple\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fconspiracies, subjected him to evidence of murders in which he did\n\nnot participate.    García-García contends that the only murder in\n\nwhich he allegedly participated -- that of Oscar Nazario-Rivera --\n\noccurred after the original conspiracy ended and was not drug-\n\nrelated.\n\n            The jury was instructed on multiple conspiracies, at the\n\nrequest of the defense.   The district court informed the jury that\n\nit must acquit \"[e]ven if the evidence in the case shows that\n\ndefendants were a member of some conspiracy, and not the single\n\nconspiracy charged in the indictment.\" As noted earlier, where the\n\njury was properly instructed and found the defendants guilty of\n\nconspiracy, its verdict is reviewable only for sufficiency of\n\nevidence.    David, 940 F.2d at 732.\n\n            On the evidence, a jury could have concluded that there\n\nwas a later, rival conspiracy, but it was not compelled to do so.\n\nThere is sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict of\n\nguilt, as well as its implicit finding that a single conspiracy\n\nexisted that extended through the summer of 1993.    The jury could\n\nplausibly have found that Rodríguez-López was a member of the\n\noriginal conspiracy, that the reestablishment of the Callejón Nueve\n\ndrug point in the small neighborhood of Bitumul was part of an\n\nagreed-upon general operation to sell drugs and to control the drug\n\ntrade in Bitumul, that the tension among the members of the\n\noverarching group did not destroy the overall agreement, that those\n\n\n                                -27-\n\ftensions were worked out, and that the cooperation worked to\n\neveryone's benefit and continued to provide a system of common\n\ndefense.\n\n           Government informant Luis Torrens-Alicea testified that\n\ndifferences   between   Rodríguez-López     and    the   original   Bitumul\n\nconspiracy    were   \"ironed   out\"    during   two   meetings   involving\n\nRodríguez-López, Negrón-Maldonado, and Cintrón-Caraballo at the El\n\nTrebol housing project in August or September of 1993.3               Other\n\nevidence corroborates this account.       Members of the original group\n\ncontinued to transact and meet with Rodríguez-López after his\n\nreturn.    Negrón-Maldonado bought heroin on credit from Rodríguez-\n\nLópez on at least one occasion, and \"cooked\" crack cocaine for\n\nRodríguez-López.      \"Peter,\"   who    managed    Soto-Ramírez's    point,\n\nAlicea-Torres, and Vega-Cosme all distributed kilograms of cocaine\n\nfor Rodríguez-López after his return.             On September 12, 1993,\n\nGarcía-García, de León Maysonet, and two other members of the\n\noriginal Bitumul group joined together with newcomers Gonzalez-\n\nAyala and Torrens-Alicea to find and kill Vitito, who had been\n\nhired to kill those who had stolen the 200 kilogram shipment of\n\ncocaine in Fajardo.     Furthermore, after Rodríguez-López's return,\n\n\n\n     3\n          Torrens-Alicea also testified that, at this meeting,\nCintrón-Caraballo and Negrón-Maldonado informed Rodríguez-López\nthat they now sought to kill Soto-Ramírez and his associates.\nBecause Soto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez had already left Bitumul at\nthis point, however, these new tensions did not prevent the drug\npoints from working together, as described infra.\n\n                                  -28-\n\fSoto-Ramírez, Vega-Cosme, Cintrón-Caraballo, and Negrón-Maldonado\n\nall continued to operate the same drug points, and García-García,\n\nde León Maysonet, Alicea-Torres, Fernández-Malavé, and two other\n\nmembers of the original conspiracy continued to work at those\n\npoints.\n\n            Moreover, contrary to defendants' assertions that the\n\ndrug points operated independently after the summer of 1993, the\n\nevidence permitted the conclusion that they continued to work\n\ntogether.    Negrón-Maldonado's three meetings with Vega-Cosme to\n\ncoordinate the cap colors for crack capsules occurred between\n\nSeptember   and   November   of   1993,   three   to   five    months   after\n\nRodríguez-López's return.     In addition, members of the conspiracy\n\nacted jointly to defend each other from threats.                  Vega-Cosme\n\ncontinued to purchase ammunition for the collective defense of the\n\ndrug points.   On September 12, 1993, as mentioned earlier, members\n\nof the original Bitumul group joined with the newcomers to find and\n\nkill Vitito, who had been hired to kill Rodríguez-López and others.\n\nOn October 11, 1993, Torrens-Alicea, García-García, and two other\n\nindividuals murdered Oscar Nazario-Rivera, a member of the rival\n\nChacho gang who had threatened Rodríguez-López.               Members of the\n\nconspiracy also continued to warn one another about possible\n\nthreats.    In 1994, after Vega-Cosme's drug point was shot at by\n\nindividuals from San Jose, he went to Cintrón-Caraballo and Negrón-\n\nMaldonado to warn them of the danger.       And on several occasions in\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fearly 1994, after Alberto Santiago-Figueroa, who ran the El Palo\n\npoint on Laguna Street, saw people armed with rifles driving by his\n\npoint, he sent a messenger to inform Negrón-Maldonado of what he\n\nhad seen.\n\n            Because the record supports the jury's finding of a\n\nsingle conspiracy, the three defendants are liable for their\n\nparticipation.          Although   Gonzalez-Ayala    may   have    joined    the\n\nconspiracy late, as long as he did so knowingly, he is liable for\n\nthe conspiracy itself and earlier acts in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.       David, 940 F.2d at 735.       A jury could easily have\n\nfound that he joined knowingly.        Gonzalez-Ayala was present at the\n\nmeeting of Negrón-Maldonado, Cintrón-Caraballo, and Rodríguez-López\n\nin August or September of 1993, in which they worked out their\n\ndifferences.      He also participated in the trip to Fajardo to kill\n\nVitito.     Mere association with conspirators does not establish a\n\nknowing intent to join a conspiracy. United States v. Gomez-Pabon,\n\n911 F.2d 847, 853 (1st Cir. 1990).            But, in this situation, the\n\njury could have reasonably inferred from Gonzalez-Ayala's presence\n\nat negotiations between major players in the gang and from his\n\nparticipation in the hunt for Vitito that he knew or learned of\n\n\"the essential nature of the plan\" to distribute narcotics in\n\nBitumul     and   the    violent    tactics   used   to    carry    out     that\n\ndistribution.      Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d at 1032 (quoting United States\n\nv. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1019 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f           Similarly,       although     de    León   Maysonet    joined   the\n\nconspiracy as a minor, he ratified his participation after he had\n\nturned eighteen.       In 1993, he stood guard at the Callejón Nueve\n\npoint,    packaged    and    stored      narcotics    for   the   point,   and\n\nparticipated in the unsuccessful mission to Fajardo in 1993 to find\n\nand kill Vitito.\n\n           García-García actively participated in the conspiracy\n\nfrom the beginning, selling drugs at the Cuba Street point from\n\n1990 to 1991 and packaging narcotics for drug points from 1992 to\n\n1993.\n\n           We      reject   the     defendants'       multiple    conspiracies\n\narguments.\n\nB.   Pre-Trial\n\n     1.    Grand Jury Misconduct\n           (Soto-Beníquez, Soto-Ramírez, Fernández-Malavé)4\n\n             One event concerning a grand jury witness underlies a\n\nnumber of issues presented by the defense.\n\n             The   government     used   a    then-cooperating    conspirator,\n\nRodríguez-López, as a grand jury witness in obtaining the original\n\nindictment on April 10, 1997.            In July of 1998, the prosecution\n\nfirst learned that it might have been misled by Rodríguez-López.\n\n\n\n     4\n          A number of defendants present no argument on issues but\npurport to adopt arguments presented by other defendants on those\nissues.   In no instance in which that is done is the argument\nsuccessful. When an issue is listed as raised by a defendant, the\ndefendant listed is the one who argued the issue.\n\n                                       -31-\n\fNegrón-Maldonado, who had just started cooperating with federal\n\nauthorities, informed the prosecution that Rodríguez-López was not,\n\nas he had told the prosecution, present at Rivera-González's\n\nmurder.    When confronted with this information, Rodríguez-López\n\nadmitted that he had lied to FBI investigators about being present\n\nat the murder but insisted that he had not fabricated any of his\n\ntestimony before the grand jury, which did not address the Rivera-\n\nGonzález murder.\n\n           Rather than disclose this information immediately, the\n\nprosecution    waited      and    investigated.       In       November      1998,    the\n\ngovernment     learned     from    a    second   cooperating          defendant      that\n\nRodríguez-López also might have lied about his presence at several\n\nother murders, including at least one murder about which he had\n\ntestified to the grand jury, that of Rivera-Pagán. On November 18,\n\nthe government notified defense counsel of this inconsistency.                         It\n\nalso insisted that Rodríguez-López, who still denied lying to the\n\ngrand jury, take a polygraph test.               When he failed the test on\n\nDecember 1, Rodríguez-López admitted that he had indeed lied during\n\nthe grand jury proceedings and that he had not been present at\n\nRivera-Pagán's murder.           On December 14, the prosecution obtained a\n\nsuperseding indictment from the grand jury that changed Rodríguez-\n\nLópez   from   a   star    government      witness    to       a    defendant.        The\n\nsuperseding indictment, which was returned 15 days before trial\n\nstarted,   was     based   on     the   testimony    of    a       federal   agent    who\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\fpresented the government's evidence that Rodríguez-López had lied\n\nto the FBI.   Rodríguez-López did not testify at trial.\n\n          Several defendants object that their convictions were\n\nirreparably tainted by Rodríguez-López's perjury before the grand\n\njury. The trial court rejected this claim, holding that the fact\n\nthat the superseding indictment was obtained and the perjured\n\ntestimony was not presented at trial cured any problem.        That\n\nruling was correct.\n\n          The unknowing presentation of perjured testimony before\n\nthe grand jury was harmless and does not warrant any remedial\n\naction.   \"[A]s a general matter, a district court may not dismiss\n\nan indictment for errors in grand jury proceedings unless such\n\nerrors prejudiced the defendants.\"    Bank of Nova Scotia v. United\n\nStates, 487 U.S. 250, 254 (1988); see also United States v.\n\nFlores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 328 (1st Cir. 1995).          Here, the\n\ndistrict court specifically found that \"[d]efendants can hardly\n\nshow prejudice when the matter was later explained to the Grand\n\nJury and the perjured testimony has not been used in trial.\"     We\n\nreview this conclusion only for an abuse of discretion. See United\n\nStates v. Maceo, 873 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S.\n\n840 (1989).   No such abuse was present here.\n\n          First, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment\n\nafter learning of the perjured testimony, thereby demonstrating\n\n\n\n\n                               -33-\n\fthat sufficient evidence existed to indict the defendants even\n\nabsent the testimony of Rodríguez-López.\n\n           Of even greater import, a petit jury subsequently found\n\nthe defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charges\n\nalleged in the indictment. Such a finding \"demonstrates a fortiori\n\nthat there was probable cause to charge the defendants with the\n\noffenses   for    which   they   were   convicted.\"   United   States   v.\n\nLopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting United States\n\nv. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66, 67 (1986)).      As such, \"[a]ll but the most\n\nserious errors before the grand jury are rendered harmless by a\n\nconviction at trial.\"      United States v. Reyes-Echevarria, No. 02-\n\n1653, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 19614, at *6 (1st Cir. Sept. 22, 2003).\n\n\"Only a defect so fundamental that it causes the grand jury no\n\nlonger to be a grand jury, or the indictment no longer to be an\n\nindictment\" is sufficient to invalidate a subsequent conviction.\n\nId. (quoting Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794,\n\n802 (1989)).     The government's unknowing presentation of perjured\n\ntestimony before the grand jury is not a defect of that magnitude\n\non these facts.\n\n     2.    Indictment\n\n           a)     Pre-Indictment Delay\n                  (Soto-Beníquez, Soto-Ramírez)\n\n           Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez argue that the indictment\n\nshould have been dismissed because the government delayed in\n\nobtaining it. As discussed infra, the indictment complied with the\n\n                                   -34-\n\fstatute of limitations, which is the primary safeguard against pre-\n\nindictment delay.     When the statute of limitations has been met, a\n\ndefendant   seeking    reversal    of   his   conviction   based    on     pre-\n\nindictment delay \"bears the heavy burden of showing not only that\n\nthe pre-indictment delay caused him actual, substantial prejudice,\n\nbut also that the prosecution orchestrated the delay to gain a\n\ntactical advantage over him.\"        United States v. Stokes, 124 F.3d\n\n39, 46-47 (1st Cir. 1997); see also United States v. Marion, 404\n\nU.S. 307, 324 (1971).        Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez have not\n\nattempted to make such a showing.\n\n            b)   Constitutionality of CCE Indictment\n                 (Soto-Beníquez, Soto-Ramírez)\n\n                 i.    Failure to Charge Three Predicate CCE Acts\n\n            Soto-Beníquez    and   Soto-Ramírez   argue    that    their   CCE\n\nconvictions should be reversed because the indictment did not set\n\nforth as elements of the offense the three predicate offenses\n\nrequired for the crime of CCE, 21 U.S.C. § 848.            As described in\n\nour case law, the elements of a CCE crime are (1) the defendant\n\ncommitted a felony violation of the federal narcotics laws, (2) the\n\nviolation was part of a continuing series of violations, (3) the\n\nseries of offenses occurred in concert with five or more persons,\n\n(4) the defendant was an organizer, supervisor, or manager, and (5)\n\nthe defendant obtained substantial income or resources from the\n\nseries of violations.       United States v. Rouleau, 894 F.2d 13, 14\n\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\f(1st Cir. 1990).    To show a continuing series of violations, three\n\nor more predicate drug offenses must be demonstrated.     Id.\n\n          Defendants argue that their due process rights were\n\nviolated because they were deprived of adequate notice of the\n\npredicate offenses underlying the CCE charge.    Where the CCE count\n\nof an indictment does not list the specific predicate offenses but\n\nthose offenses are alleged in other counts of the indictment,\n\ncourts have generally held that defendants have received actual\n\nnotice of the charges and no reversible error has occurred. United\n\nStates v. Staggs, 881 F.2d 1527, 1530-31 (10th Cir. 1989) (finding\n\nindictment adequate where no underlying violations were specified\n\nin the CCE count but at least three underlying violations were\n\nlisted elsewhere in the indictment); United States v. Moya-Gomez,\n\n860 F.2d 706, 752 (7th Cir. 1988); United States v. Becton, 751\n\nF.2d 250, 256-57 (8th Cir. 1984).       We think it preferable for\n\npredicate offenses to be alleged in the CCE count.    But, at least\n\nwhere the CCE count incorporates by reference predicate offenses\n\ncharged elsewhere in the indictment, failure to list predicate\n\noffenses in the CCE count itself is not reversible error because\n\nthe defendant has been provided fair notice.    Moya-Gomez, 860 F.2d\n\nat 752; Becton, 751 F.2d at 256-57.\n\n          Here, while the CCE count did not explicitly set forth\n\nthree CCE predicate offenses, it incorporated Count Two, the\n\nconspiracy count.    Count Two did provide such notice.   Count Two\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\fstates that \"at divers times\" between January 1, 1990 and March 7,\n\n1994, the defendants distributed and possessed with intent to\n\ndistribute heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana.            It\n\nfurther states that the defendants \"would purchase multi-kilogram\n\nquantities of heroin, cocaine and marijuana at wholesale prices, .\n\n. . would cut, divide, and package [the drugs] in small packages\n\nfor subsequent sale at drug points, [and] . . . would sell packaged\n\n[drugs] in small quantities to customers at drug points.\"           That\n\ncount also alleges specifically that Soto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez\n\nsupervised the \"supply [of] sellers with the drugs to be sold . . .\n\nand [the sale of] narcotics at drug point,\" and that they would\n\n\"personally deliver packaged narcotics to [their] runners and\n\nsellers.\"\n\n            Defendants argue (1) that the acts described in Count Two\n\nare insufficient to provide notice because they establish only one\n\npredicate offense, namely, the conspiracy to distribute narcotics,5\n\nand   (2)   that   the   acts   are   insufficiently   described.   Both\n\nassertions are incorrect.       As to the defendants' first contention,\n\neach act of distribution described in the indictment constitutes a\n\nseparate predicate offense. See, e.g., United States v. Escobar-de\n\n\n\n      5\n          If the conspiracy is used to establish the continuing\nseries of violations, then defendants may be punished on the CCE\ncharge but not the conspiracy charge. Rutledge v. United States,\n517 U.S. 292, 307 (1996). Because the court eventually dismissed\nthe conspiracy charge, Count Two, against the two CCE defendants,\nthis is not an issue here.\n\n                                      -37-\n\fJesús,     187    F.3d     148,   160     n.6   (1st   Cir.     1999)     (treating   two\n\ndifferent incidents of possession with the intent to distribute as\n\ntwo separate predicate offenses).                  Multiple acts of distribution,\n\ncertainly        three    or    more,     are   alleged.        As   to   their   second\n\ncontention, the time period and acts are alleged in sufficient\n\ndetail to provide adequate notice.\n\n             Defendants then argue that the indictment failed to\n\nspecify either the amount of drugs distributed or the amount of\n\n\"substantial income\" received by the defendants, thus depriving\n\nthem of notice as to whether they were charged under 21 U.S.C. §\n\n848(a) or (b).           Section 848(a) carries a sentence of thirty years\n\nto life, whereas § 848(b) carries a mandatory life sentence.                           We\n\nreject defendants' argument.                Defendants, merely by reading the\n\nindictment, were on notice of the possibility of a life sentence.\n\nSection 848(b) requires life imprisonment for the \"principal . . .\n\nleaders\" of the continuing criminal enterprise if their violation\n\nof   the   drug     laws       involved    more    than   300    times     the   quantity\n\ndescribed in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).                    The indictment identified\n\nSoto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez as the two \"leader[s] . . . of the\n\ndrug-trafficking organization described in Counts One and Two.\" It\n\nalso identified them as conspiring to distribute, inter alia, more\n\nthan five kilograms of cocaine base, which is more than 300 times\n\nthe five grams of cocaine base described in § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                            -38-\n\f          Defendants      also   argue    that      in   the    indictment      the\n\npredicate offenses for the CCE charge were based on the conspiracy\n\ncount, but at trial, the government used evidence of uncharged\n\nnarcotics offenses to establish the predicate offenses.                      Thus,\n\ndefendants argue, although the CCE charge remained the same, the\n\nfacts used to prove the series element of the charge were different\n\nfrom those set forth in the indictment.\n\n          Defendants frame this argument as a claim of constructive\n\namendment, but it is actually a claim of variance. \"A constructive\n\namendment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\n\naltered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court\n\nafter the grand jury has last passed upon them.                A variance occurs\n\nwhen the charging terms remain unchanged but when the facts proved\n\nat trial are different from those alleged in the indictment.\"\n\nUnited States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456, 462 (1st Cir. 1993) (citations\n\nand quotation marks omitted). Convictions may be reversed based on\n\nvariance only upon a showing of prejudice to the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights -- that is, when lack of notice regarding the\n\ncharges deprives    the    defendant     of   his    ability     to   prepare    an\n\neffective defense and to avoid surprise at trial.                     Id.    Here,\n\ndefendants were not prejudiced.          The indictment charged them with\n\nviolations of narcotics laws from January 1990 to March 1994; the\n\nuse of narcotics offenses in that time period should have been no\n\nsurprise to them.\n\n\n                                   -39-\n\f               ii.   CCE Prosecution As Contrary to Congressional\n                     Intent\n\n          Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez next argue that their\n\nprosecution under the CCE statute is contrary to legislative\n\nintent.   That intent, they contend, is to enhance punishment for\n\nlarge-scale drug kingpins.   Defendants argue that the evidence did\n\nnot show them to be kingpins because they lived modestly.      The\n\ngovernment argues that we should not entertain this argument\n\nbecause the crime charged is within the statutory language and that\n\nends the inquiry.    If the crime charged is literally within the\n\nwords of the statute, there is not usually occasion to inquire into\n\nintent. See United States v. Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544, 551 (1979).\n\nThat is the case here.\n\n          To the extent that defendants' argument challenges the\n\nsufficiency of evidence as to the substantial income element of the\n\nCCE charge, it fails. Soto-Beníquez sold at least $10,000 worth of\n\ncocaine per week to Negrón-Maldonado.     Soto-Ramírez owned three\n\ndrug points for at least three years, each of which yielded\n\napproximately $5,000 per week from crack cocaine alone.       These\n\nfigures provide sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding\n\nof substantial income.\n\n          c)   Statute of Limitations\n               (Soto-Beníquez, Soto-Ramírez)\n\n          Soto-Beníquez   and   Soto-Ramírez   argue   that   their\n\nprosecution was untimely under the statute of limitations.    A CCE\n\n\n                                -40-\n\foffense consists of a series of three or more underlying predicate\n\noffenses. A CCE charge is within the statute of limitations if the\n\ngovernment     demonstrates      that     at    least    one    predicate     act     was\n\ncommitted in the five years prior to the indictment.                        See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Baker, 10 F.3d 1374, 1410 (9th Cir. 1993).                           In\n\nthis case, the indictment is dated April 11, 1997.                           Thus, the\n\nprosecution had to prove that one predicate act was committed on or\n\nafter April 12, 1992.\n\n              The    parties    dispute    which     acts      count   as    predicate\n\noffenses    for     purposes    of     determining      whether    the      statute    of\n\nlimitations has run.            Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez argue, by\n\nanalogy to the RICO statute, that only the acts of the parties\n\ncharged with the CCE count, and not those of their co-conspirators,\n\nmay be considered.        See    United States v. Torres-Lopez, 851 F.2d\n\n520, 524-25 (1st Cir. 1988) (applying this rule to substantive RICO\n\ncharges). The government argues that it need only demonstrate that\n\nacts in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred within the five-year\n\nlimitations period and that the defendants failed to withdraw from\n\nthe conspiracy.\n\n              We need not resolve this issue because the evidence,\n\nviewed   in    the    light     most    favorable       to   the   prosecution,        is\n\nsufficient to support the conclusion that both Soto-Ramírez and\n\nSoto-Beníquez themselves committed predicate offenses after April\n\n12, 1992.      Although Soto-Ramírez was incarcerated on January 8,\n\n\n                                         -41-\n\f1992, the government presented evidence that he still controlled\n\nand managed the drug points at La Pared, Callejón Nueve, and Cuba\n\nStreet.    While he was in prison, he employed Cosme-Sobrado to\n\nmanage the points until May 1992.           After Cosme-Sobrado was killed,\n\nSoto-Ramírez appointed \"Manolín\" and \"Peter\" as Cosme-Sobrado's\n\nsuccessors. Soto-Ramírez gave instructions on the operation of the\n\npoints by telephone, and the proceeds from the points were given to\n\nSoto-Ramírez's wife.         This evidence of Soto-Ramírez's own acts\n\nwithin    the    five-year   period    is    sufficient   to    establish   the\n\ntimeliness of his indictment.\n\n            Soto-Beníquez     argues    that    he   ceased    all   activities\n\nrelated to the conspiracy in December 1992 when he moved to\n\nFlorida.        Assuming arguendo that this statement is true, the\n\nDecember 1992 date does not help Soto-Beníquez. The operative date\n\nfor limitations purposes is April 12, 1992, some eight months\n\nearlier.    The record supports the conclusion that Soto-Beníquez\n\nengaged in predicate offenses after that date.                In January 1993,\n\nfor example, Soto-Beníquez provided transportation, firearms, and\n\na hide-out for members of the Bitumul gang after the Quintana\n\nmassacre, in which the gang murdered five people in retaliation for\n\nthe death of fellow gang member Rivera-Pagán.                  Soto-Beníquez's\n\nindictment was not barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\f     3.   Abuse of Prosecutorial Discretion\n          (Fernández-Malavé)\n\n          Fernández-Malavé makes a generalized protest that the\n\nfederal prosecution should never have been brought because he (and\n\nmany of the other defendants) had already pled guilty to related\n\nstate charges.    This argument does not present an issue that is\n\nreviewable by this court.      Whatever the contours of permissible\n\nattacks on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, this claim\n\nlies outside of those contours. See United States v. Stokes, 124\n\nF.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[T]he federal government [has] a\n\nperfect right to take a hard look at [a] case and to determine\n\nwhether   society's   interests   call    for   the   unusual    step   of\n\ninstituting   a   federal   prosecution    notwithstanding      the   prior\n\ncommencement of a state prosecution for substantially the same\n\nconduct.\").\n\n     4.   Pre-Trial Denial of Motions for Severance\n          (Gonzalez-Ayala, de León Maysonet)\n\n          Gonzalez-Ayala and de León Maysonet appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's denial of their motions to be severed and tried\n\nwith the second group of defendants.      On December 28, 1998, the day\n\non which jury selection began, the district court decided to split\n\nthe sixteen defendants who planned to go to trial into two groups.\n\nThe government proposed that the first ten defendants on the\n\nindictment become the first group to go to trial. The government's\n\nreasoning was that this division would allow the prosecution to\n\n\n                                  -43-\n\f\"try[] the senior conspirators together, that is the principal\n\nleaders, and the organizers and supervisors of the conspiracy\" and\n\nto \"try[] the conspirators who planned and carried [out] numerous\n\nacts of violence within the conspiracy together.\"                    The district\n\ncourt   initially    accepted        this   proposal   but    then    severed   one\n\ndefendant    to    allow   for   a    mental   competency     hearing,    another\n\ndefendant because he was on bond, and yet another defendant because\n\nhis counsel withdrew from the case on that day.                         Two other\n\ndefendants were severed because they could not yet proceed to\n\ntrial; one was still a fugitive and the other, Rodríguez-López, had\n\nbeen    indicted    only   two   weeks      earlier.     Having      severed    five\n\ndefendants, the district court was left with the eleven appellants\n\nand decided to proceed to trial with all eleven.\n\n            Gonzalez-Ayala and de León Maysonet contend that the\n\ndistrict court erred in refusing to sever their cases.                   Rule 14,\n\nFed. R. Crim. P., allows a trial court to sever defendants when\n\njoinder would prejudice them.           Gonzalez-Ayala and de León Maysonet\n\nargue that the joinder prejudiced them by forcing them to go to\n\ntrial with    more    senior     conspirators.         They   contend    that    the\n\ncomplexity of the case and the markedly different degrees of\n\nculpability between them and their co-defendants, many of whom\n\ncommitted murders or held leadership positions in the conspiracy,\n\ncreated the potential for jury confusion.                Moreover, they argue\n\nthat they were prejudiced by the presentation of spillover evidence\n\n\n                                        -44-\n\fregarding fifteen murders committed by their co-defendants, in\n\nwhich they did not participate.\n\n          We review the district court's denial of defendants'\n\nmotions for severance under Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 449 n.12 (1986);\n\nUnited States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 36 (1st Cir. 1998).                          To\n\ndemonstrate abuse of discretion, defendants must show that joinder\n\ndeprived them of a fair trial, resulting in a miscarriage of\n\njustice. United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nBecause the general rule is that those indicted together are tried\n\ntogether to prevent inconsistent verdicts and to conserve judicial\n\nand prosecutorial resources, severance is particularly difficult to\n\nobtain   where,   as   here,    multiple          defendants    share    a   single\n\nindictment.    United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n          Defendants     have       not    made   such   a   strong     showing    of\n\nprejudice.    As to the murder evidence, defendants cannot complain\n\nof an improper spillover effect where evidence is independently\n\nadmissible against them.        United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409,\n\n440 (1st Cir. 1994); O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 26.                 Because conspiracy\n\ncases often involve evidence that is admissible against all members\n\nof the conspiracy, \"in the context of conspiracy, severance will\n\nrarely, if ever, be required.\"              DeLuca, 137 F.3d at 36 (quoting\n\nFlores-Rivera,    56   F.3d    at    325     (internal   quotation      marks     and\n\n\n                                          -45-\n\fcitations omitted)).           Here, the murder evidence would likely be\n\nadmissible against Gonzalez-Ayala and de León Maysonet even in a\n\nseparate     trial   in    order      to     demonstrate   the   operation     and\n\ndevelopment of the conspiracy's system of common defense.\n\n           As to the complexity of the case and the potential for\n\njury confusion, there is no indication that the jury was unable to\n\ndistinguish the evidence and acts relating to each defendant.                  The\n\ncourt instructed the jury that each defendant must be judged\n\nseparately     based      on    the    evidence     admissible    against      him.\n\nDefendants are not entitled to severance solely on the basis that\n\ntheir co-defendants were more culpable. See Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d\n\nat 325; Brandon, 17 F.3d at 440-41.\n\n     5.    Pre-Trial Discovery\n           (Soto-Beníquez, Soto-Ramírez, Fernández-Malavé, Alicea-\n           Torres)\n\n           Defendants          make   both    a   generalized    attack   on   the\n\ngovernment's    habitual        dilatoriness      in   turning   over   discovery\n\nmaterial and more specific attacks.                Here, we address only the\n\nalleged lateness of the prosecution's compliance with discovery;\n\nthe Brady and Giglio claims are dealt with later, as are the\n\nspecific attacks.\n\n           Several of the defendants allege that the prosecution\n\nconsistently failed to respond to discovery requests and orders in\n\na timely fashion, and then \"smother[ed] [them] with an avalanche of\n\ndocuments during trial.\"              The defendants are correct that the\n\n\n                                           -46-\n\fprosecution     did,   on   several    occasions,    fail   to    comply   with\n\ndiscovery timetables set by the district court.             These discovery\n\nviolations do not warrant reversing the defendants' convictions.\n\n           We have long recognized that \"the decision as to whether\n\ndiscovery sanctions are warranted and the choice of what sanctions\n\nshould be imposed are matters within the sound discretion of the\n\ntrial court.\"     Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp), 340 F.3d 15, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 2003); Media Duplication Servs., Ltd. v. HDG Software, Inc.,\n\n928 F.2d 1228, 1238 (1st Cir. 1991).         As such, review of a district\n\ncourt's use or non-use of discovery sanctions is only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.     See United States v. One 1987 BMW 325, 985 F.2d 655,\n\n657 (1st Cir. 1993).          An abuse of discretion \"occurs when a\n\nmaterial factor deserving significant weight is ignored, when an\n\nimproper factor is relied upon, or when all proper and no improper\n\nfactors are assessed, but the court makes a serious mistake in\n\nweighing them.\"        Indep. Oil & Chem. Workers, Inc. v. Procter &\n\nGamble Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n           The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nrefusing   to   dismiss     the   indictment   due   to   the    prosecution's\n\ndiscovery violations.       Rather than resort to the drastic remedy of\n\ndismissal, the district court wisely addressed the prosecution's\n\nfailures to comply with discovery deadlines on a situation-by-\n\nsituation basis in order to prevent or remedy any prejudice that\n\nthose violations may have had on the defendants. Cf. United States\n\n\n                                      -47-\n\fv. Santana, 6 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 1993) (suggesting that a court\n\nshould not dismiss an indictment when prosecutorial misconduct is\n\n\"redressable through the utilization of less drastic disciplinary\n\ntools\").      For instance, in response to the government's failure to\n\ncomply with one discovery order, the district court chastised the\n\nprosecution and ordered the government to provide the defendants\n\nwith information not normally covered by Rule 16 of the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure.            Addressing another violation, the\n\ndistrict court set an accelerated discovery timetable and warned\n\nthe prosecution that \"[i]f the government fails to comply, the\n\ncourt will dismiss the indictment.\" In a third instance, the court\n\nrefused to admit into evidence a photograph that the prosecution\n\nhad not adequately disclosed to the defense.                       Each of these\n\nresponses to the government's discovery violations helped mitigate\n\nany prejudice to the defendants that might otherwise have resulted\n\nfrom    the    government's      apparent    inability      to    meet   discovery\n\ndeadlines.      Given this solution, the district court's continual\n\ndenials of the defendants' motions to dismiss the indictment due to\n\nthe government's discovery violations were certainly not abuses of\n\ndiscretion.         That   conclusion    is    not    a    condonation      of   the\n\ngovernment's behavior; it is just a recognition that reversal of\n\nthe    conviction    is    not   warranted,   given       the    district   court's\n\nimposition of other sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -48-\n\fC.   Alleged Trial Errors\n\n     1.     Evidentiary Rulings\n\n            a)    Admission of Murder Evidence As to CCE Defendants\n                  (Soto-Beníquez, Soto-Ramírez)\n\n            Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez object that they were\n\nunfairly prejudiced by the admission of evidence concerning the\n\nmurders of Jose Cosme-Sobrado, Angel Rivera-Pagán, and Miguel Angel\n\nMillan-Soto (a/k/a Guelo). The district court found that the three\n\nmurders were not part of the conspiracy, but admitted the evidence\n\nover the defendants' Rule 403 objection because the three murders\n\nexplained the motive for subsequent murders that did further the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n            The district court's ruling is reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.      Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 183 n.7\n\n(1997).     The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\n\nevidence.     Cosme-Sobrado's murder was relevant to demonstrate a\n\nmotive for an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy: the\n\nkidnapping and murder of Herberto Rivera-González.        Members of the\n\nconspiracy    killed   Rivera-González   because   he   was   a   suspected\n\nparticipant in Cosme-Sobrado's murder.      Cosme-Sobrado's death was\n\nalso important to demonstrate that conspirators from different drug\n\npoints would come together to avenge the death of a member of their\n\ngang.     Similarly, the killings of Rivera-Pagán and Millan-Soto in\n\nshootings by the Chacho gang were relevant to demonstrate the basis\n\nfor gang warfare with Chacho.     This gang warfare led to two overt\n\n                                  -49-\n\facts in furtherance of the conspiracy: the murder of Roberto\n\nVasallo-Morninglane, who was a member of the Chacho gang, and the\n\nQuintana massacre.\n\n           Soto-Ramírez      and    Soto-Beníquez         also    claim,    without\n\nfurther explanation, that they were prejudiced by evidence of\n\ntwelve   other    murders.      Because      this   argument       is    made    in   a\n\nperfunctory     manner,   unaccompanied       by    any   effort    at     developed\n\nargumentation, it has been waived.            See Grella v. Salem Five Cent\n\nSav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           b)     Admission of Murder Evidence As to Non-CCE\n                  Defendants\n                  (García-García, Gonzalez-Ayala, de León Maysonet)\n\n           Three defendants contend that evidence of murders should\n\nnot have been admitted against them because the government did not\n\nestablish a connection between any of the murders and the charged\n\nconspiracy.      They argue that the murders were not shown to be in\n\nfurtherance of the charged conspiracy.              They also argue that even\n\nif the murders were in furtherance of a conspiracy headed by Soto-\n\nRamírez and Soto-Beníquez from 1990 until the summer of 1993, those\n\nmurders did not advance the interests of the later conspiracy\n\nheaded by Rodríguez-López.          These errors regarding the admission\n\nof the murder evidence, they contend, cannot be harmless because\n\nthe   murders     constituted      about     seventy-five        percent    of    the\n\ngovernment's evidence at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -50-\n\f          Review is for abuse of discretion.            No abuse occurred\n\nhere.   The three murders discussed in the previous section were\n\nadmissible to demonstrate the motive for subsequent overt acts in\n\nfurtherance    of   the   conspiracy.     The   remaining   murders   were\n\nadmissible as acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n          A reasonable factfinder could infer that the murder of\n\nDagoberto Robles-Rodríguez was in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nSoto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez worked for Robles-Rodríguez, who\n\nowned the drug point on Cuba Street, at the time of the murder.\n\nNegrón-Maldonado testified that Soto-Ramírez teamed up with co-\n\nconspirators Cosme-Vega and \"Manolín\" and killed Robles-Rodríguez\n\nat least partly because Soto-Ramírez felt threatened by him.\n\nAfterwards, Soto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez took control of Robles-\n\nRodríguez's drug point.        A reasonable inference is that Soto-\n\nRamírez killed Robles-Rodríguez to avoid further threats and to\n\ngain full control of the drug point, thus eliminating a potential\n\ncompetitor to the conspiracy.\n\n          It   is   also   a   reasonable   inference    that   government\n\ninformant Ana Luz Dones-Arroyo and undercover police officer Efrain\n\nHernández de León were killed in furtherance of the conspiracy --\n\nto prevent their discovery of the group's weapons stash.          The two\n\nwere gunned down as Dones-Arroyo was leading the officer to the\n\nlocation of the stash.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\f              Fernando Agosto-Villegas was killed on Soto-Ramírez's\n\norders because two-eighths of a kilogram of cocaine and a machine\n\ngun belonging to Soto-Ramírez were missing.               The murder furthered\n\nthe conspiracy by sending the message that those suspected of\n\nstealing from the conspiracy would be treated harshly.                 Rodriguez,\n\n162 F.3d at 143.\n\n              Herberto Rivera-González was killed in retribution for\n\nthe death of Cosme-Sobrado, who had been managing Soto-Ramírez's\n\ndrug point for him while he was in prison.                       The defendants\n\ncorrectly note that the government never proved that Rivera-\n\nGonzález was actually a member of a rival gang or participated in\n\nkilling Cosme-Sobrado.         But the government met its burden when it\n\npresented     testimony      that    the   conspirators      believed,      even    if\n\nincorrectly, that Rivera-González was responsible and that they\n\nkilled him for that reason.          See, e.g., United States v. Mayes, 917\n\nF.2d   457,    464   (10th    Cir.    1990)    (explaining     that    to     be   \"in\n\nfurtherance\" of a conspiracy, an act must be intended to promote\n\nconspiratorial       objectives      but   need     not   actually     succeed      in\n\nfurthering the conspiracy).\n\n              Reynaldo   Cancel-Robles        was   killed   because     he   seized\n\ncontrol of a drug point located outside Bitumul in the Vista\n\nHermosa housing project that was supplied by Soto-Beníquez.                        His\n\nmurder furthered the conspiracy by protecting its customer base and\n\nthus ensuring a stronger market for its narcotics.\n\n\n                                       -52-\n\f            Robert Vasallo-Morninglane and the five victims of the\n\nQuintana Massacre were killed in retribution for the death of\n\nAngel Rivera-Pagán. Rivera-Pagán had died in a shootout in Bitumul\n\nwith the rival Chacho gang, to which Vasallo-Morninglane and two of\n\nthe five victims of the Quintana Massacre belonged.          These murders\n\nfurthered the conspiracy's goal of defending its territory and its\n\nmembers against rival drug-trafficking organizations.\n\n            Tito Dones-Sanchez was killed while riding in a van near\n\nthe drug point at Callejón Nueve. Fernández-Malavé spotted the van\n\nand opened fire on it, believing that those inside were members of\n\na rival gang who intended to threaten the drug point.                Dones-\n\nSanchez was murdered to protect the drug territory at Callejón\n\nNueve, and thus to further the goals of the conspiracy.\n\n            Oscar Nazario-Rivera was killed because he was a member\n\nof the rival Chacho gang and had fired shots at Rodríguez-López in\n\nthe past.    His murder furthered the conspiracy by eliminating a\n\npossible threat to one of its major players, Rodríguez-López.             Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Nesser, 939 F. Supp. 417, 421 (W.D. Pa. 1996)\n\n(\"Hiding information about the leader of a drug conspiracy [in\n\norder to protect him] is another way to further its purpose, by\n\nallowing it to continue.\").\n\n            We also reject defendants' argument that these murders\n\nfurthered   a   separate   conspiracy    from   the   one   in   which   they\n\nparticipated.    As discussed above, the record supports the jury's\n\n\n                                  -53-\n\ffinding   that     a   single   conspiracy   existed   and   that   the   three\n\ndefendants were part of it.\n\n            Because evidence of all fifteen murders was admissible to\n\ndemonstrate the existence of a conspiracy, it was admissible\n\nagainst these three defendants. Defendants correctly note that the\n\nrecord establishes that García-García participated in only one\n\nmurder, that Gonzalez-Ayala and de León Maysonet participated in no\n\nmurders, and that most of the murders occurred before Gonzalez-\n\nAyala joined the conspiracy and before de León Maysonet turned\n\neighteen.     But, as discussed earlier, the three defendants are\n\nliable for conspiracy.          As a result, they are liable for acts in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy, even if they did not participate in\n\nthose acts and even if those acts occurred before they joined the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n            c)     Admission of Guilty Pleas\n                   (Fernández-Malavé, Gonzalez-Ayala, de León Maysonet)\n\n            The district court admitted into evidence Fernández-\n\nMalavé's guilty plea to the murder of Tito Dones-Sanchez over\n\ndefense counsel's objection that the plea was not knowing and\n\nvoluntary.6      According to Fernández-Malavé, his plea in Puerto Rico\n\n\n     6\n          Fernández-Malavé also asserts in his brief a different\nobjection to the admission of his guilty plea, rooted in Fed. R.\nEvid. 403.    Because this objection was not raised below, the\ncourt's decision not to exclude the evidence on Rule 403 grounds is\nreviewed for plain error. See United States v. Woods, 210 F.3d 70,\n78 (1st Cir. 2000). Given the relevance of the murder of Dones-\nSanchez to the charged conspiracy, it is clear that there was not\nplain error in admitting the guilty plea despite potential Rule 403\n\n                                      -54-\n\fcourt    was    coerced   because   the   local   prosecutor   had    falsely\n\nrepresented to him that the earlier testimony of an unavailable\n\nwitness could be used against him at trial.         After hearing lengthy\n\nargument on this issue, the district court denied Fernández-\n\nMalavé's motion, concluding that Fernández-Malavé knowingly pled\n\nguilty in order to avoid facing first-degree murder charges.\n\n               Normally, it is inappropriate for a federal court to\n\nreview a collateral attack on a state court conviction without\n\naffording the state court a prior opportunity to do so.                United\n\nStates v. Bouthot, 878 F.2d 1506, 1511 (1st Cir. 1989).              But when\n\na defendant challenges the voluntariness of a state court guilty\n\nplea for purposes of an admissibility determination, the interests\n\nof comity and federalism that underlie the exhaustion doctrine are\n\nbest served by addressing the merits of that claim.                  Id.; see\n\nUnited States v. Campusano, 947 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1991).               We\n\nthus review the district court's evidentiary ruling for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. United States v. Perrotta, 289 F.3d 155, 164 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n               The district court had a more than sufficient basis upon\n\nwhich to deny Fernández-Malavé's motion to exclude his guilty plea.\n\nThe court noted that \"counsel for the defendant described exactly\n\nwhat the plea was\" during the plea colloquy in state court and that\n\n\n\nconcerns: the murder was highly probative of a material issue in\nthe case.\n\n                                    -55-\n\fFernández-Malavé expressly told the court that he had discussed his\n\noptions   with    his   lawyer    and    was   pleading    guilty    freely   and\n\nvoluntarily. Furthermore, the court concluded that the Puerto Rico\n\nprosecutor did not mislead Fernández-Malavé about the admissibility\n\nof the unavailable witness's prior testimony, but was instead\n\nsimply advocating a plausible interpretation of the Puerto Rico\n\nevidence rules.     Fernández-Malavé has not presented any reason to\n\ndoubt these findings.\n\n           De León Maysonet and Gonzalez-Ayala also object to the\n\ndistrict court's admission of their plea agreements regarding state\n\ncrimes; de León Maysonet had pled guilty to possessing a controlled\n\nsubstance, while Gonzalez-Ayala had pled guilty to conspiring or\n\nattempting to violate the Puerto Rico controlled substances law.\n\nThe argument of these defendants differs slightly from that of\n\nFernández-Malavé: they claim that the plea agreements were not\n\nadmissible because the government did not enter in evidence a\n\ntranscript   of    their   plea    colloquies      in     Puerto    Rico   court.\n\nGonzalez-Ayala also argues that his plea should not have been\n\nadmitted because the crime to which he pled encompasses numerous\n\ntypes of criminal activity, making it impossible for the jury to\n\ndetermine the activities for which he was actually convicted.7\n\n\n     7\n          The defendants also argue briefly that the convictions\nwere inadmissible hearsay because they did not fall within Rule\n803(22). This argument is not developed in the defendants' brief,\nand, in any case, is not meritorious. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(22)\n(exception to hearsay rule for \"[e]vidence of a final judgment,\n\n                                        -56-\n\f            The district court had a sufficient basis to reject these\n\narguments as well.             Even without the transcript of the plea\n\ncolloquy, the pleas linked the defendants to the charged drug\n\nconspiracy: according to the arresting officer, both Gonzalez-Ayala\n\nand de León Maysonet possessed heroin and a firearm when they were\n\narrested.    Had the defendants produced specific evidence that the\n\nguilty pleas were coerced, the admissibility of the pleas might be\n\nquestionable.       But defendants cannot defeat the relevance of these\n\nguilty pleas by making unsupported allegations that they were not\n\nvoluntary.\n\n            For similar reasons, we reject Gonzalez-Ayala's argument\n\nthat his plea should not have been admitted because the statute to\n\nwhich he pled guilty applied to more than one factual scenario.\n\nThe guilty plea corroborated the fact that Gonzalez-Ayala was found\n\ncarrying    drugs    and   a    weapon,    and    that   fact   was   relevant   in\n\nestablishing that he was part of the charged conspiracy.\n\n             d)     Admission of the Testimony of Cesário-Soto\n                    (Alicea-Torres)\n\n             Alicea-Torres       makes    a      separate   argument    that     the\n\ngovernment knowingly offered in evidence perjured testimony from\n\nwitness Cesário-Soto.          Cesário-Soto testified at trial that he had\n\nobserved Alicea-Torres sell drugs at two different drug points.\n\n\nentered after a trial or upon a plea of guilty . . . adjudging a\nperson guilty of a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in\nexcess of one year, to prove any fact essential to sustain the\njudgment\").\n\n                                         -57-\n\fAlicea-Torres alleges that at an earlier interview conducted by his\n\ncounsel and attended by the prosecuting attorney, Cesário-Soto\n\nstated only that Alicea-Torres was in the area.   That discrepancy\n\nprovides the basis for the defendant's misconduct claim.\n\n           We bypass the question whether the defendant properly\n\npreserved the objection and reject on the merits his claim that the\n\nprosecution knowingly used perjured testimony.     First, the two\n\nstatements by Cesário-Soto are not necessarily conflicting. At the\n\ninterview, defense counsel did not pursue what was meant by the\n\nwitness's statement that Alicea-Torres was \"in the area.\"   Second,\n\nthere was no prejudice.   Defense counsel cross-examined Cesário-\n\nSoto as to the supposed conflict between his testimony and the\n\nstatements he made during the interview.    Moreover, Cesário-Soto\n\nwas not the only witness to link Alicea-Torres to two different\n\ndrug points: Negrón-Maldonado testified that Alicia-Torres sold\n\ndrugs at Calejon Dos and Torrens-Alicea testified that Alicea-\n\nTorres conducted drug transactions with Rodríguez-López and spent\n\ntime at Callejón Nueve. There is no reasonable likelihood that any\n\nfalse testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.   Cf.\n\nKyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 433 n.7 (1995) (\"[A] conviction\n\nobtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally\n\nunfair, and must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood\n\nthat the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the\n\njury.\").\n\n\n                               -58-\n\f           e)     Motion to Suppress Exhibit 227, a Photograph, and\n\n                  Related Testimony\n                  (Fernández-Malavé)\n\n           Fernández-Malavé appeals the denial of his motion to\n\nsuppress a photograph, later admitted as Exhibit 227, of items that\n\nappeared to be drugs and that were seized when he was arrested on\n\nApril 9, 1993.     He contends that the photograph was taken after\n\nOfficers   Rosa-Lopez      and    Victor-Rivera        illegally   entered   and\n\nsearched his apartment without a warrant.\n\n           The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the\n\nsuppression     motion    and    held    that    the   warrantless   entry   was\n\njustified by exigent circumstances.             The court made the following\n\nfactual determinations.          Officer Rosa-Lopez was on routine patrol\n\nduring the evening of April 9, 1993 when he saw a person carrying\n\na nickel plated gun in his hand.                Before he could respond, the\n\nindividual noticed Officer Rosa-Lopez (who was in uniform) and\n\nbegan to run in the opposite direction. Officer Rosa-Lopez pursued\n\nthe suspect up a nearby stairway between two houses, but lost sight\n\nof   him   when   he     apparently     jumped    onto    an   adjacent   patio.\n\nMeanwhile, Officer Victor-Rivera was patrolling the same area when\n\nhe received notice on his police radio of the pursuit involving\n\nOfficer Rosa-Lopez.       While he was approaching the area to provide\n\nback-up, he observed an individual carrying a black gun.                     That\n\nindividual, on spotting Officer Victor-Rivera (who was in uniform),\n\nimmediately turned around and ran into a house behind him. Officer\n\n                                        -59-\n\fVictor-Rivera followed the person, later identified as Fernández-\n\nMalavé, into the house and pursued him up the stairway.       Officer\n\nRosa-Lopez, still searching for the first suspect outside, heard a\n\nwindow open.   He turned toward the noise and saw someone drop a gun\n\nand a plastic bag containing drugs out of the window.        When he\n\nlooked through the window, he saw Fernández-Malavé inside. He then\n\nseized the drugs and the weapon.       After a third officer told him\n\nthat Officer Victor-Rivera was inside, Officer Rosa-Lopez went to\n\nthe front of the house.    Officer Rosa-Lopez explained to Officer\n\nVictor-Rivera that he had just observed Fernández-Malavé drop the\n\nseized drugs and weapon out of the back window, and Fernández-\n\nMalavé was placed under arrest.\n\n          This court reviews the district court's findings of fact\n\nfor clear error and its ultimate Fourth Amendment conclusion de\n\nnovo.   Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996).       The\n\ndistrict court's rendition of facts is not clearly erroneous.\n\nFernández-Malavé unsuccessfully attempts to discredit the court's\n\nfindings by noting that much of Officer Rosa-Lopez's testimony was\n\nnot included in an earlier sworn statement of his.         There are\n\nmultiple explanations for why Officer Rosa-Lopez might not have\n\nreported certain details about his encounter with Fernández-Malavé\n\nin his sworn statement, including his belief at the time that those\n\ndetails were not important.   The absence of those details does not\n\nestablish clear error.\n\n\n                                -60-\n\f           The district court's Fourth Amendment conclusion was\n\ncorrect.   Once Fernández-Malavé abandoned the weapon and drugs by\n\nthrowing them out of the window, he had no reasonable expectation\n\nof privacy in those items and their seizure did not itself violate\n\nhis Fourth Amendment rights.           It is well settled that if a\n\ndefendant abandons property while he is being pursued by police\n\nofficers, he forfeits any reasonable expectation of privacy he may\n\nhave had in that property.       See Abel v. United States, 362 U.S.\n\n217, 241 (1960).    Nevertheless, if Officer Victor-Rivera's pursuit\n\nof Fernández-Malavé into his house was unconstitutional, then the\n\nevidence of the drugs might well have been subject to suppression\n\nas the fruit of an illegal entry.      Cf. California v. Hodari D., 499\n\nU.S. 621, 629 (1991); United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1334\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           Even without a warrant, police officers are entitled to\n\nenter private residences when \"exigent circumstances\" necessitate\n\nsuch action.    See Fletcher v. Town of Clinton, 196 F.3d 41, 49 (1st\n\nCir.   1999).     One   consistently   recognized   example   of   exigent\n\ncircumstances encompasses the \"hot pursuit\" of a suspect the police\n\nreasonably believe to be a felon.      Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91,\n\n100 (1990); Hegarty v. Somerset County, 53 F.3d 1367, 1374 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).     In such cases, the police are permitted to pursue the\n\nfleeing felon into a private residence in order to effect an\n\narrest.    See United States v. Santana, 427 U.S. 38, 43 (1976).\n\n\n                                  -61-\n\f            Officer Victor-Rivera's pursuit of Fernández-Malavé falls\n\nsquarely    within   the    doctrinal    confines       of   the   hot    pursuit\n\nexception, and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment.                 We have\n\npreviously held in a remarkably similar situation that an officer\n\nwho is looking for a fleeing suspect and has a reasoned basis to\n\nthink that he has found the suspect is justified in pursuing the\n\nsuspect into a house.       See United States v. Lopez, 989 F.2d 24, 27\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (holding that police were justified under the hot\n\npursuit doctrine in following defendant into a house because he fit\n\na general description of an armed assault suspect and ran from\n\npolice when he was ordered to halt).          That same conclusion holds\n\nhere.\n\n            Fernández-Malavé also objects on hearsay grounds to the\n\nadmission of Officer Rosa-Lopez's testimony about a subsequent\n\nfield test that confirmed that the items in the picture were indeed\n\ndrugs.     The hearsay objection is that Officer Rosa-Lopez did not\n\nperform the field test himself, but instead only observed the test\n\nas it was conducted.       The court correctly overruled this objection\n\nat trial. Officer Rosa-Lopez did not testify about an out-of-court\n\nstatement,    see Fed.     R.   Evid.   801(c),   but    about     his   personal\n\nobservation of the results of the field test.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -62-\n\f",

This massive drug conspiracy case\n\nfrom Puerto      Rico   involved   a   six-month     trial       and   resulted   in\n\nconvictions of the eleven defendants who appeal, eight of whom\n\nreceived life sentences and three of whom received sentences of\n\nmore than twenty years.\n\n           The    government      charged    this    case    as    involving      one\n\noverarching      conspiracy    from    January      1990    to    March   1994    to\n\ndistribute drugs at Bitumul (Israel Ward) in Hato Rey, San Juan,\n\nPuerto Rico and to protect that distribution through multiple\n\nmurders.      Twenty-two      defendants     were   indicted      on    charges    of\n\nconspiracy with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of\n\ncocaine, more than five kilograms of cocaine base, more than five\n\nkilograms of heroin, and more than 100 kilograms of marijuana over\n\na four-year period, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).                   Two of\n\nthese defendants,       William    Soto-Beníquez      and    Juan      Soto-Ramírez\n\n(a/k/a Pipo), were also charged with violating the Continuing\n\nCriminal Enterprise (CCE) statute, 21 U.S.C. § 848(a) and (b). The\n\ngovernment alleged that Soto-Ramírez headed the conspiracy and that\n\nSoto-Beníquez was the triggerman and principal supplier.                          The\n\nremaining nine appellants were charged with playing various roles\n\nin distributing drugs or protecting the distribution of drugs.\n\n           The original twenty-two defendants were separated into\n\ntwo groups.    The first group of eleven, comprised of those who the\n\ngovernment said were more major players in the conspiracy, were\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\ftried before a jury from December 28, 1998 to June 25, 1999.                      The\n\njury convicted all eleven defendants on all counts with which they\n\nwere charged.\n\n           The     two    CCE   defendants          were     sentenced    to      life\n\nimprisonment on Count One, the CCE count, while Count Two, the\n\nconspiracy count, was dismissed as to them under the rule of\n\nRutledge   v.    United   States,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118013\"><a href=\"/opinion/118013/rutledge-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span>      <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>    <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">    (1996).      Six   other\n\ndefendants were also sentenced to life imprisonment:                        Alicea-\n\nTorres, Fernández-Malavé, Vega-Pacheco, García-García, Vega-Cosme,\n\nand   Cintrón-Caraballo.         The   remaining           three   --   Vega-Colón,\n\nGonzalez-Ayala, and de León Maysonet -- were each sentenced to 292\n\nmonths of imprisonment.\n\n           These    appeals     present      three    substantial       issues:      a\n\nmultiple conspiracy issue, an issue of improper argument by the\n\ngovernment in its rebuttal closing argument, and a set of Apprendi\n\nsentencing issues.        Defendants' key theme on appeal is that the\n\ngovernment overcharged the conspiracy in at least two significant\n\nrespects. First, defendants argue that, assuming Soto-Beníquez and\n\nSoto-Ramírez did distribute drugs to points in Bitumul from 1990\n\nuntil late 1992 or early 1993, the drug points were largely\n\nindependent; the fact of a common supplier does not mean the\n\nindependent drug point operators agreed to a conspiracy, much less\n\nto the ensuing murders.         Second, defendants argue that, by late\n\n1992, both Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez were out of action: one\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fhad been imprisoned and the other had left for Florida after\n\nnarrowly escaping an attempt on his life.           Any conspiracy was by\n\nthen concluded, defendants assert, and the government's attempts to\n\ninclude another year's worth of events, until March 1994, in the\n\nconspiracy were improper.        Those events involved a different and\n\nrival drug dealer, Rodríguez-López (a/k/a El Bebo), and took place\n\npartly in another town called Fajardo.          The defendants argue that\n\nif their theory as to multiple conspiracies is correct, then there\n\nare significant ramifications that affect the application of the\n\nstatute    of     limitations,     the      admissibility       of   testimony\n\n(particularly, evidence of fifteen horrific            murders), the refusal\n\nto sever certain defendants, and various sentencing determinations.\n\n           The defendants also complain, with justification, about\n\nthe government's poor record of pre-trial production of required\n\nmaterials, as well as its belated springing of requested sentencing\n\nenhancements      on   certain    defendants     after    the    Pre-Sentence\n\nInvestigative Report (PSR) had been prepared and the defendants'\n\nobjections to it had been served.           The trial court was obviously\n\nfrustrated      with   the   government's    conduct     in   this   case   and\n\nthreatened three times to dismiss the indictment, but in the end\n\ndid not.   Post-trial, the court also found the evidence sufficient\n\nto support the convictions.\n\n             Over twenty-five issues are raised in these appeals and\n\nare discussed in the sequence of events leading to and through\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\ftrial, with the exception of the multiple conspiracies issue, which\n\nwe discuss first.\n\n                                      I.\n\n              The facts are stated, for sufficiency of the evidence\n\npurposes, as a reasonable jury could have found them, in the light\n\nmost favorable to the verdict.\n\n              The government's case turned on the testimony of several\n\ncooperating co-conspirators -- Ramón Cesário-Soto,              Victor Negrón-\n\nMaldonado (a/k/a Pitosito), and Luis Torrens-Alicea (a/k/a Pito\n\nSalsa)   --    as   well   as   the   testimony   of   police    officers   and\n\ninvestigators.\n\n              The case centers around six drug points in the Bitumul\n\nWard of Hato Rey, San Juan, Puerto Rico: (1) Callejón Nueve,\n\noperated by Juan Soto-Ramírez and later by Negrón-Maldonado, (2) La\n\nPared, also operated by Soto-Ramírez, (3) Street B between La Pared\n\nand Callejón Nueve, operated by Juan Cintrón-Caraballo and supplied\n\nby Soto-Ramírez, (4) El Palo on Laguna Street, operated by Alberto\n\nSantiago-Figueroa, a defendant not participating in this trial, and\n\nsupplied by Soto-Ramírez, (5) Cuba Street, which included two\n\ndistribution points operated by Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez, and\n\n(6) Laguna Street, operated by Miguel Vega-Cosme.               These points,\n\nwhich began operation around 1990, dealt in crack cocaine, cocaine,\n\nheroin, and marijuana.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f           Soto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez were the leaders of the\n\noperation.     Soto-Ramírez operated or supplied almost all of the\n\ndrug points.      His house at Callejón Dos was used by various\n\ndefendants to prepare crack and heroin for distribution at the six\n\ndrug points and to store weapons to defend and acquire territory\n\nfor the drug points.    When defendant Miguel Vega-Cosme established\n\nhis drug point on Laguna Street with his son, defendant Miguel\n\nVega-Colón, he first requested permission from Soto-Ramírez.\n\n             Soto-Beníquez served as the triggerman and principal\n\nsupplier. He ultimately supplied most of the narcotics sold at the\n\ndrug points and owned many of the weapons used to kill rival gang\n\nmembers.     Cesário-Soto described him as \"one with ranks\" in the\n\ndrug world.\n\n             The remaining defendants were involved in running one or\n\nmore of the six drug points.     Eduardo Alicea-Torres sold drugs at\n\nthe Cuba Street and Callejón Dos drug points from 1990 until at\n\nleast 1991, and later began his own drug point.     Ramon Fernández-\n\nMalavé packaged crack and cocaine for Soto-Ramírez and cooperating\n\ngovernment witness Negrón-Maldonado in 1992.    Carmelo Vega-Pacheco\n\npackaged drugs for Soto-Ramírez and Negrón-Maldonado through 1992,\n\nand sold narcotics at the Cuba Street drug points in 1990 and 1991.\n\nArmando García-García sold narcotics at the Cuba Street drug points\n\nfrom 1990 to 1991, packaged drugs in 1992, and sold drugs at\n\nCallejón Nueve in 1993.     From 1990 to 1992, Jose de León Maysonet\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fstored narcotics and weapons for the drug points, and after 1992,\n\nhe sold narcotics at Callejón Nueve.         Juan Cintrón-Caraballo\n\noperated the Street B drug point throughout the charged conspiracy.\n\nMiguel Vega-Cosme supplied Soto-Ramírez with narcotics and operated\n\na drug point at Laguna Street from 1990 until 1994 with Soto-\n\nRamírez's permission.   Vega-Cosme also supplied ammunition used in\n\nshootings of rival gang members in 1992 and 1993, and negotiated on\n\nbehalf of the group in seeking to resolve its differences with the\n\nrival Chacho gang.      Miguel Vega-Colón, the son of Vega-Cosme,\n\npackaged crack cocaine, heroin, and marijuana for his father and\n\nstood as an armed guard at the Callejón Nueve drug point, a point\n\nseparate from the one his father ran on Laguna Street.\n\n          Several of the defendants were involved in a series of\n\nmurders undertaken to defend and acquire territory in Bitumul on\n\nbehalf of the conspiracy.   The first of these killings occurred on\n\nFebruary 10, 1991. Soto-Ramírez confessed to Negrón-Maldonado that\n\nhe, along with two deceased members of the conspiracy, killed\n\nDagoberto Robles-Rodríguez because he felt threatened by Robles-\n\nRodríguez.   Soto-Ramírez then gained control of Robles-Rodríguez's\n\nheroin point on Cuba Street.   Soto-Ramírez pled guilty in a Puerto\n\nRico court to Robles-Rodríguez's homicide.\n\n          Another killing occurred on February 20, 1991.         As\n\ngovernment informant Ana Luz Dones-Arroyo was leading undercover\n\npolice officer Efrain Hernández de León to the location at Callejón\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fDos where Soto-Ramírez and others stored their weapons, both were\n\ngunned down. Soto-Ramírez shot Dones-Arroyo, and defendant Alicea-\n\nTorres killed the police officer and disposed of the body.                 A\n\nballistics expert testified that the same two weapons used in the\n\nmurder of Robles-Rodríguez were used to kill Dones-Arroyo and\n\nHernández de León.\n\n           According to Negrón-Maldonado's testimony, several more\n\nmurders occurred after these two.           On July 20, 1991, Soto-Ramírez\n\nordered the murder of one of his sellers at the Cuba Street drug\n\npoint, Fernando Agosto-Villegas, because two-eighths of a kilogram\n\nof   cocaine   and   a   machine   gun   belonging   to   Soto-Ramírez   were\n\nmissing.   On May 12, 1992, Soto-Beníquez ordered the murder of\n\nHeriberto Rivera-González in retribution for the death of Jose\n\nCosme-Sobrado (a/k/a Canito), who had been managing several of\n\nSoto-Ramírez's drug points.          Rivera-González was suspected of\n\nparticipating in the murder of Cosme-Sobrado earlier that day.\n\nDefendant Cintrón-Caraballo, cooperating government witness Negrón-\n\nMaldonado, and two other members of the group kidnapped Rivera-\n\nGonzález and brought him to Callejón Dos, where Negrón-Maldonado\n\nand others killed him.        Finally, on November 25, 1992, Negrón-\n\nMaldonado, Soto-Beníquez, and another co-conspirator not on trial\n\nhere, Juan Antonio Rodríguez-López, killed Reynaldo Cancel-Robles.\n\nSoto-Beníquez supplied a drug dealer named \"Cuelli,\" who owned a\n\ndrug point outside Bitumul in the Vista Hermosa housing project.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fCancel-Robles was killed because he had ousted \"Cuelli\" from this\n\ndrug point.\n\n          On December 20, 1992, gang warfare broke out between the\n\ngroup and members of a rival gang led by \"Chacho.\"      A shootout\n\noccurred between the two gangs, in which Angel Rivera-Pagán, a\n\nmember of Soto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez's group, was killed.\n\nEight days later, Negrón-Maldonado, Rodríguez-López, and others\n\nretaliated by murdering Roberto Vasallo-Morninglane, a member of\n\nthe Chacho gang.\n\n          The gang warfare continued, and several days later, on\n\nJanuary 10, 1993, defendant Vega-Pacheco, government witnesses\n\nCesário-Soto and Negrón-Maldonado, Rodríguez-López, and others went\n\nto the Quintana housing project and killed five more people, two of\n\nwhom were members of the Chacho gang.     Vega-Pacheco later pled\n\nguilty in a Puerto Rico court to participating in those five\n\nmurders, which came to be known as the Quintana massacre.\n\n          Yet another murder took place on March 7, 1993, when\n\ndefendant Fernández-Malavé killed Tito Dones-Sanchez.        Negrón-\n\nMaldonado and Cesário-Soto testified that Fernández-Malavé opened\n\nfire on a white van after Cintrón-Caraballo and other dealers at\n\nthe Callejón Nueve drug point saw it driving nearby and suspected\n\nthat those inside were members of the rival El Visco gang.    Dones-\n\nSanchez was later found dead inside a white van of the same\n\ndescription, which a municipal police officer had witnessed leaving\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fthe Bitumul area.   Fernández-Malavé pled guilty in a Puerto Rico\n\ncourt to the murder of Dones-Sanchez.\n\n           While these murders were occurring in 1992 and 1993, some\n\nchanges occurred in the leadership of the group.      On January 8,\n\n1992, Soto-Ramírez was incarcerated after pleading guilty in a\n\nPuerto Rico court to various crimes, including attempted murder.\n\nAfter Soto-Beníquez was shot in an assassination attempt, he ceased\n\nactivities in Bitumul in December 1992 and moved to Florida in\n\n1993.   While Soto-Ramírez was in prison, Cosme-Sobrado managed\n\nthree of Soto-Ramírez's drug points until Cosme-Sobrado was killed\n\non May 12, 1992. Negrón-Maldonado then took over managing the\n\npoints until he left for Philadelphia in June or July 1993.    When\n\nmanaging the points, both Cosme-Sobrado and Negrón-Maldonado took\n\ninstructions from Soto-Ramírez through telephone calls from prison\n\nand forwarded the proceeds from the drug points to Soto-Ramírez's\n\nwife.\n\n           In June or July 1993, Rodríguez-López, a former member of\n\nthe group, returned to Bitumul from Fajardo, where he had fled\n\nafter the Quintana massacre.    Rodríguez-López had teamed up with\n\ndefendant Rene Gonzalez-Ayala and government witness Torrens-Alicea\n\nto steal a two hundred kilogram shipment of cocaine at a beach in\n\nFajardo.   Without consulting anyone in Bitumul, Rodríguez-López\n\nbrought the cocaine back to Bitumul and established a \"new\" drug\n\npoint at Callejón Nueve, where Soto-Ramírez's drug point had been\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fabandoned.      Rodríguez-López      employed    several   members   of   the\n\noriginal group in setting up the new drug point, including García-\n\nGarcía and de León Maysonet, but he also brought in individuals\n\nfrom outside Bitumul, including Gonzalez-Ayala and Torrens-Alicea.\n\n             Tension arose between Rodríguez-López and the members of\n\nthe original group, in particular Cintrón-Caraballo and Negrón-\n\nMaldonado, over the influx of outsiders working at the new drug\n\npoint at Callejón Nueve.      Torrens-Alicea testified, however, that\n\nafter Negrón-Maldonado returned from Philadelphia, he \"ironed out\"\n\nthese differences with Rodríguez-López over the course of two\n\nmeetings in August or September 1993.\n\n             Around   that   time,   several    defendants   again   became\n\ninvolved in violent activities.             According to Torrens-Alicea's\n\ntestimony, on September 12, 1993, de León Maysonet, Gonzalez-Ayala,\n\nGarcía-García, and three other members of the gang went to Fajardo\n\nto find and kill an individual named Vitito, who had been hired to\n\nkill those responsible for the stolen cocaine in Fajardo.                 They\n\nnever found Vitito. Instead, de León Maysonet, Gonzalez-Ayala, and\n\nanother member of the gang were arrested in Fajardo while in\n\npossession of a firearm and eleven decks of heroin; both de León\n\nMaysonet and Gonzalez-Ayala pled guilty in Puerto Rico court to the\n\ncharges.     On October 11, 1993, Torrens-Alicia, García-García, and\n\ntwo others killed Oscar Nazario-Rivera in Floral Park, Hato Rey,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fbecause he was a member of the Chacho gang and had threatened\n\nRodríguez-López.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            On April 10, 1997, a federal grand jury in Puerto Rico\n\nreturned a two-count indictment against the eleven appellants,\n\nalong with ten other defendants.         Count One charged Soto-Beníquez\n\nand Soto-Ramírez with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 848(a) and (b).          Count Two charged that\n\nfrom about January 1, 1990, until about March 7, 1994, all twenty-\n\none defendants conspired to distribute more than five kilograms of\n\nheroin, more     than   five   kilograms   of     cocaine,   more   than   five\n\nkilograms   of   cocaine   base,   and     more    than    100   kilograms   of\n\nmarijuana, as prohibited by 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846.\n\n            Rodríguez-López, who became a cooperating witness in the\n\npre-trial stage of the case, testified to the grand jury.                    The\n\ngovernment eventually discovered that he had lied before the grand\n\njury about his presence at a murder.         The government informed the\n\ngrand jury about the false testimony, and on December 14, 1998,\n\nobtained a superseding indictment.         In the superseding indictment,\n\nthe government alleged the same charges against the same twenty-one\n\ndefendants listed in the original indictment.             The government also\n\nadded Rodríguez-López as a defendant to the conspiracy charge of\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fthe superseding indictment, thus raising the total number of\n\ndefendants to twenty-two.\n\n            On December 28, 1998, the district court divided the\n\ntwenty-two defendants into two groups for trial purposes.          At that\n\npoint, sixteen of the original twenty-two defendants were slated to\n\ngo to trial.     The district court selected the eleven appellants as\n\nthe first group to be tried.        After an eighty-six-day trial, the\n\njury returned a guilty verdict as to all eleven defendants on all\n\ncounts for which they were charged.\n\n           All eleven defendants appealed.       This court consolidated\n\ntheir appeals.\n\n                                    III.\n\nA.     Sufficiency of the Evidence Proving a Single Conspiracy\n       (García-García, de León Maysonet, Gonzalez-Ayala)\n\n            To join a drug conspiracy, a defendant must agree with\n\nothers to advance the aim of the conspiracy -- here, to possess\n\ndrugs for distribution.      United States v. Garcia-Torres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199822\"><a href=\"/opinion/199822/united-states-v-garcia-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st Cir. 2002).       Advancing the aim of the conspiracy can\n\ninvolve performing ancillary functions such as processing and\n\ncooking drugs, procuring weapons, collecting monies, enforcing\n\ndiscipline, chastising rivals, accounting, and the like, as long as\n\nsuch   actions    are   performed   with   the   aim   of   furthering   the\n\nconspiracy.      See id.    To hold that defendants have \"joined\" a\n\nconspiracy, there must be sufficient evidence both that they knew\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fabout the conspiracy and that they knew the ancillary service would\n\nadvance that conspiracy.     Id.\n\n            Special issues arise when defendants argue that there\n\nwere multiple conspiracies and that their activities were not part\n\nof the conspiracy charged.    The initial issue -- and the only issue\n\nwe need to reach here -- is whether the government proved the\n\nconspiracy charged in the indictment.       This issue, assuming a\n\nproperly instructed jury, resolves into a sufficiency-of-evidence\n\nquestion.     United States v. Martinez-Medina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776396\"><a href=\"/opinion/776396/united-states-v-marcos-martinez-medina-united-states-of-america-v-manuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 &\n\nn.2 (1st Cir. 2002); United States v.

If the evidence is sufficient to support the\n\njury's finding that all the defendants are guilty of the single\n\nconspiracy charged, then no error has occurred.1\n\n            A number of factors come into play in determining whether\n\nthe evidence establishes a single conspiracy,2 including (1) the\n\n\n     1\n          If the evidence instead establishes agreements different\nfrom those charged, the next issue is variance.      The reviewing\ncourt asks whether the evidence is sufficient to permit a properly\ninstructed jury to convict the defendant of a similar related\nconspiracy, and if so, whether the variance between the two\nconspiracies affected the substantial rights of the defendant.\nUnited States v. Glenn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494122\"><a href=\"/opinion/494122/united-states-v-kenneth-robert-glenn-united-states-of-america-v-manuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 858 (1st Cir. 1987); see also\nKotteakos v.

First, they\n\nargue that there was no conspiracy at all because Soto-Ramírez and\n\nSoto-Beníquez were simply common distributors to a number of\n\n\n\ncourt uses a similar totality of the circumstances, multi-factored\napproach in analyzing a claim of that type. Id. at 734.\n\n                                         -19-\n\fdiverse and independent drug points.          This argument is belied by\n\nthe record, which shows a great deal more than common distribution.\n\nThe evidence establishes not only that Soto-Ramírez and Soto-\n\nBeníquez were the primary suppliers of the six drug points, but\n\nalso that the six drug points shared a common system of defense.\n\nVarious defendants stood guard at drug points owned by other co-\n\nconspirators to protect them from rival gang members. For example,\n\nVega-Colón, who worked at his father's point on Laguna Street, also\n\nstood as an armed guard at Rodríguez-López's point on Callejón\n\nNueve.   Those   standing   guard   at     different   drug   points   shared\n\nresources with each other.       They communicated among themselves via\n\nwalkie-talkies    or   radios,   issuing     alerts    when   the   police   or\n\nunfamiliar cars from outside Bitumul were in the area.              They also\n\nshared rifles purchased and stored by Soto-Beníquez, and ammunition\n\npurchased by Vega-Cosme after taking up collections from each of\n\nthe drug points.       When the drug points were threatened by rival\n\ngangs, members of the group would join together to guard vulnerable\n\npoints from attack.       After the shootout with the Chacho gang in\n\nDecember 1992, Negrón-Maldonado, Fernández-Malavé, and Vega-Pacheco\n\nstood guard together at Callejón Dos. And after the conspiracy was\n\nthreatened by members of the El Vizco gang, Soto-Beníquez, Negrón-\n\nMaldonado, Fernández-Malavé, and Cintrón-Caraballo stood guard\n\ntogether at the Street B drug point.            The six drug points also\n\nnegotiated as a group in settling disputes with rival gangs.             When\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fwar broke out against the Chacho gang at the end of 1992, Vega-\n\nCosme met with Chacho to negotiate on behalf of all six drug points\n\nbecause the war was interfering with drug sales at the Bitumul\n\npoints.\n\n            Furthermore, members of the group jointly avenged the\n\ndeaths of others involved in the operation of the six drug points.\n\nAfter the death of Cosme-Sobrado, who managed Soto-Ramírez's drug\n\npoints while he was in prison, members of the group met at Callejón\n\nDos.   Individuals from different drug points attended the meeting,\n\nincluding Soto-Beníquez and Alicea-Torres (Cuba Street point),\n\nVega-Cosme and Vega-Colón (Laguna Street point), Cintrón-Caraballo\n\n(Street B point), and Negrón-Maldonado (Callejón Nueve point).       As\n\na result of the meeting, Negrón-Maldonado and Cintrón-Caraballo\n\ncame together to kidnap and murder Rivera-González, whom Soto-\n\nRamírez's   wife   suspected   of   participating   in   Cosme-Sobrado's\n\nmurder.\n\n            In addition to this system of common defense, the co-\n\nconspirators had agreements regarding the distribution of narcotics\n\nat the drug points.    Vega-Cosme and Negrón-Maldonado met at least\n\nthree times to assign colors to the caps of crack capsules sold at\n\ndifferent points in the Bitumul Ward so that their origin could be\n\nidentified and competition between the points avoided.        Vega-Cosme\n\nalso asked Soto-Ramírez for permission before setting up his drug\n\npoint with his son Vega-Colón on Laguna Street.\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\f           The evidence supports the jury's finding that each of the\n\ndefendants joined in this common enterprise.    First, the evidence\n\nestablishes that each defendant joined in the common defense of the\n\npoints.    Seven of the defendants -- Soto-Ramírez, Soto-Beníquez,\n\nAlicea-Torres, Vega-Pacheco, Fernández-Malavé, García-García, and\n\nCintrón-Caraballo -- ordered or participated in murders to protect\n\nthe drug points.    Soto-Ramírez and Alicea-Torres killed a police\n\nofficer and a government informant who were about to discover the\n\ngroup's stash of weapons used to protect the drug points.     Soto-\n\nRamírez ordered the murder of one of his drug dealers when some\n\ncocaine and a machine gun disappeared, sending the message that\n\nthose who broke ranks and stole from the group would be punished.\n\nSee United States v. Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198229\"><a href=\"/opinion/198229/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(finding the beating of a member of the conspiracy suspected of\n\nbeing an informant to be in furtherance of the conspiracy because\n\nit served to \"maintain[] discipline in [the conspiracy's] ranks\").\n\nOn Soto-Beníquez's orders, Cintrón-Caraballo kidnapped Rivera-\n\nGonzález and brought him to Bitumul to be killed to avenge the\n\ndeath of Cosme-Sobrado.   Vega-Pacheco participated in the Quintana\n\nmassacre to avenge the death of Rivera-Pagán, a member of the\n\ngroup.    While defending the group's territory at Callejón Nueve,\n\nFernández-Malavé killed Tito Dones-Sanchez by opening fire on a van\n\nsuspected of containing rival gang members.    García-García killed\n\na member of the rival Chacho gang who threatened Rodríguez-López.\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f              Although not direct participants in those murders, the\n\nremaining four defendants also contributed to the common defense of\n\nthe drug points.            We put aside, for the moment, the issue of\n\nwhether   the    group's      post-1993      activities    involved     a   separate\n\nconspiracy.      De León Maysonet and Gonzalez-Ayala went to Fajardo\n\nfor the purpose of killing someone who threatened Rodríguez-López.\n\nVega-Cosme supplied ammunition for shootings of rival gang members\n\nin 1992 and 1993 and negotiated on behalf of the group with the\n\nChacho gang.      Vega-Colón stood as an armed guard at Rodríguez-\n\nLópez's point on Callejón Nueve.\n\n              Second, in addition to evidence that each defendant\n\nparticipated in the system of common defense, there is evidence\n\nthat each defendant participated in the common enterprise of\n\nselling drugs through the six points.              We again put aside for the\n\nmoment whether the group's post-1993 activities involved a separate\n\nconspiracy.      Soto-Ramírez controlled several drug points, and his\n\nhouse   was    used    to    prepare   and    package     crack   and   heroin   for\n\ndistribution at several of the drug points.                Soto-Beníquez was the\n\nprimary supplier of cocaine and crack to the six drug points.\n\nAlicea-Torres and Vega-Pacheco sold narcotics for points owned by\n\nSoto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez from 1990 to 1991. Fernández-Malavé\n\npackaged crack cocaine, cocaine, and heroin from 1992 to 1993, and\n\npackaged cocaine specifically for Soto-Ramírez from May 1992 to\n\nDecember 1992.        García-García sold narcotics for Soto-Beníquez and\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fSoto-Ramírez     from    1990    to   1991,       packaged   narcotics    in   1992,\n\nreturned   to    selling     narcotics        for    Rodríguez-López      in   1993.\n\nCintrón-Caraballo supervised a drug point for crack cocaine and\n\ndistributed cocaine and crack cocaine for Soto-Ramírez throughout\n\nthe duration of the conspiracy.              Gonzalez-Ayala helped Rodríguez-\n\nLópez steal 200 kilograms of cocaine for the conspiracy in 1993 and\n\nsubsequently     packaged       and   distributed      it.     De    Leon-Maysonet\n\npackaged and stored narcotics for the conspiracy from 1990 to 1992\n\nand then sold narcotics at the Callejón Nueve point in 1993.\n\nVega-Cosme supplied ammunition and narcotics to Soto-Ramírez and\n\ndistributed heroin at a drug point with Soto-Ramírez's permission\n\nthroughout      the     duration      of     the    conspiracy.        Vega-Colón,\n\nVega-Cosme's son, packaged crack, heroin, and marijuana for his\n\nfather's point.\n\n           The    second    argument         challenging     the    sufficiency   of\n\nevidence proving a single conspiracy is presented by defendants\n\nGarcía-García, de León Maysonet and Gonzalez-Ayala.                      They argue\n\nthat the government overreached in counting as part of one massive\n\nconspiracy a separate, later, and antagonistic drug-selling group.\n\nThe three defendants argue that they cannot be guilty of the\n\ncontinuing conspiracy when they were in competition with the\n\noriginal conspiracy and the original conspirators were out to kill\n\nthe head of their drug group.              They concede that the evidence does\n\nshow their involvement with separate drug points. But the evidence\n\n\n                                           -24-\n\fdoes not, they contend, show that they participated in an overall\n\ndrug conspiracy headed by Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez.      They\n\nargue that this conspiracy effectively ended by the summer of 1993.\n\nIn January 1992, Soto-Ramírez was arrested and incarcerated.   And\n\nWilliam Soto-Beníquez, after escaping death in a shootout, ceased\n\nactivities in Bitumul in December 1992 and moved to Florida in\n\n1993. Cosme-Sobrado, who succeeded Soto-Ramírez, was killed on May\n\n12, 1992, and Victor Negrón-Maldonado left for Philadelphia in June\n\nor July 1993.\n\n          The three defendants argue that later events centered\n\naround a separate conspiracy, led by Rodríguez-López.   Rodríguez-\n\nLópez, who had originally been part of the conspiracy headed by\n\nSoto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez, left Bitumul for Fajardo in the\n\nsummer of 1993 to avoid being arrested for his involvement in the\n\nQuintana massacre.     While in Fajardo, he stole a 200 kilogram\n\nshipment of cocaine.   Upon his return to San Juan in June or July\n\nof 1993, and without consulting anyone in Bitumul, Rodríguez-López\n\nreestablished a drug point at Callejón Nueve with the stolen\n\ncocaine, employing outsiders from Fajardo to operate the point.\n\nNegrón-Maldonado testified that while he was in Philadelphia, he\n\nhad telephone conversations with people in Bitumul, including\n\nCintrón-Caraballo, who wanted to kill Rodríguez-López for bringing\n\noutsiders into the Bitumul operation; Torrens-Alicea confirmed that\n\n\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fsome members of the original group \"were out to kill\" Rodríguez-\n\nLópez.\n\n           Each of the three defendants argues that the multiple\n\nconspiracies theory affects his liability in a different way.\n\nGonzalez-Ayala contends that, at most, he was a member only of a\n\nlater uncharged conspiracy headed by Rodríguez-López; he did not\n\njoin any conspiracy at all until the summer of 1993, when he helped\n\nRodríguez-López steal the shipment of cocaine and returned with\n\nRodríguez-López     to     set   up   the   drug   point   at   Callejón    Nueve.\n\nGonzalez-Ayala thus contends that no evidence ties him to the other\n\nBitumul drug points or the earlier murders connected with those\n\ndrug points.\n\n           De León Maysonet contends that he was prejudiced by the\n\ngovernment's      single     conspiracy       theory   because     all     of   his\n\nparticipation in the original conspiracy occurred while he was a\n\nminor.    He was nonetheless held liable as an adult because he\n\nsupposedly ratified the conspiracy by continuing to participate\n\nafter he turned eighteen on January 12, 1992.                   United States v.\n\nWelch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195118\"><a href=\"/opinion/195118/united-states-v-welch/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1211-12 (1st Cir. 1993).                      He contends,\n\nhowever, that the only acts of ratification presented by the\n\ngovernment occurred after the original conspiracy had ended and\n\nRodríguez-López had taken over.\n\n           García-García argues that the government's presentation\n\nof   a   single    overarching        conspiracy,      rather     than   multiple\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fconspiracies, subjected him to evidence of murders in which he did\n\nnot participate.    García-García contends that the only murder in\n\nwhich he allegedly participated -- that of Oscar Nazario-Rivera --\n\noccurred after the original conspiracy ended and was not drug-\n\nrelated.\n\n            The jury was instructed on multiple conspiracies, at the\n\nrequest of the defense.   The district court informed the jury that\n\nit must acquit \"[e]ven if the evidence in the case shows that\n\ndefendants were a member of some conspiracy, and not the single\n\nconspiracy charged in the indictment.\" As noted earlier, where the\n\njury was properly instructed and found the defendants guilty of\n\nconspiracy, its verdict is reviewable only for sufficiency of\n\nevidence.    David, 940 F.2d at 732.\n\n            On the evidence, a jury could have concluded that there\n\nwas a later, rival conspiracy, but it was not compelled to do so.\n\nThere is sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict of\n\nguilt, as well as its implicit finding that a single conspiracy\n\nexisted that extended through the summer of 1993.    The jury could\n\nplausibly have found that Rodríguez-López was a member of the\n\noriginal conspiracy, that the reestablishment of the Callejón Nueve\n\ndrug point in the small neighborhood of Bitumul was part of an\n\nagreed-upon general operation to sell drugs and to control the drug\n\ntrade in Bitumul, that the tension among the members of the\n\noverarching group did not destroy the overall agreement, that those\n\n\n                                -27-\n\ftensions were worked out, and that the cooperation worked to\n\neveryone's benefit and continued to provide a system of common\n\ndefense.\n\n           Government informant Luis Torrens-Alicea testified that\n\ndifferences   between   Rodríguez-López     and    the   original   Bitumul\n\nconspiracy    were   \"ironed   out\"    during   two   meetings   involving\n\nRodríguez-López, Negrón-Maldonado, and Cintrón-Caraballo at the El\n\nTrebol housing project in August or September of 1993.3               Other\n\nevidence corroborates this account.       Members of the original group\n\ncontinued to transact and meet with Rodríguez-López after his\n\nreturn.    Negrón-Maldonado bought heroin on credit from Rodríguez-\n\nLópez on at least one occasion, and \"cooked\" crack cocaine for\n\nRodríguez-López.      \"Peter,\"   who    managed    Soto-Ramírez's    point,\n\nAlicea-Torres, and Vega-Cosme all distributed kilograms of cocaine\n\nfor Rodríguez-López after his return.             On September 12, 1993,\n\nGarcía-García, de León Maysonet, and two other members of the\n\noriginal Bitumul group joined together with newcomers Gonzalez-\n\nAyala and Torrens-Alicea to find and kill Vitito, who had been\n\nhired to kill those who had stolen the 200 kilogram shipment of\n\ncocaine in Fajardo.     Furthermore, after Rodríguez-López's return,\n\n\n\n     3\n          Torrens-Alicea also testified that, at this meeting,\nCintrón-Caraballo and Negrón-Maldonado informed Rodríguez-López\nthat they now sought to kill Soto-Ramírez and his associates.\nBecause Soto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez had already left Bitumul at\nthis point, however, these new tensions did not prevent the drug\npoints from working together, as described infra.\n\n                                  -28-\n\fSoto-Ramírez, Vega-Cosme, Cintrón-Caraballo, and Negrón-Maldonado\n\nall continued to operate the same drug points, and García-García,\n\nde León Maysonet, Alicea-Torres, Fernández-Malavé, and two other\n\nmembers of the original conspiracy continued to work at those\n\npoints.\n\n            Moreover, contrary to defendants' assertions that the\n\ndrug points operated independently after the summer of 1993, the\n\nevidence permitted the conclusion that they continued to work\n\ntogether.    Negrón-Maldonado's three meetings with Vega-Cosme to\n\ncoordinate the cap colors for crack capsules occurred between\n\nSeptember   and   November   of   1993,   three   to   five    months   after\n\nRodríguez-López's return.     In addition, members of the conspiracy\n\nacted jointly to defend each other from threats.                  Vega-Cosme\n\ncontinued to purchase ammunition for the collective defense of the\n\ndrug points.   On September 12, 1993, as mentioned earlier, members\n\nof the original Bitumul group joined with the newcomers to find and\n\nkill Vitito, who had been hired to kill Rodríguez-López and others.\n\nOn October 11, 1993, Torrens-Alicea, García-García, and two other\n\nindividuals murdered Oscar Nazario-Rivera, a member of the rival\n\nChacho gang who had threatened Rodríguez-López.               Members of the\n\nconspiracy also continued to warn one another about possible\n\nthreats.    In 1994, after Vega-Cosme's drug point was shot at by\n\nindividuals from San Jose, he went to Cintrón-Caraballo and Negrón-\n\nMaldonado to warn them of the danger.       And on several occasions in\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fearly 1994, after Alberto Santiago-Figueroa, who ran the El Palo\n\npoint on Laguna Street, saw people armed with rifles driving by his\n\npoint, he sent a messenger to inform Negrón-Maldonado of what he\n\nhad seen.\n\n            Because the record supports the jury's finding of a\n\nsingle conspiracy, the three defendants are liable for their\n\nparticipation.          Although   Gonzalez-Ayala    may   have    joined    the\n\nconspiracy late, as long as he did so knowingly, he is liable for\n\nthe conspiracy itself and earlier acts in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.       David, 940 F.2d at 735.       A jury could easily have\n\nfound that he joined knowingly.        Gonzalez-Ayala was present at the\n\nmeeting of Negrón-Maldonado, Cintrón-Caraballo, and Rodríguez-López\n\nin August or September of 1993, in which they worked out their\n\ndifferences.      He also participated in the trip to Fajardo to kill\n\nVitito.     Mere association with conspirators does not establish a\n\nknowing intent to join a conspiracy. United States v.

Pre-Trial\n\n     1.    Grand Jury Misconduct\n           (Soto-Beníquez, Soto-Ramírez, Fernández-Malavé)4\n\n             One event concerning a grand jury witness underlies a\n\nnumber of issues presented by the defense.\n\n             The   government     used   a    then-cooperating    conspirator,\n\nRodríguez-López, as a grand jury witness in obtaining the original\n\nindictment on April 10, 1997.            In July of 1998, the prosecution\n\nfirst learned that it might have been misled by Rodríguez-López.\n\n\n\n     4\n          A number of defendants present no argument on issues but\npurport to adopt arguments presented by other defendants on those\nissues.   In no instance in which that is done is the argument\nsuccessful. When an issue is listed as raised by a defendant, the\ndefendant listed is the one who argued the issue.\n\n                                       -31-\n\fNegrón-Maldonado, who had just started cooperating with federal\n\nauthorities, informed the prosecution that Rodríguez-López was not,\n\nas he had told the prosecution, present at Rivera-González's\n\nmurder.    When confronted with this information, Rodríguez-López\n\nadmitted that he had lied to FBI investigators about being present\n\nat the murder but insisted that he had not fabricated any of his\n\ntestimony before the grand jury, which did not address the Rivera-\n\nGonzález murder.\n\n           Rather than disclose this information immediately, the\n\nprosecution    waited      and    investigated.       In       November      1998,    the\n\ngovernment     learned     from    a    second   cooperating          defendant      that\n\nRodríguez-López also might have lied about his presence at several\n\nother murders, including at least one murder about which he had\n\ntestified to the grand jury, that of Rivera-Pagán. On November 18,\n\nthe government notified defense counsel of this inconsistency.                         It\n\nalso insisted that Rodríguez-López, who still denied lying to the\n\ngrand jury, take a polygraph test.               When he failed the test on\n\nDecember 1, Rodríguez-López admitted that he had indeed lied during\n\nthe grand jury proceedings and that he had not been present at\n\nRivera-Pagán's murder.           On December 14, the prosecution obtained a\n\nsuperseding indictment from the grand jury that changed Rodríguez-\n\nLópez   from   a   star    government      witness    to       a    defendant.        The\n\nsuperseding indictment, which was returned 15 days before trial\n\nstarted,   was     based   on     the   testimony    of    a       federal   agent    who\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\fpresented the government's evidence that Rodríguez-López had lied\n\nto the FBI.   Rodríguez-López did not testify at trial.\n\n          Several defendants object that their convictions were\n\nirreparably tainted by Rodríguez-López's perjury before the grand\n\njury. The trial court rejected this claim, holding that the fact\n\nthat the superseding indictment was obtained and the perjured\n\ntestimony was not presented at trial cured any problem.        That\n\nruling was correct.\n\n          The unknowing presentation of perjured testimony before\n\nthe grand jury was harmless and does not warrant any remedial\n\naction.   \"[A]s a general matter, a district court may not dismiss\n\nan indictment for errors in grand jury proceedings unless such\n\nerrors prejudiced the defendants.\"    Bank of Nova Scotia v.

As described in\n\nour case law, the elements of a CCE crime are (1) the defendant\n\ncommitted a felony violation of the federal narcotics laws, (2) the\n\nviolation was part of a continuing series of violations, (3) the\n\nseries of offenses occurred in concert with five or more persons,\n\n(4) the defendant was an organizer, supervisor, or manager, and (5)\n\nthe defendant obtained substantial income or resources from the\n\nseries of violations.

We think it preferable for\n\npredicate offenses to be alleged in the CCE count.    But, at least\n\nwhere the CCE count incorporates by reference predicate offenses\n\ncharged elsewhere in the indictment, failure to list predicate\n\noffenses in the CCE count itself is not reversible error because\n\nthe defendant has been provided fair notice.

Count Two did provide such notice.   Count Two\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\fstates that \"at divers times\" between January 1, 1990 and March 7,\n\n1994, the defendants distributed and possessed with intent to\n\ndistribute heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana.            It\n\nfurther states that the defendants \"would purchase multi-kilogram\n\nquantities of heroin, cocaine and marijuana at wholesale prices, .\n\n. . would cut, divide, and package [the drugs] in small packages\n\nfor subsequent sale at drug points, [and] . . . would sell packaged\n\n[drugs] in small quantities to customers at drug points.\"           That\n\ncount also alleges specifically that Soto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez\n\nsupervised the \"supply [of] sellers with the drugs to be sold . . .\n\nand [the sale of] narcotics at drug point,\" and that they would\n\n\"personally deliver packaged narcotics to [their] runners and\n\nsellers.\"\n\n            Defendants argue (1) that the acts described in Count Two\n\nare insufficient to provide notice because they establish only one\n\npredicate offense, namely, the conspiracy to distribute narcotics,5\n\nand   (2)   that   the   acts   are   insufficiently   described.   Both\n\nassertions are incorrect.       As to the defendants' first contention,\n\neach act of distribution described in the indictment constitutes a\n\nseparate predicate offense. See, e.g., United States v.

Multiple acts of distribution,\n\ncertainly        three    or    more,     are   alleged.        As   to   their   second\n\ncontention, the time period and acts are alleged in sufficient\n\ndetail to provide adequate notice.\n\n             Defendants then argue that the indictment failed to\n\nspecify either the amount of drugs distributed or the amount of\n\n\"substantial income\" received by the defendants, thus depriving\n\nthem of notice as to whether they were charged under 21 U.S.C. §\n\n848(a) or (b).           Section 848(a) carries a sentence of thirty years\n\nto life, whereas § 848(b) carries a mandatory life sentence.                           We\n\nreject defendants' argument.                Defendants, merely by reading the\n\nindictment, were on notice of the possibility of a life sentence.\n\nSection 848(b) requires life imprisonment for the \"principal . . .\n\nleaders\" of the continuing criminal enterprise if their violation\n\nof   the   drug     laws       involved    more    than   300    times     the   quantity\n\ndescribed in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).                    The indictment identified\n\nSoto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez as the two \"leader[s] . . . of the\n\ndrug-trafficking organization described in Counts One and Two.\" It\n\nalso identified them as conspiring to distribute, inter alia, more\n\nthan five kilograms of cocaine base, which is more than 300 times\n\nthe five grams of cocaine base described in § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                            -38-\n\f          Defendants      also   argue    that      in   the    indictment      the\n\npredicate offenses for the CCE charge were based on the conspiracy\n\ncount, but at trial, the government used evidence of uncharged\n\nnarcotics offenses to establish the predicate offenses.                      Thus,\n\ndefendants argue, although the CCE charge remained the same, the\n\nfacts used to prove the series element of the charge were different\n\nfrom those set forth in the indictment.\n\n          Defendants frame this argument as a claim of constructive\n\namendment, but it is actually a claim of variance. \"A constructive\n\namendment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are\n\naltered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court\n\nafter the grand jury has last passed upon them.

Convictions may be reversed based on\n\nvariance only upon a showing of prejudice to the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights -- that is, when lack of notice regarding the\n\ncharges deprives    the    defendant     of   his    ability     to   prepare    an\n\neffective defense and to avoid surprise at trial.                     Id.    Here,\n\ndefendants were not prejudiced.          The indictment charged them with\n\nviolations of narcotics laws from January 1990 to March 1994; the\n\nuse of narcotics offenses in that time period should have been no\n\nsurprise to them.\n\n\n                                   -39-\n\f               ii.

That intent, they contend, is to enhance punishment for\n\nlarge-scale drug kingpins.   Defendants argue that the evidence did\n\nnot show them to be kingpins because they lived modestly.      The\n\ngovernment argues that we should not entertain this argument\n\nbecause the crime charged is within the statutory language and that\n\nends the inquiry.    If the crime charged is literally within the\n\nwords of the statute, there is not usually occasion to inquire into\n\nintent. See United States v.

Soto-Beníquez sold at least $10,000 worth of\n\ncocaine per week to Negrón-Maldonado.     Soto-Ramírez owned three\n\ndrug points for at least three years, each of which yielded\n\napproximately $5,000 per week from crack cocaine alone.       These\n\nfigures provide sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding\n\nof substantial income.\n\n          c)   Statute of Limitations\n               (Soto-Beníquez, Soto-Ramírez)\n\n          Soto-Beníquez   and   Soto-Ramírez   argue   that   their\n\nprosecution was untimely under the statute of limitations.

In\n\nthis case, the indictment is dated April 11, 1997.                           Thus, the\n\nprosecution had to prove that one predicate act was committed on or\n\nafter April 12, 1992.\n\n              The    parties    dispute    which     acts      count   as    predicate\n\noffenses    for     purposes    of     determining      whether    the      statute    of\n\nlimitations has run.            Soto-Beníquez and Soto-Ramírez argue, by\n\nanalogy to the RICO statute, that only the acts of the parties\n\ncharged with the CCE count, and not those of their co-conspirators,\n\nmay be considered.

The government argues that it need only demonstrate that\n\nacts in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred within the five-year\n\nlimitations period and that the defendants failed to withdraw from\n\nthe conspiracy.\n\n              We need not resolve this issue because the evidence,\n\nviewed   in    the    light     most    favorable       to   the   prosecution,        is\n\nsufficient to support the conclusion that both Soto-Ramírez and\n\nSoto-Beníquez themselves committed predicate offenses after April\n\n12, 1992.      Although Soto-Ramírez was incarcerated on January 8,\n\n\n                                         -41-\n\f1992, the government presented evidence that he still controlled\n\nand managed the drug points at La Pared, Callejón Nueve, and Cuba\n\nStreet.    While he was in prison, he employed Cosme-Sobrado to\n\nmanage the points until May 1992.           After Cosme-Sobrado was killed,\n\nSoto-Ramírez appointed \"Manolín\" and \"Peter\" as Cosme-Sobrado's\n\nsuccessors. Soto-Ramírez gave instructions on the operation of the\n\npoints by telephone, and the proceeds from the points were given to\n\nSoto-Ramírez's wife.         This evidence of Soto-Ramírez's own acts\n\nwithin    the    five-year   period    is    sufficient   to    establish   the\n\ntimeliness of his indictment.\n\n            Soto-Beníquez     argues    that    he   ceased    all   activities\n\nrelated to the conspiracy in December 1992 when he moved to\n\nFlorida.        Assuming arguendo that this statement is true, the\n\nDecember 1992 date does not help Soto-Beníquez. The operative date\n\nfor limitations purposes is April 12, 1992, some eight months\n\nearlier.    The record supports the conclusion that Soto-Beníquez\n\nengaged in predicate offenses after that date.                In January 1993,\n\nfor example, Soto-Beníquez provided transportation, firearms, and\n\na hide-out for members of the Bitumul gang after the Quintana\n\nmassacre, in which the gang murdered five people in retaliation for\n\nthe death of fellow gang member Rivera-Pagán.                  Soto-Beníquez's\n\nindictment was not barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\f     3.

This argument does not present an issue that is\n\nreviewable by this court.

On December 28, 1998, the day\n\non which jury selection began, the district court decided to split\n\nthe sixteen defendants who planned to go to trial into two groups.\n\nThe government proposed that the first ten defendants on the\n\nindictment become the first group to go to trial.

Two other\n\ndefendants were severed because they could not yet proceed to\n\ntrial; one was still a fugitive and the other, Rodríguez-López, had\n\nbeen    indicted    only   two   weeks      earlier.     Having      severed    five\n\ndefendants, the district court was left with the eleven appellants\n\nand decided to proceed to trial with all eleven.\n\n            Gonzalez-Ayala and de León Maysonet contend that the\n\ndistrict court erred in refusing to sever their cases.                   Rule 14,\n\nFed. R. Crim. P., allows a trial court to sever defendants when\n\njoinder would prejudice them.           Gonzalez-Ayala and de León Maysonet\n\nargue that the joinder prejudiced them by forcing them to go to\n\ntrial with    more    senior     conspirators.         They   contend    that    the\n\ncomplexity of the case and the markedly different degrees of\n\nculpability between them and their co-defendants, many of whom\n\ncommitted murders or held leadership positions in the conspiracy,\n\ncreated the potential for jury confusion.                Moreover, they argue\n\nthat they were prejudiced by the presentation of spillover evidence\n\n\n                                        -44-\n\fregarding fifteen murders committed by their co-defendants, in\n\nwhich they did not participate.\n\n          We review the district court's denial of defendants'\n\nmotions for severance under Fed.

Rather than resort to the drastic remedy of\n\ndismissal, the district court wisely addressed the prosecution's\n\nfailures to comply with discovery deadlines on a situation-by-\n\nsituation basis in order to prevent or remedy any prejudice that\n\nthose violations may have had on the defendants.

For instance, in response to the government's failure to\n\ncomply with one discovery order, the district court chastised the\n\nprosecution and ordered the government to provide the defendants\n\nwith information not normally covered by Rule 16 of the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure.            Addressing another violation, the\n\ndistrict court set an accelerated discovery timetable and warned\n\nthe prosecution that \"[i]f the government fails to comply, the\n\ncourt will dismiss the indictment.\" In a third instance, the court\n\nrefused to admit into evidence a photograph that the prosecution\n\nhad not adequately disclosed to the defense.                       Each of these\n\nresponses to the government's discovery violations helped mitigate\n\nany prejudice to the defendants that might otherwise have resulted\n\nfrom    the    government's      apparent    inability      to    meet   discovery\n\ndeadlines.      Given this solution, the district court's continual\n\ndenials of the defendants' motions to dismiss the indictment due to\n\nthe government's discovery violations were certainly not abuses of\n\ndiscretion.         That   conclusion    is    not    a    condonation      of   the\n\ngovernment's behavior; it is just a recognition that reversal of\n\nthe    conviction    is    not   warranted,   given       the    district   court's\n\nimposition of other sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -48-\n\fC.

The district court found that the three\n\nmurders were not part of the conspiracy, but admitted the evidence\n\nover the defendants' Rule 403 objection because the three murders\n\nexplained the motive for subsequent murders that did further the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n            The district court's ruling is reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.

The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\n\nevidence.     Cosme-Sobrado's murder was relevant to demonstrate a\n\nmotive for an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy: the\n\nkidnapping and murder of Herberto Rivera-González.        Members of the\n\nconspiracy    killed   Rivera-González   because   he   was   a   suspected\n\nparticipant in Cosme-Sobrado's murder.      Cosme-Sobrado's death was\n\nalso important to demonstrate that conspirators from different drug\n\npoints would come together to avenge the death of a member of their\n\ngang.     Similarly, the killings of Rivera-Pagán and Millan-Soto in\n\nshootings by the Chacho gang were relevant to demonstrate the basis\n\nfor gang warfare with Chacho.     This gang warfare led to two overt\n\n                                  -49-\n\facts in furtherance of the conspiracy: the murder of Roberto\n\nVasallo-Morninglane, who was a member of the Chacho gang, and the\n\nQuintana massacre.\n\n           Soto-Ramírez      and    Soto-Beníquez         also    claim,    without\n\nfurther explanation, that they were prejudiced by evidence of\n\ntwelve   other    murders.      Because      this   argument       is    made    in   a\n\nperfunctory     manner,   unaccompanied       by    any   effort    at     developed\n\nargumentation, it has been waived.

They argue that the murders were not shown to be in\n\nfurtherance of the charged conspiracy.              They also argue that even\n\nif the murders were in furtherance of a conspiracy headed by Soto-\n\nRamírez and Soto-Beníquez from 1990 until the summer of 1993, those\n\nmurders did not advance the interests of the later conspiracy\n\nheaded by Rodríguez-López.          These errors regarding the admission\n\nof the murder evidence, they contend, cannot be harmless because\n\nthe   murders     constituted      about     seventy-five        percent    of    the\n\ngovernment's evidence at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -50-\n\f          Review is for abuse of discretion.            No abuse occurred\n\nhere.   The three murders discussed in the previous section were\n\nadmissible to demonstrate the motive for subsequent overt acts in\n\nfurtherance    of   the   conspiracy.     The   remaining   murders   were\n\nadmissible as acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n          A reasonable factfinder could infer that the murder of\n\nDagoberto Robles-Rodríguez was in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nSoto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez worked for Robles-Rodríguez, who\n\nowned the drug point on Cuba Street, at the time of the murder.\n\nNegrón-Maldonado testified that Soto-Ramírez teamed up with co-\n\nconspirators Cosme-Vega and \"Manolín\" and killed Robles-Rodríguez\n\nat least partly because Soto-Ramírez felt threatened by him.\n\nAfterwards, Soto-Ramírez and Soto-Beníquez took control of Robles-\n\nRodríguez's drug point.        A reasonable inference is that Soto-\n\nRamírez killed Robles-Rodríguez to avoid further threats and to\n\ngain full control of the drug point, thus eliminating a potential\n\ncompetitor to the conspiracy.\n\n          It   is   also   a   reasonable   inference    that   government\n\ninformant Ana Luz Dones-Arroyo and undercover police officer Efrain\n\nHernández de León were killed in furtherance of the conspiracy --\n\nto prevent their discovery of the group's weapons stash.          The two\n\nwere gunned down as Dones-Arroyo was leading the officer to the\n\nlocation of the stash.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\f              Fernando Agosto-Villegas was killed on Soto-Ramírez's\n\norders because two-eighths of a kilogram of cocaine and a machine\n\ngun belonging to Soto-Ramírez were missing.               The murder furthered\n\nthe conspiracy by sending the message that those suspected of\n\nstealing from the conspiracy would be treated harshly.                 Rodriguez,\n\n162 F.3d at 143.\n\n              Herberto Rivera-González was killed in retribution for\n\nthe death of Cosme-Sobrado, who had been managing Soto-Ramírez's\n\ndrug point for him while he was in prison.                       The defendants\n\ncorrectly note that the government never proved that Rivera-\n\nGonzález was actually a member of a rival gang or participated in\n\nkilling Cosme-Sobrado.

But, as discussed earlier, the three defendants are\n\nliable for conspiracy.          As a result, they are liable for acts in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy, even if they did not participate in\n\nthose acts and even if those acts occurred before they joined the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n            c)     Admission of Guilty Pleas\n                   (Fernández-Malavé, Gonzalez-Ayala, de León Maysonet)\n\n            The district court admitted into evidence Fernández-\n\nMalavé's guilty plea to the murder of Tito Dones-Sanchez over\n\ndefense counsel's objection that the plea was not knowing and\n\nvoluntary.6      According to Fernández-Malavé, his plea in Puerto Rico\n\n\n     6\n          Fernández-Malavé also asserts in his brief a different\nobjection to the admission of his guilty plea, rooted in Fed.

Furthermore, the court concluded that the Puerto Rico\n\nprosecutor did not mislead Fernández-Malavé about the admissibility\n\nof the unavailable witness's prior testimony, but was instead\n\nsimply advocating a plausible interpretation of the Puerto Rico\n\nevidence rules.     Fernández-Malavé has not presented any reason to\n\ndoubt these findings.\n\n           De León Maysonet and Gonzalez-Ayala also object to the\n\ndistrict court's admission of their plea agreements regarding state\n\ncrimes; de León Maysonet had pled guilty to possessing a controlled\n\nsubstance, while Gonzalez-Ayala had pled guilty to conspiring or\n\nattempting to violate the Puerto Rico controlled substances law.\n\nThe argument of these defendants differs slightly from that of\n\nFernández-Malavé: they claim that the plea agreements were not\n\nadmissible because the government did not enter in evidence a\n\ntranscript   of    their   plea    colloquies      in     Puerto    Rico   court.\n\nGonzalez-Ayala also argues that his plea should not have been\n\nadmitted because the crime to which he pled encompasses numerous\n\ntypes of criminal activity, making it impossible for the jury to\n\ndetermine the activities for which he was actually convicted.7\n\n\n     7\n          The defendants also argue briefly that the convictions\nwere inadmissible hearsay because they did not fall within Rule\n803(22). This argument is not developed in the defendants' brief,\nand, in any case, is not meritorious. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(22)\n(exception to hearsay rule for \"[e]vidence of a final judgment,\n\n                                        -56-\n\f            The district court had a sufficient basis to reject these\n\narguments as well.             Even without the transcript of the plea\n\ncolloquy, the pleas linked the defendants to the charged drug\n\nconspiracy: according to the arresting officer, both Gonzalez-Ayala\n\nand de León Maysonet possessed heroin and a firearm when they were\n\narrested.    Had the defendants produced specific evidence that the\n\nguilty pleas were coerced, the admissibility of the pleas might be\n\nquestionable.       But defendants cannot defeat the relevance of these\n\nguilty pleas by making unsupported allegations that they were not\n\nvoluntary.\n\n            For similar reasons, we reject Gonzalez-Ayala's argument\n\nthat his plea should not have been admitted because the statute to\n\nwhich he pled guilty applied to more than one factual scenario.\n\nThe guilty plea corroborated the fact that Gonzalez-Ayala was found\n\ncarrying    drugs    and   a    weapon,    and    that   fact   was   relevant   in\n\nestablishing that he was part of the charged conspiracy.\n\n             d)     Admission of the Testimony of Cesário-Soto\n                    (Alicea-Torres)\n\n             Alicea-Torres       makes    a      separate   argument    that     the\n\ngovernment knowingly offered in evidence perjured testimony from\n\nwitness Cesário-Soto.          Cesário-Soto testified at trial that he had\n\nobserved Alicea-Torres sell drugs at two different drug points.\n\n\nentered after a trial or upon a plea of guilty . . . adjudging a\nperson guilty of a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in\nexcess of one year, to prove any fact essential to sustain the\njudgment\").\n\n                                         -57-\n\fAlicea-Torres alleges that at an earlier interview conducted by his\n\ncounsel and attended by the prosecuting attorney, Cesário-Soto\n\nstated only that Alicea-Torres was in the area.   That discrepancy\n\nprovides the basis for the defendant's misconduct claim.\n\n           We bypass the question whether the defendant properly\n\npreserved the objection and reject on the merits his claim that the\n\nprosecution knowingly used perjured testimony.     First, the two\n\nstatements by Cesário-Soto are not necessarily conflicting. At the\n\ninterview, defense counsel did not pursue what was meant by the\n\nwitness's statement that Alicea-Torres was \"in the area.\"   Second,\n\nthere was no prejudice.   Defense counsel cross-examined Cesário-\n\nSoto as to the supposed conflict between his testimony and the\n\nstatements he made during the interview.    Moreover, Cesário-Soto\n\nwas not the only witness to link Alicea-Torres to two different\n\ndrug points: Negrón-Maldonado testified that Alicia-Torres sold\n\ndrugs at Calejon Dos and Torrens-Alicea testified that Alicea-\n\nTorres conducted drug transactions with Rodríguez-López and spent\n\ntime at Callejón Nueve. There is no reasonable likelihood that any\n\nfalse testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.   Cf.\n\nKyles v.

He contends that the photograph was taken after\n\nOfficers   Rosa-Lopez      and    Victor-Rivera        illegally   entered   and\n\nsearched his apartment without a warrant.\n\n           The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the\n\nsuppression     motion    and    held    that    the   warrantless   entry   was\n\njustified by exigent circumstances.             The court made the following\n\nfactual determinations.          Officer Rosa-Lopez was on routine patrol\n\nduring the evening of April 9, 1993 when he saw a person carrying\n\na nickel plated gun in his hand.                Before he could respond, the\n\nindividual noticed Officer Rosa-Lopez (who was in uniform) and\n\nbegan to run in the opposite direction. Officer Rosa-Lopez pursued\n\nthe suspect up a nearby stairway between two houses, but lost sight\n\nof   him   when   he     apparently     jumped    onto    an   adjacent   patio.\n\nMeanwhile, Officer Victor-Rivera was patrolling the same area when\n\nhe received notice on his police radio of the pursuit involving\n\nOfficer Rosa-Lopez.       While he was approaching the area to provide\n\nback-up, he observed an individual carrying a black gun.                     That\n\nindividual, on spotting Officer Victor-Rivera (who was in uniform),\n\nimmediately turned around and ran into a house behind him. Officer\n\n                                        -59-\n\fVictor-Rivera followed the person, later identified as Fernández-\n\nMalavé, into the house and pursued him up the stairway.       Officer\n\nRosa-Lopez, still searching for the first suspect outside, heard a\n\nwindow open.   He turned toward the noise and saw someone drop a gun\n\nand a plastic bag containing drugs out of the window.        When he\n\nlooked through the window, he saw Fernández-Malavé inside. He then\n\nseized the drugs and the weapon.       After a third officer told him\n\nthat Officer Victor-Rivera was inside, Officer Rosa-Lopez went to\n\nthe front of the house.    Officer Rosa-Lopez explained to Officer\n\nVictor-Rivera that he had just observed Fernández-Malavé drop the\n\nseized drugs and weapon out of the back window, and Fernández-\n\nMalavé was placed under arrest.\n\n          This court reviews the district court's findings of fact\n\nfor clear error and its ultimate Fourth Amendment conclusion de\n\nnovo.   Ornelas v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 699 (1996).       The\n\ndistrict court's rendition of facts is not clearly erroneous.\n\nFernández-Malavé unsuccessfully attempts to discredit the court's\n\nfindings by noting that much of Officer Rosa-Lopez's testimony was\n\nnot included in an earlier sworn statement of his.         There are\n\nmultiple explanations for why Officer Rosa-Lopez might not have\n\nreported certain details about his encounter with Fernández-Malavé\n\nin his sworn statement, including his belief at the time that those\n\ndetails were not important.   The absence of those details does not\n\nestablish clear error.\n\n\n                                -60-\n\f           The district court's Fourth Amendment conclusion was\n\ncorrect.   Once Fernández-Malavé abandoned the weapon and drugs by\n\nthrowing them out of the window, he had no reasonable expectation\n\nof privacy in those items and their seizure did not itself violate\n\nhis Fourth Amendment rights.           It is well settled that if a\n\ndefendant abandons property while he is being pursued by police\n\nofficers, he forfeits any reasonable expectation of privacy he may\n\nhave had in that property.       See Abel v.

Nevertheless, if Officer Victor-Rivera's pursuit\n\nof Fernández-Malavé into his house was unconstitutional, then the\n\nevidence of the drugs might well have been subject to suppression\n\nas the fruit of an illegal entry.
