The question here is whether a\n\nLiquidating Supervisor in bankruptcy has the authority pursuant to\n\n11 U.S.C. §§ 363(b) and 704 to settle a disputed claim for the full\n\namount   of    that   claim    in   order    to   avoid   the    expenditure   of\n\nattorneys’ fees and costs.            We hold that such a settlement is\n\nauthorized,     and   that    the   bankruptcy    court    did   not   abuse   its\n\ndiscretion in approving the settlement in this case.\n\n                                        I\n\n              ServiSense.com, Inc. (“ServiSense”) was a corporation\n\nengaged in the business of reselling telecommunications services to\n\nresidential customers.        In March of 2000 ServiSense hired David A.\n\nDane as its Vice President - Customer Care.                He was subsequently\n\npromoted to President and Chief Operating Officer on December 21,\n\n2000. Under his employment agreement, Dane was to be paid a yearly\n\nsalary, and “[a]fter 12 consecutive months of employment,” he was\n\nentitled to receive “12 months salary and benefits if terminated\n\nwithout cause” (the “severance agreement”).               (App. at 346.)   As of\n\nOctober of 2000, the amount of Dane’s annual salary was $135,000,\n\nand the value of Dane’s benefits was approximately $12,500, for a\n\ntotal severance payment of $147,500.\n\n              ServiSense subsequently experienced financial difficulty,\n\nand Dane agreed in June of 2001 to a reduction of his salary by 50%\n\nto $67,500 annually.          On August 20, 2001, ServiSense filed for\n\nChapter 11 bankruptcy protection.            In December of 2001 ServiSense\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffiled a motion to sell substantially all of its assets, converting\n\nthe bankruptcy    to     a   Chapter   7    liquidation   proceeding.   Dane\n\napparently provided valuable assistance both before and after the\n\nconversion to a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding.                  After the\n\nconversion, Dane assisted ServiSense in consummating the sale of\n\nits assets, including helping to formulate the Joint Liquidating\n\nPlan of Reorganization (“Plan”), until he was terminated as an\n\nemployee in February of 2002.1\n\n           The events in question occurred during the period between\n\nthe Chapter 11 filing and Dane’s termination as an employee.                On\n\nDecember   6,   2001,    Dane   instructed      ServiSense’s   bookkeeper   to\n\nrestore his salary to $135,000, and Dane was paid this salary until\n\nhe was terminated.        Although the parties disagree as to whether\n\nServiSense’s Board authorized Dane to increase his salary, the\n\npresent controversy does not directly concern Dane’s right to this\n\nsalary, but rather primarily his right to severance pay.                    On\n\nJanuary 9, 2002, a motion was filed in the name of the debtor\n\nproposing “a retention payment agreement (‘RPA’) with Dane which\n\nwill ensure his continued employment through the end of the sale\n\nprocess and which will also effectuate a resolution of claims which\n\nwill otherwise arise in connection with Dane’s severance agreement\n\nwith the Debtor.”       (App. at 3.)       The RPA provided for a payment to\n\n\n\n     1\n          After his termination as an employee, Dane served as an\nEstate Representative at the hourly rate of $90.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fDane of $35,000 “in consideration for his agreement to remain in\n\nthe employ of the Debtor through the completion of the sale of its\n\nassets.”    (App. at 3.)      The RPA also provided that the $35,000\n\npayment would qualify as an administrative expense entitled to\n\npriority in bankruptcy, but that the $35,000 payment “shall reduce\n\nthe Debtor’s obligations under the severance agreement on a dollar-\n\nfor-dollar basis, and that the remaining claims held by Dane\n\narising out of the . . . severance agreement shall constitute pre-\n\npetition general unsecured claims against the Debtor’s bankruptcy\n\nestate,” which were not entitled to administrative priority. (App.\n\nat 4.)\n\n            A motion to approve this arrangement was filed in the\n\nbankruptcy court pursuant to Rule 9019(a) of the Federal Rules of\n\nBankruptcy Procedure2 on January 9, 2002.       The motion was signed by\n\ncounsel    for   ServiSense   and   assented   to   by   counsel   for   the\n\nCreditors’ Committee.      Although the motion was originally granted\n\nby the bankruptcy court, a motion to reconsider was filed by\n\nappellant Peter Bos -- the Chief Executive Officer, a director, and\n\na creditor of ServiSense -- disputing whether the debtor approved\n\nthe agreement.     While the motion to reconsider was still pending,\n\na Liquidating Supervisor, Craig R. Jalbert, the appellee here, was\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          That rule provides, in pertinent part: “On motion by the\ntrustee and after notice and a hearing, the court may approve a\ncompromise or settlement.” Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9019(a).\n\n                                    -4-\n\fappointed.          The bankruptcy court later granted the motion to\n\nreconsider.\n\n                 In the interim, Dane had been terminated in February of\n\n2002.          The parties dispute the circumstances of the termination.\n\nThe appellants argue that Bos terminated Dane for cause on February\n\n2, 2002, but the appellee argues that Dane was terminated with all\n\nof the other ServiSense employees on February 1, 2002.                     On March\n\n21, 2002, Dane filed an administrative claim for $147,500, arguing\n\nthat he was entitled to that amount because the severance agreement\n\nwas    executory       and   because   ServiSense    had   never    rejected    the\n\nagreement.\n\n                 On April 25, 2002, the Liquidating Supervisor entered\n\ninto       a    settlement   with   Dane   under   which   Dane    would    receive\n\neverything that he would have received under the proposed January\n\n9, 2002, agreement. A motion to approve the settlement was granted\n\nby the bankruptcy court, In re ServiSense.com, Inc., No. 01-16539-\n\nWCH (Bankr. D. Mass. Aug. 20, 2002) (“ServiSense I”),3 and the\n\nbankruptcy court’s action was affirmed on appeal to the district\n\ncourt, In re ServiSense.com, Inc., No. 02-11987-PBS (D. Mass. Sept.\n\n26, 2003) (“ServiSense II”).\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          The bankruptcy court also held that its order granting\nthe settlement motion rendered moot the previous motions with\nrespect to the RPA. ServiSense I, slip op. at 21.\n\n                                           -5-\n\f                                       II\n\n                                        A\n\n              “On an appeal from the district court, we independently\n\nreview the bankruptcy court’s decision . . . .                  The approval of a\n\ncompromise is within the sound discretion of the bankruptcy judge,\n\nhowever, and this court will not overturn a decision to approve a\n\ncompromise absent a clear showing that the bankruptcy judge abused\n\n[his] discretion.”      Jeffrey v. Desmond, 70 F.3d 183, 185 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (citations omitted).            We apply this abuse of discretion\n\nstandard “against the background understanding that ‘[c]ompromises\n\nare favored in bankruptcy.’” LeBlanc v. Salem (In re Mailman Steam\n\nCarpet Cleaning Corp.), 212 F.3d 632, 635 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting\n\nHicks, Muse & Co. v. Brandt (In re Healthco Int’l, Inc.), 136 F.3d\n\n45, 50 n.5 (1st Cir. 1998)) (alteration in original).                      “[T]he\n\nresponsibility of the bankruptcy judge, and ours on review, is not\n\nto   decide    the   numerous   questions    of   law     and    fact   raised   by\n\nappellants but rather to canvass the issues and see whether the\n\nsettlement      falls   below   the    lowest     point    in     the   range    of\n\nreasonableness.” Healthco Int’l, 136 F.3d at 51 (quoting Cosoff v.\n\nRodman (In re W.T. Grant Co.), 699 F.2d 599, 608 (2d Cir. 1983))\n\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n              The propriety of bankruptcy settlements is judged under\n\na four-part standard:\n\n              In deciding whether to approve a compromise\n              of  a   lawsuit,  the  specific  factors  a\n\n                                       -6-\n\f           bankruptcy court should consider include: “(i)\n           the probability of success in the litigation\n           being compromised; (ii) the difficulties, if\n           any, to be encountered in the matter of\n           collection; (iii) the complexity of the\n           litigation    involved,   and   the   expense,\n           inconvenience and delay attending it; and,\n           (iv) the paramount interest of the creditors\n           and a proper deference to their reasonable\n           views   in   the   premise.”     The   court’s\n           consideration    of   these   factors   should\n           demonstrate whether the compromise is fair and\n           equitable, and whether the claim the debtor is\n           giving up is outweighed by the advantage to\n           the debtor’s estate.\n\nJeremiah v. Richardson, 148 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting\n\nJeffrey, 70 F.3d at 185) (citation omitted).\n\n           The bankruptcy court held with respect to the first two\n\nfactors that (1) Dane had a colorable claim to administrative\n\npriority for his $147,500 claim under the severance agreement and\n\n(2) there would be no difficulties in the matter of collection.\n\nServiSense I, slip op. at 20.   With respect to the third factor --\n\nthe complexity, expense, inconvenience, and delay of litigation --\n\nthe bankruptcy court found:   “Given the acrimony which was evident\n\nduring the hearings on these matters and which permeated the\n\naffidavits presented, obtaining [the required] evidence will be\n\narduous.   The expense of such litigation is certain to exceed the\n\nsettlement amount of $35,000.”        Id. at 20-21.   Finally, with\n\nrespect to the fourth factor, the bankruptcy court concluded that,\n\nbecause the cost of litigation would “in all likelihood” exceed the\n\nsettlement amount, the creditors’ “interests would better be served\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fby settling the matter, avoiding the litigation and having the case\n\nclosed as expeditiously as possible.”           Id. at 21.\n\n            The district court agreed that Dane had a colorable claim\n\nand that, “based on the parties’ prior animosity (which [it]\n\nobserved   as   well),    [litigation     of   the   issues    covered   by   the\n\nsettlement] would likely be rife with disputes.”                ServiSense II,\n\nslip op. at 14.        In addition, the district court noted that the\n\nparties did not dispute the bankruptcy court’s finding that “the\n\nexpense    of   such    litigation   would     be    certain   to   exceed    the\n\nsettlement amount,” and it held that the bankruptcy court acted\n\nwithin its discretion with respect to the other Jeremiah factors.\n\nId.   The district court also noted that no party had objected to\n\nthe appointment of the Liquidating Supervisor, indicating that he\n\nwas not seen as partial or untrustworthy, and that the Creditors’\n\nCommittee had assented to the original RPA and had not objected to\n\nthe Liquidating Supervisor’s settlement.             Id. at 14-15.\n\n                                      B\n\n            The focus of this appeal is on whether Dane had a\n\ncolorable claim to a $147,500 priority claim for severance.               For a\n\nclaim to be entitled to administrative priority in bankruptcy, it\n\nmust arise after the bankruptcy petition has been filed. Cramer v.\n\nMammoth Mart, Inc. (In re Mammoth Mart, Inc.), 536 F.2d 950, 954\n\n(1st Cir. 1976).       “When the claim is based upon a contract between\n\nthe debtor and the claimant, the case law teaches that a creditor’s\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fright to payment will be afforded first priority only to the extent\n\nthat the consideration supporting the claimant’s right to payment\n\nwas both supplied to and beneficial to the debtor-in-possession in\n\nthe operation of the business” after the bankruptcy petition was\n\nfiled.   Id.    In approving the settlement in this case, the\n\nbankruptcy court focused on Mammoth Mart in determining whether\n\nDane’s claim under the severance agreement could be entitled to\n\nadministrative priority.   ServiSense I, slip op. at 19.   Mammoth\n\nMart states:\n\n          [W]hether a claim for severance pay based upon\n          an unrejected contract with the debtor and\n          arising from a chapter XI discharge will be\n          entitled to § 64(a)(1) priority will depend\n          upon the extent to which the consideration\n          supporting the claim was supplied during the\n          reorganization.    If an employment contract\n          provides that all discharged employees will\n          receive severance pay equal to their salaries\n          for a specified period, the consideration\n          supporting the claim--being an employee in\n          good   standing    at   the   time    of   the\n          discharge--will have been supplied during the\n          arrangement, and the former employee will be\n          entitled to priority.\n\n536 F.2d at 955.   The bankruptcy court held that, under Mammoth\n\nMart, because Dane arguably remained an employee in good standing\n\nat the time of his discharge, “it is reasonable to conclude that\n\nDane has a colorable claim that he is entitled to have his\n\nseverance claim treated as a priority claim.”   ServiSense I, slip\n\nop. at 20.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f              After the bankruptcy court’s decision, this court decided\n\nMason v. Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (In re FBI\n\nDistribution     Corp.),   330   F.3d   36     (1st   Cir.    2003).     In   FBI\n\nDistribution, an employee sought to recover severance benefits\n\nunder her employment agreement, which provided that she would\n\nreceive three years’ salary and other fringe benefits if she was\n\nterminated without cause.        Id. at 39.      The court reaffirmed that,\n\nunder Mammoth Mart, an employee is “entitled to administrative\n\npriority only to the extent that the consideration supporting the\n\nclaim   was    supplied    to   the   debtor    in    possession     during   the\n\nreorganization and was beneficial to the estate.”               Id. at 42-43.\n\n              The court held that, in the agreement at issue in FBI\n\nDistribution, “the consideration supporting [the employee’s] claim\n\nfor severance benefits was not ‘being an employee in good standing\n\nat the time of discharge,’ but rather her agreement to forego other\n\nemployment opportunities . . . , which she provided prepetition to\n\nthe debtor the moment she signed the Employment Agreement,” and it\n\nrejected the employee’s argument that her claim was entitled to\n\nadministrative priority under Mammoth Mart.             Id. at 46-47 (quoting\n\nMammoth Mart, 536 F.2d at 955).          The court noted that “it is not\n\nentirely clear what type of severance provision the Mammoth Mart\n\ncourt   was    contemplating     when   it   discussed       this   hypothetical\n\nsituation,” but “f[ou]nd it unlikely that it was referring to\n\nseverance provisions in executive contracts, like the one here.”\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fId. at 47.     Instead, the court “presume[d] that [the Mammoth Mart\n\ncourt] was referring to the severance plan at issue in [In re\n\nPublic Ledger, Inc., 161 F.2d 762 (3d Cir. 1947)], which was a plan\n\nthat provided for severance pay in lieu of notice of termination.”\n\nId.    Accordingly, the court held that the employment agreement in\n\nFBI   Distribution         was     not   entitled      to   administrative    priority\n\nbecause     there       was    never     a   court-approved     assumption       of   the\n\nagreement by the debtor and because the consideration was not\n\nsupplied post-petition.             Id. at 48.\n\n             The        district    court     determined      that    the   later     FBI\n\nDistribution decision would have precluded the settlement in this\n\ncase, stating that “[i]n light of the First Circuit’s clarification\n\nof    the   law,    the       bankruptcy      court    turned   out    to   be   overly\n\npessimistic        in    its     conclusion     that    under   Mammoth     Mart,     the\n\nLiquidating Supervisor would not be likely to succeed against Dane\n\non his claim for full severance and salary as a priority claim.”\n\nServiSense II, slip op. at 12.                Rather, the district court held:\n\n             The Liquidating Supervisor would have had a\n             strong argument that Dane had given the\n             complete consideration required for receipt of\n             the severance payment as soon as he had been\n             employed twelve months with Debtor, that is in\n             March 2001, which is before the filing of the\n             petition. Therefore, under the rationale of\n             FBI Distribution, Dane arguably held only a\n             contingent claim against Debtor at the\n             Petition   Date,  which   should   have   been\n             classified as pre-petition debt.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -11-\n\fId.   Thus, the district court determined that the Liquidating\n\nSupervisor would have had a strong argument under FBI Distribution\n\nthat Dane was not entitled to administrative priority for his claim\n\nunder his severance agreement.     Nevertheless, the district court\n\nheld that the settlement was reasonable given the state of the law\n\n-- as represented by Mammoth Mart -- at the time of the settlement\n\nand the bankruptcy court’s approval of the settlement, stating that\n\n“it was not unreasonable to have settled this claim for short\n\nmoney.”   Id. at 13.\n\n                                  C\n\n           We disagree with the bankruptcy court and the district\n\ncourt that Dane had a colorable claim to administrative priority\n\nfor his $147,500 claim under the severance agreement. Rather, this\n\ncase is unusual in that the Liquidating Supervisor agreed to pay\n\nDane everything that Dane had a colorable right to claim.\n\n           Dane’s argument that he was entitled to administrative\n\npriority for his $147,500 claim under the severance agreement had\n\nlittle support, even under Mammoth Mart.     There is now no claim\n\nhere that ServiSense assumed the agreement pursuant to 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 365(a). Under these circumstances, Dane would have been entitled\n\nto administrative priority for his claim under the severance\n\nagreement only if he provided consideration after ServiSense filed\n\nits bankruptcy petition.    See Mammoth Mart, 536 F.2d at 954.\n\nPursuant to Mammoth Mart, Dane could have made two arguments with\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\frespect to his entitlement to administrative priority, neither of\n\nwhich would have given Dane a colorable claim for administrative\n\npriority for his claim.     First, Dane could have argued that he was\n\nentitled to priority because he was “an employee in good standing\n\nat the time of [his] discharge.”           Id. at 955.    However, as FBI\n\nDistribution made clear, Mammoth Mart cannot be read to encompass\n\nDane’s severance agreement.     See FBI Distribution, 330 F.3d at 46-\n\n47.   Dane was an executive seeking to enforce an agreement he had\n\nnegotiated     with   ServiSense,   not    an   hourly   employee   seeking\n\nseverance pay pursuant to a company policy, like the appellants in\n\nMammoth Mart.     In any event, Dane’s severance agreement was not\n\nbased on a requirement that he remain “an employee in good standing\n\nat the time of the discharge,” unlike the agreement discussed in\n\nMammoth Mart.    536 F.2d at 955.    Rather, the severance agreement by\n\nits own terms provided for severance only “[a]fter 12 consecutive\n\nmonths of employment.”      (App. at 346.)      Dane earned the right to\n\nseverance once he had performed twelve months of service, which\n\noccurred pre-petition.\n\n             Nor is there a colorable claim pursuant to footnote 4 of\n\nMammoth Mart4 that, to induce Dane to remain on the job, ServiSense\n\n\n      4\n          Footnote 4 of Mammoth Mart provides: “The result [in\nthis case] would be different if the debtor-in-possession had, to\ninduce the employees to remain on the job, promised them that, if\ndischarged, they would receive severance pay based on the prior\npractice.   Then the consideration supporting appellants’ claims\nwould be the services performed subsequent to the debtor-in-\npossession’s promise.” 536 F.2d at 955 n.4.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fpromised him after the bankruptcy petition was filed that he would\n\nreceive severance pay based on his severance agreement.                           As the\n\nLiquidating Supervisor candidly conceded at oral argument, there is\n\nno colorable claim here that the debtor induced Dane to remain with\n\nthe   company    by   promising        that   he   would    receive      $147,500       in\n\nseverance pay pursuant to the pre-filing agreement.                     Even assuming\n\nthat the debtor approved the increase of Dane’s salary to the\n\n$135,000 level, there was no post-petition promise to pay him\n\nseverance to retain his services.              The only possible inducement by\n\nServiSense was its promise (1) to pay the $35,000 retention payment\n\nas an administrative expense and (2) to treat the remainder of the\n\n$147,500 sought by Dane as an unsecured claim.                Thus, Dane did not\n\nhave a colorable claim to administrative priority for his claim for\n\n$147,500 under the severance agreement.\n\n           Dane’s only colorable claim was for exactly what he\n\nreceived   under      the   January     9,    2002,   settlement        --   a   $35,000\n\npriority claim for the retention payment and a $112,500 unsecured\n\nclaim for the balance of his severance payment under the pre-\n\npetition severance agreement.            Even this claim was legitimately in\n\ndispute.      First, the parties dispute whether ServiSense ever\n\nauthorized      the    $35,000     retention       payment        and    whether        the\n\nLiquidating     Supervisor       had    the     authority    to    ratify        such    an\n\nagreement.      In addition, there is a dispute even as to the\n\nunsecured claim for $112,500, as the parties dispute whether Dane’s\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\f“salary” for purposes of the agreement was $67,500 or $135,000.\n\nEven       though    the    bankruptcy      court   decided      that   Dane    was   not\n\nterminated          for    cause    and    that    the    severance     agreement     was\n\ntriggered, ServiSense I, slip op. at 19, the parties also dispute\n\nwhether Dane was terminated for cause, which would have eliminated\n\nall of Dane’s rights under the settlement agreement.                           While the\n\nclaim      to   priority      for    the   $35,000       and   $112,500   amounts     was\n\ndisputed, the claim was nonetheless a substantial, non-frivolous\n\nclaim.\n\n                The key fact here is that the bankruptcy court found that\n\nthe expense of any litigation of Dane’s claim “is certain to exceed\n\nthe settlement amount.”              ServiSense I, slip op. at 21.5             Based on\n\nthis finding, we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy\n\ncourt had the authority to approve the settlement and did not abuse\n\nits discretion in doing so.6                See ServiSense II, slip op. at 14.\n\nA decision by a Liquidating Supervisor to spare the creditors the\n\n\n\n       5\n          The bankruptcy court characterized the amount of the\nsettlement as $35,000.      However, it appears that Dane also\nrecovered approximately 12.5% of his non-priority claim for\n$112,500, or slightly more than $14,000. We do not think that this\ndifference is significant.\n       6\n          In this connection, we reject the appellants’ contention\nthat the Liquidating Supervisor lacked the authority to enter into\nthe settlement agreement because the Plan provides that all pre-\npetition agreements like Dane’s settlement agreement were deemed\nrejected and thus must be treated as non-priority unsecured claims.\nThe Liquidating Supervisor plainly had the authority under section\n6.8(c) of the Plan to enter into settlements with the approval of\nthe bankruptcy court.\n\n                                            -15-\n\fexpense of litigation over a non-frivolous claim where the expense\n\nof litigation is “certain” to exceed the amount of a settlement is\n\neminently reasonable, and we will not disturb it.              We need not\n\ndecide   in    this   case   what   other   circumstances   might   make   it\n\nreasonable to enter into a settlement for the full amount of the\n\nclaim.\n\n                                      III\n\n              Because the bankruptcy court did not exceed its authority\n\nor abuse its discretion in approving the Liquidating Supervisor’s\n\nsettlement, its decision must be affirmed.\n\n              It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

(\"ServiSense\") was a corporation engaged in the business of reselling telecommunications services to residential customers. In March of 2000 ServiSense hired David A. Dane as its Vice President&#8212;Customer Care. He was subsequently promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer on December 21, 2000. Under his employment agreement, Dane was to be paid a yearly salary, and \"[a]fter 12 consecutive months of employment,\" he was entitled to receive \"12 months salary and benefits if terminated without cause\" (the \"severance agreement\"). (App. at 346.) As of October of 2000, the amount of Dane's annual salary was $135,000, and the value of Dane's benefits was approximately $12,500, for a total severance payment of $147,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ServiSense subsequently experienced financial difficulty, and Dane agreed in June of 2001 to a reduction of his salary by 50% to $67,500 annually. On August 20, 2001, ServiSense filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In December of 2001 ServiSense filed a motion to sell substantially all of its assets, converting the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding. Dane apparently provided valuable assistance both before and after the conversion to a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding. After the conversion, Dane assisted ServiSense in consummating the sale of its assets, including helping to formulate the Joint Liquidating Plan of Reorganization (\"Plan\"), until he was terminated as an employee in February of 2002.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The events in question occurred during the period between the Chapter 11 filing and Dane's termination as an employee. On December 6, 2001, Dane instructed ServiSense's bookkeeper to restore his salary to $135,000, and Dane was paid this salary until he was terminated. Although the parties disagree as to whether ServiSense's Board authorized Dane to increase his salary, the present controversy does not directly concern Dane's right to this salary, but rather primarily his right to severance pay. On January 9, 2002, a motion was filed in the name of the debtor proposing \"a retention payment agreement (`RPA') with Dane which will ensure his continued employment through the end of the sale process and which will also effectuate a resolution of claims which will otherwise arise in connection with Dane's severance agreement with the Debtor.\" (App. at 3.) The RPA provided for a payment to Dane of $35,000 \"in consideration for his agreement to remain in the employ of the Debtor through the completion of the sale of its assets.\" (App. at 3.) The RPA also provided that the $35,000 payment would qualify as an administrative expense entitled to priority in bankruptcy, but that the $35,000 payment \"shall reduce the Debtor's obligations under the severance agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and that the remaining claims held by Dane arising out of the ... severance agreement shall constitute pre-petition general unsecured claims against the Debtor's bankruptcy estate,\" which were not entitled to administrative priority.

The motion was signed by counsel for ServiSense and assented to by counsel for the Creditors' Committee. Although the motion was originally granted by the bankruptcy court, a motion to reconsider was filed by appellant Peter Bos&#8212;the Chief Executive Officer, a director, and a creditor of ServiSense&#8212;disputing whether the debtor approved the agreement. While the motion to reconsider was still pending, a Liquidating Supervisor, Craig R. Jalbert, the appellee here, was appointed.

The appellants argue that Bos terminated Dane for cause on February 2, 2002, but the appellee argues that Dane was terminated with all of the other ServiSense employees on February 1, 2002. On March 21, 2002, Dane filed an administrative claim for $147,500, arguing that he was entitled to that amount because the severance agreement was executory and because ServiSense had never rejected the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 25, 2002, the Liquidating Supervisor entered into a settlement with Dane under which Dane would receive everything that he would have received under the proposed January 9, 2002, agreement.

Mammoth Mart, Inc.</i> (<i>In re Mammoth Mart, Inc.</i>), 536 F.2d 950, 954 (1st Cir.1976). \"When the claim is based upon a contract between the debtor and the claimant, the case law teaches that a creditor's right to payment will be afforded first priority only to the extent that the consideration supporting the claimant's right to payment was both supplied to and beneficial to the debtor-in-possession in the operation of the business\" after the bankruptcy petition was filed. <i>Id.</i> In approving the settlement in this case, the bankruptcy court focused on <i>Mammoth Mart</i> in determining whether Dane's claim under the severance agreement could be entitled to administrative priority. <i>ServiSense I,</i> slip op. at 19. <i>Mammoth Mart</i> states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hether a claim for severance pay based upon an unrejected contract with the debtor and arising from a chapter XI discharge will be entitled to &#167; 64(a)(1) priority will depend upon the extent to which the consideration supporting the claim was supplied during the reorganization.

In <i>FBI Distribution,</i> an employee sought to recover severance benefits under her employment agreement, which provided that she would receive three years' salary and other fringe benefits if she was terminated without cause. <i>Id.</i> at 39. The court reaffirmed that, under <i>Mammoth Mart,</i> an employee is \"entitled to administrative priority only to the extent that the consideration supporting the claim was supplied to the debtor in possession during the reorganization and was beneficial to the estate.\" <i>Id.</i> at 42-43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held that, in the agreement at issue in <i>FBI Distribution,</i> \"the consideration supporting [the employee's] claim for severance benefits was not `being an employee in good standing at the time of discharge,' but rather her agreement to forego other employment opportunities..., which she provided prepetition to the debtor the moment she signed the Employment Agreement,\" and it rejected the employee's argument that her claim was entitled to administrative priority under <i>Mammoth Mart. Id.</i> at 46-47 (quoting <i>Mammoth Mart,</i> 536 F.2d at 955). The court noted that \"it is not entirely clear what type of severance provision the <i>Mammoth Mart</i> court was contemplating when it discussed this hypothetical situation,\" but \"f[ou]nd it unlikely that it was referring to severance provisions in executive contracts, like the one here.\" <i>Id.</i> at 47. Instead, the court \"presume[d] that [the <i>Mammoth Mart</i> court] was referring to the severance plan at issue in [<i>In re Public Ledger, Inc.,</i> 161 F.2d 762 (3d Cir. 1947)], which was a plan that provided for severance pay in lieu of notice of termination.\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, the court held that the employment agreement in <i>FBI Distribution</i> was not entitled to administrative priority because there was never a court-approved assumption of the agreement by the debtor and because the consideration was not supplied post-petition. <i>Id.</i> at 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the later <i>FBI Distribution</i> decision would have precluded the settlement in this case, stating that \"[i]n light of the First Circuit's clarification of the law, the bankruptcy court turned out to be overly pessimistic in its conclusion that under <i>Mammoth Mart,</i> the Liquidating Supervisor would not be likely to succeed against Dane on his claim for full severance and salary as a priority claim.\" <i>Servisense II,</i> 2003 WL 22232819, at *5, slip op. at 12.

Therefore, under the rationale of <i>FBI Distribution,</i> Dane arguably held only a contingent claim against Debtor at the Petition Date, which should have been classified as pre-petition debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Thus, the district court determined that the Liquidating Supervisor would have had a strong argument under <i>FBI Distribution</i> that Dane was not entitled to administrative priority for his claim under his severance agreement. Nevertheless, the district court held that the settlement was reasonable given the state of the law&#8212;as represented by <i>Mammoth Mart</i>&#8212; at the time of the settlement and the bankruptcy court's approval of the settlement, stating that \"it was not unreasonable to have settled this claim for short money.\" <i>Id.</i> at at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the bankruptcy court and the district court that Dane had a colorable claim to administrative priority for his $147,500 claim under the severance agreement. Rather, this case is unusual in that the Liquidating Supervisor agreed to pay Dane everything that Dane had a colorable right to claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dane's argument that he was entitled to administrative priority for his $147,500 claim under the severance agreement had little support, even under <i>Mammoth Mart.</i> There is now no claim here that ServiSense assumed the agreement pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 365(a). Under these circumstances, Dane would have been entitled to administrative priority for his claim under the severance agreement only if he provided consideration after ServiSense filed its bankruptcy petition. <i>See Mammoth Mart,</i> 536 F.2d at 954. Pursuant to <i>Mammoth Mart,</i> Dane could have made two arguments with respect to his entitlement to administrative priority, neither of which would have given Dane a colorable claim for administrative priority for his claim. First, Dane could have argued that he was entitled to priority because he was \"an employee in good standing at the time of [his] discharge.\" <i>Id.</i> at 955. However, as <i>FBI Distribution</i> made clear, <i>Mammoth Mart</i> cannot be read to encompass Dane's severance agreement. <i>See FBI Distribution,</i> 330 F.3d at 46-47. Dane was an executive seeking to enforce an agreement he had negotiated with ServiSense, not an hourly employee seeking severance pay pursuant to a company policy, like the appellants in <i>Mammoth Mart.</i> In any event, Dane's severance agreement was not based on a requirement that he remain \"an employee in good standing at the time of the discharge,\" unlike the agreement discussed in <i>Mammoth Mart,</i> 536 F.2d at 955. Rather, the severance agreement by its own terms provided for severance only \"[a]fter 12 consecutive months of employment.\" (App. at 346.) Dane earned the right to severance once he had performed twelve months of service, which occurred pre-petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there a colorable claim pursuant to footnote 4 of <i>Mammoth Mart</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> that, to induce Dane to remain on the job, ServiSense promised him after the bankruptcy petition was filed that he would receive severance pay based on his severance agreement. As the Liquidating Supervisor candidly conceded at oral argument, there is no colorable claim here that the debtor induced Dane to remain with the company by promising that he would receive $147,500 in severance pay pursuant to the pre-filing agreement. Even assuming that the debtor approved the increase of Dane's salary to the $135,000 level, there was no post-petition promise to pay him severance to retain his services. The only possible inducement by ServiSense was its promise (1) to pay the $35,000 retention payment as an administrative expense and (2) to treat the remainder of the $147,500 sought by Dane as an unsecured claim. Thus, Dane did not have a colorable claim to administrative priority for his claim for $147,500 under the severance agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dane's only colorable claim was for exactly what he received under the January 9, 2002, settlement&#8212;a $35,000 priority claim for the retention payment and a $112,500 unsecured claim for the balance of his severance payment under the pre-petition severance agreement. Even this claim was legitimately in dispute. First, the parties dispute whether ServiSense ever authorized the $35,000 retention payment and whether the Liquidating Supervisor had the authority to ratify such an agreement. In addition, there is a dispute even as to the unsecured claim for $112,500, as the parties dispute whether Dane's \"salary\" for purposes of the agreement was $67,500 or $135,000. Even though the bankruptcy court decided that Dane was not terminated for cause and that the severance agreement was triggered, <i>ServiSense I,</i> slip op. at 19, the parties also dispute whether Dane was terminated for cause, which would have eliminated all of Dane's rights under the settlement agreement. While the claim to priority for the $35,000 and $112,500 amounts was disputed, the claim was nonetheless a substantial, non-frivolous claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key fact here is that the bankruptcy court found that the expense of any litigation of Dane's claim \"is certain to exceed the settlement amount.\" <i>ServiSense I,</i> slip op. at 21.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Based on this finding, we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court had the authority to approve the settlement and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Servisense II,</i> 2003 WL 22232819, at *6, slip op. at 14.

(\"ServiSense\") was a corporation engaged in the business of reselling telecommunications services to residential customers. In March of 2000 ServiSense hired David A. Dane as its Vice President&#8212;Customer Care. He was subsequently promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer on December 21, 2000. Under his employment agreement, Dane was to be paid a yearly salary, and \"[a]fter 12 consecutive months of employment,\" he was entitled to receive \"12 months salary and benefits if terminated without cause\" (the \"severance agreement\"). (App. at 346.) As of October of 2000, the amount of Dane's annual salary was $135,000, and the value of Dane's benefits was approximately $12,500, for a total severance payment of $147,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ServiSense subsequently experienced financial difficulty, and Dane agreed in June of 2001 to a reduction of his salary by 50% to $67,500 annually. On August 20, 2001, ServiSense filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In December of 2001 ServiSense filed a motion to sell substantially all of its assets, converting the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding. Dane apparently provided valuable assistance both before and after the conversion to a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding. After the conversion, Dane assisted ServiSense in consummating the sale of its assets, including helping to formulate the Joint Liquidating Plan of Reorganization (\"Plan\"), until he was terminated as an employee in February of 2002.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The events in question occurred during the period between the Chapter 11 filing and Dane's termination as an employee. On December 6, 2001, Dane instructed ServiSense's bookkeeper to restore his salary to $135,000, and Dane was paid this salary until he was terminated. Although the parties disagree as to whether ServiSense's Board authorized Dane to increase his salary, the present controversy does not directly concern Dane's right to this salary, but rather primarily his right to severance pay. On January 9, 2002, a motion was filed in the name of the debtor proposing \"a retention payment agreement (`RPA') with Dane which will ensure his continued employment through the end of the sale process and which will also effectuate a resolution of claims which will otherwise arise in connection with Dane's severance agreement with the Debtor.\" (App. at 3.) The RPA provided for a payment to Dane of $35,000 \"in consideration for his agreement to remain in the employ of the Debtor through the completion of the sale of its assets.\" (App. at 3.) The RPA also provided that the $35,000 payment would qualify as an administrative expense entitled to priority in bankruptcy, but that the $35,000 payment \"shall reduce the Debtor's obligations under the severance agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and that the remaining claims held by Dane arising out of the ... severance agreement shall constitute pre-petition general unsecured claims against the Debtor's bankruptcy estate,\" which were not entitled to administrative priority.

The motion was signed by counsel for ServiSense and assented to by counsel for the Creditors' Committee. Although the motion was originally granted by the bankruptcy court, a motion to reconsider was filed by appellant Peter Bos&#8212;the Chief Executive Officer, a director, and a creditor of ServiSense&#8212;disputing whether the debtor approved the agreement. While the motion to reconsider was still pending, a Liquidating Supervisor, Craig R. Jalbert, the appellee here, was appointed.

The parties dispute the circumstances of the termination. The appellants argue that Bos terminated Dane for cause on February 2, 2002, but the appellee argues that Dane was terminated with all of the other ServiSense employees on February 1, 2002. On March 21, 2002, Dane filed an administrative claim for $147,500, arguing that he was entitled to that amount because the severance agreement was executory and because ServiSense had never rejected the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 25, 2002, the Liquidating Supervisor entered into a settlement with Dane under which Dane would receive everything that he would have received under the proposed January 9, 2002, agreement.

For a claim to be entitled to administrative priority in bankruptcy, it must arise after the bankruptcy petition has been filed. <i>Cramer v. Mammoth Mart, Inc.</i> (<i>In re Mammoth Mart, Inc.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"336186\"><a href=\"/opinion/336186/in-re-mammoth-mart-inc-debtor-stanley-cramer-v-mammoth-mart-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></a></span>, 954 (1st Cir.1976). \"When the claim is based upon a contract between the debtor and the claimant, the case law teaches that a creditor's right to payment will be afforded first priority only to the extent that the consideration supporting the claimant's right to payment was both supplied to and beneficial to the debtor-in-possession in the operation of the business\" after the bankruptcy petition was filed. <i>Id.</i> In approving the settlement in this case, the bankruptcy court focused on <i>Mammoth Mart</i> in determining whether Dane's claim under the severance agreement could be entitled to administrative priority. <i>ServiSense I,</i> slip op. at 19. <i>Mammoth Mart</i> states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hether a claim for severance pay based upon an unrejected contract with the debtor and arising from a chapter XI discharge will be entitled to &#167; 64(a)(1) priority will depend upon the extent to which the consideration supporting the claim was supplied during the reorganization.

Instead, the court \"presume[d] that [the <i>Mammoth Mart</i> court] was referring to the severance plan at issue in [<i>In re Public Ledger, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1566446\"><a href=\"/opinion/1566446/in-re-public-ledger/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></a></span> (3d Cir. 1947)], which was a plan that provided for severance pay in lieu of notice of termination.\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, the court held that the employment agreement in <i>FBI Distribution</i> was not entitled to administrative priority because there was never a court-approved assumption of the agreement by the debtor and because the consideration was not supplied post-petition. <i>Id.</i> at 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the later <i>FBI Distribution</i> decision would have precluded the settlement in this case, stating that \"[i]n light of the First Circuit's clarification of the law, the bankruptcy court turned out to be overly pessimistic in its conclusion that under <i>Mammoth Mart,</i> the Liquidating Supervisor would not be likely to succeed against Dane on his claim for full severance and salary as a priority claim.\" <i>Servisense II,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22232819</span></span>, at *5, slip op. at 12. Rather, the district court held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Liquidating Supervisor would have had a strong argument that Dane had given the complete consideration required for receipt of the severance payment as soon as he had been employed twelve months with Debtor, that is in March 2001, which is before the filing of the petition. Therefore, under the rationale of <i>FBI Distribution,</i> Dane arguably held only a contingent claim against Debtor at the Petition Date, which should have been classified as pre-petition debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Thus, the district court determined that the Liquidating Supervisor would have had a strong argument under <i>FBI Distribution</i> that Dane was not entitled to administrative priority for his claim under his severance agreement. Nevertheless, the district court held that the settlement was reasonable given the state of the law&#8212;as represented by <i>Mammoth Mart</i>&#8212; at the time of the settlement and the bankruptcy court's approval of the settlement, stating that \"it was not unreasonable to have settled this claim for short money.\" <i>Id.</i> at at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the bankruptcy court and the district court that Dane had a colorable claim to administrative priority for his $147,500 claim under the severance agreement. Rather, this case is unusual in that the Liquidating Supervisor agreed to pay Dane everything that Dane had a colorable right to claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dane's argument that he was entitled to administrative priority for his $147,500 claim under the severance agreement had little support, even under <i>Mammoth Mart.</i> There is now no claim here that ServiSense assumed the agreement pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 365(a). Under these circumstances, Dane would have been entitled to administrative priority for his claim under the severance agreement only if he provided consideration after ServiSense filed its bankruptcy petition. <i>See Mammoth Mart,</i> 536 F.2d at 954. Pursuant to <i>Mammoth Mart,</i> Dane could have made two arguments with respect to his entitlement to administrative priority, neither of which would have given Dane a colorable claim for administrative priority for his claim. First, Dane could have argued that he was entitled to priority because he was \"an employee in good standing at the time of [his] discharge.\" <i>Id.</i> at 955. However, as <i>FBI Distribution</i> made clear, <i>Mammoth Mart</i> cannot be read to encompass Dane's severance agreement. <i>See FBI Distribution,</i> 330 F.3d at 46-47. Dane was an executive seeking to enforce an agreement he had negotiated with ServiSense, not an hourly employee seeking severance pay pursuant to a company policy, like the appellants in <i>Mammoth Mart.</i> In any event, Dane's severance agreement was not based on a requirement that he remain \"an employee in good standing at the time of the discharge,\" unlike the agreement discussed in <i>Mammoth Mart,</i> 536 F.2d at 955. Rather, the severance agreement by its own terms provided for severance only \"[a]fter 12 consecutive months of employment.\" (App. at 346.) Dane earned the right to severance once he had performed twelve months of service, which occurred pre-petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there a colorable claim pursuant to footnote 4 of <i>Mammoth Mart</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> that, to induce Dane to remain on the job, ServiSense promised him after the bankruptcy petition was filed that he would receive severance pay based on his severance agreement. As the Liquidating Supervisor candidly conceded at oral argument, there is no colorable claim here that the debtor induced Dane to remain with the company by promising that he would receive $147,500 in severance pay pursuant to the pre-filing agreement. Even assuming that the debtor approved the increase of Dane's salary to the $135,000 level, there was no post-petition promise to pay him severance to retain his services. The only possible inducement by ServiSense was its promise (1) to pay the $35,000 retention payment as an administrative expense and (2) to treat the remainder of the $147,500 sought by Dane as an unsecured claim. Thus, Dane did not have a colorable claim to administrative priority for his claim for $147,500 under the severance agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dane's only colorable claim was for exactly what he received under the January 9, 2002, settlement&#8212;a $35,000 priority claim for the retention payment and a $112,500 unsecured claim for the balance of his severance payment under the pre-petition severance agreement. Even this claim was legitimately in dispute. First, the parties dispute whether ServiSense ever authorized the $35,000 retention payment and whether the Liquidating Supervisor had the authority to ratify such an agreement. In addition, there is a dispute even as to the unsecured claim for $112,500, as the parties dispute whether Dane's \"salary\" for purposes of the agreement was $67,500 or $135,000. Even though the bankruptcy court decided that Dane was not terminated for cause and that the severance agreement was triggered, <i>ServiSense I,</i> slip op. at 19, the parties also dispute whether Dane was terminated for cause, which would have eliminated all of Dane's rights under the settlement agreement. While the claim to priority for the $35,000 and $112,500 amounts was disputed, the claim was nonetheless a substantial, non-frivolous claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key fact here is that the bankruptcy court found that the expense of any litigation of Dane's claim \"is certain to exceed the settlement amount.\" <i>ServiSense I,</i> slip op. at 21.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Based on this finding, we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court had the authority to approve the settlement and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Servisense II,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22232819</span></span>, at *6, slip op. at 14. A decision by a Liquidating Supervisor to spare the creditors the expense of litigation over a non-frivolous claim where the expense of litigation is \"certain\" to exceed the amount of a settlement is eminently reasonable, and we will not disturb it. We need not decide in this case what other circumstances might make it reasonable to enter into a settlement for the full amount of the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the bankruptcy court did not exceed its authority or abuse its discretion in approving the Liquidating Supervisor's settlement, its decision must be <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> After his termination as an employee, Dane served as an Estate Representative at the hourly rate of $90</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> That rule provides, in pertinent part: \"On motion by the trustee and after notice and a hearing, the court may approve a compromise or settlement.\" Fed.
