Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Robert O. Berger for appellant.\n     Carlos Lopez on brief pro se.\n     Mark E. Howard, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Thomas P.\nColantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        August 19, 2004\n\f      COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.        A jury convicted Carlos Lopez\n\non   eight   criminal   counts,   including    conspiracy   to   distribute\n\ncocaine base, distribution of cocaine base, and three firearms\n\nviolations.     On appeal, appellant raises two primary issues.\n\nFirst, he contends that key physical evidence, namely, a quantity\n\nof drugs and a loaded .40 caliber handgun, was obtained through an\n\nunlawful search of his vehicle.           Second, appellant contests the\n\nadmissibility of certain statements he made to law enforcement\n\nofficers.     He argues that the statements were the product of\n\ncustodial interrogation that occurred after he invoked his right to\n\ncounsel.     Appellant also raises a series of issues relating to\n\nalleged prosecutorial vouching, the reliability of the drug dog\n\nused in the vehicle search, and the district court's denial of his\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal.           Finding no infirmity in the\n\ndistrict court's decision to admit both the physical evidence and\n\nappellant's statements, and detecting no basis for reversal or\n\nremand on any of appellant's other claims, we affirm the conviction\n\non all counts.1\n\n      1\n      Counsel for appellant submitted two letters pursuant to Fed.\nR. App. P. 28(j) in which he asserted that, under Blakely v.\nWashington, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (2004), this court should strike down\nthe federal sentencing guidelines and remand this case. Blakely\nheld that a sentence that was enhanced on the basis of factors\nfound by the judge, rather than the jury, violated the defendant's\nconstitutional right to trial by jury. The appellant in this case,\nhowever, received the minimum statutory sentence, and counsel has\noffered no explanation as to why Blakely would apply. The argument\nis thus waived. See Mulvihill v. Top-Flite Golf Co., 335 F.3d 15,\n28 (1st Cir. 2003) (issue deemed forfeited by failure to marshal\npertinent facts or engage in reasoned analysis).\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                      I.   Factual Background\n\n     Acting on a tip from a confidential informant, the Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration (DEA) and local law enforcement officers\n\nin New Hampshire began surveillance of a series of arranged drug\n\ntransactions between appellant and Terri Tremblay, an unwitting\n\nfriend of the informant.   The first such arranged buy occurred on\n\nMay 11, 2001.     In what would become a pattern for subsequent\n\ntransactions, Tremblay met the confidential informant at a Wendy's\n\nrestaurant in Portsmouth, where the informant gave Tremblay cash -\n\nserialized funds provided by the DEA - to purchase crack cocaine.\n\nTremblay and the informant then met Lopez in the parking lot of the\n\nBeechstone   Condominium   complex,   across   the   street   from   the\n\nWendy's.2    Tremblay entered appellant's car and purchased crack\n\ncocaine with the serialized money.    She then gave the drugs to the\n\ninformant.    After two such transactions in which the informant\n\nserved as an intermediary between Tremblay and undercover task\n\nforce officer John Perrachi, Perrachi began to arrange deals\n\ndirectly with Tremblay.    Lopez and Tremblay were arrested on July\n\n25, 2001, during the fifth coordinated transaction.\n\n     On the night of the arrest, law enforcement officers observed\n\nTremblay drive into the Beechstone parking lot, park her car next\n\nto a Dodge minivan, exit her vehicle, and enter the minivan.\n\n\n\n     2\n      Out of the five arranged deals, four occurred in the parking\nlot of the Beechstone apartment complex; the fifth occurred in a\nmanner similar to the other four, but on a nearby side street.\n\n                                -3-\n\fOfficers then converged on the minivan and arrested both appellant,\n\nwho was in the driver's seat, and Tremblay, who was in the\n\npassenger seat.      Tremblay and appellant were separated, and each\n\ntold a different version of events to officers present at the\n\nscene. Appellant denied any knowledge regarding drugs, saying only\n\nthat he met Tremblay in the parking lot because he hoped to have\n\nsex   with   her.     Tremblay,    however,    wanted   to   cooperate   and,\n\naccording to law enforcement reports, explained that Lopez had\n\nbrought with him a larger quantity of crack than she had been\n\nplanning to purchase.\n\n      Because children lived in the Beechstone apartment complex,\n\nofficers     were   particularly   concerned    with    seizing    the   drugs\n\nbelieved to still be in the vicinity.         A preliminary search of the\n\nvehicle at the scene of the arrest turned up $280 of the serialized\n\nfunds (the remaining $20 was found on Tremblay's person), but,\n\ndespite a drug-sniffing dog alerting three times to the passenger\n\nfront seat, no drugs.     A search of the surrounding wooded area and\n\nparking lot failed to yield any results.         Due to poor lighting and\n\nthe presence of a crowd of onlookers that had gathered around the\n\nscene, officers transported the van to the Portsmouth Police\n\nDepartment.     Tremblay and Lopez, still separated, were also taken\n\nto the station.\n\n      At the station, after answering some initial questions about\n\nthe registration of the van, appellant indicated he might be\n\ninterested in cooperating and requested an attorney.              DEA Special\n\n                                     -4-\n\fAgents Steven Story and Norman Houle ceased questioning appellant\n\nand returned to the van to continue the search.         Appellant was left\n\nin the interview room under the supervision of Officer Brandon\n\nDrysdale.\n\n     While searching the van, Story located a wire leading to a\n\nlocked compartment under the front passenger seat. Suspecting that\n\nthe compartment contained contraband, Houle went to fetch a camera\n\nto document the compartment and its contents. En route, he briefly\n\nentered the interview room, told Lopez that he and Story had found\n\n\"the stuff\" and that \"the deal was off.\"         Houle left the interview\n\nroom immediately after making his remark.            The compartment was\n\nlater found to contain sixty-three grams of crack cocaine, a loaded\n\nsemi-automatic .40 caliber handgun with an obliterated serial\n\nnumber, and a package of photographs bearing Lopez' name.\n\n     At   trial,    Drysdale   testified   that,   upon    hearing   Houle's\n\nremark, Lopez became \"very sad,\" remarking repeatedly that he was\n\n\"fucked\" and that \"his life was over.\"          Lopez then asked Drysdale\n\nwhat would happen to a person caught possessing both a gun and\n\ndrugs.    Drysdale replied that it was \"a bad thing.\"\n\n     Prior to trial, appellant submitted a motion to suppress the\n\nguns and drugs found in the compartment, as well as his statements\n\nto Drysdale.    Appellant argued that the search of the vehicle was\n\nunreasonable, justified neither as a search incident to arrest nor\n\nunder the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.                He\n\nprotested    that    his   statements    were    made     during   custodial\n\n                                   -5-\n\finterrogation and without his having waived his Miranda rights and\n\nwere thus inadmissible.               After a hearing, the district court\n\nsummarily denied the motion.\n\n       We review the district court's findings of fact with respect\n\nto a suppression motion for clear error. United States v. Infante-\n\nRuiz, 13 F.3d 498, 501 (1st Cir. 1994).                   As a general matter,\n\nhowever,        we    review    the    district     court's       ultimate     legal\n\ndetermination of probable cause de novo. Ornelas v. United States,\n\n517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996).\n\n                                II. Vehicle Search\n\n       The Fourth Amendment guarantees \"[t]he right of the people to\n\nbe secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures.\"                    U.S. Const. amend. IV.\n\nSubject to limited exceptions, warrantless searches of private\n\nproperty are per se unreasonable.              California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S.\n\n565, 580 (1991); United States v. Donlin, 982 F.2d 31, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).     The mobility of automobiles and the attendant need to\n\nprevent    loss      of   evidence     undergirds       one    such   exception.   A\n\nwarrantless search of an automobile will be upheld if \"officers\n\nhave     probable       cause   to    believe    that    the    vehicle      contains\n\ncontraband.\"         United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 808 (1982).\n\n       The government bears the burden of proving the lawfulness of\n\nthe search. Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 390-91 (1978); United\n\nStates     v.    Cruz     Jimenez,     894   F.2d   1,    7    (1st   Cir.    1990).\n\nSpecifically, the government must demonstrate that law enforcement\n\n                                         -6-\n\fofficers had \"a belief, reasonably arising out of circumstances\n\nknown to the seizing officer,\" that the vehicle \"contain[ed] that\n\nwhich by law is subject to seizure and destruction,\" Carroll v.\n\nUnited States, 267 U.S. 132, 149 (1925).3          Our focus is on \"what\n\nthe agents knew at the time they searched the car,\" United States\n\nv. Goldman, 41 F.3d 785, 787 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          At the suppression hearing, both DEA agents and New Hampshire\n\npolice officers gave consistent and detailed testimony regarding\n\nthe surveilled transactions, all of which occurred in a similar\n\nmanner.      Officers were able to corroborate information supplied by\n\nthe   confidential     source   describing   the    vehicles   driven    by\n\nappellant, including the van used on the night of the arrest.           The\n\nappellant was positively identified both by the confidential source\n\nand agents familiar with him from a prior felony conviction.            Two\n\nwitnesses - Officer Joslin and Agent Houle - personally observed\n\nLopez during surveilled transactions occurring prior to the night\n\nof the arrest.      Furthermore, at the scene of the arrest, Tremblay\n\nexplained to officers that Lopez had in his possession a larger\n\nquantity of crack cocaine than she intended to purchase, thus\n\nleading officers to believe that a substantial amount of drugs\n\nremained in the van. Tremblay further described how, as the arrest\n\n\n      3\n      The government makes no effort to justify the search as a\nsearch incident to arrest, see Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 47\n(1970) (acknowledging that search of an automobile occurring at a\npolice station \"some time after the arrest . . . cannot be\njustified as a search incident to an arrest\"), and thus we focus\nour analysis on the existence of probable cause for the search.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fteam converged, Lopez leaned over her in the passenger seat,\n\nsuggesting that appellant had either hidden or discarded the drugs.\n\nThe latter possibility was of particular concern to officers given\n\nthe presence of several children living in close proximity to the\n\narrest site.   Finally, a drug dog alerted aggressively in front of\n\nthe   passenger   seat,   suggesting    that   drugs   were   present   but\n\nconcealed.4 In short, the district court reasonably concluded that\n\nofficers had probable cause to search the van.\n\n      Appellant nevertheless contends that, under United States v.\n\nKyllo, 533 U.S. 27 (2001), we are required to weigh the evidence of\n\nprobable cause against the privacy interests of the individual\n\nwhose property was subject to search.          Kyllo is inapposite.     In\n\nthat case, the primary thrust of the court's analysis was \"whether\n\nthe use of a thermal-imaging device . . . to detect relative\n\namounts of heat within the home constitutes a 'search' within the\n\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment.\"       Kyllo, 533 U.S. at 29.    Nowhere\n\ndoes the court conduct the type of balancing suggested by appellant\n\n\n\n      4\n      Appellant also challenges the reliability of Turbo, the drug\ndog. See United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 749 (1st Cir. 1999)\n(\"The existence of probable cause based on an alert by a drug dog\ndepends on the dog's reliability.\").     Philip Ahlin, the dog's\ntrained handler, testified at the suppression hearing that Turbo\nwas certified at the time of the search and had never - in Ahlin's\nexperience with the dog - given a false indication.          Ahlin\nexplained that, during the search, Turbo's interest was\nconsistently focused on the front passenger seat, even when Ahlin\ndirected Turbo to other areas of the van. Cross-examination of\nAhlin in no way undermined this evidence of reliability and\nconsistency. We defer to the district court on this matter without\nfurther explanation.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fconcerning     the    reasonableness    of   the    search   rather   than    the\n\nthreshold determination of whether a search occurred.\n\n     Even if we were to turn to Kyllo for guidance, the recognized\n\nprivacy interest is of a different caliber from that in the present\n\ncase because the search there involved a home rather than a car.\n\nSee New York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106, 112 (1986) (\"The Court has\n\nrecognized that the physical characteristics of an automobile and\n\nits use result in a lessened expectation of privacy therein[.]\").\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has acknowledged that the stop and\n\nsearch   of    a     vehicle   does   present   a    conflict   between      \"the\n\nindividual's constitutionally protected interest in privacy and the\n\npublic interest in effective law enforcement,\" Ross, 456 U.S. at\n\n804, the Court has also made clear that \"[t]hese interests must\n\nyield to the authority of a search\" justified by probable cause.\n\nId. at 823.     The fact that the contraband was in a container in a\n\nlocked, hidden compartment does not justify any extra measure of\n\nconsideration. The Supreme Court has explicitly stated that \"[t]he\n\npolice may search an automobile and the containers within it where\n\nthey have probable cause to believe contraband or evidence is\n\ncontained.\"5       Acevedo, 500 U.S. at 580; see also Owens, 167 F.3d at\n\n\n     5\n      Appellant argues that United States v. Maple, 348 F.3d 260\n(D.C. Cir. 2003), applies the Kyllo rationale to warrantless\nsearches of an automobile.       Maple, however, dealt with the\nreasonableness of a search in which there was no probable cause to\nsuspect contraband. The appellant in that case had been stopped\nfor speeding and subsequently arrested for driving with a suspended\nlicense. This is markedly different from the facts before us, in\nwhich law enforcement officers had a reasonable belief that\n\n                                       -9-\n\f750 (\"[I]f probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully\n\nstopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the\n\nvehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the\n\nsearch.\") (quoting Ross, 456 U.S. at 800).    Similarly, \"efforts to\n\nrestrict access to an area do not generate a reasonable expectation\n\nof privacy where none would otherwise exist,\" Class, 475 U.S. at\n\n114.\n\n       The government has presented ample evidence demonstrating that\n\nlaw enforcement officers had probable cause to search the vehicle\n\nand the compartment.      The relocation of the vehicle from the\n\nparking lot to the police station did not deprive the officers of\n\nprobable cause to search.     See Chambers, 399 U.S. at 52 (\"[T]he\n\nblue station wagon could have been searched on the spot . . . .\n\nThe probable-cause factor still obtained at the station house[.]\").\n\nThe district court properly denied appellant's motion to suppress\n\nthe evidence discovered in the vehicle.\n\n          III.   Statements Made to Law Enforcement Officers\n\n       Appellant next argues that the district court should have\n\nsuppressed the post-arrest remarks he made to Drysdale after he\n\nlearned that Houle and Story had located the hidden compartment.\n\nSee supra at 5.       Appellant claims that the admission of his\n\ninculpatory remarks violated his rights under Miranda v. Arizona,\n\n384 U.S. 436 (1965).    In his brief, appellant admitted that Agent\n\n\n\nappellant's vehicle contained crack cocaine.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fStory advised him of his Miranda rights at the scene of the arrest,\n\nand that appellant affirmatively responded that he understood those\n\nrights.\n\n        In order for appellant to make out a claim under Miranda,\n\nhowever, his statements must have been the product of custodial\n\ninterrogation.      Id.    at   444   (\"[T]he   prosecution      may    not   use\n\nstatements . . . stemming from custodial interrogation of the\n\ndefendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards\n\neffective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\").\n\nThe protections of Miranda extend beyond actual questioning by the\n\npolice to include the \"functional equivalent\" of interrogation,\n\nmeaning \"any words or actions on the part of the police (other than\n\nthose normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police\n\nshould know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating\n\nresponse from the suspect.\"          Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291,\n\n301 (1980).\n\n     Although Story and Houle did formally question appellant about\n\nthe registration of the van, the agents ceased interrogation when\n\nappellant indicated he wanted to talk to his lawyer.                    Although\n\nLopez    remained   in    custody,    any    statement   made    \"freely      and\n\nvoluntarily    without    any   compelling    influences   is,     of    course,\n\nadmissible in evidence,\" Miranda, 384 U.S. at 478.              See Innis, 446\n\nU.S. at 299.\n\n     We see no indication that appellant's statements stemmed from\n\ncustodial interrogation or its functional equivalent.                   Houle's\n\n                                      -11-\n\fremark,   although       suggesting       that   the   case    against      Lopez    was\n\nstrengthened by discovery of \"the stuff,\" was not designed to\n\nelicit an incriminating response.                 Although our focus must be\n\n\"primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the\n\nintent of the police,\" Innis, 446 U.S. at 301, it is difficult to\n\nsee how appellant could have construed a passing remark as the\n\nfunctional equivalent of interrogation.                 Indeed, Houle left the\n\nroom immediately after making the comment, signaling to appellant\n\nthat no response was sought.\n\n      In United States v. Genao, 281 F.3d 305 (1st Cir. 2002), we\n\nupheld the admission of a confession blurted out by the defendant\n\nin response to an officer's statement - in conjunction with a\n\ndisplay of seized contraband - that \"[w]e've got a problem here.\"\n\nSee id. at 310.      We reasoned that the remark was brief, not worded\n\nin a particularly confrontational manner, and, in the context of\n\nthe   ongoing     search,    intended       simply     to    get    the    defendant's\n\nattention       before   reading    him    his    rights.          See    id.   at   311.\n\nSimilarly, Houle's succinct remark simply highlighted information\n\nthat appellant needed to know to convey to his attorney, who at\n\nthat point was on his way to the station.                    Cf. United States v.\n\nConley, 156 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"A law enforcement\n\nofficer's mere description of the evidence and of potential charges\n\nagainst     a    suspect    .   .     .     hardly     can    be     classified       as\n\ninterrogatory.\").\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f     Because     appellant's    voluntary    statements,    though\n\nincriminating, were not the product of custodial interrogation, the\n\ndistrict court properly denied the motion to suppress.6\n\n                IV.   Alleged Prosecutorial Vouching\n\n     Appellant contends that remarks in the prosecutor's opening\n\nand closing statements constituted vouching for an absent witness.\n\nNo objection was made at trial and thus we review only for plain\n\nerror.   United States v. Newton, 327 F.3d 17, 26 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n     The registered owner of the van, Bob Cole, was scheduled to\n\ntestify on the final day of the trial.   In his opening statement,\n\nthe prosecutor mentioned that Cole would testify that he - Cole -\n\nnever saw the van and did not have a valid driver's license.   The\n\nnight before his scheduled testimony, however, Cole was visited by\n\na defense investigator.   Although we do not know what was said to\n\nCole, he was subsequently admitted to the hospital for mental\n\n     6\n      After oral argument, counsel for appellant submitted a Rule\n28j letter arguing that admission of appellant's remarks was barred\nby the Supreme Court's decision in Crawford v. Washington, 124\nS.Ct. 1354 (2004). Under Crawford, certain testimonial hearsay is\ninadmissible \"unless the declarant is unavailable and the accused\nhas had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant,\" Horton\nv. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 83 (1st Cir. 2004). However, for reasons\nsimilar to our conclusion that appellant's statements were not the\nproduct of custodial interrogation, the statements were also not\ntestimonial in nature. The Supreme Court offered three general\nformulations of the \"core class of testimonial statements,\"\nCrawford, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, namely, \"ex parte in-court testimony\nor its functional equivalent,\" id., \"extrajudicial statements . .\n. contained in formalized testimonial materials,\" id., and\nstatements \"made under circumstances which would lead an objective\nwitness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available\nfor use at a later trial,\" id. Appellant's statements fall under\nnone of these three formulations.\n\n                                -13-\n\fhealth reasons and was thus unavailable. In his closing statement,\n\nthe prosecutor explained to the jury that Cole didn't testify\n\n\"because we've established that even though his name is on the\n\nregistration, Carlos Lopez kept that van.\"\n\n     The prosecution is not permitted to \"tell the jury what\n\nwitnesses who did not testify would have said had they testified,\"\n\nUnited States v. Palmer, 37 F.3d 1080, 1087 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\nNeither may the prosecution place the prestige of the government\n\nbehind a witness nor implicitly vouch for a witness by indicating\n\nthat the testimony is supported by information not presented to the\n\njury.    United States v. Martin, 815 F.2d 818, 821-22 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).\n\n     We discern none of the above errors in the prosecutor's\n\nclosing remarks.    The prosecutor did not offer any indication of\n\nthe substance of what Cole would have said, but instead simply\n\nclarified that other testimony proved that Lopez controlled the\n\nvehicle.   The prosecutor pointed to evidence presented to the jury\n\n- the testimony of Tremblay regarding multiple drug transactions\n\nbetween her and Lopez in the van, the testimony of the mechanic who\n\nperformed several thousand dollars worth of work on the car at\n\nLopez' request - that proved the same point.\n\n           V.   Denial of Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\n\n     Appellant's final claim concerns the court's denial of his\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.\n\nAppellant's counsel did not submit a motion for acquittal following\n\n                                -14-\n\fthe close of the government's evidence and, when asked by the judge\n\nwhether he wished to do so at the conclusion of all the evidence,\n\nexpressly declined.      At the sentencing hearing on May 14, 2003 -\n\nthree months after the jury was discharged - appellant offered a\n\nlengthy and detailed allocution.       The court treated the allocution\n\nas a Rule 29 motion for acquittal, but then denied the motion.\n\n      Despite the district court's lenience, we conclude that the\n\nissue was waived by the appellant's failure to comply with the\n\nprocedural requirements of Rule 29, which require the motion to be\n\nmade by the defendant within seven days \"after a guilty verdict or\n\nthe court discharges the jury, whichever is later[.]\"                     Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29(a).      Although the court may also \"on its own consider\n\nwhether the    evidence    is    insufficient,\"    it    must   do   so    before\n\nsubmission to the jury.         Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c); see also United\n\nStates v. Davis, 992 F.2d 635, 638 (6th Cir. 1993) (concluding that\n\nthe district court lacked authority to sua sponte enter a judgment\n\nof acquittal more than two months after the jury was discharged).\n\nWe   thus   review   appellant's    claim   only   for    \"clear     and    gross\n\ninjustice,\" United States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 996 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n      The record fails to reveal such unfairness.           We only briefly\n\nrecite the case against appellant, as there is little need for more\n\nextensive analysis.       Information supplied by the confidential\n\ninformant was corroborated during multiple surveillance operations\n\ninvolving Tremblay and appellant. The testimony regarding the five\n\n                                    -15-\n\fsurveilled drug transactions was consistent from all witnesses -\n\nincluding law enforcement agents, the confidential informant and\n\nTremblay.       Appellant    was     positively     identified    on   multiple\n\noccasions. A hidden compartment in the van that was maintained and\n\nused by the appellant was found to contain drugs, as well as a gun\n\nwith an obviously obliterated serial number, and photographs of\n\nappellant     and   his     girlfriend,      thus   substantiating      knowing\n\npossession.     Appellant stipulated to his status as a convicted\n\nfelon,   thus   supporting     his    conviction    for   being   a    felon   in\n\npossession of a firearm.       In short, we see no basis to disturb the\n\nverdict.7\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Appellant submitted a pro se brief in which he argued that\nthe initial arrest warrant was not supported by probable cause.\nAppellant raised the issue of the validity of the arrest warrant\nonly during his allocution at the sentencing hearing. This belated\neffort fails to preserve the issue for review. It arguably should\nhave been the subject of a pretrial motion, and, at a minimum,\nshould have been raised in the district court at trial. See Fed.\nR. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(A) (requiring that a motion alleging a defect\nin instituting the prosecution must be made before trial); United\nStates v. Nee, 261 F.3d 79, 86-87 (1st Cir. 2001)(\"'Arguments not\nraised below will be entertained on appeal only in horrendous cases\nwhere a gross miscarriage of justice would occur and, in addition,\nwhere the newly asserted ground is so compelling as virtually to\ninsure appellant's success.'\")(quoting United States v. Haggert,\n980 F.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1992)). In any event, the argument is\nutterly without merit, whether it was forfeiture or not.\n\n                                      -16-\n\f",

On appeal, appellant raises two primary issues. First, he contends that key physical evidence, namely, a quantity of drugs and a loaded .40 caliber handgun, was obtained through an unlawful search of his vehicle. Second, appellant contests the admissibility of certain statements he made to law enforcement officers. He argues that the statements were the product of custodial interrogation that occurred after he invoked his right to counsel. Appellant also raises a series of issues relating to alleged prosecutorial vouching, the reliability of the drug dog used in the vehicle search, and the district court's denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. Finding no infirmity in the district court's decision to admit both the physical evidence and appellant's statements, and detecting no basis for reversal or remand on any of appellant's other claims, we affirm the conviction on all counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acting on a tip from a confidential informant, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and local law enforcement officers in New Hampshire began surveillance of a series of arranged drug transactions between appellant and Terri Tremblay, an unwitting friend of the informant. The first such arranged buy occurred on May 11, 2001. In what would become a pattern for subsequent transactions, Tremblay met the confidential informant at a Wendy's restaurant in Portsmouth, where the informant gave Tremblay cash &#8212; serialized funds provided by the DEA &#8212; to purchase crack cocaine. Tremblay and the informant then met Lopez in the parking lot of the Beechstone Condominium complex, across the street from the Wendy's.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Tremblay entered appellant's car and purchased crack cocaine with the serialized money. She then gave the drugs to the informant. After two such transactions in which the informant served as an intermediary between Tremblay and undercover task force officer John Perrachi, Perrachi began to arrange deals directly with Tremblay. Lopez and Tremblay were arrested on July 25, 2001, during the fifth coordinated transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the night of the arrest, law enforcement officers observed Tremblay drive into the Beechstone parking lot, park her car next to a Dodge minivan, exit her vehicle, and enter the minivan. Officers then converged on the minivan and arrested both appellant, who was in the driver's seat, and Tremblay, who was in the passenger seat. Tremblay and appellant were separated, and each told a different version of events to officers present at the scene. Appellant denied any knowledge regarding drugs, saying only that he met Tremblay in the parking lot because he hoped to have sex with her. Tremblay, however, wanted to cooperate and, according to law enforcement reports, explained that Lopez had brought with him a larger quantity of crack than she had been planning to purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because children lived in the Beechstone apartment complex, officers were particularly concerned with seizing the drugs believed to still be in the vicinity. A preliminary search of the vehicle at the scene of the arrest turned up $280 of the serialized funds (the remaining $20 was found on Tremblay's person), but, despite a drug-sniffing dog alerting three times to the passenger front seat, no drugs. A search of the surrounding wooded area and parking lot failed to yield any results. Due to poor lighting and the presence of a crowd of onlookers that had gathered around the scene, officers transported the van to the Portsmouth Police Department. Tremblay and Lopez, still separated, were also taken to the station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the station, after answering some initial questions about the registration of the van, appellant indicated he might be interested in cooperating and requested an attorney. DEA Special Agents Steven Story and Norman Houle ceased questioning appellant and returned to the van to continue the search. Appellant was left in the interview room under the supervision of Officer Brandon Drysdale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While searching the van, Story located a wire leading to a locked compartment under the front passenger seat. Suspecting that the compartment contained contraband, Houle went to fetch a camera to document the compartment and its contents. En route, he briefly entered the interview room, told Lopez that he and Story had found \"the stuff\" and that \"the deal was off.\" Houle left the interview room immediately after making his remark. The compartment was later found to contain sixty-three grams of crack cocaine, a loaded semi-automatic.40 caliber handgun with an obliterated serial number, and a package of photographs bearing Lopez' name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Drysdale testified that, upon hearing Houle's remark, Lopez became \"very sad,\" remarking repeatedly that he was \"fucked\" and that \"his life was over.\" Lopez then asked Drysdale what would happen to a person caught possessing both a gun and drugs. Drysdale replied that it was \"a bad thing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, appellant submitted a motion to suppress the guns and drugs found in the compartment, as well as his statements to Drysdale. Appellant argued that the search of the vehicle was unreasonable, justified neither as a search incident to arrest nor under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. He protested that his statements were made during custodial interrogation and without his having waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights and were thus inadmissible. After a hearing, the district court summarily denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's findings of fact with respect to a suppression motion for clear error. <i>United States v. Infante-Ruiz,</i> 13 F.3d 498, 501 (1st Cir.1994). As a general matter, however, we review the district court's ultimate legal determination of probable cause de novo. <i>Ornelas v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Vehicle Search</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment guarantees \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. Subject to limited exceptions, warrantless searches of private property are per se unreasonable. <i>California v. Acevedo,</i> 500 U.S. 565, 580, 111 S.Ct. 1982, 114 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991); <i>United States v. Donlin,</i> 982 F.2d 31, 33 (1st Cir.1992). The mobility of automobiles and the attendant need to prevent loss of evidence undergirds one such exception. A warrantless search of an automobile will be upheld if \"officers have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband.\" <i>United States v. Ross,</i> 456 U.S. 798, 808, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government bears the burden of proving the lawfulness of the search. <i>Mincey v. Arizona,</i> 437 U.S. 385, 390-91, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978); <i>United States v. Cruz Jimenez,</i> 894 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1990). Specifically, the government must demonstrate that law enforcement officers had \"a belief, reasonably arising out of circumstances known to the seizing officer,\" that the vehicle \"contain[ed] that which by law is subject to seizure and destruction,\" <i>Carroll v. United States,</i> 267 U.S. 132, 149, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Our focus is on \"what the agents knew at the time they searched the car,\" <i>United States v. Goldman,</i> 41 F.3d 785, 787 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the suppression hearing, both DEA agents and New Hampshire police officers gave consistent and detailed testimony regarding the surveilled transactions, all of which occurred in a similar manner. Officers were able to corroborate information supplied by the confidential source describing the vehicles driven by appellant, including the van used on the night of the arrest. The appellant was positively identified both by the confidential source and agents familiar with him from a prior felony conviction. Two witnesses &#8212; Officer Joslin and Agent Houle &#8212; personally observed Lopez during surveilled transactions occurring prior to the night of the arrest. Furthermore, at the scene of the arrest, Tremblay explained to officers that Lopez had in his possession a larger quantity of crack cocaine than she intended to purchase, thus leading officers to believe that a substantial amount of drugs remained in the van. Tremblay further described how, as the arrest team converged, Lopez leaned over her in the passenger seat, suggesting that appellant had either hidden or discarded the drugs. The latter possibility was of particular concern to officers given the presence of several children living in close proximity to the arrest site. Finally, a drug dog alerted aggressively in front of the passenger seat, suggesting that drugs were present but concealed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In short, the district court reasonably concluded that officers had probable cause to search the van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant nevertheless contends that, under <i>Kyllo v. United States,</i> 533 U.S. 27, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001), we are required to weigh the evidence of probable cause against the privacy interests of the individual whose property was subject to search. <i>Kyllo</i> is inapposite. In that case, the primary thrust of the court's analysis was \"whether the use of a thermal-imaging device ... to detect relative amounts of heat within the home constitutes a `search' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\" <i>Kyllo,</i> 533 U.S. at 29, 121 S.Ct. 2038. Nowhere does the court conduct the type of balancing suggested by appellant concerning the reasonableness of the search rather than the threshold determination of whether a search occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to turn to <i>Kyllo</i> for guidance, the recognized privacy interest is of a different caliber from that in the present case because the search there involved a home rather than a car. <i>See New York v. Class,</i> 475 U.S. 106, 112, 106 S.Ct. 960, 89 L.Ed.2d 81 (1986) (\"The Court has recognized that the physical characteristics of an automobile and its use result in a lessened expectation of privacy therein[.]\"). Although the Supreme Court has acknowledged that the stop and search of a vehicle does present a conflict between \"the individual's constitutionally protected interest in privacy and the public interest in effective law enforcement,\" <i>Ross,</i> 456 U.S. at 804, 102 S.Ct. 2157, the Court has also made clear that \"[t]hese interests must yield to the authority of a search\" justified by probable cause. <i>Id.</i> at 823, 102 S.Ct. 2157. The fact that the contraband was in a container in a locked, hidden compartment does not justify any extra measure of consideration. The Supreme Court has explicitly stated that \"[t]he police may search an automobile and the containers within it where they have probable cause to believe contraband or evidence is contained.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Acevedo,</i> 500 U.S. at 580, 111 S.Ct. 1982; <i>see also Owens,</i> 167 F.3d at 750 (\"[I]f probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.\") (quoting <i>Ross,</i> 456 U.S. at 800, 102 S.Ct. 2157). Similarly, \"efforts to restrict access to an area do not generate a reasonable expectation of privacy where none would otherwise exist,\" <i>Class,</i> 475 U.S. at 114, 106 S.Ct. 960.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has presented ample evidence demonstrating that law enforcement officers had probable cause to search the vehicle and the compartment. The relocation of the vehicle from the parking lot to the police station did not deprive the officers of probable cause to search. <i>See Chambers,</i> 399 U.S. at 52, 90 S.Ct. 1975 (\"[T]he blue station wagon could have been searched on the spot.... The probable-cause factor still obtained at the station house[.]\"). The district court properly denied appellant's motion to suppress the evidence discovered in the vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Statements Made to Law Enforcement Officers</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next argues that the district court should have suppressed the post-arrest remarks he made to Drysdale after he learned that Houle and Story had located the hidden compartment. <i>See supra</i> at 5. Appellant claims that the admission of his inculpatory remarks violated his rights under <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1965). In his brief, appellant admitted that Agent Story advised him of his <i>Miranda</i> rights at the scene of the arrest, and that appellant affirmatively responded that he understood those rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order for appellant to make out a claim under <i>Miranda,</i> however, his statements must have been the product of custodial interrogation. <i>Id.</i> at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (\"[T]he prosecution may not use statements ... stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\"). The protections of <i>Miranda</i> extend beyond actual questioning by the police to include the \"functional equivalent\" of interrogation, meaning \"any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\" <i>Rhode Island v. Innis,</i> 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Story and Houle did formally question appellant about the registration of the van, the agents ceased interrogation when appellant indicated he wanted to talk to his lawyer. Although Lopez remained in custody, any statement made \"freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence,\" <i>Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. 1602. <i>See Innis,</i> 446 U.S. at 299, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no indication that appellant's statements stemmed from custodial interrogation or its functional equivalent. Houle's remark, although suggesting that the case against Lopez was strengthened by discovery of \"the stuff,\" was not designed to elicit an incriminating response. Although our focus must be \"primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police,\" <i>Innis,</i> 446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, it is difficult to see how appellant could have construed a passing remark as the functional equivalent of interrogation. Indeed, Houle left the room immediately after making the comment, signaling to appellant that no response was sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Genao,</i> 281 F.3d 305 (1st Cir.2002), we upheld the admission of a confession blurted out by the defendant in response to an officer's statement &#8212; in conjunction with a display of seized contraband &#8212; that \"[w]e've got a problem here.\" <i>See id.</i> at 310. We reasoned that the remark was brief, not worded in a particularly confrontational manner, and, in the context of the ongoing search, intended simply to get the defendant's attention before reading him his rights. <i>See id.</i> at 311. Similarly, Houle's succinct remark simply highlighted information that appellant needed to know to convey to his attorney, who at that point was on his way to the station. <i>Cf. United States v. Conley,</i> 156 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir.1998) (\"A law enforcement officer's mere description of the evidence and of potential charges against a suspect ... hardly can be classified as interrogatory.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellant's voluntary statements, though incriminating, were not the product of custodial interrogation, the district court properly denied the motion to suppress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV. <i>Alleged Prosecutorial Vouching</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that remarks in the prosecutor's opening and closing statements constituted vouching for an absent witness. No objection was made at trial and thus we review only for plain error. <i>United States v. Newton,</i> 327 F.3d 17, 26 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The registered owner of the van, Bob Cole, was scheduled to testify on the final day of the trial. In his opening statement, the prosecutor mentioned that Cole would testify that he &#8212; Cole &#8212; never saw the van and did not have a valid driver's license. The night before his scheduled testimony, however, Cole was visited by a defense investigator. Although we do not know what was said to Cole, he was subsequently admitted to the hospital for mental health reasons and was thus unavailable. In his closing statement, the prosecutor explained to the jury that Cole didn't testify \"because we've established that even though his name is on the registration, Carlos Lopez kept that van.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution is not permitted to \"tell the jury what witnesses who did not testify would have said had they testified,\" <i>United States v. Palmer,</i> 37 F.3d 1080, 1087 (5th Cir.1994). Neither may the prosecution place the prestige of the government behind a witness nor implicitly vouch for a witness by indicating that the testimony is supported by information not presented to the jury. <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 815 F.2d 818, 821-22 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern none of the above errors in the prosecutor's closing remarks. The prosecutor did not offer any indication of the substance of what Cole would have said, but instead simply clarified that other testimony proved that Lopez controlled the vehicle. The prosecutor pointed to evidence presented to the jury &#8212; the testimony of Tremblay regarding multiple drug transactions between her and Lopez in the van, the testimony of the mechanic who performed several thousand dollars worth of work on the car at Lopez' request &#8212; that proved the same point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">V. <i>Denial of Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final claim concerns the court's denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. Appellant's counsel did not submit a motion for acquittal following the close of the government's evidence and, when asked by the judge whether he wished to do so at the conclusion of all the evidence, expressly declined. At the sentencing hearing on May 14, 2003 &#8212; three months after the jury was discharged &#8212; appellant offered a lengthy and detailed allocution. The court treated the allocution as a Rule 29 motion for acquittal, but then denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the district court's lenience, we conclude that the issue was waived by the appellant's failure to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 29, which require the motion to be made by the defendant within seven days \"after a guilty verdict or the court discharges the jury, whichever is later[.]\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a). Although the court may also \"on its own consider whether the evidence is insufficient,\" it must do so before submission to the jury. Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c); <i>see also United States v. Davis,</i> 992 F.2d 635, 638 (6th Cir.1993) (concluding that the district court lacked authority to sua sponte enter a judgment of acquittal more than two months after the jury was discharged). We thus review appellant's claim only for \"clear and gross injustice,\" <i>United States v. Hadfield,</i> 918 F.2d 987, 996 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record fails to reveal such unfairness. We only briefly recite the case against appellant, as there is little need for more extensive analysis. Information supplied by the confidential informant was corroborated during multiple surveillance operations involving Tremblay and appellant. The testimony regarding the five surveilled drug transactions was consistent from all witnesses &#8212; including law enforcement agents, the confidential informant and Tremblay. Appellant was positively identified on multiple occasions. A hidden compartment in the van that was maintained and used by the appellant was found to contain drugs, as well as a gun with an obviously obliterated serial number, and photographs of appellant and his girlfriend, thus substantiating knowing possession. Appellant stipulated to his status as a convicted felon, thus supporting his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm. In short, we see no basis to disturb the verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Counsel for appellant submitted two letters pursuant to Fed.

Ahlin explained that, during the search, Turbo's interest was consistently focused on the front passenger seat, even when Ahlin directed Turbo to other areas of the van.

On appeal, appellant raises two primary issues. First, he contends that key physical evidence, namely, a quantity of drugs and a loaded .40 caliber handgun, was obtained through an unlawful search of his vehicle. Second, appellant contests the admissibility of certain statements he made to law enforcement officers. He argues that the statements were the product of custodial interrogation that occurred after he invoked his right to counsel. Appellant also raises a series of issues relating to alleged prosecutorial vouching, the reliability of the drug dog used in the vehicle search, and the district court's denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. Finding no infirmity in the district court's decision to admit both the physical evidence and appellant's statements, and detecting no basis for reversal or remand on any of appellant's other claims, we affirm the conviction on all counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acting on a tip from a confidential informant, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and local law enforcement officers in New Hampshire began surveillance of a series of arranged drug transactions between appellant and Terri Tremblay, an unwitting friend of the informant. The first such arranged buy occurred on May 11, 2001. In what would become a pattern for subsequent transactions, Tremblay met the confidential informant at a Wendy's restaurant in Portsmouth, where the informant gave Tremblay cash &#8212; serialized funds provided by the DEA &#8212; to purchase crack cocaine. Tremblay and the informant then met Lopez in the parking lot of the Beechstone Condominium complex, across the street from the Wendy's.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Tremblay entered appellant's car and purchased crack cocaine with the serialized money. She then gave the drugs to the informant. After two such transactions in which the informant served as an intermediary between Tremblay and undercover task force officer John Perrachi, Perrachi began to arrange deals directly with Tremblay. Lopez and Tremblay were arrested on July 25, 2001, during the fifth coordinated transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the night of the arrest, law enforcement officers observed Tremblay drive into the Beechstone parking lot, park her car next to a Dodge minivan, exit her vehicle, and enter the minivan. Officers then converged on the minivan and arrested both appellant, who was in the driver's seat, and Tremblay, who was in the passenger seat. Tremblay and appellant were separated, and each told a different version of events to officers present at the scene. Appellant denied any knowledge regarding drugs, saying only that he met Tremblay in the parking lot because he hoped to have sex with her. Tremblay, however, wanted to cooperate and, according to law enforcement reports, explained that Lopez had brought with him a larger quantity of crack than she had been planning to purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because children lived in the Beechstone apartment complex, officers were particularly concerned with seizing the drugs believed to still be in the vicinity. A preliminary search of the vehicle at the scene of the arrest turned up $280 of the serialized funds (the remaining $20 was found on Tremblay's person), but, despite a drug-sniffing dog alerting three times to the passenger front seat, no drugs. A search of the surrounding wooded area and parking lot failed to yield any results. Due to poor lighting and the presence of a crowd of onlookers that had gathered around the scene, officers transported the van to the Portsmouth Police Department. Tremblay and Lopez, still separated, were also taken to the station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the station, after answering some initial questions about the registration of the van, appellant indicated he might be interested in cooperating and requested an attorney. DEA Special Agents Steven Story and Norman Houle ceased questioning appellant and returned to the van to continue the search. Appellant was left in the interview room under the supervision of Officer Brandon Drysdale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While searching the van, Story located a wire leading to a locked compartment under the front passenger seat. Suspecting that the compartment contained contraband, Houle went to fetch a camera to document the compartment and its contents. En route, he briefly entered the interview room, told Lopez that he and Story had found \"the stuff\" and that \"the deal was off.\" Houle left the interview room immediately after making his remark. The compartment was later found to contain sixty-three grams of crack cocaine, a loaded semi-automatic.40 caliber handgun with an obliterated serial number, and a package of photographs bearing Lopez' name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Drysdale testified that, upon hearing Houle's remark, Lopez became \"very sad,\" remarking repeatedly that he was \"fucked\" and that \"his life was over.\" Lopez then asked Drysdale what would happen to a person caught possessing both a gun and drugs. Drysdale replied that it was \"a bad thing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, appellant submitted a motion to suppress the guns and drugs found in the compartment, as well as his statements to Drysdale. Appellant argued that the search of the vehicle was unreasonable, justified neither as a search incident to arrest nor under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. He protested that his statements were made during custodial interrogation and without his having waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights and were thus inadmissible. After a hearing, the district court summarily denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's findings of fact with respect to a suppression motion for clear error. <i>United States v.

The appellant was positively identified both by the confidential source and agents familiar with him from a prior felony conviction. Two witnesses &#8212; Officer Joslin and Agent Houle &#8212; personally observed Lopez during surveilled transactions occurring prior to the night of the arrest. Furthermore, at the scene of the arrest, Tremblay explained to officers that Lopez had in his possession a larger quantity of crack cocaine than she intended to purchase, thus leading officers to believe that a substantial amount of drugs remained in the van. Tremblay further described how, as the arrest team converged, Lopez leaned over her in the passenger seat, suggesting that appellant had either hidden or discarded the drugs. The latter possibility was of particular concern to officers given the presence of several children living in close proximity to the arrest site. Finally, a drug dog alerted aggressively in front of the passenger seat, suggesting that drugs were present but concealed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In short, the district court reasonably concluded that officers had probable cause to search the van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant nevertheless contends that, under <i>Kyllo v.

We reasoned that the remark was brief, not worded in a particularly confrontational manner, and, in the context of the ongoing search, intended simply to get the defendant's attention before reading him his rights. <i>See id.</i> at 311.

In his opening statement, the prosecutor mentioned that Cole would testify that he &#8212; Cole &#8212; never saw the van and did not have a valid driver's license. The night before his scheduled testimony, however, Cole was visited by a defense investigator. Although we do not know what was said to Cole, he was subsequently admitted to the hospital for mental health reasons and was thus unavailable. In his closing statement, the prosecutor explained to the jury that Cole didn't testify \"because we've established that even though his name is on the registration, Carlos Lopez kept that van.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution is not permitted to \"tell the jury what witnesses who did not testify would have said had they testified,\" <i>United States v.

The prosecutor did not offer any indication of the substance of what Cole would have said, but instead simply clarified that other testimony proved that Lopez controlled the vehicle. The prosecutor pointed to evidence presented to the jury &#8212; the testimony of Tremblay regarding multiple drug transactions between her and Lopez in the van, the testimony of the mechanic who performed several thousand dollars worth of work on the car at Lopez' request &#8212; that proved the same point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">V. <i>Denial of Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final claim concerns the court's denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. Appellant's counsel did not submit a motion for acquittal following the close of the government's evidence and, when asked by the judge whether he wished to do so at the conclusion of all the evidence, expressly declined. At the sentencing hearing on May 14, 2003 &#8212; three months after the jury was discharged &#8212; appellant offered a lengthy and detailed allocution. The court treated the allocution as a Rule 29 motion for acquittal, but then denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the district court's lenience, we conclude that the issue was waived by the appellant's failure to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 29, which require the motion to be made by the defendant within seven days \"after a guilty verdict or the court discharges the jury, whichever is later[.]\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a). Although the court may also \"on its own consider whether the evidence is insufficient,\" it must do so before submission to the jury. Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c); <i>see also United States v.

We only briefly recite the case against appellant, as there is little need for more extensive analysis. Information supplied by the confidential informant was corroborated during multiple surveillance operations involving Tremblay and appellant. The testimony regarding the five surveilled drug transactions was consistent from all witnesses &#8212; including law enforcement agents, the confidential informant and Tremblay. Appellant was positively identified on multiple occasions. A hidden compartment in the van that was maintained and used by the appellant was found to contain drugs, as well as a gun with an obviously obliterated serial number, and photographs of appellant and his girlfriend, thus substantiating knowing possession. Appellant stipulated to his status as a convicted felon, thus supporting his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm.
