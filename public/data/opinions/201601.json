In the proceedings below, the\n\ndistrict court declared two statutes enacted by the Puerto Rico\n\nlegislature — one requiring the use of Puerto Rican cement in\n\npublicly funded construction projects and the other requiring\n\nspecial labels for cement manufactured elsewhere — antithetic to\n\nthe dormant Foreign Commerce Clause of Article I, section 8 of the\n\nUnited States Constitution and enjoined their enforcement.                 The\n\ndefendants     (government    officials    sued    in   their   representative\n\ncapacities) appeal. They are joined by an intervenor, Puerto Rican\n\nCement Corporation (PRCC).\n\n             Despite the obvious importance of the case, two questions\n\nof statutory interpretation — one critical to the resolution of\n\nthese appeals and another of potential significance — were not\n\naddressed below.        Perhaps more troublesome, we do not have a fully\n\ndeveloped record to assist us in their resolution. This unfinished\n\nbusiness sends up a red flag:        courts should not hurry to resolve\n\nissues   of     great    public   import   on     the   basis   of   incomplete\n\ninformation.      Consequently, we return the case to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nI.   THE STATUTORY SCHEME\n\n              On July 12, 1985, the Puerto Rico legislature enacted Law\n\n109, codified at 3 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 927-927h, which, inter alia,\n\nrequires the use of \"construction materials manufactured in Puerto\n\nRico\" in all construction works financed with public funds.               Id. §\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f927a.   \"Public funds\" are defined as \"funds or guarantees from the\n\nCommonwealth or from the United States Government, and those funds\n\nprovided by federal laws for the purposes of revitalizing the\n\neconomy.\"     Id. § 927(f).\n\n             The scope of the law's application is unclear.                        The\n\nstatute states that in \"those cases in which a call for bids is\n\nrequired for the contracting of a construction work with public\n\nfunds,\"     the    building      specifications      must    contain   a   provision\n\nmandating the use of Puerto Rican construction materials.                      Id. §\n\n927a.     This section does not expressly limit the law's scope to\n\nsituations        in   which    the   Commonwealth,     or    an   agency    of    the\n\nCommonwealth, is the contracting entity. By contrast, section 927b\n\nprovides that the law applies to projects not requiring competitive\n\nbidding when \"the Commonwealth contracts a construction work.\" Id.\n\n§   927b.     The      law     also   applies   to   situations     in     which   the\n\nCommonwealth undertakes construction to its own behoof.                        Id. §\n\n927c.   The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has never spoken to the scope\n\nof Law 109, nor has it interpreted the relationship among its\n\nvarious sections.\n\n             In all events, the requirements of Law 109 are rendered\n\ninapplicable in two sets of circumstances. First, the law does not\n\nhold with respect to any particular construction material when the\n\ncost associated with the use of local, as opposed to off-island,\n\nmaterial would exceed a certain percentage set by the Puerto Rico\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fBoard of Preference for Government Purchases (Preference Board).\n\nSee id. § 927e(a); see also id. §§ 914a-914k.             Second, the law does\n\nnot apply if indigenous construction materials are not available in\n\nsufficient quantity or quality.           Id. § 927e(b).\n\n            While    the   statute    covers    a     myriad   of   construction\n\nmaterials, only one — cement — is specifically defined.                See id. §\n\n927(d).    \"Cement manufactured in Puerto Rico\" is described as that\n\ncement created from Puerto Rican raw materials, save only for\n\ncomponents not available in industrial quantities from Puerto Rican\n\nsources. Id. The term \"cement\" as used in the statute encompasses\n\n\"cement blocks, pre-mixed concrete, concrete mixed at the site and\n\nmixture for plastering.\"        Id.\n\n            The statute not only confers the standard statutory\n\nexemptions upon cement but also allows the use of off-island cement\n\nfor up to six months \"in a case of force majeure or for causes or\n\nreasons beyond the control of the local factory.\"               Id.    This six-\n\nmonth window may be extended for up to six additional months if the\n\nPreference Board approves.        Id.\n\n            Law 109's Statement of Motives explains that, at the time\n\nof   the   law's    passage,   Puerto    Rico   was    experiencing    a   severe\n\nrecession in the construction industry.             See Act of July 12, 1985,\n\nNo. 109, 1985 P.R. Laws 378, 379.               The cement industry was a\n\nprominent player in the construction market, and it had suffered as\n\na result.    Id.     Expressing concern about the loss of high-paying\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fjobs and the reduction in the tax base accompanying the decline in\n\nthe local cement industry, the legislature enacted the law to\n\nprovide \"greatly needed aid for [its] rehabilitation.\"            Id.\n\n           There is a second statute at issue here.            On September\n\n17, 2001, the Puerto Rico legislature passed Law 132, requiring,\n\ninter alia, all bags of cement manufactured outside of Puerto Rico\n\nto carry a warning label, in both Spanish and English, stating that\n\n\"in accordance with the federal laws (41 U.S.C. sec 10a et seq.)\n\nand the laws of Puerto Rico (§§ 927 et seq. of Title 3), th[is]\n\ncement shall not be used in construction works of the governments\n\nof the United States and of Puerto Rico nor in works financed with\n\nfunds   from    said   governments    except    in    the   specific    cases\n\nestablished in said laws.\"     10 P.R. Laws Ann. § 167e(a)(4).           Bags\n\nof foreign cement that are not so labeled cannot be sold within the\n\nCommonwealth.     Id. § 167e(b).       Law 132's Statement of Motives\n\nreiterated that cement is the principal material used in Puerto\n\nRico construction projects.     See Act of Sept. 17, 2001, No. 132,\n\n2001 P.R. Laws 637, 638.\n\nII.   TRAVEL OF THE CASE\n\n           On    April   30,   2002,       Antilles   Cement    Corporation\n\n(Antilles), a Puerto Rico corporation engaged solely in importing\n\nforeign-made cement for distribution in the Commonwealth, brought\n\nsuit against the governor of Puerto Rico and other executive branch\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fofficials in their representative capacities.1                      The complaint\n\nsought       a    declaration    (i)    that     Law   109   and    Law   132    are\n\nunconstitutional as applied to cement imported from foreign nations\n\nand (ii) that Law 109 is preempted by both the Buy American Act\n\n(BAA), 41 U.S.C. §§ 10a-10d, and section 165 of the Surface\n\nTransportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA), Pub. L. No. 97-424,\n\n96 Stat. 2097.         The complaint also sought concomitant injunctive\n\nrelief.\n\n                 Before the Commonwealth answered the complaint, Antilles\n\nfiled a motion for summary judgment, appending thereto a series of\n\naffidavits and other exhibits.             These exhibits included a letter\n\nfrom       the   Preference     Board   noting    that   there     were   only   two\n\nmanufacturers of cement in Puerto Rico (PRCC and ESSROC San Juan,\n\nInc.).       The letter verified that the Preference Board required\n\nindigenous cement to be used in projects subject to Law 109 so long\n\nas it cost no more than 115% of the price of off-island cement.\n\n                 The Commonwealth asked the court to deny the summary\n\njudgment motion without prejudice on the ground that discovery had\n\nnot yet commenced. Subsequently, Antilles abandoned its claim that\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      The other defendants are the Secretary of Justice, the\nSecretary of Transportation and Public Works, and the Secretary of\nConsumer Affairs. The current occupants of these offices have been\nsubstituted as defendants by operation of law. See Fed. R. App. P.\n43(c)(2).   For simplicity's sake, we refer to the defendants,\ncollectively, as \"the Commonwealth.\"\n\n                                         -7-\n\fthe BAA preempted Law 109.     At that juncture, the Commonwealth\n\nanswered the amended complaint.\n\n          On October 16, 2003, the district court rejected the\n\nCommonwealth's request to deny the summary judgment motion pro\n\nforma. See Antilles Cement Corp. v. Calderón, 288 F. Supp. 2d 187,\n\n190-91 (D.P.R. 2003).   The court proceeded to decide the merits of\n\nthat motion.   First, it ruled that Antilles lacked standing to\n\nraise STAA preemption, as that law only proscribes discrimination\n\nagainst certain domestic construction materials.       Id. at 193.\n\nAntilles does not challenge this ruling on appeal. Next, the court\n\ninquired whether Law 109 and/or Law 132 infringed the dormant\n\nForeign Commerce Clause. Finding that Law 109 discriminated on its\n\nface against foreign commerce, the court concluded that the law was\n\n\"virtually per se invalid.\" Id. at 199 (citing Philadelphia v. New\n\nJersey, 437 U.S. 617, 624 (1978)).    The court deemed the interests\n\nasserted by the Commonwealth — essentially, the economic benefits\n\naccruing to the local economy — far outweighed by the federal\n\ngovernment's interest in \"speaking with one voice\" with respect to\n\ninternational trade.    Id.   Relatedly, the court determined that\n\nalthough the Commonwealth was acting as a market participant, the\n\nmarket participant exception was not available to it in a case\n\nwhich, like this one, involved foreign commerce.        Id. at 197.\n\nFinally, the court inquired whether congressional authorization\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fshielded Law 109 from attack under the dormant Foreign Commerce\n\nClause and answered that inquiry in the negative.         Id. at 199-201.\n\n              Based on this reasoning, the court declared Law 109\n\nunconstitutional.      Id. at 201.   The court simultaneously held Law\n\n132 unconstitutional to the extent that it required labels on bags\n\nof   cement    that   specifically   referenced   the   use   restrictions\n\nestablished by Law 109.      Id. at 202.    It enjoined enforcement of\n\nboth statutes.\n\n              The Commonwealth filed a motion to reconsider or, in the\n\nalternative, to alter or amend the judgment.         See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e).    On December 17, 2003, the district court summarily denied\n\nthe motion.     The next day, PRCC moved to intervene for the purpose\n\nof prosecuting an appeal.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24.        The putative\n\nintervenor asserted that it had an interest protected by Law 109;\n\nthat its interest would be threatened should the district court's\n\njudgment withstand review; and that the government defendants would\n\nnot adequately represent its interest.        On January 15, 2004, the\n\nCommonwealth filed a notice of appeal.2           The following day, the\n\ndistrict court granted PRCC's motion to intervene, whereupon PRCC\n\nfiled a notice of appeal in its own right.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      The Commonwealth originally had filed a premature notice of\nappeal on November 14, 2003 (No. 03-2713). The new appeal (No. 04-\n1231) was intended to supersede that appeal and to encompass the\ndenial of the Rule 59(e) motion.       These two appeals and the\nintervenor's appeal (No. 04-1232) have been consolidated.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            In this court, Antilles moved to dismiss PRCC's appeal,\n\narguing that the Commonwealth's second notice of appeal, filed on\n\nJanuary 15, 2004, divested the district court of jurisdiction over\n\nthe motion to intervene.       We denied that motion without prejudice\n\nto its renewal before this panel.                PRCC has since moved for\n\nintervention at the appellate level.\n\n            A federal court of appeals has broad discretion to grant\n\nor deny intervention at the appellate level. See, e.g., Mangual v.\n\nRotger-Sabat,   317    F.3d    45,   62   (1st     Cir.   2003).        Since   PRCC\n\nsatisfies all the criteria for permissive intervention, see Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 24(b), we choose to exercise that discretion affirmatively\n\nin this instance.        That ruling puts an end to the procedural\n\ncontretemps.         Having    allowed      PRCC     to    intervene       in    the\n\nCommonwealth's pending appeals, PRCC's own appeal (No. 04-1232)\n\nbecomes superfluous.\n\nIII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            This case brings into bold relief the principle that\n\nfederal courts ordinarily \"should withhold decision on vexing\n\nconstitutional questions until consideration of those questions\n\nbecomes necessary.\"      Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ., 386 F.3d 344,\n\n350 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Ala. State Fed'n of Labor v. McAdory,\n\n325 U.S. 450, 461 (1945)); see also Aggarwal v. Ponce Sch. of Med.,\n\n745 F.2d 723, 726 (1st Cir. 1984) (\"It has long been a basic tenet\n\nof   the   federal    courts   to    eschew   the     decision     of    cases    on\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fconstitutional grounds unless and until all other available avenues\n\nof resolution were exhausted.\").                It presents a paradigmatic\n\nexample of a situation in which constitutional questions have been\n\nanswered    in    advance   of   the   demonstrated      necessity    for    their\n\ndecision.\n\n            As framed in the lower court and briefed by the parties\n\non    appeal,    this   litigation     centers    on     novel    constitutional\n\nquestions concerning the reach of the dormant Foreign Commerce\n\nClause and the existence vel non of a market participant exception\n\nto that clause.         A brief discussion regarding the doctrine is\n\nappropriate.\n\n            The    Constitution    gives      Congress   the     authority   \"[t]o\n\nregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several\n\nStates.\"    U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.            This affirmative grant\n\nof power has a negative aspect, known as the dormant Commerce\n\nClause.     See Grant's Dairy-Me., LLC v. Comm'r of Me. Dep't of\n\nAgric., Food & Rural Res., 232 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir. 2000).                     In\n\ngeneral, the dormant Commerce Clause \"prevents state and local\n\ngovernments from impeding the free flow of goods from one state to\n\nanother.\" Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d\n\n178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).          As such, it \"prohibits protectionist\n\nstate regulation designed to benefit in-state economic interests by\n\nburdening out-of-state competitors.\"             Grant's Dairy, 232 F.3d at\n\n18.    The dormant Commerce Clause and its doctrinal accouterments\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fapply to Puerto Rico as though Puerto Rico were a state.                Walgreen\n\nCo. v. Rullan, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2005) [No. 03-2542, slip\n\nop. at 9].\n\n             Although   the    language    of   dormant    Commerce       Clause\n\njurisprudence most often concerns interstate commerce, essentially\n\nthe same doctrine applies to international commerce.              See Barclays\n\nBank v. Franchise Tax Bd., 512 U.S. 298, 310 & n.9 (1994).                    This\n\nlatter application — which, for ease in reference, we shall deem as\n\nemanating from the dormant Foreign Commerce Clause — is relatively\n\nundeveloped in the Supreme Court's case law.              The Court's only\n\niterations of it have come in situations involving state taxation\n\nof foreign commerce.          See, e.g., Barclays Bank, 512 U.S. 298;\n\nWardair Can. Inc. v. Fla. Dep't of Revenue, 477 U.S. 1 (1986);\n\nContainer Corp. of Am. v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. 159 (1983);\n\nJapan Line, Ltd. v. County of L.A., 441 U.S. 434 (1979).\n\n           In those cases, the Supreme Court recognized that, with\n\nrespect to foreign trade and relations, \"the people of the United\n\nStates act through a single government with unified and adequate\n\nnational power.\"    Japan Line, 441 U.S. at 448 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).     Consequently, there is a more pressing need for\n\nuniformity in the realm of foreign trade; the government must be\n\nable to \"speak with one voice when regulating commercial relations\n\nwith   foreign   governments.\"       Barclays    Bank,    512    U.S.    at    311\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).                We regard this\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fconcern as equally vivid in non-tax dormant Foreign Commerce Clause\n\ncases.   See Nat'l Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios, 181 F.3d 38,\n\n68-69 (1st Cir. 1999), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. Crosby v.\n\nNat'l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363 (2000).\n\n            The     market        participant       doctrine       complicates       this\n\nconstitutional algorithm.            The Supreme Court has held, in cases\n\ninvolving domestic commerce, that \"if a State is acting as a market\n\nparticipant,      rather     than    as    a   market       regulator,      the   dormant\n\nCommerce Clause places no limitation on its activities.\"                          S.-Cent.\n\nTimber Dev., Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82, 93 (1984).                       Under this\n\nelaboration, states have been shielded when engaged in activities\n\nsuch as purchasing, Hughes v.

Withal,     this     shield       has   relatively       modest\n\ndimensions;       for     example,        it   does     not       extend     to    hybrid\n\nproprietary/regulatory activities that have downstream effects in\n\na market in which the state is not a participant.                       See, e.g., S.-\n\nCent. Timber, 467 U.S. at 84-85 (holding invalid Alaska's practice\n\nof   selling      state-owned       timber     with     a    contractual      condition\n\nrequiring   purchasers        partially        to   process       the   timber     before\n\nshipping it out of state).\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f            It is uncertain whether the market participant doctrine\n\napplies at all in the context of the dormant Foreign Commerce\n\nClause.      The Supreme Court has never breached this frontier,\n\nalthough it has insinuated that the doctrine, if viable to any\n\nextent in the area of foreign commerce, would have to be more\n\nnarrowly configured.       See Reeves, 447 U.S. at 437 n.9 (\"We have no\n\noccasion to explore the limits imposed on state proprietary actions\n\nby the 'foreign commerce' Clause. . . .         We note, however, that\n\nCommerce Clause scrutiny may well be more rigorous when a restraint\n\non   foreign    commerce    is   alleged.\").   The   issue   has   arisen\n\nsporadically in other courts, and what little case law there is\n\nappears to be in some disarray.         Compare, e.g., Bethlehem Steel\n\nCorp. v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 276 Cal. App. 2d 221, 228-29 (1969)\n\n(holding state \"Buy American\" statute unconstitutional because it\n\ninterfered with federal foreign affairs power, emphasizing its\n\neffect on foreign commerce), with, e.g., Trojan Techs., Inc. v.\n\nPennsylvania, 916 F.2d 903, 910 (3d Cir. 1990) (holding market\n\nparticipant exception applicable to Foreign Commerce Clause so as\n\nto shield state \"Buy American\" law); K. S. B. Tech. Sales Corp. v.\n\nNorth Jersey Dist. Water Supply Comm'n, 381 A.2d 774, 789 (N.J.\n\n1977) (same).     This court has taken pains to leave the question\n\nopen.     See Natsios, 181 F.3d at 65-66.\n\n            The district court, perhaps led astray by the parties,\n\nventured to resolve this case by plunging into this complex and\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\flargely undeveloped area of constitutional law.                In doing so,\n\nhowever, the court failed to consider two antecedent statutory\n\nissues that have the capacity either to eliminate the need for\n\nvexing constitutional adjudication or to narrow the constitutional\n\nquestion.    In our judgment, these issues — one of which concerns\n\nthe scope of the BAA and the second of which concerns the proper\n\ninterpretation of a key aspect of Law 109 — warrant further\n\ndevelopment.        In addition, the insights gleaned by a further\n\nexamination of the two challenged statutes may have some impact on\n\nthe question of their downstream effects — a factor that is\n\nrelevant to assessing the potential applicability of the market\n\nparticipant doctrine.\n\n            We turn first to the BAA.          Early in the game, Antilles\n\nabandoned its claim that the BAA preempts Law 109.3             See Antilles\n\nCement, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 190 n.1.           The BAA remained in the case,\n\nhowever,    through    the   Commonwealth's     insistence    that     the   BAA,\n\ncoupled with Congress's knowing acquiescence in the \"Buy American\"\n\nstatutes    adopted     by   several     states,   furnished    evidence       of\n\ncongressional authorization for statutes such as Law 109.                     The\n\ndistrict    court     brushed   aside   this   argument,     stating    without\n\nelaboration that the BAA \"applies only to contracts with federal\n\n\n     3\n      Antilles abandoned its claim because of its belief that the\nBAA did not apply to purchases by the Commonwealth and/or its\nagencies. Since this opinion calls that premise into question,\nthere is no impediment to the plaintiff's reinstating its\npreemption argument, should it move to do so in a timely fashion.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fagencies,   not    to    contracts   involving     .   .    .   agencies   of   the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"            Id.\n\n            The text of the BAA seems to contradict this statement.\n\nIt provides that\n\n            only such unmanufactured articles, materials,\n            and supplies as have been mined or produced in\n            the United States, and only such manufactured\n            articles, materials, and supplies as have been\n            manufactured    in     the    United    States\n            substantially all from articles, materials, or\n            supplies mined, produced, or manufactured, as\n            the case may be, in the United States, shall\n            be acquired for public use . . . [unless]\n            sufficient and reasonably available commercial\n            quantities and . . . quality [of American-made\n            goods are not available].\n\n41 U.S.C. § 10a. It further provides, with exceptions not relevant\n\nhere, that \"[e]very contract for the construction, alteration, or\n\nrepair of any public building or public work in the United States\"\n\nmust contain a clause requiring the \"contractor, subcontractors,\n\nmaterial men, or suppliers\" to use only American-made goods unless\n\n\"the head of the department or independent establishment making the\n\ncontract\"    determines      that    such      usage   is       impracticable    or\n\nunreasonably expensive.          Id. § 10b(a).    When used in sections 10a\n\nand 10b of the BAA, \"[t]he terms 'public use,' 'public building,'\n\nand 'public work' shall mean use by, public building of, and public\n\nwork of, the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,\n\nAmerican Samoa, the Canal Zone, and the Virgin Islands.\"                    Id. §\n\n10c(b) (emphasis supplied). Thus, it is at least arguable that the\n\nBAA   applies     to    public   works    contracts    entered      into   by   the\n\n                                      -16-\n\fgovernment of Puerto Rico and requires that Puerto Rico include in\n\nthose contracts a clause restricting the use of foreign goods.               It\n\nis also arguable that, if so, Puerto Rico is not free to impose\n\nclauses containing restrictions on the use of foreign goods greater\n\nthan those imposed by federal law.            So viewed, the constitutional\n\nquestions might be avoided by construction of the statute.\n\n            We   have   been   able   to     find   only   one   reported   case\n\ninterpreting the BAA as it pertains to Puerto Rico.              See Caribbean\n\nTubular Corp. v. Fernandez Torrecillas, 67 B.R. 172 (D.P.R. 1986),\n\nvacated on other grounds sub nom. In re Caribbean Tubular Corp.,\n\n813 F.2d 533, 535 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam).                     There, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the BAA applied four-square to\n\nprocurements and purchases of the Commonwealth.               Id. at 174.   The\n\ncourt rejected an argument that the statute only covered federal\n\nprocurement and purchases within Puerto Rico.              Id. at 174-75.   The\n\ncourt also rebuffed an argument that the Federal Relations Act, 48\n\nU.S.C. §§ 731-731e, which authorized self-government for Puerto\n\nRico, rendered the BAA locally inapplicable.               Id. at 175-76.\n\n            The language of the BAA is suggestive and that language,\n\nreinforced by the reasoning of the Caribbean Tubular court, gives\n\nus pause.   Although we hesitate to say with certainty — after all,\n\nneither side has briefed the issue —                both the BAA and Law 109\n\nappear at first blush to forbid the use of foreign construction\n\nmaterials unless their domestic counterparts are unavailable in\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fsufficient quantities or qualities.        Indeed, the parallels between\n\nthe BAA and Law 109 are remarkable.          The BAA forbids the use of\n\nforeign materials in public works, but gives \"the head of the\n\ndepartment    or   independent    establishment   making   the   contract\"\n\nauthority to determine when to grant exemptions from that rule\n\nbased on impracticability or expense.       41 U.S.C. § 10b(a).    Law 109\n\nforbids the use of foreign materials in public works and directs an\n\nindependent establishment — now the Preference Board — to authorize\n\nexceptions if domestic goods are unavailable or markedly more\n\ncostly.   3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 927e.\n\n             Notwithstanding     these   similarities,   there   are   some\n\nsalient differences between Law 109 and the BAA.4          For instance,\n\nthe BAA permits the use of foreign goods if it is in the \"public\n\ninterest,\" 41 U.S.C. § 10d, and Law 109 does not contain such an\n\nexception.    There are also disparities between the BAA and Law 109\n\nas the former has been interpreted in federal regulations.              One\n\nsuch disparity is that the preference for domestic construction\n\nmaterials in procurement by federal agencies is 6%, see 48 C.F.R.\n\n§ 25.204(b), whereas the Preference Board currently sets the\n\npreference for purposes of Law 109 at 15%.         Furthermore, the BAA\n\n\n     4\n      Among other things, Law 109 goes well beyond the BAA in that\nit forbids procurement of American cement not manufactured in\nPuerto Rico. Because Antilles does not contest the lower court's\nfinding, Antilles Cement, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 193, that it lacks\nstanding to challenge the provisions of Law 109 insofar as those\nprovisions apply to American-made cement manufactured off-island,\nwe need not dwell upon this difference.\n\n                                    -18-\n\frequires contracts for construction of public buildings to favor\n\nitems manufactured in the United States that are \"substantially\n\nall\" composed from American raw materials.                        41 U.S.C. § 10b.       The\n\napplicable        federal    regulation        defines      \"substantially        all\"    as\n\nmeaning      at   least     50%.      See      48    C.F.R.   §     25.101(a)(2).         In\n\ncontradistinction,          Law    109    seems       to   require       that   cement    be\n\nmanufactured 100% from indigenous (Puerto Rican) raw materials,\n\nsave   for    those    indigenous         materials        that    are   unavailable      in\n\ncommercial quantities.             See 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 927(d).\n\n              Viewed in this light, one might reasonably question\n\nwhether Law 109, in its differential treatment of foreign goods, is\n\nconsistent or inconsistent with federal law.                       This question can be\n\nexplored on remand, along with the related questions of whether the\n\nBAA essentially preempts Law 109, see Natsios, 181 F.3d at 73-77,\n\nor whether it represents direct congressional authorization for\n\nthat law.         See N.Y. State Dairy Foods, Inc. v. Northeast Dairy\n\nCompact   Comm'n,      198    F.3d       1,   9     (1st   Cir.    1999)    (noting   that\n\ndiscriminatory state legislation may be shielded from dormant\n\nCommerce Clause scrutiny if congressional consent is \"expressly\n\nstated or made unmistakably clear\" (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)); Houlton Citizens' Coalition, 175 F.3d at 184\n\n(explaining that \"[t]he dormant Commerce Clause does not affect\n\nstate or local regulations directly authorized by Congress\").                             If\n\nthe final question were to be answered in the affirmative — a\n\n\n                                              -19-\n\fmatter on which we take no view — that answer would cast doubt upon\n\nthe district court's holding that, in enacting the BAA, \"Congress\n\nhas given express approval for restrictions on the use of foreign\n\nmaterials in federally-funded construction projects . . . [but] has\n\nnot granted similar approval for laws prohibiting the use of\n\nforeign materials in . . . construction projects [funded by the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico].\" Antilles Cement, 288 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n201.   After all, the district court predicated this holding on the\n\nassumption,     quite    possibly      incorrect,     that    the   BAA    did   not\n\nexpressly apply to Puerto Rico.\n\n            There is another unanswered question looming here.                   We\n\nalready have mentioned the market participant doctrine.                   Even were\n\nwe to assume that the doctrine applies in this context — a matter\n\non which we take no view — it is readily evident that determining\n\nwhether particular state activity constitutes market participation\n\nwould require a clear understanding of what the state is doing.\n\n            The record in this case does not furnish the basis for\n\nsuch an understanding.        One problem is that the scope of Law 109 is\n\nunclear.    On its face, section 927a does not appear to limit the\n\nlaw's application to government contracts for construction goods\n\nand    services,      but,   rather,    to    reach   all    competitively       bid\n\nconstruction projects subsidized to any extent by either the\n\nCommonwealth     or    the   federal    government.         Notwithstanding      the\n\nbreadth    of   the    language   contained     in    section    927a,    however,\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fsections 927b and 927c seem less expansive. Whether the latter two\n\nprovisions act to narrow section 927a is an open question.\n\n           Without   discussing   this   tension,   the   district   court\n\nassumed that Law 109 was limited to public works projects.             See\n\nAntilles Cement, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 189.     Based on that assumption,\n\nthe court concluded that Puerto Rico was acting as a market\n\nparticipant with respect to construction goods and services.           Id.\n\nat 194.   Whatever the lower court may have been told — the record\n\nis silent on the subject — we have been given reason to doubt its\n\nunderlying assumption.\n\n          At oral argument in this court, we queried the parties as\n\nto whether Law 109 applies to private development projects for\n\nwhich either the Commonwealth or the federal government provided\n\nsome funding (say, a grant to an entrepreneur building housing for\n\nthe elderly).   The Commonwealth and Antilles, who have agreed on\n\nlittle else during the currency of this litigation, both asserted\n\nthat Law 109 would apply in such situations.5             The intervenor\n\ndisagreed, maintaining that the law only applies to public works.\n\nRemarking the obvious — that the Commonwealth would be hard-pressed\n\nto portray itself as a market participant if the statute regulated\n\nprivate sector construction — we invited supplemental briefing.\n\n\n\n     5\n      Antilles's counsel further asserted that, as a result of this\nlaw, Antilles had been unable to sell off-island cement products to\nprivate developers. There are no facts in the record that either\nsupport or contradict that assertion.\n\n                                  -21-\n\f                 The   supplemental       briefs    provide    scant     assistance.\n\nAntilles elected not to file one. The Commonwealth made a complete\n\nabout-face and took the position that Law 109 only applies to\n\npublic works.           The intervenor remained steadfast in its view,\n\nnoting that the title of Law 109 describes it as providing \"for the\n\nuse of all types of construction materials manufactured in Puerto\n\nRico       in    the   public     works   and   buildings     to   be   constructed,\n\nreconstructed, preserved or repaired with public funds.\" 1985 P.R.\n\nLaws at 378.           As the title of an act may shed some light on its\n\nmeaning, E. Mt. Platform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 40\n\nF.3d 492, 499 (1st Cir. 1994), this is helpful — but far from\n\nconclusive.\n\n                 A second obstacle impedes our effort to gauge Law 109's\n\nreach:          the record is devoid of any factual evidence of custom,\n\nusage, or administrative practice.                 While the docket does contain\n\na   translation        of   the    Preference      Board's   \"Guidelines    for   the\n\nInterpretation and Application of Laws\" — a document compiled in\n\n2002 that discusses Law 109 — those guidelines do not purport to be\n\ndefinitive with respect to the law's scope.6                        To add to the\n\nmystery, the local courts have had virtually no occasion to discuss\n\nLaw 109.         Given this apparent void, evidence of custom, usage, and\n\n\n\n       6\n      The most relevant datum contained in the guidelines is a\nfootnote stating that Law 109 \"is applicable to government entities\n. . . and also to contractors and their subcontractors who perform\nconstruction work under government contracts\" (emphasis supplied).\n\n                                           -22-\n\fadministrative practice is likely to be useful. The statute is now\n\nalmost twenty years old.   If the agencies charged with enforcing\n\nits command consistently have interpreted the language one way or\n\nanother, that fact may prove to be of considerable assistance in\n\ndetermining the statute's meaning.    See Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of\n\nAm. v. Concannon, 249 F.3d 66, 75 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that\n\ndeference is owed to state agency's interpretation of state law);\n\nZambrana v. Gonzalez, 145 P.R. Dec. 616, 639 (P.R. 1998) (stating\n\nthat \"the administrative interpretation given to an act by the\n\n[Commonwealth] agency in charge of enforcing it deserves great\n\nweight and deference\").\n\n          These issues — the applicability of the BAA to Puerto\n\nRico, its significance (if any) as a sign of either congressional\n\nauthorization for or inconsistency with Law 109, the scope and\n\nproper interpretation of Law 109, and the custom, usage, and\n\nadministrative practice that has gone before — are important.\n\nSingly or in combination, they have the potential of allowing a\n\ncourt to avoid, or at least to frame more precisely, a potentially\n\ndifficult constitutional inquiry.     Yet, these issues remain virgin\n\nterritory.   They have not been briefed or argued; they have not\n\nbeen vetted in the district court; and they have not been the focus\n\nof any discovery.\n\n          In the past, we have not shied from remanding cases when\n\nsignificant questions of fact or law have been insufficiently\n\n\n                               -23-\n\fconsidered by the parties or the trial court.              See, e.g., Anderson\n\nv. Boston Sch. Comm., 105 F.3d 762, 769 (1st Cir. 1997); In re San\n\nJuan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 45 F.3d 564, 568-69 (1st Cir.\n\n1995); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2106 (stating that appellate courts\n\n\"may remand [a] cause and . . . require such further proceedings to\n\nbe had as may be just under the circumstances\").               This makes good\n\nsense, as the district court is in the best position to develop the\n\nrecord regarding previously overlooked issues, to examine their\n\nfactual foundations, and to explore their legal ramifications.                  We\n\nelect to follow that salutary praxis here.\n\n             We    do   not     limit    this    disposition   to    the    issues\n\nsurrounding Law 109. The lower court's decision to declare Law 132\n\nunconstitutional is inextricably intertwined with, and ostensibly\n\njustified by, its decision anent the constitutionality of Law 109.\n\nSee Antilles Cement, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 202 (\"As the Court today\n\nhas ruled that Law 109 is unconstitutional, Defendants are not\n\npermitted to order that cement bags carry warnings reflecting the\n\nlanguage of Law 109.          Therefore, the Court holds that the portions\n\nof   .   .   .    Law   132    that     impact   upon   foreign     commerce   are\n\nunconstitutional        under    the     Foreign   Commerce    Clause.\").       We\n\ntherefore remand the Law 132 issues as well and direct the district\n\ncourt to reconsider its ruling with regard thereto in light of the\n\nadditional information (factual and legal) that it will glean in\n\nthe course of the remand.\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fIV.     CONCLUSION\n\n             We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this     opinion.   While     we   vacate   the   court's   declaratory\n\njudgment, we do not vacate the existing injunction at this time.\n\nWe believe that the more orderly course is for the district court,\n\non remand, to consider whether the usual criteria counsel in favor\n\nof preliminarily enjoining enforcement of the statutes pendente\n\nlite.    See, e.g., Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v.

In the proceedings below, the\n\ndistrict court declared two statutes enacted by the Puerto Rico\n\nlegislature — one requiring the use of Puerto Rican cement in\n\npublicly funded construction projects and the other requiring\n\nspecial labels for cement manufactured elsewhere — antithetic to\n\nthe dormant Foreign Commerce Clause of Article I, section 8 of the\n\nUnited States Constitution and enjoined their enforcement.                 The\n\ndefendants     (government    officials    sued    in   their   representative\n\ncapacities) appeal. They are joined by an intervenor, Puerto Rican\n\nCement Corporation (PRCC).\n\n             Despite the obvious importance of the case, two questions\n\nof statutory interpretation — one critical to the resolution of\n\nthese appeals and another of potential significance — were not\n\naddressed below.        Perhaps more troublesome, we do not have a fully\n\ndeveloped record to assist us in their resolution. This unfinished\n\nbusiness sends up a red flag:        courts should not hurry to resolve\n\nissues   of     great    public   import   on     the   basis   of   incomplete\n\ninformation.      Consequently, we return the case to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nI.   THE STATUTORY SCHEME\n\n              On July 12, 1985, the Puerto Rico legislature enacted Law\n\n109, codified at 3 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 927-927h, which, inter alia,\n\nrequires the use of \"construction materials manufactured in Puerto\n\nRico\" in all construction works financed with public funds.               Id. §\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f927a.   \"Public funds\" are defined as \"funds or guarantees from the\n\nCommonwealth or from the United States Government, and those funds\n\nprovided by federal laws for the purposes of revitalizing the\n\neconomy.\"     Id. § 927(f).\n\n             The scope of the law's application is unclear.                        The\n\nstatute states that in \"those cases in which a call for bids is\n\nrequired for the contracting of a construction work with public\n\nfunds,\"     the    building      specifications      must    contain   a   provision\n\nmandating the use of Puerto Rican construction materials.                      Id. §\n\n927a.     This section does not expressly limit the law's scope to\n\nsituations        in   which    the   Commonwealth,     or    an   agency    of    the\n\nCommonwealth, is the contracting entity. By contrast, section 927b\n\nprovides that the law applies to projects not requiring competitive\n\nbidding when \"the Commonwealth contracts a construction work.\" Id.\n\n§   927b.     The      law     also   applies   to   situations     in     which   the\n\nCommonwealth undertakes construction to its own behoof.                        Id. §\n\n927c.   The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has never spoken to the scope\n\nof Law 109, nor has it interpreted the relationship among its\n\nvarious sections.\n\n             In all events, the requirements of Law 109 are rendered\n\ninapplicable in two sets of circumstances. First, the law does not\n\nhold with respect to any particular construction material when the\n\ncost associated with the use of local, as opposed to off-island,\n\nmaterial would exceed a certain percentage set by the Puerto Rico\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fBoard of Preference for Government Purchases (Preference Board).\n\nSee id. § 927e(a); see also id. §§ 914a-914k.             Second, the law does\n\nnot apply if indigenous construction materials are not available in\n\nsufficient quantity or quality.           Id. § 927e(b).\n\n            While    the   statute    covers    a     myriad   of   construction\n\nmaterials, only one — cement — is specifically defined.                See id. §\n\n927(d).    \"Cement manufactured in Puerto Rico\" is described as that\n\ncement created from Puerto Rican raw materials, save only for\n\ncomponents not available in industrial quantities from Puerto Rican\n\nsources. Id. The term \"cement\" as used in the statute encompasses\n\n\"cement blocks, pre-mixed concrete, concrete mixed at the site and\n\nmixture for plastering.\"        Id.\n\n            The statute not only confers the standard statutory\n\nexemptions upon cement but also allows the use of off-island cement\n\nfor up to six months \"in a case of force majeure or for causes or\n\nreasons beyond the control of the local factory.\"               Id.    This six-\n\nmonth window may be extended for up to six additional months if the\n\nPreference Board approves.        Id.\n\n            Law 109's Statement of Motives explains that, at the time\n\nof   the   law's    passage,   Puerto    Rico   was    experiencing    a   severe\n\nrecession in the construction industry.             See Act of July 12, 1985,\n\nNo. 109, 1985 P.R. Laws 378, 379.               The cement industry was a\n\nprominent player in the construction market, and it had suffered as\n\na result.    Id.     Expressing concern about the loss of high-paying\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fjobs and the reduction in the tax base accompanying the decline in\n\nthe local cement industry, the legislature enacted the law to\n\nprovide \"greatly needed aid for [its] rehabilitation.\"            Id.\n\n           There is a second statute at issue here.            On September\n\n17, 2001, the Puerto Rico legislature passed Law 132, requiring,\n\ninter alia, all bags of cement manufactured outside of Puerto Rico\n\nto carry a warning label, in both Spanish and English, stating that\n\n\"in accordance with the federal laws (41 U.S.C. sec 10a et seq.)\n\nand the laws of Puerto Rico (§§ 927 et seq. of Title 3), th[is]\n\ncement shall not be used in construction works of the governments\n\nof the United States and of Puerto Rico nor in works financed with\n\nfunds   from    said   governments    except    in    the   specific    cases\n\nestablished in said laws.\"     10 P.R. Laws Ann. § 167e(a)(4).           Bags\n\nof foreign cement that are not so labeled cannot be sold within the\n\nCommonwealth.     Id. § 167e(b).       Law 132's Statement of Motives\n\nreiterated that cement is the principal material used in Puerto\n\nRico construction projects.     See Act of Sept. 17, 2001, No. 132,\n\n2001 P.R. Laws 637, 638.\n\nII.   TRAVEL OF THE CASE\n\n           On    April   30,   2002,       Antilles   Cement    Corporation\n\n(Antilles), a Puerto Rico corporation engaged solely in importing\n\nforeign-made cement for distribution in the Commonwealth, brought\n\nsuit against the governor of Puerto Rico and other executive branch\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fofficials in their representative capacities.1                      The complaint\n\nsought       a    declaration    (i)    that     Law   109   and    Law   132    are\n\nunconstitutional as applied to cement imported from foreign nations\n\nand (ii) that Law 109 is preempted by both the Buy American Act\n\n(BAA), 41 U.S.C. §§ 10a-10d, and section 165 of the Surface\n\nTransportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA), Pub. L. No. 97-424,\n\n96 Stat. 2097.         The complaint also sought concomitant injunctive\n\nrelief.\n\n                 Before the Commonwealth answered the complaint, Antilles\n\nfiled a motion for summary judgment, appending thereto a series of\n\naffidavits and other exhibits.             These exhibits included a letter\n\nfrom       the   Preference     Board   noting    that   there     were   only   two\n\nmanufacturers of cement in Puerto Rico (PRCC and ESSROC San Juan,\n\nInc.).       The letter verified that the Preference Board required\n\nindigenous cement to be used in projects subject to Law 109 so long\n\nas it cost no more than 115% of the price of off-island cement.\n\n                 The Commonwealth asked the court to deny the summary\n\njudgment motion without prejudice on the ground that discovery had\n\nnot yet commenced. Subsequently, Antilles abandoned its claim that\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      The other defendants are the Secretary of Justice, the\nSecretary of Transportation and Public Works, and the Secretary of\nConsumer Affairs. The current occupants of these offices have been\nsubstituted as defendants by operation of law. See Fed. R. App. P.\n43(c)(2).   For simplicity's sake, we refer to the defendants,\ncollectively, as \"the Commonwealth.\"\n\n                                         -7-\n\fthe BAA preempted Law 109.     At that juncture, the Commonwealth\n\nanswered the amended complaint.\n\n          On October 16, 2003, the district court rejected the\n\nCommonwealth's request to deny the summary judgment motion pro\n\nforma. See Antilles Cement Corp. v. Calderón, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2509375\"><a href=\"/opinion/2509375/antilles-cement-corp-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n190-91 (D.P.R. 2003).   The court proceeded to decide the merits of\n\nthat motion.   First, it ruled that Antilles lacked standing to\n\nraise STAA preemption, as that law only proscribes discrimination\n\nagainst certain domestic construction materials.       Id. at 193.\n\nAntilles does not challenge this ruling on appeal. Next, the court\n\ninquired whether Law 109 and/or Law 132 infringed the dormant\n\nForeign Commerce Clause. Finding that Law 109 discriminated on its\n\nface against foreign commerce, the court concluded that the law was\n\n\"virtually per se invalid.\" Id. at 199 (citing Philadelphia v. New\n\nJersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109916\"><a href=\"/opinion/109916/philadelphia-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 624 (1978)).    The court deemed the interests\n\nasserted by the Commonwealth — essentially, the economic benefits\n\naccruing to the local economy — far outweighed by the federal\n\ngovernment's interest in \"speaking with one voice\" with respect to\n\ninternational trade.    Id.   Relatedly, the court determined that\n\nalthough the Commonwealth was acting as a market participant, the\n\nmarket participant exception was not available to it in a case\n\nwhich, like this one, involved foreign commerce.        Id. at 197.\n\nFinally, the court inquired whether congressional authorization\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fshielded Law 109 from attack under the dormant Foreign Commerce\n\nClause and answered that inquiry in the negative.         Id. at 199-201.\n\n              Based on this reasoning, the court declared Law 109\n\nunconstitutional.      Id. at 201.   The court simultaneously held Law\n\n132 unconstitutional to the extent that it required labels on bags\n\nof   cement    that   specifically   referenced   the   use   restrictions\n\nestablished by Law 109.      Id. at 202.    It enjoined enforcement of\n\nboth statutes.\n\n              The Commonwealth filed a motion to reconsider or, in the\n\nalternative, to alter or amend the judgment.         See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e).    On December 17, 2003, the district court summarily denied\n\nthe motion.     The next day, PRCC moved to intervene for the purpose\n\nof prosecuting an appeal.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24.        The putative\n\nintervenor asserted that it had an interest protected by Law 109;\n\nthat its interest would be threatened should the district court's\n\njudgment withstand review; and that the government defendants would\n\nnot adequately represent its interest.        On January 15, 2004, the\n\nCommonwealth filed a notice of appeal.2           The following day, the\n\ndistrict court granted PRCC's motion to intervene, whereupon PRCC\n\nfiled a notice of appeal in its own right.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      The Commonwealth originally had filed a premature notice of\nappeal on November 14, 2003 (No. 03-2713). The new appeal (No. 04-\n1231) was intended to supersede that appeal and to encompass the\ndenial of the Rule 59(e) motion.       These two appeals and the\nintervenor's appeal (No. 04-1232) have been consolidated.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            In this court, Antilles moved to dismiss PRCC's appeal,\n\narguing that the Commonwealth's second notice of appeal, filed on\n\nJanuary 15, 2004, divested the district court of jurisdiction over\n\nthe motion to intervene.       We denied that motion without prejudice\n\nto its renewal before this panel.                PRCC has since moved for\n\nintervention at the appellate level.\n\n            A federal court of appeals has broad discretion to grant\n\nor deny intervention at the appellate level. See, e.g., Mangual v.\n\nRotger-Sabat,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780589\"><a href=\"/opinion/780589/tomas-de-jesus-mangual-jorge-medina-caribbean-international-news/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span>    <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>    <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   62   (1st     Cir.   2003).        Since   PRCC\n\nsatisfies all the criteria for permissive intervention, see Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 24(b), we choose to exercise that discretion affirmatively\n\nin this instance.        That ruling puts an end to the procedural\n\ncontretemps.         Having    allowed      PRCC     to    intervene       in    the\n\nCommonwealth's pending appeals, PRCC's own appeal (No. 04-1232)\n\nbecomes superfluous.\n\nIII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            This case brings into bold relief the principle that\n\nfederal courts ordinarily \"should withhold decision on vexing\n\nconstitutional questions until consideration of those questions\n\nbecomes necessary.\"      Eulitt v.

This court has taken pains to leave the question\n\nopen.     See Natsios, 181 F.3d at 65-66.\n\n            The district court, perhaps led astray by the parties,\n\nventured to resolve this case by plunging into this complex and\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\flargely undeveloped area of constitutional law.                In doing so,\n\nhowever, the court failed to consider two antecedent statutory\n\nissues that have the capacity either to eliminate the need for\n\nvexing constitutional adjudication or to narrow the constitutional\n\nquestion.    In our judgment, these issues — one of which concerns\n\nthe scope of the BAA and the second of which concerns the proper\n\ninterpretation of a key aspect of Law 109 — warrant further\n\ndevelopment.        In addition, the insights gleaned by a further\n\nexamination of the two challenged statutes may have some impact on\n\nthe question of their downstream effects — a factor that is\n\nrelevant to assessing the potential applicability of the market\n\nparticipant doctrine.\n\n            We turn first to the BAA.          Early in the game, Antilles\n\nabandoned its claim that the BAA preempts Law 109.3             See Antilles\n\nCement, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 190 n.1.           The BAA remained in the case,\n\nhowever,    through    the   Commonwealth's     insistence    that     the   BAA,\n\ncoupled with Congress's knowing acquiescence in the \"Buy American\"\n\nstatutes    adopted     by   several     states,   furnished    evidence       of\n\ncongressional authorization for statutes such as Law 109.                     The\n\ndistrict    court     brushed   aside   this   argument,     stating    without\n\nelaboration that the BAA \"applies only to contracts with federal\n\n\n     3\n      Antilles abandoned its claim because of its belief that the\nBAA did not apply to purchases by the Commonwealth and/or its\nagencies. Since this opinion calls that premise into question,\nthere is no impediment to the plaintiff's reinstating its\npreemption argument, should it move to do so in a timely fashion.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fagencies,   not    to    contracts   involving     .   .    .   agencies   of   the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"            Id.\n\n            The text of the BAA seems to contradict this statement.\n\nIt provides that\n\n            only such unmanufactured articles, materials,\n            and supplies as have been mined or produced in\n            the United States, and only such manufactured\n            articles, materials, and supplies as have been\n            manufactured    in     the    United    States\n            substantially all from articles, materials, or\n            supplies mined, produced, or manufactured, as\n            the case may be, in the United States, shall\n            be acquired for public use . . . [unless]\n            sufficient and reasonably available commercial\n            quantities and . . . quality [of American-made\n            goods are not available].\n\n41 U.S.C. § 10a. It further provides, with exceptions not relevant\n\nhere, that \"[e]very contract for the construction, alteration, or\n\nrepair of any public building or public work in the United States\"\n\nmust contain a clause requiring the \"contractor, subcontractors,\n\nmaterial men, or suppliers\" to use only American-made goods unless\n\n\"the head of the department or independent establishment making the\n\ncontract\"    determines      that    such      usage   is       impracticable    or\n\nunreasonably expensive.          Id. § 10b(a).    When used in sections 10a\n\nand 10b of the BAA, \"[t]he terms 'public use,' 'public building,'\n\nand 'public work' shall mean use by, public building of, and public\n\nwork of, the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,\n\nAmerican Samoa, the Canal Zone, and the Virgin Islands.\"                    Id. §\n\n10c(b) (emphasis supplied). Thus, it is at least arguable that the\n\nBAA   applies     to    public   works    contracts    entered      into   by   the\n\n                                      -16-\n\fgovernment of Puerto Rico and requires that Puerto Rico include in\n\nthose contracts a clause restricting the use of foreign goods.               It\n\nis also arguable that, if so, Puerto Rico is not free to impose\n\nclauses containing restrictions on the use of foreign goods greater\n\nthan those imposed by federal law.            So viewed, the constitutional\n\nquestions might be avoided by construction of the statute.\n\n            We   have   been   able   to     find   only   one   reported   case\n\ninterpreting the BAA as it pertains to Puerto Rico.

There, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the BAA applied four-square to\n\nprocurements and purchases of the Commonwealth.               Id. at 174.   The\n\ncourt rejected an argument that the statute only covered federal\n\nprocurement and purchases within Puerto Rico.              Id. at 174-75.   The\n\ncourt also rebuffed an argument that the Federal Relations Act, 48\n\nU.S.C. §§ 731-731e, which authorized self-government for Puerto\n\nRico, rendered the BAA locally inapplicable.               Id. at 175-76.\n\n            The language of the BAA is suggestive and that language,\n\nreinforced by the reasoning of the Caribbean Tubular court, gives\n\nus pause.   Although we hesitate to say with certainty — after all,\n\nneither side has briefed the issue —                both the BAA and Law 109\n\nappear at first blush to forbid the use of foreign construction\n\nmaterials unless their domestic counterparts are unavailable in\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fsufficient quantities or qualities.        Indeed, the parallels between\n\nthe BAA and Law 109 are remarkable.          The BAA forbids the use of\n\nforeign materials in public works, but gives \"the head of the\n\ndepartment    or   independent    establishment   making   the   contract\"\n\nauthority to determine when to grant exemptions from that rule\n\nbased on impracticability or expense.       41 U.S.C. § 10b(a).    Law 109\n\nforbids the use of foreign materials in public works and directs an\n\nindependent establishment — now the Preference Board — to authorize\n\nexceptions if domestic goods are unavailable or markedly more\n\ncostly.   3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 927e.\n\n             Notwithstanding     these   similarities,   there   are   some\n\nsalient differences between Law 109 and the BAA.4          For instance,\n\nthe BAA permits the use of foreign goods if it is in the \"public\n\ninterest,\" 41 U.S.C. § 10d, and Law 109 does not contain such an\n\nexception.    There are also disparities between the BAA and Law 109\n\nas the former has been interpreted in federal regulations.              One\n\nsuch disparity is that the preference for domestic construction\n\nmaterials in procurement by federal agencies is 6%, see 48 C.F.R.\n\n§ 25.204(b), whereas the Preference Board currently sets the\n\npreference for purposes of Law 109 at 15%.         Furthermore, the BAA\n\n\n     4\n      Among other things, Law 109 goes well beyond the BAA in that\nit forbids procurement of American cement not manufactured in\nPuerto Rico. Because Antilles does not contest the lower court's\nfinding, Antilles Cement, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 193, that it lacks\nstanding to challenge the provisions of Law 109 insofar as those\nprovisions apply to American-made cement manufactured off-island,\nwe need not dwell upon this difference.\n\n                                    -18-\n\frequires contracts for construction of public buildings to favor\n\nitems manufactured in the United States that are \"substantially\n\nall\" composed from American raw materials.                        41 U.S.C. § 10b.       The\n\napplicable        federal    regulation        defines      \"substantially        all\"    as\n\nmeaning      at   least     50%.      See      48    C.F.R.   §     25.101(a)(2).         In\n\ncontradistinction,          Law    109    seems       to   require       that   cement    be\n\nmanufactured 100% from indigenous (Puerto Rican) raw materials,\n\nsave   for    those    indigenous         materials        that    are   unavailable      in\n\ncommercial quantities.             See 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 927(d).\n\n              Viewed in this light, one might reasonably question\n\nwhether Law 109, in its differential treatment of foreign goods, is\n\nconsistent or inconsistent with federal law.                       This question can be\n\nexplored on remand, along with the related questions of whether the\n\nBAA essentially preempts Law 109, see Natsios, 181 F.3d at 73-77,\n\nor whether it represents direct congressional authorization for\n\nthat law.         See N.Y. State Dairy Foods, Inc. v.

[but] has\n\nnot granted similar approval for laws prohibiting the use of\n\nforeign materials in . . . construction projects [funded by the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico].\" Antilles Cement, 288 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n201.   After all, the district court predicated this holding on the\n\nassumption,     quite    possibly      incorrect,     that    the   BAA    did   not\n\nexpressly apply to Puerto Rico.\n\n            There is another unanswered question looming here.                   We\n\nalready have mentioned the market participant doctrine.                   Even were\n\nwe to assume that the doctrine applies in this context — a matter\n\non which we take no view — it is readily evident that determining\n\nwhether particular state activity constitutes market participation\n\nwould require a clear understanding of what the state is doing.\n\n            The record in this case does not furnish the basis for\n\nsuch an understanding.        One problem is that the scope of Law 109 is\n\nunclear.    On its face, section 927a does not appear to limit the\n\nlaw's application to government contracts for construction goods\n\nand    services,      but,   rather,    to    reach   all    competitively       bid\n\nconstruction projects subsidized to any extent by either the\n\nCommonwealth     or    the   federal    government.         Notwithstanding      the\n\nbreadth    of   the    language   contained     in    section    927a,    however,\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fsections 927b and 927c seem less expansive. Whether the latter two\n\nprovisions act to narrow section 927a is an open question.\n\n           Without   discussing   this   tension,   the   district   court\n\nassumed that Law 109 was limited to public works projects.             See\n\nAntilles Cement, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 189.     Based on that assumption,\n\nthe court concluded that Puerto Rico was acting as a market\n\nparticipant with respect to construction goods and services.           Id.\n\nat 194.   Whatever the lower court may have been told — the record\n\nis silent on the subject — we have been given reason to doubt its\n\nunderlying assumption.\n\n          At oral argument in this court, we queried the parties as\n\nto whether Law 109 applies to private development projects for\n\nwhich either the Commonwealth or the federal government provided\n\nsome funding (say, a grant to an entrepreneur building housing for\n\nthe elderly).   The Commonwealth and Antilles, who have agreed on\n\nlittle else during the currency of this litigation, both asserted\n\nthat Law 109 would apply in such situations.5             The intervenor\n\ndisagreed, maintaining that the law only applies to public works.\n\nRemarking the obvious — that the Commonwealth would be hard-pressed\n\nto portray itself as a market participant if the statute regulated\n\nprivate sector construction — we invited supplemental briefing.\n\n\n\n     5\n      Antilles's counsel further asserted that, as a result of this\nlaw, Antilles had been unable to sell off-island cement products to\nprivate developers.

The Commonwealth made a complete\n\nabout-face and took the position that Law 109 only applies to\n\npublic works.           The intervenor remained steadfast in its view,\n\nnoting that the title of Law 109 describes it as providing \"for the\n\nuse of all types of construction materials manufactured in Puerto\n\nRico       in    the   public     works   and   buildings     to   be   constructed,\n\nreconstructed, preserved or repaired with public funds.\" 1985 P.R.\n\nLaws at 378.

While the docket does contain\n\na   translation        of   the    Preference      Board's   \"Guidelines    for   the\n\nInterpretation and Application of Laws\" — a document compiled in\n\n2002 that discusses Law 109 — those guidelines do not purport to be\n\ndefinitive with respect to the law's scope.6                        To add to the\n\nmystery, the local courts have had virtually no occasion to discuss\n\nLaw 109.         Given this apparent void, evidence of custom, usage, and\n\n\n\n       6\n      The most relevant datum contained in the guidelines is a\nfootnote stating that Law 109 \"is applicable to government entities\n. . . and also to contractors and their subcontractors who perform\nconstruction work under government contracts\" (emphasis supplied).\n\n                                           -22-\n\fadministrative practice is likely to be useful. The statute is now\n\nalmost twenty years old.   If the agencies charged with enforcing\n\nits command consistently have interpreted the language one way or\n\nanother, that fact may prove to be of considerable assistance in\n\ndetermining the statute's meaning.

Yet, these issues remain virgin\n\nterritory.   They have not been briefed or argued; they have not\n\nbeen vetted in the district court; and they have not been the focus\n\nof any discovery.\n\n          In the past, we have not shied from remanding cases when\n\nsignificant questions of fact or law have been insufficiently\n\n\n                               -23-\n\fconsidered by the parties or the trial court.

This makes good\n\nsense, as the district court is in the best position to develop the\n\nrecord regarding previously overlooked issues, to examine their\n\nfactual foundations, and to explore their legal ramifications.                  We\n\nelect to follow that salutary praxis here.\n\n             We    do   not     limit    this    disposition   to    the    issues\n\nsurrounding Law 109. The lower court's decision to declare Law 132\n\nunconstitutional is inextricably intertwined with, and ostensibly\n\njustified by, its decision anent the constitutionality of Law 109.\n\nSee Antilles Cement, 288 F. Supp. 2d at 202 (\"As the Court today\n\nhas ruled that Law 109 is unconstitutional, Defendants are not\n\npermitted to order that cement bags carry warnings reflecting the\n\nlanguage of Law 109.          Therefore, the Court holds that the portions\n\nof   .   .   .    Law   132    that     impact   upon   foreign     commerce   are\n\nunconstitutional        under    the     Foreign   Commerce    Clause.\").       We\n\ntherefore remand the Law 132 issues as well and direct the district\n\ncourt to reconsider its ruling with regard thereto in light of the\n\nadditional information (factual and legal) that it will glean in\n\nthe course of the remand.\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fIV.     CONCLUSION\n\n             We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this     opinion.   While     we   vacate   the   court's   declaratory\n\njudgment, we do not vacate the existing injunction at this time.\n\nWe believe that the more orderly course is for the district court,\n\non remand, to consider whether the usual criteria counsel in favor\n\nof preliminarily enjoining enforcement of the statutes pendente\n\nlite.
