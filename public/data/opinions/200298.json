A newspaper reporter threatened with prosecution for articles he had published about government corruption brought suit in 1999 challenging the Puerto Rico criminal libel statute as unconstitutional under the First Amendment.  Three other reporters, including one who had been prosecuted under the statute and another who had been threatened, sought to intervene on the plaintiff's side, along with a newspaper and the Overseas Press Club.  The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief and at the outset moved for summary judgment on the ground that the statute is plainly unconstitutional.  The district court dismissed the suit in 2002, finding no jurisdiction due to standing, ripeness and mootness concerns.  We hold that the district court was in error as to its standing, ripeness and mootness rulings and that the criminal libel statute is unconstitutional as applicable to statements regarding public officials and public figures.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">I.

However, the court may impose the penalty of rendering community service in lieu of the term of imprisonment.</span>\n</p><p>1:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; that amendment increased the criminal penalty to incarceration between one and three years and a fine of not more than five thousand dollars, but made no other changes to the statute.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"/>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; 4102.

In 1995, Caribbean created an internal division of </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, the Editorial Investigations Division, which was designed to investigate matters of public concern, such as police brutality, government corruption, and the like.  Obed Betancourt, a reporter for </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> since 1995, was transferred to this division in June 1998 and assigned to investigate allegations that the Narcotics Squad of the Caguas police had been infiltrated by organized crime.  Betancourt wrote a series of articles reporting on these allegations, including evidence that a drug dealer who was targeted by the Narcotics Squad helped to organize its Christmas party and was paying bribes to officers.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';n, an agent with the Narcotics Squad, was having an affair with that same drug dealer.  The purpose of publishing this information, according to Betancourt, was to explain why so many drug cases in Caguas were dismissed -- because the Narcotics agents did not appear to testify -- and how confidential information was leaked to investigation targets.  The article also touched on Officer Rivera's fitness for police duty.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">On September 10, 1998, Officer Rivera filed a civil action for libel against both Betancourt and </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">.  On February 26, 1999, she also filed a complaint with the Caguas police against Betancourt for criminal libel under section 4101 and later urged the local district attorney to bring charges against Betancourt.  Subsequently, she persuaded a fellow Caguas police officer to file a similar complaint and to secure his supervisor's signature on it.  The case was then transferred to San Juan, where the newspaper's offices are located.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Betancourt and </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> filed suit in federal court, requesting declaratory judgment that the criminal libel statute is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.</span>\n</p><p>2:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> The residents of Puerto Rico are protected by the First Amendment.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Torres</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Puerto Rico</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, 442 U.S. 465, 469 (1979) (citing </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Balzac</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Porto Rico</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, 258 U.S. 298, 314 (1922)).  </span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; thus, four police officers in two departments were involved in initiating prosecutions.  That same day Betancourt was forced to appear and testify at a probable cause hearing.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">  The prosecution made no effort to put on evidence as to falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth.  Cross-examination demonstrated that neither prosecution witness could establish anything about the truthfulness of the articles.  The Puerto Rico court judge found no probable cause, and the criminal case was dismissed against Betancourt.  Thereafter, the federal district court dismissed the federal declaratory judgment case as moot.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Fuentes Agostini</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, No. 99-1272 (D.P.R. Sept. 14, 1999).</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';s Mangual, the plaintiff in this case, is another reporter for </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> and was assigned to cover the Caguas police and courts.  For over thirteen years he has written extensively on the subject of the corruption of government officials in the Caguas region, often identifying individual officials as corrupt and under the influence of drug traffickers.  Mangual investigated the criminal libel complaint against Betancourt and wrote four articles on the subject between March 11 and 16, 1999.  In these articles, Mangual accused the Caguas police, including Rivera, of being corrupt and of pursuing the libel charge against Betancourt in an attempt to silence him.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Mangual also made several accusations specifically against Officer Rivera, in addition to the charge that she had trumped up criminal charges against Betancourt in retaliation for his 1998 articles.  The first was that Rivera was linked to drug traffickers, the same charge earlier made by Betancourt, and that she was under investigation as a result.  The second was that Rivera had been conducting an adulterous affair with her married superior and had given birth to his child.  This latter allegation was meant to explain Rivera's influence over the Caguas police.  The articles asserted that she had managed to achieve a transfer to the drug unit in violation of normal procedures and had used her position to retaliate against officers who complained about her.  Mangual wrote that the chief of the anti-corruption unit of the Puerto Rico police had instituted an investigation into a number of complaints against Rivera, and it was possible that probable cause to charge her would be found.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Officer Rivera responded to these articles by writing a letter to the Secretary of Justice on April 12, 1999.  The letter notified Fuentes that \"I am prepared not only to file the criminal charges that concern [Betancourt and Mangual], but also to bring this suit on its merits, up to the ultimate legal consequences.\"</span>\n</p><p>3:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; we quote from the certified translation of Rivera's letter, and a translation provided by the plaintiff of the response.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">  This reference was to the filing of criminal libel charges against the two reporters.  She complained of procedural anomalies in the handling of her prior criminal libel complaint against Betancourt, including the transfer of the case to San Juan, and requested an investigation \"so that summons be issued for this case for the corresponding legal process.\"</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; the Department of Justice intervenes only after there has been a determination of probable cause and the case has been scheduled for trial.  Accordingly, he forwarded the letter and the materials Rivera attached to the Superintendent of the Police \"for any action he may deem pertinent.\"  He did not inform either Officer Rivera or the Superintendent of the Police that the Department of Justice would not support prosecution in this matter, nor did he warn them that there may be constitutional infirmities in a prosecution.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> Mangual's complaint stated he feared \"prosecution by at least Officer Rivera, and possibly by other persons whose interest is obstructing publications regarding official corruption.\"  Mangual also verified that he felt the effects of the threat of prosecution after the March 1999 articles.  Police officers at Caguas Police Headquarters were being pressured not to give information to Mangual and were afraid to even be seen with him, seriously interfering with his work as a journalist.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; the defendant was convicted and fined.  In both cases, district attorneys from the Department of Justice were prosecuting.  Neither case involved journalists or other members of the press.  Details about the threats to the putative intervenors are discussed below.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">II.  History of the Case</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; Fuentes Agostini, the Secretary of Justice of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico at the time of the initiation of the suit.  Fuentes has since resigned, and he has been replaced as the defendant by the new Secretary of Justice, Angel Rotger-Sabat.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> Fed.

The Secretary also filed a memorandum opposing the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.  On May 2, 2000, Fuentes, no longer the Secretary, moved to dismiss the case entirely on the additional jurisdictional ground of mootness, because no criminal charges had been filed against Mangual, and the one-year statute of limitations had expired on March 17, 2000.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; 3412(b).</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';rez, who was a reporter for the </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">San Juan Star</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, a </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">New York Times</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';rez said, \"I am in a catch-22 situation, damned if I do, damned if I don't.

R. Civ. P. 24(b) (permissive intervention).  The application to intervene included an affidavit from Medina.  The application was in part based on a threat of prosecution which had been leveled at Medina.   Medina wrote three articles in October 2000 in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> involving allegations of certain conduct by a Puerto Rico gubernatorial candidate.  The candidate's campaign director, at a press conference, announced the filing of a civil suit against Medina and threatened to file a criminal complaint.  The campaign director stated that the publications constituted criminal libel and such actions were a felony punishable by jail.  Medina was present and felt threatened.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">On March 28, 2002, the district court dismissed Mangual's case, and denied Medina and Caribbean's motions to intervene, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The court held that the plaintiff and intervenors all lacked standing to sue, and that the plaintiff's claims were both unripe and moot.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Mangual</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Fuentes Agostini</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, 203 F.

In his complaint, Mangual asserts standing under both alternative prongs of the </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">N.H. Right to Life</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> standing rubric.  First,  Mangual faced and continues to face a real threat of prosecution.  \"The existence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Newman-Green, Inc.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Alfonzo-Larrain</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">see</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Becker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">FEC</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; furthermore, the Department of Justice advanced the prosecution when it forwarded Rivera's complaint to the local police.  There is no question Mangual had standing at that time.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Mangual also has standing based on other factors.  He states an intention to continue covering police corruption and writing articles similar to those which instigated Rivera's threat of prosecution.  He asserts that there are several other individuals who have been mentioned in published articles he has authored who are inclined to prosecute him for criminal libel.  The investigations into these individuals are ongoing, and further articles will be written, exacerbating Mangual's exposure to a criminal libel prosecution.  Thus, even discounting Rivera's threat of prosecution, Mangual has shown a credible threat of prosecution for continuing his work as a journalist.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Second, Mangual asserts the existence of a \"chilling effect of a very serious nature\" on his investigative reporting due to the possibility of prosecution.  The effect of the statute, as alleged by Mangual, has been severe.  While insurance is available to cover civil libel cases, none is available to cover the legal fees or fines resulting from criminal libel charges.   As a result, there is nothing Mangual can do to limit his exposure other than to curtail his investigative and journalistic activities.  Mangual also says there is a danger his sources will silence themselves if he is criminally prosecuted and forced to disclose his sources to prove the truth of his allegations.  The threat of prosecution against Mangual, and the ensuing chilling effect, certainly exceed the low probability threshold required for First Amendment standing purposes.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; it is less than thirty years old.

The prosecution of Betancourt in 1999, thwarted only by the judge in the probable cause hearing, belies the claim that journalists are immune from prosecution.  The Secretary of Justice has not unequivocally stated a policy against prosecution of such cases, and the Secretary's actions gainsay any such avowal.  Indeed, when Officer Rivera threatened to institute a criminal libel action against Mangual and notified the Department of Justice, the Department did not advise against it.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; indeed, as the history of Betancourt's prosecution indicates, at least one local police department prosecuted despite a federal court injunction ordering it not to prosecute.  The plaintiff's credible fear of being haled into court on a criminal charge is enough for the purposes of standing, even if it were not likely that the reporter would be convicted.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">The defendants do not raise separate prudential standing concerns, and we see none.  \"[A] realistic risk of future exposure to [a] challenged policy . . . is sufficient to satisfy\" prudential as well as constitutional standing concerns.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Berner</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Delahanty</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, 129 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1997).  Mangual's complaint makes a sufficient showing of a credible threat of prosecution to secure standing under Article III.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">2.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Ripeness</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">The district court also found that Mangual's claim was not ripe.  Like standing, the doctrine of ripeness has roots in both the Article III case or controversy requirement and in prudential considerations.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">R.I.

Supp. 2d at 87.  The district court did not make clear under which prong of the ripeness determination it was operating, or whether its concerns were constitutional or prudential.  It appears that the district court was making a prudential determination based on fitness.  The reasoning seems to be that because Mangual might not in fact engage in activities that run afoul of the statute, or because he might never be prosecuted, the court should decline to consider the merits of the constitutional challenge.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">The district court's analysis has two errors.  First, its analysis under the ripeness doctrine that Mangual does not face a \"credible threat of prosecution\" is simply a repetition of its standing decision, one that is mistaken.  Mangual has averred an intention to continue his work as an investigative journalist, and the recent prosecutions under the criminal libel law indicate a real threat of prosecution for his work.  Ripeness does not require that he wait for such a prosecution.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Second, the district court failed to consider Mangual's alternative ground for standing: the chilling effect that the statute has on his work as a journalist.  If that effect emanates from a credible threat of prosecution, as it does here, Mangual need not either describe a plan to break the law or wait for a prosecution under it.  The purpose of the alternative ground for standing in such cases is so that plaintiffs need not break the law in order to challenge it.  \"[T]he doctrine of ripeness . . . asks whether an injury that has not yet happened is sufficiently likely to happen to warrant judicial review.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Gun Owners Action League, Inc.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Swift</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, 284 F.3d 198, 205 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation omitted).  Here, that injury, the chilling effect, is not only likely but has already come to pass.

This mootness determination is incorrect.  A pending prosecution is not required for a party to have standing, even if standing is asserted on the basis of a party's intent to engage in potentially law-breaking activity.  Mangual claims a threat of prosecution based on his ongoing investigations.  Mangual also claims standing based on the criminal libel statute's chilling effect, which is an ongoing repercussion of the statute.  The expiration of the limitations period as related to Rivera's particular threat does not moot either of these standing grounds.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Finally, this case meets the standards of the \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" doctrine.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">S.

Medina is also a journalist working for </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> who has been threatened with prosecution under the Puerto Rico criminal libel statute.  While the statute of limitations has expired as to that particular threat, he continues to work as a journalist and to risk prosecution under the statute.  As such, he is in a position like that of Mangual.  Medina has expressed the fear that he may be prosecuted and has articulated his desire to continue publishing, as a journalist, on matters that may draw a libel prosecution.  Given the history of threatened and actual prosecution under the statute detailed above, Medina has evidenced enough of a threat to establish standing to intervene in this suit.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Under the circumstances of this case, we see no reason to remand for consideration of Medina's motion to intervene under the correct legal standards.

Because we hold that both the plaintiff, Mangual, and the intervenor, Medina, have standing to challenge the Puerto Rico criminal libel statute, we need not reach the question of whether a newspaper can assert standing to challenge a criminal libel statute based on threats of prosecution against its reporters.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">C.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Abstention</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">In the district court the defendants argued that the plaintiff and intervenors could vindicate their rights by undergoing criminal prosecution and presenting the </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Garrison</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> issues to the Puerto Rico courts.  For this reason, they argued, the federal court should abstain.  Such an argument fundamentally misunderstands the law of pre-enforcement action under the First Amendment and of abstention.  On appeal the Secretary urges that the federal court stay its hand and wait \"until the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has had the opportunity to express itself.\"  That opportunity would presumably arise on appeal from a conviction of a media defendant under the criminal libel statute.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">At no time has the Secretary of Justice identified any unclear issue of state law, as opposed to federal constitutional law, in this dispute.

The Secretary points to </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Olivero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">.  There the court described the elements of the case: \"a real and malicious intent, indicating the untruth of the fact and reckless disregard for the truth ('malice' animus injuriandi) which is expressed directly in a publication . . . which communicates information tending to denigrate a person's worth.\"  112 P.R.

It did cite federal caselaw, but only for the question of who qualifies as a public figure, and it found that the case did not involve a public figure.  Further, the opinion's use of the \"reckless disregard\" phrase is followed by the Latin phrase \"animus injuriandi,\" defined as \"The intention to injure, esp. to insult.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Black's Law Dictionary</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> 87 (7th ed. 1999).

The </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Olivero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';decision uses \"reckless disregard\" to further define \"a real and malicious intent,\" and it does not impose a distinct requirement of knowing or reckless disregard for the statement's truth.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">b.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Truth as a Defense</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">In addition to the actual malice standard, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Garrison</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> requires that in a criminal libel prosecution for a statement concerning a public official, truth must be a complete defense.  Section 4102 does permit an unqualified affirmative defense of truth, but it does so only if the victim \"is a public officer and the charge made refers to the performance of his duties.\"  Otherwise, truth is only a defense if the defendant \"had good intention and justifiable ends.\"  The section 4102 defense of truth is not broad enough to encompass all constitutionally protected statements.  This affirmative defense is constitutionally deficient.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">First, section 4102 only applies to statements about public officials in the performance of official duties.  Under </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Garrison</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; it exacerbates it.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">The statutory affirmative defense also does not protect all public figures, only public officers.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Garrison</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> rejected any notion that the allegedly libelous utterance must have been published \"with good motives and for justifiable ends,\" as applied to public officials.  379 U.S. at 70-73.  Later rulings expanded the </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">New York Times</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> standard to statements regarding public figures.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Gertz</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, 418 U.S. at 335.  Thus, truth must be a complete defense for all public figures, not merely public officials.  Section 4102 does not provide such protection for statements involving public figures who are not officials.  For these reasons, section 4102 is unconstitutional.</span>\n</p><p>9:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> The criminal libel statute makes no mention of any requirement that the prosecution prove a defendant's knowledge of falsity or recklessness with regard to falsity.  The plaintiff and intervenors allege that this also makes the statute unconstitutional.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">It is an open question whether criminal libel statutes must include non-truth as an element of the crime instead of truth as an affirmative defense.  The Supreme Court, in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Garrison</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, indicated that the constitutional protections in the civil arena should apply to criminal libel prosecutions as well. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> 379 U.S. at 74 (\"We held in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">New York Times</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> that a public official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he establishes that the utterance was false . . . .  The reasons which led us so to hold . . . apply with no less force merely because the remedy is criminal.\").  The Supreme Court has also required that libelous statements in civil cases on matters of public concern be proven false, at least against media defendants.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Phila.

In other words, the Puerto Rico statute potentially puts defendants into the position of choosing between their First and Fifth Amendment rights.  Another concern is that journalists may be unable to protect confidential sources if required to prove the truth of published statements.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">It may be that the Supreme Court will reason that the</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> requirement that civil plaintiffs prove falsity in certain circumstances means that prosecutors must also prove falsity  as an element of the crime of libel in those circumstances.  However, because the Supreme Court has yet to rule on this precise issue, and because the Puerto Rico criminal libel statute clearly has other constitutional infirmities, we need not reach this issue.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">\t\tc.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Report of Official Acts</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Section 4103 also applies to plaintiff's activities.

Second, plaintiffs independently challenge section 4104, which requires that the criminal court \"shall order\" the publication of conviction for libel through the same or analogous means as the libel was published.

A newspaper reporter threatened with prosecution for articles he had published about government corruption brought suit in 1999 challenging the Puerto Rico criminal libel statute as unconstitutional under the First Amendment.  Three other reporters, including one who had been prosecuted under the statute and another who had been threatened, sought to intervene on the plaintiff's side, along with a newspaper and the Overseas Press Club.  The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief and at the outset moved for summary judgment on the ground that the statute is plainly unconstitutional.  The district court dismissed the suit in 2002, finding no jurisdiction due to standing, ripeness and mootness concerns.  We hold that the district court was in error as to its standing, ripeness and mootness rulings and that the criminal libel statute is unconstitutional as applicable to statements regarding public officials and public figures.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">I.

In 1995, Caribbean created an internal division of </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, the Editorial Investigations Division, which was designed to investigate matters of public concern, such as police brutality, government corruption, and the like.  Obed Betancourt, a reporter for </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> since 1995, was transferred to this division in June 1998 and assigned to investigate allegations that the Narcotics Squad of the Caguas police had been infiltrated by organized crime.  Betancourt wrote a series of articles reporting on these allegations, including evidence that a drug dealer who was targeted by the Narcotics Squad helped to organize its Christmas party and was paying bribes to officers.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';n, an agent with the Narcotics Squad, was having an affair with that same drug dealer.  The purpose of publishing this information, according to Betancourt, was to explain why so many drug cases in Caguas were dismissed -- because the Narcotics agents did not appear to testify -- and how confidential information was leaked to investigation targets.  The article also touched on Officer Rivera's fitness for police duty.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">On September 10, 1998, Officer Rivera filed a civil action for libel against both Betancourt and </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">.  On February 26, 1999, she also filed a complaint with the Caguas police against Betancourt for criminal libel under section 4101 and later urged the local district attorney to bring charges against Betancourt.  Subsequently, she persuaded a fellow Caguas police officer to file a similar complaint and to secure his supervisor's signature on it.  The case was then transferred to San Juan, where the newspaper's offices are located.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Betancourt and </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> filed suit in federal court, requesting declaratory judgment that the criminal libel statute is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.</span>\n</p><p>2:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> The residents of Puerto Rico are protected by the First Amendment.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Torres</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Puerto Rico</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620876\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620876/torres-v-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span>, 469 (1979) (citing </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Balzac</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Porto Rico</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99954\"><a href=\"/opinion/99954/balzac-v-porto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 314 (1922)).  </span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; thus, four police officers in two departments were involved in initiating prosecutions.  That same day Betancourt was forced to appear and testify at a probable cause hearing.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">  The prosecution made no effort to put on evidence as to falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth.  Cross-examination demonstrated that neither prosecution witness could establish anything about the truthfulness of the articles.  The Puerto Rico court judge found no probable cause, and the criminal case was dismissed against Betancourt.  Thereafter, the federal district court dismissed the federal declaratory judgment case as moot.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Fuentes Agostini</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, No. 99-1272 (D.P.R. Sept. 14, 1999).</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';s Mangual, the plaintiff in this case, is another reporter for </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> and was assigned to cover the Caguas police and courts.  For over thirteen years he has written extensively on the subject of the corruption of government officials in the Caguas region, often identifying individual officials as corrupt and under the influence of drug traffickers.  Mangual investigated the criminal libel complaint against Betancourt and wrote four articles on the subject between March 11 and 16, 1999.  In these articles, Mangual accused the Caguas police, including Rivera, of being corrupt and of pursuing the libel charge against Betancourt in an attempt to silence him.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Mangual also made several accusations specifically against Officer Rivera, in addition to the charge that she had trumped up criminal charges against Betancourt in retaliation for his 1998 articles.  The first was that Rivera was linked to drug traffickers, the same charge earlier made by Betancourt, and that she was under investigation as a result.  The second was that Rivera had been conducting an adulterous affair with her married superior and had given birth to his child.  This latter allegation was meant to explain Rivera's influence over the Caguas police.  The articles asserted that she had managed to achieve a transfer to the drug unit in violation of normal procedures and had used her position to retaliate against officers who complained about her.  Mangual wrote that the chief of the anti-corruption unit of the Puerto Rico police had instituted an investigation into a number of complaints against Rivera, and it was possible that probable cause to charge her would be found.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Officer Rivera responded to these articles by writing a letter to the Secretary of Justice on April 12, 1999.  The letter notified Fuentes that \"I am prepared not only to file the criminal charges that concern [Betancourt and Mangual], but also to bring this suit on its merits, up to the ultimate legal consequences.\"</span>\n</p><p>3:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; we quote from the certified translation of Rivera's letter, and a translation provided by the plaintiff of the response.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">  This reference was to the filing of criminal libel charges against the two reporters.  She complained of procedural anomalies in the handling of her prior criminal libel complaint against Betancourt, including the transfer of the case to San Juan, and requested an investigation \"so that summons be issued for this case for the corresponding legal process.\"</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; the Department of Justice intervenes only after there has been a determination of probable cause and the case has been scheduled for trial.  Accordingly, he forwarded the letter and the materials Rivera attached to the Superintendent of the Police \"for any action he may deem pertinent.\"  He did not inform either Officer Rivera or the Superintendent of the Police that the Department of Justice would not support prosecution in this matter, nor did he warn them that there may be constitutional infirmities in a prosecution.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> Mangual's complaint stated he feared \"prosecution by at least Officer Rivera, and possibly by other persons whose interest is obstructing publications regarding official corruption.\"  Mangual also verified that he felt the effects of the threat of prosecution after the March 1999 articles.  Police officers at Caguas Police Headquarters were being pressured not to give information to Mangual and were afraid to even be seen with him, seriously interfering with his work as a journalist.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; the defendant was convicted and fined.  In both cases, district attorneys from the Department of Justice were prosecuting.  Neither case involved journalists or other members of the press.  Details about the threats to the putative intervenors are discussed below.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">II.

The Secretary also filed a memorandum opposing the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.  On May 2, 2000, Fuentes, no longer the Secretary, moved to dismiss the case entirely on the additional jurisdictional ground of mootness, because no criminal charges had been filed against Mangual, and the one-year statute of limitations had expired on March 17, 2000.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; 3412(b).</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';rez, who was a reporter for the </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">San Juan Star</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, a </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">New York Times</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';rez said, \"I am in a catch-22 situation, damned if I do, damned if I don't.

R. Civ. P. 24(b) (permissive intervention).  The application to intervene included an affidavit from Medina.  The application was in part based on a threat of prosecution which had been leveled at Medina.   Medina wrote three articles in October 2000 in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> involving allegations of certain conduct by a Puerto Rico gubernatorial candidate.  The candidate's campaign director, at a press conference, announced the filing of a civil suit against Medina and threatened to file a criminal complaint.  The campaign director stated that the publications constituted criminal libel and such actions were a felony punishable by jail.  Medina was present and felt threatened.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">On March 28, 2002, the district court dismissed Mangual's case, and denied Medina and Caribbean's motions to intervene, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

In his complaint, Mangual asserts standing under both alternative prongs of the </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">N.H. Right to Life</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> standing rubric.  First,  Mangual faced and continues to face a real threat of prosecution.  \"The existence of federal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Newman-Green, Inc.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Alfonzo-Larrain</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">see</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Becker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">FEC</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; furthermore, the Department of Justice advanced the prosecution when it forwarded Rivera's complaint to the local police.  There is no question Mangual had standing at that time.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Mangual also has standing based on other factors.  He states an intention to continue covering police corruption and writing articles similar to those which instigated Rivera's threat of prosecution.  He asserts that there are several other individuals who have been mentioned in published articles he has authored who are inclined to prosecute him for criminal libel.  The investigations into these individuals are ongoing, and further articles will be written, exacerbating Mangual's exposure to a criminal libel prosecution.  Thus, even discounting Rivera's threat of prosecution, Mangual has shown a credible threat of prosecution for continuing his work as a journalist.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Second, Mangual asserts the existence of a \"chilling effect of a very serious nature\" on his investigative reporting due to the possibility of prosecution.  The effect of the statute, as alleged by Mangual, has been severe.  While insurance is available to cover civil libel cases, none is available to cover the legal fees or fines resulting from criminal libel charges.   As a result, there is nothing Mangual can do to limit his exposure other than to curtail his investigative and journalistic activities.  Mangual also says there is a danger his sources will silence themselves if he is criminally prosecuted and forced to disclose his sources to prove the truth of his allegations.  The threat of prosecution against Mangual, and the ensuing chilling effect, certainly exceed the low probability threshold required for First Amendment standing purposes.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; it is less than thirty years old.

The prosecution of Betancourt in 1999, thwarted only by the judge in the probable cause hearing, belies the claim that journalists are immune from prosecution.  The Secretary of Justice has not unequivocally stated a policy against prosecution of such cases, and the Secretary's actions gainsay any such avowal.  Indeed, when Officer Rivera threatened to institute a criminal libel action against Mangual and notified the Department of Justice, the Department did not advise against it.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; indeed, as the history of Betancourt's prosecution indicates, at least one local police department prosecuted despite a federal court injunction ordering it not to prosecute.  The plaintiff's credible fear of being haled into court on a criminal charge is enough for the purposes of standing, even if it were not likely that the reporter would be convicted.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">The defendants do not raise separate prudential standing concerns, and we see none.  \"[A] realistic risk of future exposure to [a] challenged policy . . . is sufficient to satisfy\" prudential as well as constitutional standing concerns.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Berner</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Delahanty</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197623\"><a href=\"/opinion/197623/berner-v-delahanty/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir. 1997).

Supp. 2d at 87.  The district court did not make clear under which prong of the ripeness determination it was operating, or whether its concerns were constitutional or prudential.  It appears that the district court was making a prudential determination based on fitness.  The reasoning seems to be that because Mangual might not in fact engage in activities that run afoul of the statute, or because he might never be prosecuted, the court should decline to consider the merits of the constitutional challenge.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">The district court's analysis has two errors.  First, its analysis under the ripeness doctrine that Mangual does not face a \"credible threat of prosecution\" is simply a repetition of its standing decision, one that is mistaken.  Mangual has averred an intention to continue his work as an investigative journalist, and the recent prosecutions under the criminal libel law indicate a real threat of prosecution for his work.

If that effect emanates from a credible threat of prosecution, as it does here, Mangual need not either describe a plan to break the law or wait for a prosecution under it.  The purpose of the alternative ground for standing in such cases is so that plaintiffs need not break the law in order to challenge it.  \"[T]he doctrine of ripeness . . . asks whether an injury that has not yet happened is sufficiently likely to happen to warrant judicial review.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Gun Owners Action League, Inc.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Swift</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></span>, 205 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation omitted).

A pending prosecution is not required for a party to have standing, even if standing is asserted on the basis of a party's intent to engage in potentially law-breaking activity.  Mangual claims a threat of prosecution based on his ongoing investigations.  Mangual also claims standing based on the criminal libel statute's chilling effect, which is an ongoing repercussion of the statute.

Medina is also a journalist working for </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">El Vocero</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> who has been threatened with prosecution under the Puerto Rico criminal libel statute.  While the statute of limitations has expired as to that particular threat, he continues to work as a journalist and to risk prosecution under the statute.  As such, he is in a position like that of Mangual.  Medina has expressed the fear that he may be prosecuted and has articulated his desire to continue publishing, as a journalist, on matters that may draw a libel prosecution.  Given the history of threatened and actual prosecution under the statute detailed above, Medina has evidenced enough of a threat to establish standing to intervene in this suit.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Under the circumstances of this case, we see no reason to remand for consideration of Medina's motion to intervene under the correct legal standards.

Because we hold that both the plaintiff, Mangual, and the intervenor, Medina, have standing to challenge the Puerto Rico criminal libel statute, we need not reach the question of whether a newspaper can assert standing to challenge a criminal libel statute based on threats of prosecution against its reporters.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">C.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Abstention</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">In the district court the defendants argued that the plaintiff and intervenors could vindicate their rights by undergoing criminal prosecution and presenting the </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Garrison</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> issues to the Puerto Rico courts.  For this reason, they argued, the federal court should abstain.  Such an argument fundamentally misunderstands the law of pre-enforcement action under the First Amendment and of abstention.  On appeal the Secretary urges that the federal court stay its hand and wait \"until the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has had the opportunity to express itself.\"  That opportunity would presumably arise on appeal from a conviction of a media defendant under the criminal libel statute.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">At no time has the Secretary of Justice identified any unclear issue of state law, as opposed to federal constitutional law, in this dispute.

Under </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Garrison</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; it exacerbates it.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">The statutory affirmative defense also does not protect all public figures, only public officers.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Garrison</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> rejected any notion that the allegedly libelous utterance must have been published \"with good motives and for justifiable ends,\" as applied to public officials.  379 U.S. at 70-73.  Later rulings expanded the </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">New York Times</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> standard to statements regarding public figures.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Gertz</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, 418 U.S. at 335.  Thus, truth must be a complete defense for all public figures, not merely public officials.  Section 4102 does not provide such protection for statements involving public figures who are not officials.  For these reasons, section 4102 is unconstitutional.</span>\n</p><p>9:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> The criminal libel statute makes no mention of any requirement that the prosecution prove a defendant's knowledge of falsity or recklessness with regard to falsity.  The plaintiff and intervenors allege that this also makes the statute unconstitutional.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">It is an open question whether criminal libel statutes must include non-truth as an element of the crime instead of truth as an affirmative defense.  The Supreme Court, in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Garrison</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, indicated that the constitutional protections in the civil arena should apply to criminal libel prosecutions as well. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> 379 U.S. at 74 (\"We held in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">New York Times</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> that a public official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he establishes that the utterance was false . . . .  The reasons which led us so to hold . . . apply with no less force merely because the remedy is criminal.\").  The Supreme Court has also required that libelous statements in civil cases on matters of public concern be proven false, at least against media defendants.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Phila. Newspapers</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Hepps</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111628\"><a href=\"/opinion/111628/philadelphia-newspapers-inc-v-hepps/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></a></span>, 778 (1986).</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">One concern about placing the burden of proving truth on the defendant is that it may require defendants to waive their Fifth Amendment rights in order to take advantage of the </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">New York Times</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> standards.  In other words, the Puerto Rico statute potentially puts defendants into the position of choosing between their First and Fifth Amendment rights.  Another concern is that journalists may be unable to protect confidential sources if required to prove the truth of published statements.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">It may be that the Supreme Court will reason that the</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> requirement that civil plaintiffs prove falsity in certain circumstances means that prosecutors must also prove falsity  as an element of the crime of libel in those circumstances.  However, because the Supreme Court has yet to rule on this precise issue, and because the Puerto Rico criminal libel statute clearly has other constitutional infirmities, we need not reach this issue.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">\t\tc.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Report of Official Acts</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Section 4103 also applies to plaintiff's activities.  Mangual investigated and reported the details of the judicial proceedings against Betancourt.  Mangual also reported on other acts of official character, the internal investigations of the police department.  Section 4103 states that, as to judicial or legislative acts, or any other act of \"official character,\" any report or statement </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">which is true and fair</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> \"shall [not] be considered to be libelous.\"  The official Spanish version, enacted in 1974, uses \"imparcial y exacta,\" rendered in the official English translation as \"true and fair.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; the report must be \"fair\" as well.  It is inconsistent with First Amendment standards to require that a true statement about official acts must also be fair.  Further, when proving actual malice, falsity is not established by \"minor inaccuracies,\" whether deliberate or not.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Masson</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">New Yorker Magazine</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112633\"><a href=\"/opinion/112633/masson-v-new-yorker-magazine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 516-17 (1991).

Otherwise, small inaccuracies, if the product of knowing or reckless behavior, could form the basis of liability even when commenting about public officials or figures. </span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Mangual and the intervenors argue that the translation of the passage as \"true and fair\" is neither true nor fair: they say the original Spanish translates more accurately to \"impartial and exact.\"  Their complaint appears to be a valid one.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Oxford Spanish Dictionary</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; 517(5), and there the original Spanish is \"verdadero y justo.\"  Were the statute read literally in Spanish, an exactness standard (even an impartiality standard) is even more clearly constitutionally deficient, for the reasons stated above. </span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">In the end, the constitutional infirmity does not depend on whether the original Spanish or the official English translation is relied upon.  Section 4103 is not broad enough to privilege minor inaccuracies when reporting on government acts, statements, or debates.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">d.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Further Arguments</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">The plaintiff and intervenors challenge the criminal libel statute on two additional grounds.  First, they argue that the penalty of restitution permitted by section 4101 violates the </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Gertz</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> requirement that damages be proven unless liability is established under the actual malice standard.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Gertz</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, 418 U.S. at 349-50 (prohibiting \"presumed or punitive damages, at least when liability is not based on a showing of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth\" and requiring that \"all awards must be supported by competent evidence concerning the injury\").  Second, plaintiffs independently challenge section 4104, which requires that the criminal court \"shall order\" the publication of conviction for libel through the same or analogous means as the libel was published.  The plaintiff and intervenors argue that this provision unconstitutionally violates editorial independence under the standards set out in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Miami Herald</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">Tornillo</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109088\"><a href=\"/opinion/109088/miami-herald-publishing-co-v-tornillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span> (1974).</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier'; as to section 4104, there is no severability clause, and this section would in any event lack force standing alone.
