Mukasey as the respondent.\n     **\n      Senior Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          SILER, Senior Circuit Judge. Petitioner Guang Zhao Zhang\n\nseeks review of the final order of removal of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (“BIA”) denying his applications for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (“CAT”).   He argues that the BIA erred by concluding that\n\nhe failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\nfor his religious beliefs.       For the following reasons, we deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n                            I.     BACKGROUND\n\n          Zhang, a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of\n\nChina, arrived in the United States in 2004 without valid entry\n\ndocuments and was detained at the border.         In 2005, after being\n\ncharged by the Department of Homeland Security with being subject\n\nto removal, Zhang filed an application for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under CAT.\n\n          Zhang claims that he was a Protestant Christian and was\n\npersecuted because of his religious beliefs. In China, he attended\n\nmass with his grandmother.       Prior to 1999, she organized mass in\n\npublic places in their village.        After 1999, when the police did\n\nnot allow mass in public places, she held mass for ten to twenty\n\npeople in her home.    In 2001, the police ransacked their home while\n\nthey were away at a wedding.           Three weeks later, the police\n\napproached their house again, but Zhang’s family left before the\n\npolice arrived.    Two months later, his grandmother and parents\n\n                                    -2-\n\fmoved into an old house.        Zhang stayed with his uncle until he left\n\nChina in 2004.       He attended middle school for one semester before\n\ndropping out.     His older brother and sister got jobs and moved to\n\nother places.        His parents and siblings still live and work in\n\nChina and have not been harmed.\n\n           The Immigration Judge (“IJ”) denied Zhang’s petition for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal.             The IJ found that the core\n\nelement in Zhang’s claim (that he left China because of religious\n\npersecution) was not credible because the purpose of the police\n\nraids was not clearly shown, it seemed implausible that the family\n\nwould   flee    and    never    return    after   the   first     contact    with\n\nauthorities,    he    had   “extremely     limited   familiarity”     with   the\n\nChristian faith, and he had not attended church for two months and\n\nwas not baptized.        The IJ also found, in the alternative, that\n\nZhang had not demonstrated past persecution or a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution in China on account of his religion for his\n\nasylum or withholding of removal claims.             There were no arrests,\n\ndetentions, or physical injuries to Zhang or any member of his\n\nfamily. There was no information on the purpose of the police raid\n\nor any reference to an arrest warrant or official proceedings.\n\nThere was no evidence of communication between Chinese officials\n\nand Zhang or any member of his family.\n\n           The BIA dismissed Zhang’s appeal, adopting the IJ’s\n\ndecision   in    part.         Without    reaching   the   IJ’s    credibility\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fdetermination,       it   held   that    “even   assuming   that   [Zhang]   was\n\ncredible, he has not met his burden of proving that he suffered\n\npast persecution or that he has a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution” for his asylum or withholding of removal claims.                   It\n\nnoted that Zhang conceded in his appellate brief that he had not\n\nsuffered past persecution.              It also noted that Zhang remained\n\nunharmed while living with his uncle and attending middle school;\n\nthe police raids of his home, when he was not there, were the only\n\nharm that came to him; he does not suggest that any Chinese\n\nofficials were looking for him; and his family remains safely in\n\nChina.\n\n                                 II.     ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review the BIA’s final order denying review under the\n\nsubstantial evidence standard; we consider the record as a whole\n\nand “reverse only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled\n\nto conclude to the contrary.”           El-Labaki v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 1, 4-\n\n5 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\nB.   Asylum Claim\n\n            To be eligible for asylum, an applicant must show that he\n\nis a “refugee,” which includes any person that is unable or\n\nunwilling to return to his home country because of a well-founded\n\nfear   of   future    persecution       based    on   religion.    8   U.S.C.    §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A).       To be well-founded, fear must be subjectively\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fgenuine and objectively reasonable .              Toloza-Jiminez v. Gonzales,\n\n457   F.3d    155,    161   (1st   Cir.    2005).     A   fear   is   objectively\n\nreasonable if “a reasonable person in the asylum applicant’s\n\ncircumstances would fear persecution.”               Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168\n\nF.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n              Zhang did not establish that he had a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution.         He did not show that he would be targeted\n\npersonally if returned to China; he had no personal encounter with\n\nthe police; there was no evidence that the police were looking for\n\nhim; he lived with his uncle for three years and went to school for\n\none semester without harm; and his parents, older brother, and\n\nolder sister still live and work in China and have not been harmed.\n\nSee Khem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir. 2003).                 He also did\n\nnot show that there was a pattern or practice of persecution of\n\npersons in similar circumstances in China.                 See id. at 54 n.2.\n\nAccording to the United States State Department 2005 Report on\n\nChina, although the government’s religious tolerance varies greatly\n\nin China, Protestantism is one of the five officially recognized\n\nreligions and is rapidly growing.               There is also no evidence that\n\nZhang’s      former   church   opposed      registration    with      the   Chinese\n\ngovernment, that similarly situated Christians were prohibited from\n\nworshiping in registered churches, or that Zhang was a member of a\n\ngroup subject to a pattern or practice of persecution.                 In sum, the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\frecord, considered as a whole, does not compel the conclusion that\n\nZhang has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nC.   Withholding of Removal\n\n           To be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant\n\nmust establish that it is “more likely than not” that his “life or\n\nfreedom would be threatened” in his home country because of a\n\nstatutorily   protected   ground   such   as   religion.   8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1).          The burden of proof for\n\nwithholding of removal is more stringent than that for asylum.\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nBecause Zhang failed to meet the burden of proof for his asylum\n\nclaim, he necessarily failed to meet the higher burden of proof for\n\nwithholding of removal.\n\nD.   Convention Against Torture Claim\n\n           Although Zhang applied for protection under the CAT, he\n\ndevoted his appellate brief exclusively to whether he established\n\npast persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nBecause he “failed to develop any argument supporting . . . his\n\nclaim for protection under CAT,” we deem this claim abandoned or\n\nwaived.   Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 n. 3 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    Moreover, because Zhang failed to raise his CAT claim at\n\nthe hearing before the IJ or argue error in the denial of his CAT\n\nclaim before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider it.          See\n\nBollanos v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 82, 87 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f                         III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, Zhang’s petition for review is\n\ndenied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",
