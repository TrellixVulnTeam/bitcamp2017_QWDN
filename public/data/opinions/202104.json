Before us are three interlocutory\n\nappeals arising from an action brought by B. Fernandez & Hnos.,\n\nInc. (BFH) and Caribbean Warehouse Logistics (CWL) (collectively,\n\nappellees) against Kellogg USA, Inc. (Kellogg USA).                  The appellees\n\naccuse Kellogg USA of violating Puerto Rico Law 75, a statute\n\nprohibiting a principal from terminating without just cause a\n\ndistribution agreement with its dealer.              P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, §\n\n278.      Appellees seek an injunction, damages, and declaratory\n\nrelief.        Federal   jurisdiction        is   premised      on   diversity   of\n\ncitizenship as appellees are Puerto Rico companies and Kellogg USA\n\nis a Michigan company.          See 28 U.S.C. § 1332.\n\n              The first appeal, by nonparty Kellogg Caribbean Services,\n\nInc. (Kellogg Caribbean), a Puerto Rico company, challenges the\n\ndenial of its motion to intervene under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a) and\n\nfor dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b).                  Pointing out that it\n\n(and    not   Kellogg    USA)    is    the   party   to   the    agreements    with\n\nappellees, Kellogg Caribbean argues that it is an indispensable\n\nparty    whose   intervention         must   be   allowed    but     would   destroy\n\ndiversity jurisdiction.          The district court denied the motion on\n\nthe ground that Kellogg USA, a company affiliated with Kellogg\n\nCaribbean because they share the same corporate parent company,\n\ncould adequately represent Kellogg Caribbean's interests.\n\n              The second and third appeals, by Kellogg USA and Kellogg\n\nCaribbean respectively, challenge a preliminary injunction ordering\n\nKellogg USA and its affiliates (which includes Kellogg Caribbean)\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fto   specifically perform the agreements with appellees.           We do not\n\nreach the merits of these appeals because our resolution of the\n\nintervention    appeal    requires   that   we   vacate    the   preliminary\n\ninjunction.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           We    derive   the   relevant    facts   primarily     from   the\n\nallegations and evidence submitted by Kellogg Caribbean in support\n\nof its motion to intervene but also consider uncontroverted facts\n\nestablished elsewhere in the record.             See Southwest Ctr. for\n\nBiological Diversity v. Berg, 268 F.3d 810, 819-20 (9th Cir. 2001)\n\n(stating that \"a district court is required to accept as true the\n\nnon-conclusory allegations made in support of an intervention\n\nmotion\") (collecting cases); 7C Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.\n\nMiller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1914, at 418\n\n(2d ed. 1986).\n\n           BFH, a Puerto Rico company, distributes Kellogg products\n\nto Puerto Rico retailers.       CWL, also a Puerto Rico company and an\n\naffiliate of BFH, provides logistical and warehousing services.\n\nKellogg USA, a Michigan company and subsidiary of nonparty Kellogg\n\nCompany, manufactures cereal products on the mainland United States\n\nfor export to certain geographic markets throughout the world.\n\nKellogg Caribbean, a Puerto Rico company, promotes, sells and\n\ndistributes Kellogg products in Puerto Rico.              Like Kellogg USA,\n\nKellogg Caribbean is a subsidiary of Kellogg Company.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f                In 1992, Kellogg USA signed an agreement to supply\n\nKellogg products to BFH for distribution to Puerto Rico retailers.\n\nSometime        thereafter,     Kellogg    USA    assigned   its     rights     and\n\nobligations under this agreement to Kellogg Caribbean.1\n\n                In October 2004, BFH and Kellogg Caribbean signed an\n\nInventory and Repurchase Agreement under which Kellogg Caribbean\n\nwould purchase the Kellogg products owned by BFH.                  The purpose of\n\nthe    repurchase      agreement   was    to    permit   Kellogg    Caribbean    to\n\nconsolidate its warehouse and administrative functions into one\n\nfacility.        Within this agreement, Kellogg Caribbean notified BFH\n\nthat       it   had   been    assigned    Kellogg   USA's    interest    in     the\n\ndistribution agreement. The agreement stated that the terms of the\n\ninitial Kellogg USA-BFH distribution agreement remained in \"full\n\nforce and effect.\"\n\n                After purchasing BFH's inventory, Kellogg Caribbean sold\n\nKellogg products to BFH for distribution to the Puerto Rico market.\n\nAs part of its consolidation effort, Kellogg Caribbean hired CWL,\n\nBFH's affiliate, to manage its warehouse operation.                  But Kellogg\n\nCaribbean and CWL did not sign a written agreement for these\n\nservices.\n\n                In November 2004, Kellogg Caribbean informed BFH that it\n\nwas exercising a provision in the distribution agreement entitling\n\nit to sell Kellogg \"Cereal in a Cup\" and \"Fruit Snacks\" products\n\n\n       1\n      Appellees dispute the effectiveness of this assignment, but,\nat this stage of the case, we accept the facts as pleaded by\nKellogg Caribbean. See supra at 4.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fdirectly to Puerto Rico retailers.          BFH would, however, remain the\n\ndistributor of other Kellogg products.\n\n            Displeased, BFH sued Kellogg USA claiming that it had\n\nviolated Law 75 by permitting \"it or its affiliates\" to sell\n\n\"Cereal in a Cup\" and \"Fruit Snacks\" directly to retailers.                   Five\n\nmonths     later,   Kellogg    Caribbean     notified     CWL    that    it    was\n\nterminating    their    warehouse     services    relationship.          Shortly\n\nthereafter, appellees amended the complaint to add a count by CWL\n\nalleging that Kellogg USA \"and/or its affiliates\" violated Law 75\n\nby terminating the warehouse services agreement.              Appellees sought\n\ndamages,    declaratory     relief,   and   a   preliminary      and    permanent\n\ninjunction.\n\n            Five days after appellees filed their amended complaint,\n\nKellogg Caribbean      moved \"to intervene and to dismiss for lack of\n\nan indispensable party.\"       In due course, the district court denied\n\nthe motion.     After an evidentiary hearing, the court entered a\n\npreliminary injunction requiring Kellogg USA \"and/or its affiliates\n\nor   subsidiaries\"     to   specifically    perform     the   agreements      with\n\nappellees pending trial.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            As mentioned above, federal jurisdiction is premised on\n\nthe diversity of citizenship between Kellogg USA (a Michigan\n\ncompany) and BFH and CWL (Puerto Rico companies).               But, if Kellogg\n\nCaribbean (a Puerto Rico company) is entitled to intervene as a\n\nmatter of right under Rule 24(a)(2) and is an indispensable party\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\funder Rule 19(b), the litigation must be dismissed because there\n\nwould not be complete diversity.          As Professors Wright, Miller and\n\nKane have explained:\n\n            A person who should have been joined in\n            the first instance because he is so\n            related to the action that he is regarded\n            as \"indispensable\" cannot intervene if his\n            joinder   will   deprive  the   court   of\n            jurisdiction over the subject matter of\n            the action. The action must be dismissed,\n            as Rule 19(b) requires, if the court\n            concludes that he is so related to the\n            action that he is indispensable. For this\n            reason the courts, in considering an\n            application for intervention by one whose\n            joinder would defeat diversity . . . will\n            examine his relation to the action and\n            [dismiss the action] if he . . . meets\n            the tests of Rule 24(a)(2) and . . . was\n            . . . an indispensable party to the\n            original action.\n\n7C Wright, Miller & Kane, supra § 1917, at 477-78; see also\n\nTravelers Indemnity Co. v. Dingwell, 884 F.2d 629, 636 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).     We begin by considering whether          Kellogg Caribbean meets\n\nthe requirements of Rule 24(a)(2).\n\n            A.          Rule 24(a)(2)\n\n            We review the denial of a Rule 24(a)(2) motion for abuse\n\nof discretion.         See Ewers v. Heron, 419 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nBut,     because   Rule     24(a)(2)    provides    explicit   criteria   for\n\nadjudicating       a    motion   to    intervene,   the   district   court's\n\ndiscretion is more circumscribed than in some other contexts.             See\n\nCotter v. Mass. Assoc. of Minority Law Enforcement Officers, 219\n\nF.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 2000).             We will reverse if the district\n\ncourt committed a legal error, or if the court reaches a decision\n\n                                        -7-\n\fpatently   out-of-step    with    the    purposes   of   Rule       24(a)(2).\n\nSee Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. v. Patch, 136 F.3d 197, 204 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n           Rule 24(a)(2) provides in pertinent part:\n\n           Upon timely application anyone shall be\n           permitted to intervene in an action . . .\n           when the applicant claims an interest\n           relating to the property or transaction\n           which is the subject of the action and the\n           applicant   is   so   situated   that   the\n           disposition of the action may as a\n           practical matter impair or impede the\n           applicant's   ability   to   protect   that\n           interest,     unless    the     applicant's\n           interest is adequately represented by\n           existing parties.\n\n\nA putative intervenor thus must show that (1) it timely moved to\n\nintervene; (2) it has an interest relating to the property or\n\ntransaction that forms the basis of the ongoing suit; (3) the\n\ndisposition   of   the   action   threatens    to   create      a    practical\n\nimpediment to its ability to protects its interest; and (4) no\n\nexisting party adequately represents its interests.2                See Patch,\n\n136 F.3d at 204.    \"The failure to satisfy [all four conditions]\n\ndooms intervention.\"     Id.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The requirements for a nonparty to intervene under Rule\n24(a)(2) are similar to the requirements for a named party to join\na nonparty as a \"person needed for just adjudication\" under Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 19(a)(2)(i). See 1966 Advisory Committee Notes to Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 24. Therefore, cases applying Rule 19(a)(2)(i) are\nhelpful in interpreting application of Rule 24(a)(2) and vice\nversa. See Pujol v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 877 F.2d 132, 135\n(1st Cir. 1989); 4 J. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice §\n19.02[5][c] (2005).\n\n                                   -8-\n\f            Because appellees concede that Kellogg Caribbean timely\n\nmoved to intervene, we first consider whether Kellogg Caribbean\n\nhas \"an interest relating to the property or transaction which is\n\nthe subject of the action.\"        Kellogg Caribbean easily meets this\n\nrequirement.      An intervenor has a sufficient interest in the\n\nsubject of the litigation where the intervenor's contractual\n\nrights may be affected by a proposed remedy.             See Forest Conserv.\n\nCouncil v. United States Forest Serv., 66 F.3d 1489, 1495 (9th\n\nCir. 1995); Harris v. Pernsley, 820 F.2d 592, 601 (3d Cir. 1987).\n\nHere,    appellees'     proposed   remedy     --   an   injunction   requiring\n\nspecific performance of the agreements             -- obviously would affect\n\nKellogg    Caribbean's     asserted     contractual       rights.      Kellogg\n\nCaribbean is the only Kellogg entity which is a party to these\n\nagreements   so   that    an   injunction     specifically      enforcing   the\n\nagreements would surely limit its opportunity to terminate or\n\nalter its future business relationship with appellees.3\n\n            This same rationale satisfies the requirement that\n\nKellogg Caribbean's interests, as a practical matter, may be\n\nimpaired    by   this   litigation.         Appellees    seek   an   injunction\n\nrequiring specific performance that could bind Kellogg Caribbean.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d); see generally 11A Wright, Miller &\n\nKane, supra § 2956 (discussing the circumstances in which a\n\n     3\n      Appellees claim that Kellogg Caribbean has no interest in\nBFH's claim because Kellogg USA's assignment of the distribution\nagreement to Kellogg Caribbean was ineffective. But, as mentioned\npreviously, we assume for purposes of this appeal that the\nassignment was effective. See supra at n.1.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fnonparty may be bound by an injunction).               Thus, this litigation\n\ncould result (and preliminarily has resulted) in an order directly\n\naffecting Kellogg Caribbean's contractual rights.                 This is more\n\nthan sufficient to satisfy the \"practical impediment\" requirement.\n\nSee Daggett v. Comm. on Governmental Ethics & Election Practices,\n\n172 F.3d 104, 110-11 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that the possibility\n\nthat   the    litigation     could   end   with   an   injunction    adversely\n\naffecting intervenors' interests was adequate to satisfy this\n\naspect of Rule 24(a)(2)).\n\n              This brings us to the district court's basis for denying\n\nintervention: that Kellogg Caribbean's interests are sufficiently\n\nrepresented by Kellogg USA.           In so ruling, the district court\n\nconcluded that, because Kellogg USA and Kellogg Caribbean are\n\nsubsidiaries of a common parent, there is a presumption that\n\nKellogg      USA    would   adequately     represent    Kellogg    Caribbean's\n\ninterests.         According to the district court, Kellogg Caribbean\n\ncould only rebut this presumption by showing that its interests\n\nwere somehow adverse to those of Kellogg USA, there was collusion\n\nbetween Kellogg USA and appellees, or Kellogg USA has committed\n\nnonfeasance in litigating the case. Because Kellogg Caribbean did\n\nnot make any of these showings, the court denied intervention.\n\n              Typically, an intervenor need only make a \"minimal\"\n\nshowing that the representation afforded by a named party would\n\nprove inadequate.        Trbovich v. United Mine Workers, 404 U.S. 528,\n\n538 n.10 (1972); see Patch, 136 F.3d at 207.               However, in cases\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fwhere the intervenor's ultimate objective matches that of the\n\nnamed party, a rebuttable presumption of adequate representation\n\napplies.    See Daggett, 172 F.3d at 111; Moosehead Sanitary Dist.\n\nv. S.G. Phillips Corp., 610 F.2d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 1979).                    We are\n\ndoubtful that this presumption should apply based solely on the\n\nfact that Kellogg Caribbean and Kellogg USA share the same parent\n\ncompany.    Cf. Pujol, 877 F.2d at 135 (stating that \"corporate\n\nalter ego status does not, by itself, mean that [the s]ubsidiary\"\n\nis automatically denied intervention).\n\n            But assuming arguendo that this presumption applies, we\n\nthink that the district court focused too narrowly when it ruled\n\nthat Kellogg Caribbean could only rebut the presumption by showing\n\nadversity   of   interest,       collusion,    or   nonfeasance.           We   have\n\nexplained that this trilogy of grounds for rebutting the adequate\n\nrepresentation presumption is only illustrative. See Daggett, 172\n\nF.3d at 111.     Indeed, we have stressed the case-specific nature\n\nof this inquiry, Maine v. United States Fish & Wildlife Serv., 262\n\nF.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 2001), and have discouraged district courts\n\nfrom   identifying    only   a    limited     number     of    \"cubbyholes\"     for\n\ninadequate representation claims, Mass. Food Assoc. v. Mass.\n\nAlcohol Beverages Control Comm., 197 F.3d 560, 567 n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n            Rather, to overcome the presumption, the intervenor need\n\nonly   offer   \"an   adequate     explanation       as   to    why\"   it   is   not\n\nsufficiently represented by the named party.                  Maine, 262 F.3d at\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f19.   One way for the intervenor to show inadequate representation\n\nis to demonstrate that its interests are sufficiently different\n\nin kind or degree from those of the named party.                    See United\n\nNuclear Corp. v. Cannon, 696 F.2d 141, 144 (1st Cir. 1982); Glancy\n\nv.    Taubman   Cts.,   Inc.,   373    F.3d    656,   675   (6th    Cir.   2004)\n\n(\"Asymmetry in the intensity . .          of interest can prevent a named\n\nparty from representing the interests of the absentee.\").\n\n              To support its inadequate representation claim, Kellogg\n\nCaribbean contends that the arguments it would emphasize are\n\ndifferent from those that Kellogg USA has pressed and will press.\n\nAccording to Kellogg Caribbean, Kellogg USA will stress that it\n\nis not a party to the agreements at issue and therefore cannot be\n\nheld liable for breaching those agreements under Law 75.4                     See\n\nGoya de P.R., Inc. v. Rowland Coffee Roasters, Inc., 206 F. Supp.\n\n2d 211, 218-19 (D.P.R. 2002) (holding that a manufacturer that\n\nassigns its interest in distribution contract is generally not\n\nliable under Law 75).           On the other hand, Kellogg Caribbean\n\ncontends, because it admits that it is a party to the agreements,\n\nit    would   defend    by   arguing    that   appellees'    allegations      of\n\nwrongdoing are unfounded.          In Kellogg Caribbean's view, this\n\ndifference in emphasis is sufficient to demonstrate that Kellogg\n\nUSA does not adequately represent its interests.\n\n              In assessing this argument, we observe first that,\n\n       4\n      This was Kellogg USA's lead argument                  in     response   to\nappellees' preliminary injunction motion.\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fbecause   of   the    potential   for   an   injunction   binding   Kellogg\n\nCaribbean's future dealings, Kellogg Caribbean has a tangible and\n\nsubstantial stake in the outcome of this case.             Because of this\n\ndirect    interest,    the   burden     on   Kellogg   Caribbean    to   show\n\ninadequate representation is lighter than if its interest was\n\n\"thin and widely shared.\"          Daggett, 172 F.3d at 113-14; see\n\nalso Virg. Sur. Co. v. Northrop Grumman Corp., 144 F.3d 1243, 1248\n\n(9th Cir. 1998) (concluding that a subsidiary was a necessary\n\nparty in a lawsuit against the parent because the litigation could\n\nresult in an injunction limiting the subsidiary's rights).\n\n            We recognize that there is nothing to prevent Kellogg\n\nUSA from defending this lawsuit by arguing that, even if it is a\n\nparty to the agreements, Kellogg Caribbean acted lawfully.               But,\n\nas we will explain, Kellogg Caribbean almost certainly has more\n\nto lose than Kellogg USA in this litigation -- at least insofar\n\nas appellees seek relief enjoining Kellogg Caribbean to perform\n\nunder the agreements.\n\n            According to Kellogg Caribbean's pleadings (which we\n\naccept as true, see supra at 4), Kellogg USA is not a party to the\n\nagreements, does not own or control Kellogg Caribbean, does no\n\nbusiness in Puerto Rico, and had no involvement in the events\n\nunderlying     appellees'    complaint.       Unlike   Kellogg   Caribbean,\n\nKellogg USA is unlikely to be harmed by an injunction ordering\n\nspecific performance of the agreements; after all, it no longer\n\nhas a business relationship with appellees.            See Tell v. Trustees\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fof Dartmouth Coll., 145 F.3d 417, 419 (1st Cir. 1998) (stating\n\nthat \"without a perfect identity of interests, a court must be\n\nvery cautious in concluding that a litigant will serve as a proxy\n\nfor an absent party\").         The potential for this litigation to have\n\na greater adverse impact on Kellogg Caribbean is a sufficient\n\nbasis for concluding that Kellogg USA may not serve as an adequate\n\nproxy.    See Nat. Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Rite Aid of S. Carolina,\n\nInc., 210 F.3d 246, 251 (4th Cir. 2000) (concluding that a parent\n\ncompany was a necessary party in a lawsuit against its subsidiary\n\nbecause the results of the litigation could have more serious\n\nfuture consequences for the parent); see also Southwest Ctr. for\n\nBiological Diversity, 268 F.3d at 824 (\"[I]t is not Applicants'\n\nburden at this stage in the litigation to anticipate specific\n\ndifferences in trial strategy.           It is sufficient for Applicants\n\nto show that, because of differences in interests, it is likely\n\nthat     Defendants     will     not   advance   the   same     arguments     as\n\nApplicants.\").\n\n            In sum, Kellogg Caribbean's attempt to overcome the\n\npresumption    of     adequate    representation     should   not    have   been\n\nlimited to showing adversity, collusion or nonfeasance.                Because\n\nthe injunctive relief sought would affect Kellogg Caribbean and\n\nbecause    \"there     is   sufficient    doubt   about    the    adequacy     of\n\nrepresentation to warrant intervention,\" Trbovich, 404 U.S. at\n\n538,     Kellogg    Caribbean      has   satisfied     the    Rule    24(a)(2)\n\nrequirements.\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f            B.       Rule 19(b)\n\n            Having concluded that Kellogg Caribbean meets the Rule\n\n24(a)(2)    requirements,     but     that   intervention     would   destroy\n\ncomplete diversity, we turn to whether Kellogg Caribbean is an\n\nindispensable party under Rule 19(b).            See supra at 7-8.       Rule\n\n19(b)   provides    that,   if   a   nonparty   is   deemed    necessary   to\n\nlitigation but joining that nonparty would deprive the court of\n\njurisdiction, the court should permit the action to proceed only\n\nto   the   extent   that    \"equity    and   good    conscience\"      warrant.\n\nProvident Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U.S. 102,\n\n109 (1968).      Four factors channel the analysis:\n\n            [F]irst to what extent a judgment rendered in\n            the person's absence might be prejudicial to\n            the person or those already parties; second,\n            the extent to which, by protective provisions\n            in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or\n            other measures, the prejudice can be lessened\n            or avoided; third, whether a judgment\n            rendered in the person's absence will be\n            adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will\n            have an adequate remedy if the action is\n            dismissed for nonjoinder.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 19(b).\n\n            We review Rule 19(b) determinations only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, see United States v. San Juan Bay Marina, 239 F.3d\n\n400, 403 (1st Cir. 2001), because such determinations involve\n\n\"the balancing of competing interests\" and \"must be steeped in\n\npragmatic considerations,\" Travelers, 884 F.2d at 635.                  Here,\n\nthe district court did not independently analyze the Rule 19(b)\n\nquestion due to the erroneous conclusion that Kellogg Caribbean\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fcould not intervene.           Because the district court is in the\n\n\"preferred position\" to make the Rule 19(b) determination, we\n\nthink that it should have the first opportunity to address the\n\nquestion.     Id.\n\n             That said, at least one thing is clear:                        Kellogg\n\nCaribbean      is    indispensable       insofar    as     appellees       seek    an\n\ninjunction that affects Kellogg Caribbean's interests under the\n\nagreements.        See, e.g., Acton Co. Inc. of Mass. v. Bachman Foods,\n\nInc., 668 F.2d 76, 81-82 (1st Cir. 1982) (stating that, in an\n\naction     seeking    recision      of   a   contract,     all   parties    to    the\n\ncontract and others having a substantial interest in it are\n\nindispensable parties); 7 Wright, Miller                 & Kane, supra § 1613,\n\nat   196    (\"[I]n    an   action    seeking     specific    performance      of    a\n\ncontract all persons who will be required to act to carry out a\n\ncourt      order    compelling      performance     have    been    held     to    be\n\nindispensable parties.\").           As discussed earlier, our conclusion\n\nthat Kellogg Caribbean meets Rule 24(a)(2)'s requirements was\n\ninfluenced by our concern that it could be enjoined to perform\n\nunder the agreements without being adequately represented.                        This\n\nanalysis also renders Kellogg Caribbean an indispensable party,\n\nat least to the extent that appellees seek specific performance.\n\nSee Acton, 668 F.2d at 81-82.\n\n             Nevertheless, there are multiple ways that the district\n\ncourt could resolve the Rule 19(b) question consistent with this\n\nlimitation.          For   example,      it     could    decide    that     Kellogg\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fCaribbean's involvement in the underlying dispute is so extensive\n\nthat it is indispensable to a proper adjudication of the case and\n\ntherefore dismiss the action entirely.   See H.D. Corp. of P.R. v.\n\nFord Motor Co., 791 F.2d 987, 993 (1st Cir. 1986); Freeman v.\n\nNorthwest Acceptance Corp., 754 F.2d 553, 559 (5th Cir. 1985).\n\nIt also could decide to retain jurisdiction and limit the relief\n\navailable to appellees.    See 7 Wright, Miller & Kane, supra §\n\n1608 at 107 (\"[W]hen rescission or specific performance might\n\nhave a detrimental impact on an absent person, money damages may\n\nprove to be an appropriate alternative.\").     We do not prejudge\n\nwhether one of these approaches, or perhaps another, provides a\n\nbetter avenue for accommodating the \"competing interests\" of the\n\nparties.\n\n           This rationale requires, however, that we vacate the\n\npreliminary injunction while the district court considers the\n\nRule 19(b) question.     This injunction, by its terms, requires\n\nthat Kellogg Caribbean (as an affiliate of Kellogg USA) perform\n\nunder the agreements while this litigation is pending.    As just\n\ndiscussed, this kind of relief cannot be granted consistent with\n\nRule 19(b) because it harms Kellogg Caribbean's legal interests.\n\n                               III.\n\n           For the reasons stated, we vacate the preliminary\n\ninjunction and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.   The parties shall bear their own costs.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f",

Fernandez &amp; Hnos., Inc. (BFH) and Caribbean Warehouse Logistics (CWL) (collectively, appellees) against Kellogg USA, Inc. (Kellogg USA). The appellees accuse Kellogg USA of violating Puerto Rico Law 75, a statute prohibiting a principal from terminating without just cause a distribution agreement with its dealer. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 278. Appellees seek an injunction, damages, and declaratory relief. Federal jurisdiction is premised on diversity of citizenship as appellees are Puerto Rico companies and Kellogg USA is a Michigan company. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first appeal, by nonparty Kellogg Caribbean Services, Inc. (Kellogg Caribbean), a Puerto Rico company, challenges the denial of its motion to intervene under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a) and for dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b). Pointing out that <i>it</i> (and not Kellogg USA) is the party to the agreements with appellees, Kellogg Caribbean argues that it is an indispensable party whose intervention must be allowed but would destroy diversity jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion on the ground that Kellogg USA, a company affiliated with Kellogg Caribbean because they share the same corporate parent company, could adequately represent Kellogg Caribbean's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and third appeals, by Kellogg USA and Kellogg Caribbean respectively, challenge a preliminary injunction ordering Kellogg USA and its affiliates (which includes Kellogg Caribbean) to specifically perform the agreements with appellees. We do not reach the merits of these appeals because our resolution of the intervention appeal requires that we vacate the preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We derive the relevant facts primarily from the allegations and evidence submitted by Kellogg Caribbean in support of its motion to intervene but also consider uncontroverted facts established elsewhere in the record. <i>See Southwest Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Berg,</i> 268 F.3d 810, 819-20 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that \"a district court is required to accept as true the nonconclusory allegations made in support of an intervention motion\") (collecting cases); 7C Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

CWL, also a Puerto Rico company and an affiliate of BFH, provides logistical and warehousing services. Kellogg USA, a Michigan company and subsidiary of nonparty Kellogg Company, manufactures cereal products on the mainland United States for export to certain geographic markets throughout the world. Kellogg Caribbean, a Puerto Rico company, promotes, sells and distributes Kellogg products in Puerto Rico. Like Kellogg USA, Kellogg Caribbean is a subsidiary of Kellogg Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, Kellogg USA signed an agreement to supply Kellogg products to BFH for distribution to Puerto Rico retailers. Sometime thereafter, Kellogg USA assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to Kellogg Caribbean.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2004, BFH and Kellogg Caribbean signed an Inventory and Repurchase Agreement under which Kellogg Caribbean would purchase the Kellogg products owned by BFH. The purpose of the repurchase agreement was to permit Kellogg Caribbean to consolidate its warehouse and administrative functions into one facility. Within this agreement, Kellogg Caribbean notified BFH that it had been assigned Kellogg USA's interest in the distribution agreement. The agreement stated that the terms of the initial Kellogg USA-BFH distribution agreement remained in \"full force and effect.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After purchasing BFH's inventory, Kellogg Caribbean sold Kellogg products to BFH for distribution to the Puerto Rico market. As part of its consolidation effort, Kellogg Caribbean hired CWL, BFH's affiliate, to manage its warehouse operation. But Kellogg Caribbean and CWL did not sign a written agreement for these services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2004, Kellogg Caribbean informed BFH that it was exercising a provision in the distribution agreement entitling it to sell Kellogg \"Cereal in a Cup\" and \"Fruit Snacks\" products directly to Puerto Rico retailers. BFH would, however, remain the distributor of other Kellogg products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Displeased, BFH sued Kellogg USA claiming that it had violated Law 75 by permitting \"it or its affiliates\" to sell \"Cereal in a Cup\" and \"Fruit Snacks\" directly to retailers. Five months later, Kellogg Caribbean notified CWL that it was terminating their warehouse services relationship. Shortly thereafter, appellees amended the complaint to add a count by CWL alleging that Kellogg USA \"and/or its affiliates\" violated Law 75 by terminating the warehouse services agreement. Appellees sought damages, declaratory relief, and a preliminary and permanent injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five days after appellees filed their amended complaint, Kellogg Caribbean moved \"to intervene and to dismiss for lack of an indispensable party.\" In due course, the district court denied the motion. After an evidentiary hearing, the court entered a preliminary injunction requiring Kellogg USA \"and/or its affiliates or subsidiaries\" to specifically perform the agreements with appellees pending trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned above, federal jurisdiction is premised on the diversity of citizenship between Kellogg USA (a Michigan company) and BFH and CWL (Puerto Rico companies). But, if Kellogg Caribbean (a Puerto Rico company) is entitled to intervene as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2) and is an indispensable party under Rule 19(b), the litigation must be dismissed because there would not be complete diversity. As Professors Wright, Miller and Kane have explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person who should have been joined in the first instance because he is so related to the action that he is regarded as \"indispensable\" cannot intervene if his joinder will deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action. The action must be dismissed, as Rule 19(b) requires, if the court concludes that he is so related to the action that he is indispensable. For this reason the courts, in considering an application for intervention by one whose joinder would defeat diversity ... will examine his relation to the action and [dismiss the action] if he ... meets the tests of Rule 24(a)(2) and ... was ... an indispensable party to the original action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7C Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> &#167; 1917, at 477-78; <i>see also Travelers Indemnity Co. v.

Rule 24(a)(2)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a Rule 24(a)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <i>See Ewers v. Heron,</i> 419 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2005). But, because Rule 24(a)(2) provides explicit criteria for adjudicating a motion to intervene, the district court's discretion is more circumscribed than in some other contexts. <i>See Cotter v. Mass. Assoc. of Minority Law Enforcement Officers,</i> 219 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir.2000). We will reverse if the district court committed a legal error, or if the court reaches a decision patently out-of-step with the purposes of Rule 24(a)(2). <i>See Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. v. Patch,</i> 136 F.3d 197, 204 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 24(a)(2) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action ... when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A putative intervenor thus must show that (1) it timely moved to intervene; (2) it has an interest relating to the property or transaction that forms the basis of the ongoing suit; (3) the disposition of the action threatens to create a practical impediment to its ability to protects its interest; and (4) no existing party adequately represents its interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Patch,</i> 136 F.3d at 204. \"The failure to satisfy [all four conditions] dooms intervention.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellees concede that Kellogg Caribbean timely moved to intervene, we first consider whether Kellogg Caribbean has \"an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action.\" Kellogg Caribbean easily meets this requirement. An intervenor has a sufficient interest in the subject of the litigation where the intervenor's contractual rights may be affected by a proposed remedy. <i>See Forest Conserv. Council v. United States Forest Serv.,</i> 66 F.3d 1489, 1495 (9th Cir.1995); <i>Harris v. Pernsley,</i> 820 F.2d 592, 601 (3d Cir.1987). Here, appellees' proposed remedy &#8212; an injunction requiring specific performance of the agreements &#8212; obviously would affect Kellogg Caribbean's asserted contractual rights. Kellogg Caribbean is the <i>only</i> Kellogg entity which is a party to these agreements so that an injunction specifically enforcing the agreements would surely limit its opportunity to terminate or alter its future business relationship with appellees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This same rationale satisfies the requirement that Kellogg Caribbean's interests, as a practical matter, may be impaired by this litigation. Appellees seek an injunction requiring specific performance that could bind Kellogg Caribbean. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 65(d); <i>see generally</i> 11A Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2956 (discussing the circumstances in which a nonparty may be bound by an injunction). Thus, this litigation could result (and preliminarily has resulted) in an order directly affecting Kellogg Caribbean's contractual rights. This is more than sufficient to satisfy the \"practical impediment\" requirement. <i>See Daggett v. Comm. on Governmental Ethics &amp; Election Practices,</i> 172 F.3d 104, 110-11 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that the possibility that the litigation could end with an injunction adversely affecting intervenors' interests was adequate to satisfy this aspect of Rule 24(a)(2)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the district court's basis for denying intervention: that Kellogg Caribbean's interests are sufficiently represented by Kellogg USA. In so ruling, the district court concluded that, because Kellogg USA and Kellogg Caribbean are subsidiaries of a common parent, there is a presumption that Kellogg USA would adequately represent Kellogg Caribbean's interests. According to the district court, Kellogg Caribbean could only rebut this presumption by showing that its interests were somehow adverse to those of Kellogg USA, there was collusion between Kellogg USA and appellees, or Kellogg USA has committed nonfeasance in litigating the case. Because Kellogg Caribbean did not make any of these showings, the court denied intervention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, an intervenor need only make a \"minimal\" showing that the representation afforded by a named party would prove inadequate. <i>Trbovich v. United Mine Workers,</i> 404 U.S. 528, 538 n. 10, 92 S.Ct. 630, 30 L.Ed.2d 686 (1972); <i>see Patch,</i> 136 F.3d at 207. However, in cases where the intervenor's ultimate objective matches that of the named party, a rebuttable presumption of adequate representation applies. <i>See Daggett,</i> 172 F.3d at 111; <i>Moosehead Sanitary Dist. v. S.G. Phillips Corp.,</i> 610 F.2d 49, 54 (1st Cir.1979). We are doubtful that this presumption should apply based solely on the fact that Kellogg Caribbean and Kellogg USA share the same parent company. <i>Cf. Pujol,</i> 877 F.2d at 135 (stating that \"corporate alter ego status does not, <i>by itself,</i> mean that [the s]ubsidiary\" is automatically denied intervention).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But assuming arguendo that this presumption applies, we think that the district court focused too narrowly when it ruled that Kellogg Caribbean could only rebut the presumption by showing adversity of interest, collusion, or nonfeasance. We have explained that this trilogy of grounds for rebutting the adequate representation presumption is only illustrative. <i>See Daggett,</i> 172 F.3d at 111. Indeed, we have stressed the case-specific nature of this inquiry, <i>Maine v. United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Serv.,</i> 262 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 2001), and have discouraged district courts from identifying only a limited number of \"cubbyholes\" for inadequate representation claims, <i>Mass. Food Assoc. v. Mass. Alcohol Beverages Control Comm.,</i> 197 F.3d 560, 567 n. 5 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, to overcome the presumption, the intervenor need only offer \"an adequate explanation as to why\" it is not sufficiently represented by the named party. <i>Maine,</i> 262 F.3d at 19. One way for the intervenor to show inadequate representation is to demonstrate that its interests are sufficiently different in kind or degree from those of the named party. <i>See United Nuclear Corp. v. Cannon,</i> 696 F.2d 141, 144 (1st Cir.1982); <i>Glancy v. Taubman Cts., Inc.,</i> 373 F.3d 656, 675 (6th Cir.2004) (\"Asymmetry in the intensity ... of interest can prevent a named party from representing the interests of the absentee.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support its inadequate representation claim, Kellogg Caribbean contends that the arguments it would emphasize are different from those that Kellogg USA has pressed and will press. According to Kellogg Caribbean, Kellogg USA will stress that it is not a party to the agreements at issue and therefore cannot be held liable for breaching those agreements under Law 75.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Goya de P.R., Inc. v. Rowland,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d 211, 218-19 (D.P.R. 2002) (holding that a manufacturer that assigns its interest in distribution contract is generally not liable under Law 75). On the other hand, Kellogg Caribbean contends, because it admits that it is a party to the agreements, it would defend by arguing that appellees' allegations of wrongdoing are unfounded. In Kellogg Caribbean's view, this difference in emphasis is sufficient to demonstrate that Kellogg USA does not adequately represent its interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing this argument, we observe first that, because of the potential for an injunction binding Kellogg Caribbean's future dealings, Kellogg Caribbean has a tangible and substantial stake in the outcome of this case. Because of this direct interest, the burden on Kellogg Caribbean to show inadequate representation is lighter than if its interest was \"thin and widely shared.\" <i>Daggett,</i> 172 F.3d at 113-14; <i>see also Virg. Sur. Co. v. Northrop Grumman Corp.,</i> 144 F.3d 1243, 1248 (9th Cir.1998) (concluding that a subsidiary was a necessary party in a lawsuit against the parent because the litigation could result in an injunction limiting the subsidiary's rights).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that there is nothing to prevent Kellogg USA from defending this lawsuit by arguing that, even if it is a party to the agreements, Kellogg Caribbean acted lawfully. But, as we will explain, Kellogg Caribbean almost certainly has more to lose than Kellogg USA in this litigation &#8212; at least insofar as appellees seek relief enjoining Kellogg Caribbean to perform under the agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Kellogg Caribbean's pleadings (which we accept as true, <i>see supra</i> at 4), Kellogg USA is not a party to the agreements, does not own or control Kellogg Caribbean, does no business in Puerto Rico, and had no involvement in the events underlying appellees' complaint. Unlike Kellogg Caribbean, Kellogg USA is unlikely to be harmed by an injunction ordering specific performance of the agreements; after all, it no longer has a business relationship with appellees. <i>See Tell v. Trustees of Dartmouth Coll.,</i> 145 F.3d 417, 419 (1st Cir.1998) (stating that \"without a perfect identity of interests, a court must be very cautious in concluding that a litigant will serve as a proxy for an absent party\"). The potential for this litigation to have a greater adverse impact on Kellogg Caribbean is a sufficient basis for concluding that Kellogg USA may not serve as an adequate proxy. <i>See Nat. Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Rite Aid of S. Carolina, Inc.,</i> 210 F.3d 246, 251 (4th Cir.2000) (concluding that a parent company was a necessary party in a lawsuit against its subsidiary because the results of the litigation could have more serious future consequences for the parent); <i>see also Southwest Ctr. for Biological Diversity,</i> 268 F.3d at 824 (\"[I]t is not Applicants' burden at this stage in the litigation to anticipate specific differences in trial strategy. It is sufficient for Applicants to show that, because of differences in interests, it is likely that Defendants will not advance the same arguments as Applicants.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Kellogg Caribbean's attempt to overcome the presumption of adequate representation should not have been limited to showing adversity, collusion or nonfeasance. Because the injunctive relief sought would affect Kellogg Caribbean and because \"there is sufficient doubt about the adequacy of representation to warrant intervention,\" <i>Trbovich,</i> 404 U.S. at 538, 92 S.Ct. 630, Kellogg Caribbean has satisfied the Rule 24(a)(2) requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Rule 19(b)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that Kellogg Caribbean meets the Rule 24(a)(2) requirements, but that intervention would destroy complete diversity, we turn to whether Kellogg Caribbean is an indispensable party under Rule 19(b). <i>See supra</i> at 7-8. Rule 19(b) provides that, if a nonparty is deemed necessary to litigation but joining that nonparty would deprive the court of jurisdiction, the court should permit the action to proceed only to the extent that \"equity and good conscience\" warrant. <i>Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson,</i> 390 U.S. 102, 109, 88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968). Four factors channel the analysis:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[F]irst to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review Rule 19(b) determinations only for abuse of discretion, <i>see United</i> <i>States v. San Juan Bay Marina,</i> 239 F.3d 400, 403 (1st Cir.2001), because such determinations involve \"the balancing of competing interests\" and \"must be steeped in pragmatic considerations,\" <i>Travelers,</i> 884 F.2d at 635. Here, the district court did not independently analyze the Rule 19(b) question due to the erroneous conclusion that Kellogg Caribbean could not intervene. Because the district court is in the \"preferred position\" to make the Rule 19(b) determination, we think that it should have the first opportunity to address the question. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, at least one thing is clear: Kellogg Caribbean is indispensable insofar as appellees seek an injunction that affects Kellogg Caribbean's interests under the agreements. <i>See, e.g., Acton Co. Inc. of Mass. v. Bachman Foods, Inc.,</i> 668 F.2d 76, 81-82 (1st Cir.1982) (stating that, in an action seeking recision of a contract, all parties to the contract and others having a substantial interest in it are indispensable parties); 7 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> &#167; 1613, at 196 (\"[I]n an action seeking specific performance of a contract all persons who will be required to act to carry out a court order compelling performance have been held to be indispensable parties.\"). As discussed earlier, our conclusion that Kellogg Caribbean meets Rule 24(a)(2)'s requirements was influenced by our concern that it could be enjoined to perform under the agreements without being adequately represented. This analysis also renders Kellogg Caribbean an indispensable party, at least to the extent that appellees seek specific performance. <i>See Acton,</i> 668 F.2d at 81-82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, there are multiple ways that the district court could resolve the Rule 19(b) question consistent with this limitation. For example, it could decide that Kellogg Caribbean's involvement in the underlying dispute is so extensive that it is indispensable to a proper adjudication of the case and therefore dismiss the action entirely. <i>See H.D. Corp. of P.R. v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 791 F.2d 987, 993 (1st Cir.1986); <i>Freeman v. Northwest Acceptance Corp.,</i> 754 F.2d 553, 559 (5th Cir. 1985). It also could decide to retain jurisdiction and limit the relief available to appellees. <i>See</i> 7 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> &#167; 1608 at 107 (\"[W]hen rescission or specific performance might have a detrimental impact on an absent person, money damages may prove to be an appropriate alternative.\"). We do not prejudge whether one of these approaches, or perhaps another, provides a better avenue for accommodating the \"competing interests\" of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rationale requires, however, that we vacate the preliminary injunction while the district court considers the Rule 19(b) question. This injunction, by its terms, requires that Kellogg Caribbean (as an affiliate of Kellogg USA) perform under the agreements while this litigation is pending. As just discussed, this kind of relief cannot be granted consistent with Rule 19(b) because it harms Kellogg Caribbean's legal interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we <i>vacate</i> the preliminary injunction and <i>remand</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Fernandez &amp; Hnos., Inc. (BFH) and Caribbean Warehouse Logistics (CWL) (collectively, appellees) against Kellogg USA, Inc. (Kellogg USA). The appellees accuse Kellogg USA of violating Puerto Rico Law 75, a statute prohibiting a principal from terminating without just cause a distribution agreement with its dealer. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 278. Appellees seek an injunction, damages, and declaratory relief. Federal jurisdiction is premised on diversity of citizenship as appellees are Puerto Rico companies and Kellogg USA is a Michigan company. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first appeal, by nonparty Kellogg Caribbean Services, Inc. (Kellogg Caribbean), a Puerto Rico company, challenges the denial of its motion to intervene under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a) and for dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b). Pointing out that <i>it</i> (and not Kellogg USA) is the party to the agreements with appellees, Kellogg Caribbean argues that it is an indispensable party whose intervention must be allowed but would destroy diversity jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion on the ground that Kellogg USA, a company affiliated with Kellogg Caribbean because they share the same corporate parent company, could adequately represent Kellogg Caribbean's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and third appeals, by Kellogg USA and Kellogg Caribbean respectively, challenge a preliminary injunction ordering Kellogg USA and its affiliates (which includes Kellogg Caribbean) to specifically perform the agreements with appellees.

CWL, also a Puerto Rico company and an affiliate of BFH, provides logistical and warehousing services. Kellogg USA, a Michigan company and subsidiary of nonparty Kellogg Company, manufactures cereal products on the mainland United States for export to certain geographic markets throughout the world. Kellogg Caribbean, a Puerto Rico company, promotes, sells and distributes Kellogg products in Puerto Rico. Like Kellogg USA, Kellogg Caribbean is a subsidiary of Kellogg Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, Kellogg USA signed an agreement to supply Kellogg products to BFH for distribution to Puerto Rico retailers. Sometime thereafter, Kellogg USA assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to Kellogg Caribbean.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2004, BFH and Kellogg Caribbean signed an Inventory and Repurchase Agreement under which Kellogg Caribbean would purchase the Kellogg products owned by BFH. The purpose of the repurchase agreement was to permit Kellogg Caribbean to consolidate its warehouse and administrative functions into one facility. Within this agreement, Kellogg Caribbean notified BFH that it had been assigned Kellogg USA's interest in the distribution agreement. The agreement stated that the terms of the initial Kellogg USA-BFH distribution agreement remained in \"full force and effect.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After purchasing BFH's inventory, Kellogg Caribbean sold Kellogg products to BFH for distribution to the Puerto Rico market. As part of its consolidation effort, Kellogg Caribbean hired CWL, BFH's affiliate, to manage its warehouse operation. But Kellogg Caribbean and CWL did not sign a written agreement for these services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2004, Kellogg Caribbean informed BFH that it was exercising a provision in the distribution agreement entitling it to sell Kellogg \"Cereal in a Cup\" and \"Fruit Snacks\" products directly to Puerto Rico retailers. BFH would, however, remain the distributor of other Kellogg products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Displeased, BFH sued Kellogg USA claiming that it had violated Law 75 by permitting \"it or its affiliates\" to sell \"Cereal in a Cup\" and \"Fruit Snacks\" directly to retailers. Five months later, Kellogg Caribbean notified CWL that it was terminating their warehouse services relationship. Shortly thereafter, appellees amended the complaint to add a count by CWL alleging that Kellogg USA \"and/or its affiliates\" violated Law 75 by terminating the warehouse services agreement. Appellees sought damages, declaratory relief, and a preliminary and permanent injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five days after appellees filed their amended complaint, Kellogg Caribbean moved \"to intervene and to dismiss for lack of an indispensable party.\" In due course, the district court denied the motion. After an evidentiary hearing, the court entered a preliminary injunction requiring Kellogg USA \"and/or its affiliates or subsidiaries\" to specifically perform the agreements with appellees pending trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned above, federal jurisdiction is premised on the diversity of citizenship between Kellogg USA (a Michigan company) and BFH and CWL (Puerto Rico companies). But, if Kellogg Caribbean (a Puerto Rico company) is entitled to intervene as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2) and is an indispensable party under Rule 19(b), the litigation must be dismissed because there would not be complete diversity. As Professors Wright, Miller and Kane have explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person who should have been joined in the first instance because he is so related to the action that he is regarded as \"indispensable\" cannot intervene if his joinder will deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action. The action must be dismissed, as Rule 19(b) requires, if the court concludes that he is so related to the action that he is indispensable. For this reason the courts, in considering an application for intervention by one whose joinder would defeat diversity ... will examine his relation to the action and [dismiss the action] if he ... meets the tests of Rule 24(a)(2) and ... was ... an indispensable party to the original action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7C Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> &#167; 1917, at 477-78; <i>see also Travelers Indemnity Co. v.

But, because Rule 24(a)(2) provides explicit criteria for adjudicating a motion to intervene, the district court's discretion is more circumscribed than in some other contexts. <i>See Cotter v. Mass.

An intervenor has a sufficient interest in the subject of the litigation where the intervenor's contractual rights may be affected by a proposed remedy. <i>See Forest Conserv. Council v. United States Forest Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705179\"><a href=\"/opinion/705179/forest-conservation-council-maricopa-audubon-society-carlson-forest-watch/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1489</span></a></span>, 1495 (9th Cir.1995); <i>Harris v.

Here, appellees' proposed remedy &#8212; an injunction requiring specific performance of the agreements &#8212; obviously would affect Kellogg Caribbean's asserted contractual rights. Kellogg Caribbean is the <i>only</i> Kellogg entity which is a party to these agreements so that an injunction specifically enforcing the agreements would surely limit its opportunity to terminate or alter its future business relationship with appellees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This same rationale satisfies the requirement that Kellogg Caribbean's interests, as a practical matter, may be impaired by this litigation. Appellees seek an injunction requiring specific performance that could bind Kellogg Caribbean. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 65(d); <i>see generally</i> 11A Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2956 (discussing the circumstances in which a nonparty may be bound by an injunction). Thus, this litigation could result (and preliminarily has resulted) in an order directly affecting Kellogg Caribbean's contractual rights. This is more than sufficient to satisfy the \"practical impediment\" requirement. <i>See Daggett v. Comm. on Governmental Ethics &amp; Election Practices,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198424\"><a href=\"/opinion/198424/daggett-v-commission-on-govt/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 110-11 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that the possibility that the litigation could end with an injunction adversely affecting intervenors' interests was adequate to satisfy this aspect of Rule 24(a)(2)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the district court's basis for denying intervention: that Kellogg Caribbean's interests are sufficiently represented by Kellogg USA. In so ruling, the district court concluded that, because Kellogg USA and Kellogg Caribbean are subsidiaries of a common parent, there is a presumption that Kellogg USA would adequately represent Kellogg Caribbean's interests. According to the district court, Kellogg Caribbean could only rebut this presumption by showing that its interests were somehow adverse to those of Kellogg USA, there was collusion between Kellogg USA and appellees, or Kellogg USA has committed nonfeasance in litigating the case. Because Kellogg Caribbean did not make any of these showings, the court denied intervention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, an intervenor need only make a \"minimal\" showing that the representation afforded by a named party would prove inadequate. <i>Trbovich v. United Mine Workers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108434\"><a href=\"/opinion/108434/trbovich-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, 538 n. 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108434\"><a href=\"/opinion/108434/trbovich-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span> (1972); <i>see Patch,</i> 136 F.3d at 207. However, in cases where the intervenor's ultimate objective matches that of the named party, a rebuttable presumption of adequate representation applies. <i>See Daggett,</i> 172 F.3d at 111; <i>Moosehead Sanitary Dist. v. S.G. Phillips Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"371954\"><a href=\"/opinion/371954/the-moosehead-sanitary-district-v-s-g-phillips-corporation-etc-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.1979). We are doubtful that this presumption should apply based solely on the fact that Kellogg Caribbean and Kellogg USA share the same parent company. <i>Cf. Pujol,</i> 877 F.2d at 135 (stating that \"corporate alter ego status does not, <i>by itself,</i> mean that [the s]ubsidiary\" is automatically denied intervention).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But assuming arguendo that this presumption applies, we think that the district court focused too narrowly when it ruled that Kellogg Caribbean could only rebut the presumption by showing adversity of interest, collusion, or nonfeasance. We have explained that this trilogy of grounds for rebutting the adequate representation presumption is only illustrative. <i>See Daggett,</i> 172 F.3d at 111. Indeed, we have stressed the case-specific nature of this inquiry, <i>Maine v. United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199621\"><a href=\"/opinion/199621/state-of-maine-v-us-fish-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir. 2001), and have discouraged district courts from identifying only a limited number of \"cubbyholes\" for inadequate representation claims, <i>Mass.

Alcohol Beverages Control Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198729\"><a href=\"/opinion/198729/food-association-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span>, 567 n. 5 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, to overcome the presumption, the intervenor need only offer \"an adequate explanation as to why\" it is not sufficiently represented by the named party. <i>Maine,</i> 262 F.3d at 19. One way for the intervenor to show inadequate representation is to demonstrate that its interests are sufficiently different in kind or degree from those of the named party. <i>See United Nuclear Corp. v.

According to Kellogg Caribbean, Kellogg USA will stress that it is not a party to the agreements at issue and therefore cannot be held liable for breaching those agreements under Law 75.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Goya de P.R., Inc. v. Rowland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2433349\"><a href=\"/opinion/2433349/goya-de-puerto-rico-inc-v-rowland-coffee/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

On the other hand, Kellogg Caribbean contends, because it admits that it is a party to the agreements, it would defend by arguing that appellees' allegations of wrongdoing are unfounded. In Kellogg Caribbean's view, this difference in emphasis is sufficient to demonstrate that Kellogg USA does not adequately represent its interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing this argument, we observe first that, because of the potential for an injunction binding Kellogg Caribbean's future dealings, Kellogg Caribbean has a tangible and substantial stake in the outcome of this case. Because of this direct interest, the burden on Kellogg Caribbean to show inadequate representation is lighter than if its interest was \"thin and widely shared.\" <i>Daggett,</i> 172 F.3d at 113-14; <i>see also Virg. Sur. Co. v.

But, as we will explain, Kellogg Caribbean almost certainly has more to lose than Kellogg USA in this litigation &#8212; at least insofar as appellees seek relief enjoining Kellogg Caribbean to perform under the agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Kellogg Caribbean's pleadings (which we accept as true, <i>see supra</i> at 4), Kellogg USA is not a party to the agreements, does not own or control Kellogg Caribbean, does no business in Puerto Rico, and had no involvement in the events underlying appellees' complaint. Unlike Kellogg Caribbean, Kellogg USA is unlikely to be harmed by an injunction ordering specific performance of the agreements; after all, it no longer has a business relationship with appellees. <i>See Tell v. Trustees of Dartmouth Coll.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197979\"><a href=\"/opinion/197979/tell-v-dartmouth-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 419 (1st Cir.1998) (stating that \"without a perfect identity of interests, a court must be very cautious in concluding that a litigant will serve as a proxy for an absent party\"). The potential for this litigation to have a greater adverse impact on Kellogg Caribbean is a sufficient basis for concluding that Kellogg USA may not serve as an adequate proxy. <i>See Nat. Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Rite Aid of S.

Because the injunctive relief sought would affect Kellogg Caribbean and because \"there is sufficient doubt about the adequacy of representation to warrant intervention,\" <i>Trbovich,</i> 404 U.S. at 538, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108434\"><a href=\"/opinion/108434/trbovich-v-mine-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rule 19(b) provides that, if a nonparty is deemed necessary to litigation but joining that nonparty would deprive the court of jurisdiction, the court should permit the action to proceed only to the extent that \"equity and good conscience\" warrant. <i>Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

Here, the district court did not independently analyze the Rule 19(b) question due to the erroneous conclusion that Kellogg Caribbean could not intervene. Because the district court is in the \"preferred position\" to make the Rule 19(b) determination, we think that it should have the first opportunity to address the question. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, at least one thing is clear: Kellogg Caribbean is indispensable insofar as appellees seek an injunction that affects Kellogg Caribbean's interests under the agreements. <i>See, e.g., Acton Co. Inc. of Mass. v. Bachman Foods, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398646\"><a href=\"/opinion/398646/acton-co-inc-of-massachusetts-v-bachman-foods-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 81-82 (1st Cir.1982) (stating that, in an action seeking recision of a contract, all parties to the contract and others having a substantial interest in it are indispensable parties); 7 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> &#167; 1613, at 196 (\"[I]n an action seeking specific performance of a contract all persons who will be required to act to carry out a court order compelling performance have been held to be indispensable parties.\"). As discussed earlier, our conclusion that Kellogg Caribbean meets Rule 24(a)(2)'s requirements was influenced by our concern that it could be enjoined to perform under the agreements without being adequately represented. This analysis also renders Kellogg Caribbean an indispensable party, at least to the extent that appellees seek specific performance. <i>See Acton,</i> 668 F.2d at 81-82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, there are multiple ways that the district court could resolve the Rule 19(b) question consistent with this limitation. For example, it could decide that Kellogg Caribbean's involvement in the underlying dispute is so extensive that it is indispensable to a proper adjudication of the case and therefore dismiss the action entirely. <i>See H.D.

It also could decide to retain jurisdiction and limit the relief available to appellees. <i>See</i> 7 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> &#167; 1608 at 107 (\"[W]hen rescission or specific performance might have a detrimental impact on an absent person, money damages may prove to be an appropriate alternative.\").

This injunction, by its terms, requires that Kellogg Caribbean (as an affiliate of Kellogg USA) perform under the agreements while this litigation is pending.
