Stephen P.

We affirm the\n\ndistrict court order.\n\n                                          I\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n            In 1942, with congressional approval, fifteen Atlantic\n\ncoast states, as well as the District of Columbia, entered into a\n\ncompact pursuant to which the signatories would exercise joint\n\nregulatory oversight of their fisheries (viz., the area within\n\nthree miles of their respective shorelines), primarily through the\n\ndevelopment of interstate fishery management plans (\"IFMPs\"). Each\n\nsignatory is represented on the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries\n\nCommission (ASMFC).      16 U.S.C. § 5102(3).\n\n            Until 1993, the decision to participate in any IFMP was\n\nentirely voluntary. As compliance was spotty, Congress enacted the\n\nAtlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act, 16 U.S.C. §§\n\n5101-5108    (1993)    (\"ACFCMA\"),    which       permits   the   ASMFC   (i)   to\n\nidentify     which    IFMP   terms   it       considers   “necessary,”    id.   §\n\n5104(a)(1), and (ii) to require that all member states adopt and\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcomply with these terms. Id. § 5101(a)(4) (“The responsibility for\n\nmanaging Atlantic coastal fisheries rests with the States, which\n\ncarry out a cooperative program of fishery oversight and management\n\nthrough the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. It is the\n\nresponsibility    of   the   Federal     Government      to   support      such\n\ncooperative interstate management of coastal fishery resources.”).\n\nShould a member refuse to comply, the ASMFC may contact the\n\nSecretary   of   Commerce,   id.   §   5105(b),    who   makes   a   plenary\n\ndetermination as to whether (i) the particular IFMP term is indeed\n\n“necessary,” and (ii) the member state is in noncompliance.               Id. §\n\n5106(a).    Should the Secretary determine that the member state is\n\nnot complying with an essential term, a moratorium on fishing may\n\nbe imposed in the offending member state’s coastal waters.                Id. §\n\n5106(c).\n\n            Approximately four-fifths of all Atlantic lobsters are\n\nharvested within the territorial waters of the Atlantic states\n\n(viz., within three miles of the shoreline), and an even greater\n\npercentage by means of lobster traps.        A small percentage –           for\n\nexample, in Rhode Island, 1.62 percent – is harvested by trawling\n\nand   netting.    In   December    1997,   ASMFC   promulgated       an    IFMP\n\ncontaining Amendment 3, after acquiring evidence suggesting that,\n\ndespite years of heavy regulatory oversight, the Atlantic lobster\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fpopulation was still being overfished.1      \"Overfishing\" is defined\n\nas \"a rate or level of fishing mortality that jeopardizes the\n\ncapacity of a fishery to produce the maximum sustainable yield on\n\na   continuing   basis.\"   Id.   §   1802(29).   Specifically,   ASMFC\n\ndetermined that (i) ninety percent of recently harvested lobsters\n\nwere young “recruits” which had just molted into the minimum legal\n\nsize permitting their capture, and (ii) the loss of a population of\n\nmore mature lobsters had resulted in a drastic diminution in\n\nlobster-egg production.\n\n           Thus, Amendment 3 promulgated a variety of “necessary”\n\nmeasures to ward off an impending catastrophic collapse of the\n\nAtlantic lobster stock.     As concerns harvesting by lobster trap,\n\nAmendment 3 reduced the number of traps allowed on a vessel, as\n\nwell as the trap capacity and the size of the trap vents designed\n\nto allow smaller lobsters to escape.         With respect to non-trap\n\nlobstering methods, such as trawling and netting, Amendment 3\n\nlimited the daily harvest of lobsters to 100 per vessel, or 500 for\n\nvessels undertaking fishing expeditions of five days or more.      The\n\nRhode Island Marine Fisheries Council (RIMFC) duly implemented the\n\nlatter provision of Amendment 3 as RIMFC Regulation 15.18. In June\n\n1999, Medeiros was indicted in Rhode Island superior court after\n\n\n      1\n      As the history of Atlantic lobster regulation is complex, we\nconfine the present discussion to the facts most material to this\nappeal. A more comprehensive historical overview may be found in\nCampanale & Sons, Inc. v. Evans, 311 F.3d 109, 112-14 (1st Cir.\n2002).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fhis otter trawler landed 131 lobsters.         The case was ultimately\n\ndismissed.\n\n          Some state officials were less than enthusiastic about\n\nAmendment 3.        Mark Gibson, a former DEM official, and Jan H.\n\nReitsma, a former director of DEM, stated that Amendment 3 was\n\ndiscriminatory and resulted in no genuine conservation benefit. In\n\nJune 2000, over the strong objection of the Governor and the DEM,\n\nRIMFC repealed Regulation 15.18, and, pursuant to the Atlantic\n\nCoastal Act, ASMFC notified the Secretary of Commerce that Rhode\n\nIsland was no longer in compliance with this “necessary” IFMP\n\nrequirement.     The Secretary agreed and announced an intention to\n\nimpose a moratorium.        However, in November 2000, Rhode Island\n\nreinstated    Regulation    15.18,   and   stripped    the    RIMFC    of   its\n\nauthority to rescind the ASMFC regulations.        RIMFC is now a purely\n\nadvisory body.      See R.I. Gen. Laws §   20-3-2 (2001).      Consequently,\n\nthe moratorium never went into effect.\n\n          Medeiros submitted the instant complaint in state court\n\nagainst the ASMFC, the DEM, and the United States, alleging that\n\nAmendment 3 (as adopted through RIMFC Regulation 15.18) violates\n\nhis rights to equal protection and substantive due process, and\n\nconstitutes    an     unlawful   “commandeering”      of     Rhode    Island’s\n\nlegislative prerogatives under the Tenth Amendment. The defendants\n\nremoved the case to the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island.        Thereafter, pursuant to cross-motions\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\ffor summary judgment the district court dismissed all counts in the\n\ncomplaint.       Medeiros v. Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Comm’n,\n\n327 F. Supp. 2d 145 (D.R.I. 2004).            Medeiros appeals.\n\n                                        II\n\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\n              Cross-motions for summary judgment are reviewed de novo,\n\nand all facts, as well as reasonable inferences therefrom, are\n\nreviewed in the light most favorable to the respective non-moving\n\nparties, with a view to determining whether (i) a genuine issue\n\nexists as to any material fact and (ii) either moving party is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.           See Barnes v. Fleet Nat’l\n\nBank, 370 F.3d 164, 170 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nA.   The Equal Protection Claim\n\n              First, Medeiros claims that Amendment 3 and Regulation\n\n15.18       violate   the   Equal     Protection   Clause,   in    that    their\n\ndiscrimination between trap and non-trap lobstering methods bears\n\nno rational relationship to the asserted governmental purpose: to\n\nconserve the dwindling Atlantic lobster stock.\n\n              Legislation or regulation which neither employs a suspect\n\nclassification2       nor   impairs    fundamental   rights,3     will    survive\n\n\n        2\n      Medeiros concedes that, unlike a racial or ethnic minority,\nfor example, see Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 312 n.4\n(1976), non-trap lobstermen are not a “suspect class” for equal\nprotection purposes. See Mills v. State of Me., 118 F.3d 37, 47\n(1st Cir. 1997) (defining “suspect class” as “a class of persons\ncharacterized by some unpopular trait or affiliation . . . [that\nwould] reflect any special likelihood of bias [against them] on the\n\n                                        -7-\n\fconstitutional     scrutiny,    provided    the   remedy        is    “rationally\n\nrelated” to a legitimate governmental purpose.                    See Wine and\n\nSpirits Retailers, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 418 F.3d 36, 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); Citizens Awareness Network, Inc. v. United States, 391 F.3d\n\n338, 355 (1st Cir. 2004). Remedial choices made by the appropriate\n\nlegislative   or    regulatory    body    are   invested        with    a    strong\n\npresumption   of    validity,    rebuttable       only        where    the    party\n\nchallenging the legislation or regulation can establish that “there\n\nexists no fairly conceivable set of facts that could ground a\n\nrational relationship between the challenged classification and the\n\ngovernment's legitimate goals.”      See Wine and Spirits, 418 F.3d at\n\n54 (citation omitted).\n\n          Regulation     15.18    was      designed      to     ameliorate      the\n\n\npart of the ruling majority”) (citation omitted).\n     3\n      At oral argument on the summary judgment motion, Medeiros\nintimated that Amendment 3 and Regulation 15.18 infringe upon his\nfundamental right to pursue the livelihood or occupation of his\nchoosing: in this case, lobstering. Both for equal protection and\nsubstantive due process purposes, however, see infra Section II.B,\nit is well settled that no such fundamental right exists, and that\nlegislation or regulation impinging upon such a right therefore is\nsubject only to “rational basis” review, rather than “strict\nscrutiny.” See, e.g., Dittman v. California, 191 F.3d 1020, 1031\nn.5 (9th Cir. 1999); N.Y. State Trawlers Ass’n v. Jorling, 16 F.3d\n1303, 1311 (2d Cir. 1994); Whittle v. United States, 7 F.3d 1259,\n1262 (6th Cir. 1993); Sisk v. Tex. Parks and Wildlife Dep’t, 644\nF.2d 1056, 1058 n.5 (5th Cir. 1981) (“[F]ishing is not a\nfundamental right nor is the class of commercial fishermen a\nsuspect class.”); Cherenzia v. Lynch, 847 A.2d 818, 823-24 (R.I.\n2004); cf. Piper v. Supreme Court of N.H., 723 F.2d 110, 112 (1st\nCir. 1983), aff’d, 470 U.S. 274 (1985) (noting that right to make\na living may be “fundamental” under the Privileges and Immunities\nClause).\n\n                                    -8-\n\funprecedented overfishing of Atlantic lobster stocks, and the\n\nresulting diminution in the overall vitality of those stocks.          The\n\ndefendants proffer two principal rationales for the differing\n\ntreatment which Amendment 3 and Regulation 15.18 prescribe for trap\n\nand non-trap lobstering.\n\n           Traps are a targeted, passive method for harvesting\n\nlobster.   The lobster trap rests passively on the ocean floor\n\nawaiting the lobsters, which come for bait that is designed to\n\nattract nothing but lobsters.       Normally, newly molted lobsters, or\n\n“soft shedders,” are not caught in traps, in part because the vents\n\nin the traps permit smaller lobsters to escape from the trap.\n\nUnless   the   smaller   lobsters    can   escape,   there   cannot   be   a\n\nsufficient population of mature lobsters capable of egg production,\n\nand the ASMFC’s goal of rebuilding the Atlantic lobster stocks\n\nwould be threatened.\n\n           In contrast, non-trap methods, e.g., bottom trawling, are\n\nboth non-passive and non-selective. For the most part, the lobster\n\nis a coincidental and insignificant by-catch for trawlers fishing\n\nprimarily for finfish.     The trawler nets actively dredge the ocean\n\nfloor, catching whatever species may be in their path and large\n\nenough to be caught in the mesh, and the act of trawling the bottom\n\nmay cause significant shell damage to the vulnerable population of\n\nsoft shell lobsters.      The relatively small openings required in\n\ntrawler nets in order to catch most finfish species also lead to\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fthe capture of numerous soft shedders, which likewise causes a\n\ndiminution in overall egg production.                  For instance, seventy\n\npercent of the 131 lobsters seized from the Medeiros vessel in June\n\n1999 were soft shedders, many of which were moribund.\n\n           Given these inherent differences between the trap and\n\nnon-trap   methods,     these      defendants      opted    to   impose      different\n\nlimitations on each.         Trap methods are more amenable to “input”\n\ncontrols, viz., limiting the number and size of lobsters which will\n\nbe caught in the first instance.          Accordingly, Amendment 3 limited\n\nthe   number   of    traps   per    vessel    or   expedition,         their   overall\n\ncapacity, and the minimum size of their escape vents.4\n\n           On the other hand, such input controls were simply a less\n\npracticable    and    efficacious      methodology         for   use    in     non-trap\n\nlobstering.    For instance, had defendants prescribed that the mesh\n\nopenings in a trawler net were to be made significantly larger to\n\nenable the escape of small lobsters, the trawlers’ primary catch of\n\nfinfish would be necessarily and severely diminished as well.\n\nASMFC rationally adopted the 100/500 limitation because it would\n\n\n      4\n      At oral argument Medeiros suggested, absent record support,\nthat these limitations upon trap methods are entirely illusory,\ninasmuch as they do not restrict the number of times lobstermen may\nempty and reset traps. We disagree. If one trapper is allowed ten\ntraps, and another only two, and we assume that each trapper has\nthe same incentive to maximize his profits by resetting his traps\nas many times as is practicable (viz., allowing a sufficient time\ninterval for capture), it logically follows that the trapper with\nonly two traps is likely to catch fewer lobster in any given\nallotted time period. The same reasoning applies to the reductions\nin the capacity of each trap imposed pursuant to Amendment 3.\n\n                                       -10-\n\freasonably account for the historical, coincidental capture of\n\nlobster during finfish trawling, while deterring trawlers from\n\ndeliberately targeting more lobster. Thus, ASMFC decided to impose\n\n“output” controls upon non-trap methodologies.\n\n              The defendants point out as well that limitations upon\n\nnon-trap methodologies are essential, in that even though the\n\nlobster by-catch on the part of fishing vessels presently employing\n\nnon-trap methods constituted a relatively minor percentage of the\n\noverall lobster harvest,5 fishing vessels confronted with ever-\n\ndiminishing     finfish   stocks   and/or     with   increasing    regulatory\n\nlimitations upon finfish harvesting or trap lobstering might turn\n\nincreasingly to unregulated non-trap lobstering.               Since non-trap\n\nmethods have proven most destructive to the vulnerable population\n\nof soft shed lobsters, such a potential redirection of the vessels’\n\nefforts into non-trap lobstering eventually would undermine the\n\nessential aims of Amendment 3 and Regulation 15.18.\n\n              Medeiros maintains that these asserted reasons do not\n\nconstitute a rational basis for equal protection purposes.                   He\n\ncites    to   the   written   opinions   of   Mark   Gibson,   a   former   DEM\n\nofficial, and Jan H. Reitsma, a former director of DEM, who opposed\n\nthe 100/500 limit because (i) it would discriminate by placing\n\ncatch limits on the non-trap sector, but none on the trap sector,\n\n\n\n     5\n      For example, by the year 2000, merely 1.62 percent of Rhode\nIsland lobster landings were effected by non-trap methods.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fand (ii) offered no conservation benefit, since non-trap landings\n\nconstitute but a small fraction of the total lobster catch.\n\n           However sincere these officials may have been in regard\n\nto the usefulness of the 100/500 lobster catch limits, their\n\nopinions cannot satisfy the daunting burden of demonstrating that\n\nthe 100/500 limit has no conceivable rational basis.             See McDonald\n\nv. Bd. of Election Comm'rs, 394 U.S. 802, 809 (1969) (“Legislatures\n\nare presumed to have acted constitutionally . . . .”); Wine and\n\nSpirits, 418 F.3d at 53.        A legislative or regulatory body is\n\nentrusted with “substantial latitude to establish classifications\n\nthat roughly approximate the nature of the problem perceived.”\n\nGary S. v. Manchester Sch. Dist., 374 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir.)\n\n(citation omitted), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 505 (2004).              Once a\n\nrational   basis   is   identified,   we   must   uphold   the    statute   or\n\nregulation even in cases when there is no empirical data in the\n\nrecord to support the assumptions underlying the chosen remedy.\n\nSee Powers v. Harris, 379 F.3d 1208, 1217 (10th Cir. 2004); Donahue\n\nv. City of Boston, 371 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir.) (noting that reasons\n\nneed not be supported by record, and any “‘plausible’ justification\n\nwill suffice”) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 498\n\n(2004); Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto, 253 F.3d 137, 146 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n           Amendment      3   and     Regulation      15.18       reasonably\n\n“discriminate” by imposing “output controls” upon non-trap methods,\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fas these methods are not amenable to the type of “input controls”\n\nimposed upon the trap sector.           The defendants aptly note that any\n\nattempt to place comparable restrictions upon the non-trap sector\n\nwould be unworkable.         For example, any requirement that trawling\n\nnets have larger openings in their mesh would result in the\n\ncoincident loss of finfish, the trawlers’ primary catch. Moreover,\n\neven if practicable input controls could be placed upon the non-\n\ntrap sector, the dredging method inherently poses a greater risk of\n\nlobster mortality not presented by the trap sector. See N.Y. State\n\nTrawlers Assocs. v. Jorling, 16 F.3d 1303, 1309-10 (2d Cir. 1994)\n\n(upholding        against    equal    protection       challenge   a     statutory\n\nprohibition on lobster trawling, based upon demonstrable damage to\n\nlobster populations from trawling method).\n\n             The reliance by Gibson and Reitsma upon the relatively\n\nsmall percentage of non-trap landings is similarly unavailing.\n\nFirst, the conclusion which they draw – that the 100/500 limit has\n\n“no” conservation benefit – is demonstrably false; at the very\n\nleast,      the    100/500    limit    would    have     some   (albeit    small)\n\nconservation benefit commensurate with the relative size of the\n\nnon-trap sector.        More importantly, a statute or regulation is not\n\nlacking in a rational basis simply because it addresses a broader\n\nproblem in small or incremental stages.            See City of New Orleans v.\n\nDukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303 (1976).           It is only necessary that there\n\nbe   some    rational    relation     between   the    method   chosen    and   the\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fintended result.      And it cannot be gainsaid that it is entirely\n\nplausible   to    anticipate   that    the   100/500   limit   likely    would\n\ndecrease the non-trap harvesting of lobster to the extent such\n\nunrestricted harvesting previously occurred.\n\n            The yet more fatal fallacy in the Medeiros argument is\n\nthat it conveniently ignores the assertion that the defendants\n\ndesigned the 100/500 limit as a prophylactic measure to prevent any\n\nfuture redirection of efforts from trap lobstering and finfishing\n\ninto non-trap lobstering methods.        As this court has noted, “those\n\nattacking the rationality of the legislative classification have\n\nthe burden ‘to negative every conceivable basis which might support\n\nit[.]’”     Abdullah v. Comm’r, 84 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(quoting    FCC v. Beach Communications, 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993))\n\n(emphasis added; citation omitted).          In an industry increasingly\n\nsubjected    to    severe   restrictions      designed    to    enable     the\n\nreplenishment of rapidly dwindling fishing stocks, it was entirely\n\nrational for defendants to conclude that any opening left in the\n\nregulatory net could entice fishermen to venture an advantageous\n\nescape.\n\n            As surely as the opinion of the two DEM officials cannot\n\nbe successfully utilized to second-guess the ASMFC’s prerogatives,\n\nneither may the court second-guess such regulatory judgments. See\n\nBeach Communications, 508 U.S. at 313 (“[E]qual protection is not\n\na license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\flegislative choices.”); Dukes, 427 U.S. at 303 (“[T]he judiciary\n\nmay   not   sit   as   a   super   legislature    to   judge   the   wisdom   or\n\ndesirability of legislative policy determinations made in areas\n\nthat neither affect fundamental rights nor proceed along suspect\n\nlines.”); LCM Enters. v. Town of Dartmouth, 14 F.3d 675, 679 (1st\n\nCir. 1994); Baker v. City of Concord, 916 F.2d 744, 749 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n             As the district court correctly concluded that Medeiros\n\ncould not establish at trial that Amendment 3 and Regulation 15.18\n\nlack any conceivable rational basis, it properly granted summary\n\njudgment for the defendants on the instant claim.\n\nB.    The Substantive Due Process Claim\n\n             Medeiros appeals as well from the district court ruling\n\nthat he failed adequately or distinctly to plead the claim that\n\nAmendment 3 and Regulation 15.18 violate his right to substantive\n\ndue process.      Medeiros maintains that he adequately alleged that\n\nthe regulations infringed upon his “fundamental right” to make a\n\nliving,     thereby    triggering    the     heightened   “strict    scrutiny”\n\nstandard of review.\n\n             However, at oral argument Medeiros conceded that the\n\nidentical analysis applied to the equal protection and due process\n\nclaims.     If Medeiros alleged an infringement of a fundamental\n\nright, both claims were subject to \"strict scrutiny\" analysis.\n\nOtherwise, both claims were governed by the “rational basis”\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fstandard of review.\n\n            The right to “make a living” is not a “fundamental\n\nright,” for either equal protection or substantive due process\n\npurposes.   See N.Y. State Trawlers, 16 F.3d at 1309-12; supra note\n\n3.   Thus, Amendment 3 and Regulation 15.18 must be upheld against\n\nthe Medeiros substantive due process challenge, in that, as we have\n\nalready noted, see supra Section II.A; E. Enters. v. Chater, 110\n\nF.3d 150, 159 (1st Cir. 1997) (“[A] court must apply substantially\n\nthe same [rational basis] analysis to both substantive due process\n\nand equal protection challenges.”), both are rationally related to\n\nthe legitimate governmental purpose of lobster conservation.              See\n\nPFZ Props., Inc. v. Rodriguez, 928 F.2d 28, 31-32 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(“The   doctrine    of   substantive    due   process   ‘does   not   protect\n\nindividuals from all [governmental] actions that infringe liberty\n\nor injure property in violation of some law. Rather, substantive\n\ndue process prevents “governmental power from being used for\n\npurposes of oppression,” or “abuse of government power that shocks\n\nthe conscience,” or an “action that is legally irrational in that\n\nit is not sufficiently keyed to any legitimate state interests.”’”)\n\n(citations omitted).       Accordingly, the district court correctly\n\nentered   summary    judgment   for    the    defendants   on   the   Medeiros\n\nsubstantive due process claim.\n\nC.   The Tenth Amendment Claim\n\n            Finally, Medeiros maintains that he alleged a viable\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fTenth Amendment claim: that the Atlantic Coastal Act in general and\n\nin particular its provision permitting the Secretary of Commerce to\n\nimpose a moratorium on any member State that refuses to adopt a\n\n“necessary”   term        of     an    IFMP     constitutes   an   impermissible\n\n“commandeering”      by        the    federal    government   of   the   states’\n\nlegislative prerogatives.             See, e.g., Printz v. United States, 521\n\nU.S. 898, 924 (1997) (striking down Brady Act provision which\n\nrequired state law enforcement officers to assist in national\n\ninstant background checks for firearm sales); New York v. United\n\nStates, 505 U.S. 144, 168 (1992) (striking down provision requiring\n\nstates to take title to radioactive waste as part of a federal\n\nregulatory initiative).6             In other words, Medeiros intimates, the\n\nmere threat of a moratorium has compelled Rhode Island, against its\n\nwill, to adopt the 100/500 limitation in Amendment 3.\n\n          The defendants counter that the instant claim must be\n\ndismissed on jurisdictional grounds since private citizens like\n\nMedeiros lack standing to assert Tenth Amendment claims, which are\n\nto be prosecuted (if at all) by the state.              The defendants note as\n\nwell that Rhode Island voluntarily has endorsed and continues to\n\nendorse the policy underlying the enactment of the 100/500 limit,\n\nsee R.I. Gen. Laws § 20-8-7 (requiring that all state officials\n\ntake any action necessary to comply with the ACFCMA compact), and\n\n\n     6\n      The Tenth Amendment provides: “The powers not delegated to\nthe United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the\nStates, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”\n\n                                         -17-\n\fthat even if the Atlantic Coastal Act or its moratorium were to be\n\ninvalidated on Tenth Amendment grounds, Rhode Island voluntarily\n\nwould elect to leave Regulation 15.18 in place, and therefore the\n\nharm   incurred   by   Medeiros   would     not   be     redressed.    In    the\n\nalternative, the defendants contend that, even if Medeiros did have\n\nstanding,   the    Atlantic   Coastal      Act    does    not   constitute   an\n\nimpermissible     “commandeering”    of     Rhode      Island’s    legislative\n\nprerogatives, but rather a permissible “program of cooperative\n\nfederalism” in which the federal and state governments have acted\n\nvoluntarily in tandem to achieve a common policy objective.                  See\n\nNew York, 505 U.S. at 167.\n\n            We resolve the threshold jurisdictional issue prior to\n\nreaching the merits of the Medeiros claim.                  See Steel Co. v.\n\nCitizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 101-02 (1998) (noting\n\nthat court should not reach merits unless first assured that it has\n\njurisdiction; to assume jurisdiction arguendo would result in an\n\nadvisory opinion); Parella v. Ret. Bd. of the R.I. Employees' Ret.\n\nSys., 173 F.3d 46, 53-54 (1st Cir. 1999).           We conclude, as did the\n\ndistrict court, that Medeiros lacks standing to present a Tenth\n\nAmendment claim.\n\n            The United States Supreme Court has held that private\n\ncitizens lack standing to maintain Tenth Amendment claims.                   See\n\nTenn. Elec. Power Co. v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 306 U.S. 118, 144\n\n(1939) [hereinafter: “TVA”] (“As we have seen there is no objection\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fto the Authority's operations by the states, and, if this were not\n\nso, the appellants, absent the states or their officers, have no\n\nstanding in this suit to raise any question under the amendment.”).\n\nMedeiros incorrectly classifies the TVA holding as dictum.              The\n\nCourt dismissed the Tenth Amendment claim after analyzing both the\n\nstanding issue and the merits, and hence, the former holding is an\n\nalternative ground, rather than obiter dictum.         See California v.\n\nUnited States, 438 U.S. 645, 689 n.10 (1978); Woods v. Interstate\n\nRealty Co., 337 U.S. 535, 537 (1949); Natural Res. Def. Council,\n\nInc. v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 216 F.3d 1180, 1189 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2000).     Accordingly, the Supreme Court's explicit holding in TVA,\n\nwhich has never been reversed, remains binding precedent.\n\n            Medeiros counters that the Supreme Court’s subsequent\n\ndiscussion of the Tenth Amendment in New York v. United States, 505\n\nU.S. 144 (1992), undermines TVA:\n\n            The   Constitution   does    not  protect   the\n            sovereignty of States for the benefit of the\n            States or state governments as abstract\n            political entities, or even for the benefit of\n            the public officials governing the States. To\n            the   contrary,   the    Constitution   divides\n            authority    between     federal   and    state\n            governments for the protection of individuals.\n            State sovereignty is not just an end in\n            itself:   “Rather,    federalism   secures   to\n            citizens the liberties that derive from the\n            diffusion of sovereign power.”\n\nId.   at   181   (citation   omitted).    Medeiros   suggests   that   this\n\nlanguage is to be read as abrogating the principle that only the\n\nstates’ interests are protected by the Tenth Amendment, and if\n\n                                   -19-\n\findividual citizens also have interests, they must have standing in\n\norder to protect them in court.       We do not agree.\n\n           First, as the New York decision does not mention TVA, it\n\ncannot be construed as expressly overruling it.7        Moreover, even if\n\nthe Medeiros reading of the passage were plausible and we were to\n\nconclude that its reasoning is inconsistent with TVA, we would\n\nremain bound to apply TVA.     “If a precedent of [the Supreme] Court\n\nhas a direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons\n\nrejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals\n\nshould follow the case which directly controls, leaving to [the\n\nSupreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.”\n\nRodriquez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477,\n\n484 (1989). The TVA decision has direct application to the instant\n\ncase, in that it involved private parties attempting to assert\n\nTenth Amendment claims, whereas New York did not.             Rather, since\n\nNew York involved a claim asserted only by a state, the question of\n\nprivate-party standing under the Tenth Amendment was never at\n\nissue; indeed, the word “standing” was never mentioned.\n\n           Moreover, the Medeiros interpretation of New York – as\n\nholding   that   individuals   must   have   standing    to    bring   Tenth\n\nAmendment claims in court – is by no means inarguable.                   The\n\n\n\n     7\n      In fact, the Supreme Court has reiterated its TVA holding in\nsubsequent dicta. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 105 (1968) (noting\nthat private citizens cannot “assert the States’ interest in their\nlegislative prerogatives”).\n\n                                  -20-\n\fspecific focus of the above-quoted discussion was whether a state\n\ncould assert a Tenth Amendment “commandeering” claim where a\n\nprevious administration of that state had initially acquiesced in\n\nthe commandeering, or whether the Tenth Amendment claim had been\n\nwaived.     In responding that a state could never consent to an\n\nunconstitutional commandeering, the Supreme Court noted that the\n\nAmendment protects the individual citizens of the state generally\n\nby diffusing power among sovereigns, and therefore the State cannot\n\nwaive a commandeering violation which in fact impinges upon that\n\ninterest.    New York, 505 U.S. at 182.\n\n            One might suppose that this proposition leads inevitably\n\nto the conclusion that, if a State refuses to oppose an unlawful\n\ncommandeering, an individual citizen is the only remaining party\n\nwith an interest and incentive to vindicate that violation, and\n\ntherefore the New York Court necessarily must have envisioned that\n\nthe private citizen would have standing to bring suit on the Tenth\n\nAmendment claim. While this is one plausible interpretation, it is\n\nnot an inexorable one.      Rather, the Court may simply have intended\n\nthat the State represents the interests of its citizens in general,\n\nand, if it refuses to prosecute a viable Tenth Amendment claim, the\n\ncitizens    of   that   state   may   have   recourse   to   local   political\n\nprocesses to effect change in the state’s policy of acquiescence.\n\nIf the Tenth Amendment is not waivable, individuals could petition\n\nstate officials for redress at any time.            We need not determine\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fwhich interpretation is more likely, but only that it is at least\n\ndebatable    whether,   or    to   what   extent,    the    New   York   decision\n\nundermines the TVA holding.\n\n            Medeiros also notes that the Court recently granted a\n\nwrit of certiorari for the purpose of deciding this very issue,\n\nsee Pierce County, Washington v. Guillen, 537 U.S. 129 (2003), and\n\nthough it ultimately declined to reach the question, id. at 148\n\nn.10, we should interpret this development as an indication of the\n\nCourt's readiness to overturn TVA.           We can draw no such inference\n\non the basis of this development.            Certiorari could mean either\n\nthat the Court is interested in reexamining and/or overruling TVA,\n\nor that it merely intends to reaffirm TVA in the face of a circuit\n\nsplit on the issue.     Those circuit court decisions which have held\n\nthat private citizens possess standing to bring Tenth Amendment\n\nclaims are problematic.            For instance, the Eleventh Circuit’s\n\nprecedent commenced without any reference to TVA, and subsequent\n\npanels have expressed concern as to whether the omission has\n\nresulted in the perpetuation of a circuit precedent inconsistent\n\nwith TVA.    See, e.g., Dillard v. Baldwin County Comm’rs, 225 F.3d\n\n1271, 1283 & n.1 (11th Cir. 2000) (Barkett, J., concurring).                    In\n\naddition, the Seventh Circuit has permitted a state police officer\n\nto maintain a Tenth Amendment claim that a federal regulation\n\ninterfered    with   the     officer's    state     law    enforcement    job   by\n\nprohibiting persons convicted of domestic violence crimes from\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fpossessing guns, but in such specialized circumstances, it is\n\ndebatable whether the plaintiff is acting in behalf of the state or\n\nsimply   as      a    private   citizen.      See    Gillespie       v.   City     of\n\nIndianapolis, 185 F.3d 693, 702-04 (7th Cir. 1999); cf. Lomont v.\n\nO'Neill, 285 F.3d 9, 13 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (noting in dicta that\n\nTVA likely would preclude Tenth Amendment standing to a purely\n\nprivate citizen, yet holding that a county sheriff and a chief of\n\npolice possessed standing to assert a commandeering claim).                       In\n\ncontrast,     many     courts   explicitly    have     held   that    TVA,   until\n\noverruled, bars Tenth Amendment claims by private citizens.                      See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Parker, 362 F.3d 1279, 1284-85 (10th Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 88 (2004); City of Roseville v. Norton,\n\n219 F. Supp. 2d 130, 147-48 (D.D.C. 2002), aff’d, 348 F.3d 1020\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2003), cert. denied sub nom. Citizens for Safer Cmtys.,\n\n541 U.S. 974 (2004); Vt. Assembly of Home Health Agencies v.\n\nShalala, 18 F. Supp. 2d 355, 370-71 (D. Vt. 1998).\n\n            We       are   particularly    reluctant    to    second-guess        the\n\ncontinuing viability of TVA regarding so complex an issue of\n\nconstitutional law. If and when the Supreme Court revisits TVA, it\n\nmay be confronted with the question as to how a private citizen\n\nproceeds to establish a Tenth Amendment “commandeering” claim where\n\nthe State itself has acquiesced in the federal-state arrangement.\n\nFor example, if Medeiros were to possess standing, the question\n\nmight arise as to whether he should be allowed discovery to\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fdetermine why Rhode Island officials initially adopted Regulation\n\n15.18, or why those officials reinstated the regulation with\n\ndispatch following its brief repeal in 2000.           On the other hand, if\n\nthe State cannot acquiesce in a commandeering regime, see New York,\n\n505 U.S. at 182, its actual motivation in enacting Regulation 15.18\n\nmight be immaterial. Finally, if private citizens possess standing\n\nto   prosecute   Tenth   Amendment      claims,   it   is   not   difficult    to\n\nenvision a substantial increase in such litigation before the\n\nfederal   courts.        Given   that    potential,    the    prudential      and\n\nprecedential principle enunciated in Rodriquez de Quijas seems\n\nparticularly apt.        In the event TVA is no longer good law, it\n\nshould be for the Supreme Court explicitly to overrule it.\n\n           Accordingly, we affirm the district court holding that\n\nMedeiros lacks standing to pursue a Tenth Amendment claim that the\n\nAtlantic Coastal Act constitutes an unconstitutional commandeering\n\nof the Rhode Island legislative processes.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\f",

Each signatory is represented on the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC). 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5102(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until 1993, the decision to participate in any IFMP was entirely voluntary. As compliance was spotty, Congress enacted the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5101-5108 (1993) (\"ACFCMA\"), which permits the ASMFC (i) to identify which IFMP terms it considers \"necessary,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 5104(a)(1), and (ii) to require that all member states adopt and comply with these terms. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5101(a)(4) (\"The responsibility for managing Atlantic coastal fisheries rests with the States, which carry out a cooperative program of fishery oversight and management through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to support such cooperative interstate management of coastal fishery resources.\"). Should a member refuse to comply, the ASMFC may contact the Secretary of Commerce, <i>id.</i> &#167; 5105(b), who makes a plenary determination as to whether (i) the particular IFMP term is indeed \"necessary,\" and (ii) the member state is in noncompliance. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5106(a). Should the Secretary determine that the member state is not complying with an essential term, a moratorium on fishing may be imposed in the offending member state's coastal waters. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5106(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately four-fifths of all Atlantic lobsters are harvested within the territorial waters of the Atlantic states (<i>viz.,</i> within three miles of the shoreline), and an even greater percentage by means of lobster traps. A small percentage &#8212; for example, in Rhode Island, 1.62 percent &#8212; is harvested by trawling and netting. In December 1997, ASMFC promulgated an IFMP containing Amendment 3, after acquiring evidence suggesting that, despite years of heavy regulatory oversight, the Atlantic lobster population was still being overfished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> \"Overfishing\" is defined as \"a rate or level of fishing mortality that jeopardizes the capacity of a fishery to produce the maximum sustainable yield on a continuing basis.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1802(29). Specifically, ASMFC determined that (i) ninety percent of recently harvested lobsters were young \"recruits\" which had just molted into the minimum legal size permitting their capture, and (ii) the loss of a population of more mature lobsters had resulted in a drastic diminution in lobster-egg production.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Amendment 3 promulgated a variety of \"necessary\" measures to ward off an impending catastrophic collapse of the Atlantic lobster stock. As concerns harvesting by lobster trap, Amendment 3 reduced the number of traps allowed on a vessel, as well as the trap capacity and the size of the trap vents designed to allow smaller lobsters to escape. With respect to non-trap lobstering methods, such as trawling and netting, Amendment 3 limited the daily harvest of lobsters to 100 per vessel, or 500 for vessels undertaking fishing expeditions of five days or more. The Rhode Island Marine Fisheries Council (RIMFC) duly implemented the latter provision of Amendment 3 as RIMFC Regulation 15.18. In June 1999, Medeiros was indicted in Rhode Island superior court after his otter trawler landed 131 lobsters. The case was ultimately dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some state officials were less than enthusiastic about Amendment 3. Mark Gibson, a former DEM official, and Jan H. Reitsma, a former director of DEM, stated that Amendment 3 was discriminatory and resulted in no genuine conservation benefit. In June 2000, over the strong objection of the Governor and the DEM, RIMFC repealed Regulation 15.18, and, pursuant to the Atlantic Coastal Act, ASMFC notified the Secretary of Commerce that Rhode Island was no longer in compliance with this \"necessary\" IFMP requirement. The Secretary agreed and announced an intention to impose a moratorium. However, in November 2000, Rhode Island reinstated Regulation 15.18, and stripped the RIMFC of its authority to rescind the ASMFC regulations. RIMFC is now a purely advisory body. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 20-3-2 (2001). Consequently, the moratorium never went into effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medeiros submitted the instant complaint in state court against the ASMFC, the DEM, and the United States, alleging that Amendment 3 (as adopted through RIMFC Regulation 15.18) violates his rights to equal protection and substantive due process, and constitutes an unlawful \"commandeering\" of Rhode Island's legislative prerogatives under the Tenth Amendment. The defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. Thereafter, pursuant to cross-motions for summary judgment the district court dismissed all counts in the complaint. <i>Medeiros v.

Remedial choices made by the appropriate legislative or regulatory body are invested with a strong presumption of validity, rebuttable only where the party challenging the legislation or regulation can establish that \"there exists no fairly conceivable set of facts that could ground a rational relationship between the challenged classification and the government's legitimate goals.\" <i>See Wine and Spirits,</i> 418 F.3d at 54 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulation 15.18 was designed to ameliorate the unprecedented overfishing of Atlantic lobster stocks, and the resulting diminution in the overall vitality of those stocks. The defendants proffer two principal rationales for the differing treatment which Amendment 3 and Regulation 15.18 prescribe for trap and non-trap lobstering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traps are a targeted, passive method for harvesting lobster. The lobster trap rests passively on the ocean floor awaiting the lobsters, which come for bait that is designed to attract nothing but lobsters. Normally, newly molted lobsters, or \"soft shedders,\" are not caught in traps, in part because the vents in the traps permit smaller lobsters to escape from the trap. Unless the smaller lobsters can escape, there cannot be a sufficient population of mature lobsters capable of egg production, and the ASMFC's goal of rebuilding the Atlantic lobster stocks would be threatened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, non-trap methods, <i>e.g.,</i> bottom trawling, are both non-passive and non-selective. For the most part, the lobster is a coincidental and insignificant by-catch for trawlers fishing primarily for finfish. The trawler nets actively dredge the ocean floor, catching whatever species may be in their path and large enough to be caught in the mesh, and the act of trawling the bottom may cause significant shell damage to the vulnerable population of soft shell lobsters. The relatively small openings required in trawler nets in order to catch most finfish species also lead to the capture of numerous soft shedders, which likewise causes a diminution in overall egg production. For instance, seventy percent of the 131 lobsters seized from the Medeiros vessel in June 1999 were soft shedders, many of which were moribund.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these inherent differences between the trap and non-trap methods, these defendants opted to impose different limitations on each. Trap methods are more amenable to \"input\" controls, <i>viz.,</i> limiting the number and size of lobsters which will be caught in the first instance. Accordingly, Amendment 3 limited the number of traps per vessel or expedition, their overall capacity, and the minimum size of their escape vents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, such input controls were simply a less practicable and efficacious methodology for use in non-trap lobstering. For instance, had defendants prescribed that the mesh openings in a trawler net were to be made significantly larger to enable the escape of small lobsters, the trawlers' primary catch of finfish would be necessarily and severely diminished as well. ASMFC rationally adopted the 100/500 limitation because it would reasonably account for the historical, coincidental capture of lobster during finfish trawling, while deterring trawlers from deliberately targeting more lobster. Thus, ASMFC decided to impose \"output\" controls upon non-trap methodologies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants point out as well that limitations upon non-trap methodologies are essential, in that even though the lobster by-catch on the part of fishing vessels presently employing non-trap methods constituted a relatively minor percentage of the overall lobster harvest,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> fishing vessels confronted with ever-diminishing finfish stocks and/or with increasing regulatory limitations upon finfish harvesting or trap lobstering might turn increasingly to unregulated non-trap lobstering. Since non-trap methods have proven most destructive to the vulnerable population of soft shed lobsters, such a potential redirection of the vessels' efforts into non-trap lobstering eventually would undermine the essential aims of Amendment 3 and Regulation 15.18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medeiros maintains that these asserted reasons do not constitute a rational basis for equal protection purposes. He cites to the written opinions of Mark Gibson, a former DEM official, and Jan H. Reitsma, a former director of DEM, who opposed the 100/500 limit because (i) it would discriminate by placing catch limits on the non-trap sector, but none on the trap sector, and (ii) offered no conservation benefit, since non-trap landings constitute but a small fraction of the total lobster catch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However sincere these officials may have been in regard to the usefulness of the 100/500 lobster catch limits, their opinions cannot satisfy the daunting burden of demonstrating that the 100/500 limit has no conceivable rational basis. <i>See McDonald v. Bd. of Election Comm'rs,</i> 394 U.S. 802, 809, 89 S.Ct. 1404, 22 L.Ed.2d 739 (1969) (\"Legislatures are presumed to have acted constitutionally....\"); <i>Wine and Spirits,</i> 418 F.3d at 53. A legislative or regulatory body is entrusted with \"substantial latitude to establish classifications that roughly approximate the nature of the problem perceived.\" <i>Gary S. v. Manchester Sch.

Once a rational basis is identified, we must uphold the statute or regulation even in cases when there is no empirical data in the record to support the assumptions underlying the chosen remedy. <i>See Powers v. Harris,</i> 379 F.3d 1208, 1217 (10th Cir.2004); <i>Donahue v. City of Boston,</i> 371 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir.)

Soto,</i> 253 F.3d 137, 146 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amendment 3 and Regulation 15.18 reasonably \"discriminate\" by imposing \"output controls\" upon non-trap methods, as these methods are not amenable to the type of \"input controls\" imposed upon the trap sector. The defendants aptly note that any attempt to place comparable restrictions upon the non-trap sector would be unworkable. For example, any requirement that trawling nets have larger openings in their mesh would result in the coincident loss of finfish, the trawlers' primary catch. Moreover, even if practicable input controls could be placed upon the non-trap sector, the dredging method inherently poses a greater risk of lobster mortality not presented by the trap sector. <i>See N.Y. State Trawlers Assocs. v. Jorling,</i> 16 F.3d 1303, 1309-10 (2d Cir.1994) (upholding against equal protection challenge a statutory <i>prohibition</i> on lobster trawling, based upon demonstrable damage to lobster populations from trawling method).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reliance by Gibson and Reitsma upon the relatively small percentage of non-trap landings is similarly unavailing. First, the conclusion which they draw &#8212; that the 100/500 limit has \"no\" conservation benefit &#8212; is demonstrably false; at the very least, the 100/500 limit would have some (albeit small) conservation benefit commensurate with the relative size of the non-trap sector. More importantly, a statute or regulation is not lacking in a rational basis simply because it addresses a broader problem in small or incremental stages. <i>See City of New Orleans v. Dukes,</i> 427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976). It is only necessary that there be some rational relation between the method chosen and the intended result. And it cannot be gainsaid that it is entirely plausible to anticipate that the 100/500 limit likely would decrease the non-trap harvesting of lobster to the extent such unrestricted harvesting previously occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The yet more fatal fallacy in the Medeiros argument is that it conveniently ignores the assertion that the defendants designed the 100/500 limit as a prophylactic measure to prevent any future redirection of efforts from trap lobstering and finfishing into non-trap lobstering methods. As this court has noted, \"those attacking the rationality of the legislative classification have the burden `to negative <i>every</i> conceivable basis which might support it[.]'\" <i>Abdullah v. Comm'r,</i> 84 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>FCC v. Beach Communications,</i> 508 U.S. 307, 315, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993)) (emphasis added; citation omitted). In an industry increasingly subjected to severe restrictions designed to enable the replenishment of rapidly dwindling fishing stocks, it was entirely rational for defendants to conclude that any opening left in the regulatory net could entice fishermen to venture an advantageous escape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As surely as the opinion of the two DEM officials cannot be successfully utilized to second-guess the ASMFC's prerogatives, neither may the court second-guess such regulatory judgments. <i>See Beach Communications,</i> 508 U.S. at 313, 113 S.Ct. 2096 (\"[E]qual protection is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices.\"); <i>Dukes,</i> 427 U.S. at 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513 (\"[T]he judiciary may not sit as a super legislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations made in areas that neither affect fundamental rights nor proceed along suspect lines.\"); <i>LCM Enters. v.

Thus, Amendment 3 and Regulation 15.18 must be upheld against the Medeiros substantive due process challenge, in that, as we have already noted, <i>see supra</i> Section II.A; <i>E. Enters. v. Chater,</i> 110 F.3d 150, 159 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[A] court must apply substantially the same [rational basis] analysis to both substantive due process and equal protection challenges.\"), both are rationally related to the legitimate governmental purpose of lobster conservation. <i>See PFZ Props., Inc. v. Rodriguez,</i> 928 F.2d 28, 31-32 (1st Cir.1991) (\"The doctrine of substantive due process `does not protect individuals from all [governmental] actions that infringe liberty or injure property in violation of some law. Rather, substantive due process prevents \"governmental power from being used for purposes of oppression,\" or \"abuse of government power that shocks the conscience,\" or an \"action that is legally irrational in that it is not sufficiently keyed to any legitimate state interests.\"'\") (citations omitted). Accordingly, the district court correctly entered summary judgment for the defendants on the Medeiros substantive due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Tenth Amendment Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Medeiros maintains that he alleged a viable Tenth Amendment claim: that the Atlantic Coastal Act in general and in particular its provision permitting the Secretary of Commerce to impose a moratorium on any member State that refuses to adopt a \"necessary\" term of an IFMP constitutes an impermissible \"commandeering\" by the federal government of the states' legislative prerogatives. <i>See, e.g., Printz v.

The defendants note as well that Rhode Island voluntarily has endorsed and continues to endorse the policy underlying the enactment of the 100/500 limit, <i>see</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 20-8-7 (requiring that all state officials take any action necessary to comply with the ACFCMA compact), and that even if the Atlantic Coastal Act or its moratorium were to be invalidated on Tenth Amendment grounds, Rhode Island voluntarily would elect to leave Regulation 15.18 in place, and therefore the harm incurred by Medeiros would not be redressed. In the alternative, the defendants contend that, even if Medeiros did have standing, the Atlantic Coastal Act does not constitute an impermissible \"commandeering\" of Rhode Island's legislative prerogatives, but rather a permissible \"program of cooperative federalism\" in which the federal and state governments have acted voluntarily in tandem to achieve a common policy objective. <i>See New York,</i> 505 U.S. at 167, 112 S.Ct. 2408.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We resolve the threshold jurisdictional issue prior to reaching the merits of the Medeiros claim. <i>See Steel Co. v.

Medeiros incorrectly classifies the <i>TVA</i> holding as dictum. The Court dismissed the Tenth Amendment claim after analyzing both the standing issue and the merits, and hence, the former holding is an alternative ground, rather than obiter dictum. <i>See California v.

To the contrary, the Constitution divides authority between federal and state governments for the protection of individuals. State sovereignty is not just an end in itself: \"Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 181, 112 S.Ct. 2408 (citation omitted).

We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as the <i>New York</i> decision does not mention <i>TVA,</i> it cannot be construed as expressly overruling it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Moreover, even if the Medeiros reading of the passage were plausible and we were to conclude that its reasoning is inconsistent with <i>TVA,</i> we would remain bound to apply <i>TVA.</i> \"If a precedent of [the Supreme] Court has a direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\" <i>Rodriquez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc.,</i> 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989). The <i>TVA</i> decision has direct application to the instant case, in that it involved private parties attempting to assert Tenth Amendment claims, whereas <i>New York</i> did not. Rather, since <i>New York</i> involved a claim asserted only by a state, the question of private-party standing under the Tenth Amendment was never at issue; indeed, the word \"standing\" was never mentioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Medeiros interpretation of <i>New York</i> &#8212; as holding that individuals must have standing to bring Tenth Amendment claims in court &#8212; is by no means inarguable. The specific focus of the above-quoted discussion was whether a state could assert a Tenth Amendment \"commandeering\" claim where a previous administration of that state had initially acquiesced in the commandeering, <i>or</i> whether the Tenth Amendment claim had been waived. In responding that a state could never consent to an unconstitutional commandeering, the Supreme Court noted that the Amendment protects the individual citizens of the state generally by diffusing power among sovereigns, and therefore the State cannot waive a commandeering violation which in fact impinges upon that interest. <i>New York,</i> 505 U.S. at 182, 112 S.Ct. 2408.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might suppose that this proposition leads inevitably to the conclusion that, if a State refuses to oppose an unlawful commandeering, an individual citizen is the only remaining party with an interest and incentive to vindicate that violation, and therefore the <i>New York</i> Court necessarily must have envisioned that the private citizen would have standing to bring suit on the Tenth Amendment claim. While this is one plausible interpretation, it is not an inexorable one. Rather, the Court may simply have intended that the State represents the interests of its citizens in general, and, if it refuses to prosecute a viable Tenth Amendment claim, the citizens of that state may have recourse to local political processes to effect change in the state's policy of acquiescence. If the Tenth Amendment is not waivable, individuals could petition state officials for redress at any time. We need not determine which interpretation is more likely, but only that it is at least debatable whether, or to what extent, the <i>New York</i> decision undermines the <i>TVA</i> holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medeiros also notes that the Court recently granted a writ of certiorari for the purpose of deciding this very issue, <i>see Pierce County, Washington v. Guillen,</i> 537 U.S. 129, 123 S.Ct. 720, 154 L.Ed.2d 610 (2003), and though it ultimately declined to reach the question, <i>id.</i> at 148 n. 10, 123 S.Ct. 720, we should interpret this development as an indication of the Court's readiness to overturn <i>TVA.</i> We can draw no such inference on the basis of this development. Certiorari could mean either that the Court is interested in reexamining and/or overruling <i>TVA,</i> or that it merely intends to reaffirm <i>TVA</i> in the face of a circuit split on the issue. Those circuit court decisions which have held that private citizens possess standing to bring Tenth Amendment claims are problematic. For instance, the Eleventh Circuit's precedent commenced without any reference to <i>TVA,</i> and subsequent panels have expressed concern as to whether the omission has resulted in the perpetuation of a circuit precedent inconsistent with <i>TVA. See, e.g., Dillard v. Baldwin County Comm'rs,</i> 225 F.3d 1271, 1283 &amp; n. 1 (11th Cir.2000) (Barkett, J., concurring). In addition, the Seventh Circuit has permitted a state police officer to maintain a Tenth Amendment claim that a federal regulation interfered with the officer's state law enforcement job by prohibiting persons convicted of domestic violence crimes from possessing guns, but in such specialized circumstances, it is debatable whether the plaintiff is acting in behalf of the state or simply as a private citizen. <i>See Gillespie v. City of Indianapolis,</i> 185 F.3d 693, 702-04 (7th Cir.1999); <i>cf. Lomont v. O'Neill,</i> 285 F.3d 9, 13 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.2002) (noting in dicta that <i>TVA</i> likely would preclude Tenth Amendment standing to a purely private citizen, yet holding that a county sheriff and a chief of police possessed standing to assert a commandeering claim). In contrast, many courts explicitly have held that <i>TVA,</i> until overruled, bars Tenth Amendment claims by private citizens. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Parker,</i> 362 F.3d 1279, 1284-85 (10th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 88, 160 L.Ed.2d 124 (2004); <i>City of Roseville v.

If and when the Supreme Court revisits <i>TVA,</i> it may be confronted with the question as to how a private citizen proceeds to establish a Tenth Amendment \"commandeering\" claim where the State itself has acquiesced in the federal-state arrangement. For example, if Medeiros were to possess standing, the question might arise as to whether he should be allowed discovery to determine why Rhode Island officials initially adopted Regulation 15.18, or why those officials reinstated the regulation with dispatch following its brief repeal in 2000. On the other hand, if the State cannot acquiesce in a commandeering regime, <i>see New York,</i> 505 U.S. at 182, 112 S.Ct. 2408, its actual motivation in enacting Regulation 15.18 might be immaterial. Finally, if private citizens possess standing to prosecute Tenth Amendment claims, it is not difficult to envision a substantial increase in such litigation before the federal courts. Given that potential, the prudential and precedential principle enunciated in <i>Rodriquez de Quijas</i> seems particularly apt. In the event <i>TVA</i> is no longer good law, it should be for the Supreme Court explicitly to overrule it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court holding that Medeiros lacks standing to pursue a Tenth Amendment claim that the Atlantic Coastal Act constitutes an unconstitutional commandeering of the Rhode Island legislative processes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As the history of Atlantic lobster regulation is complex, we confine the present discussion to the facts most material to this appeal.

Medeiros appeals from a district court order dismissing the complaint he filed against the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM), the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), and the United States, challenging the constitutionality of a DEM regulation restricting the number of lobsters which may be harvested by methods other than lobster traps. We affirm the district court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1942, with congressional approval, fifteen Atlantic coast states, as well as the District of Columbia, entered into a compact pursuant to which the signatories would exercise joint regulatory oversight of their fisheries (<i>viz.,</i> the area within three miles of their respective shorelines), primarily through the development of interstate fishery management plans (\"IFMPs\"). Each signatory is represented on the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC). 16 U.S.C. &#167; 5102(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until 1993, the decision to participate in any IFMP was entirely voluntary. As compliance was spotty, Congress enacted the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5101-5108 (1993) (\"ACFCMA\"), which permits the ASMFC (i) to identify which IFMP terms it considers \"necessary,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 5104(a)(1), and (ii) to require that all member states adopt and comply with these terms. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5101(a)(4) (\"The responsibility for managing Atlantic coastal fisheries rests with the States, which carry out a cooperative program of fishery oversight and management through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to support such cooperative interstate management of coastal fishery resources.\"). Should a member refuse to comply, the ASMFC may contact the Secretary of Commerce, <i>id.</i> &#167; 5105(b), who makes a plenary determination as to whether (i) the particular IFMP term is indeed \"necessary,\" and (ii) the member state is in noncompliance. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5106(a). Should the Secretary determine that the member state is not complying with an essential term, a moratorium on fishing may be imposed in the offending member state's coastal waters. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5106(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately four-fifths of all Atlantic lobsters are harvested within the territorial waters of the Atlantic states (<i>viz.,</i> within three miles of the shoreline), and an even greater percentage by means of lobster traps. A small percentage &#8212; for example, in Rhode Island, 1.62 percent &#8212; is harvested by trawling and netting. In December 1997, ASMFC promulgated an IFMP containing Amendment 3, after acquiring evidence suggesting that, despite years of heavy regulatory oversight, the Atlantic lobster population was still being overfished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> \"Overfishing\" is defined as \"a rate or level of fishing mortality that jeopardizes the capacity of a fishery to produce the maximum sustainable yield on a continuing basis.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1802(29). Specifically, ASMFC determined that (i) ninety percent of recently harvested lobsters were young \"recruits\" which had just molted into the minimum legal size permitting their capture, and (ii) the loss of a population of more mature lobsters had resulted in a drastic diminution in lobster-egg production.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Amendment 3 promulgated a variety of \"necessary\" measures to ward off an impending catastrophic collapse of the Atlantic lobster stock. As concerns harvesting by lobster trap, Amendment 3 reduced the number of traps allowed on a vessel, as well as the trap capacity and the size of the trap vents designed to allow smaller lobsters to escape. With respect to non-trap lobstering methods, such as trawling and netting, Amendment 3 limited the daily harvest of lobsters to 100 per vessel, or 500 for vessels undertaking fishing expeditions of five days or more. The Rhode Island Marine Fisheries Council (RIMFC) duly implemented the latter provision of Amendment 3 as RIMFC Regulation 15.18. In June 1999, Medeiros was indicted in Rhode Island superior court after his otter trawler landed 131 lobsters. The case was ultimately dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some state officials were less than enthusiastic about Amendment 3. Mark Gibson, a former DEM official, and Jan H. Reitsma, a former director of DEM, stated that Amendment 3 was discriminatory and resulted in no genuine conservation benefit. In June 2000, over the strong objection of the Governor and the DEM, RIMFC repealed Regulation 15.18, and, pursuant to the Atlantic Coastal Act, ASMFC notified the Secretary of Commerce that Rhode Island was no longer in compliance with this \"necessary\" IFMP requirement. The Secretary agreed and announced an intention to impose a moratorium. However, in November 2000, Rhode Island reinstated Regulation 15.18, and stripped the RIMFC of its authority to rescind the ASMFC regulations. RIMFC is now a purely advisory body. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 20-3-2 (2001). Consequently, the moratorium never went into effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medeiros submitted the instant complaint in state court against the ASMFC, the DEM, and the United States, alleging that Amendment 3 (as adopted through RIMFC Regulation 15.18) violates his rights to equal protection and substantive due process, and constitutes an unlawful \"commandeering\" of Rhode Island's legislative prerogatives under the Tenth Amendment. The defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. Thereafter, pursuant to cross-motions for summary judgment the district court dismissed all counts in the complaint. <i>Medeiros v.

Remedial choices made by the appropriate legislative or regulatory body are invested with a strong presumption of validity, rebuttable only where the party challenging the legislation or regulation can establish that \"there exists no fairly conceivable set of facts that could ground a rational relationship between the challenged classification and the government's legitimate goals.\" <i>See Wine and Spirits,</i> 418 F.3d at 54 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulation 15.18 was designed to ameliorate the unprecedented overfishing of Atlantic lobster stocks, and the resulting diminution in the overall vitality of those stocks. The defendants proffer two principal rationales for the differing treatment which Amendment 3 and Regulation 15.18 prescribe for trap and non-trap lobstering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traps are a targeted, passive method for harvesting lobster. The lobster trap rests passively on the ocean floor awaiting the lobsters, which come for bait that is designed to attract nothing but lobsters. Normally, newly molted lobsters, or \"soft shedders,\" are not caught in traps, in part because the vents in the traps permit smaller lobsters to escape from the trap. Unless the smaller lobsters can escape, there cannot be a sufficient population of mature lobsters capable of egg production, and the ASMFC's goal of rebuilding the Atlantic lobster stocks would be threatened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, non-trap methods, <i>e.g.,</i> bottom trawling, are both non-passive and non-selective. For the most part, the lobster is a coincidental and insignificant by-catch for trawlers fishing primarily for finfish. The trawler nets actively dredge the ocean floor, catching whatever species may be in their path and large enough to be caught in the mesh, and the act of trawling the bottom may cause significant shell damage to the vulnerable population of soft shell lobsters. The relatively small openings required in trawler nets in order to catch most finfish species also lead to the capture of numerous soft shedders, which likewise causes a diminution in overall egg production. For instance, seventy percent of the 131 lobsters seized from the Medeiros vessel in June 1999 were soft shedders, many of which were moribund.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these inherent differences between the trap and non-trap methods, these defendants opted to impose different limitations on each. Trap methods are more amenable to \"input\" controls, <i>viz.,</i> limiting the number and size of lobsters which will be caught in the first instance. Accordingly, Amendment 3 limited the number of traps per vessel or expedition, their overall capacity, and the minimum size of their escape vents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, such input controls were simply a less practicable and efficacious methodology for use in non-trap lobstering. For instance, had defendants prescribed that the mesh openings in a trawler net were to be made significantly larger to enable the escape of small lobsters, the trawlers' primary catch of finfish would be necessarily and severely diminished as well. ASMFC rationally adopted the 100/500 limitation because it would reasonably account for the historical, coincidental capture of lobster during finfish trawling, while deterring trawlers from deliberately targeting more lobster. Thus, ASMFC decided to impose \"output\" controls upon non-trap methodologies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants point out as well that limitations upon non-trap methodologies are essential, in that even though the lobster by-catch on the part of fishing vessels presently employing non-trap methods constituted a relatively minor percentage of the overall lobster harvest,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> fishing vessels confronted with ever-diminishing finfish stocks and/or with increasing regulatory limitations upon finfish harvesting or trap lobstering might turn increasingly to unregulated non-trap lobstering. Since non-trap methods have proven most destructive to the vulnerable population of soft shed lobsters, such a potential redirection of the vessels' efforts into non-trap lobstering eventually would undermine the essential aims of Amendment 3 and Regulation 15.18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medeiros maintains that these asserted reasons do not constitute a rational basis for equal protection purposes. He cites to the written opinions of Mark Gibson, a former DEM official, and Jan H. Reitsma, a former director of DEM, who opposed the 100/500 limit because (i) it would discriminate by placing catch limits on the non-trap sector, but none on the trap sector, and (ii) offered no conservation benefit, since non-trap landings constitute but a small fraction of the total lobster catch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However sincere these officials may have been in regard to the usefulness of the 100/500 lobster catch limits, their opinions cannot satisfy the daunting burden of demonstrating that the 100/500 limit has no conceivable rational basis. <i>See McDonald v.

The defendants aptly note that any attempt to place comparable restrictions upon the non-trap sector would be unworkable. For example, any requirement that trawling nets have larger openings in their mesh would result in the coincident loss of finfish, the trawlers' primary catch. Moreover, even if practicable input controls could be placed upon the non-trap sector, the dredging method inherently poses a greater risk of lobster mortality not presented by the trap sector. <i>See N.Y. State Trawlers Assocs. v.

First, the conclusion which they draw &#8212; that the 100/500 limit has \"no\" conservation benefit &#8212; is demonstrably false; at the very least, the 100/500 limit would have some (albeit small) conservation benefit commensurate with the relative size of the non-trap sector. More importantly, a statute or regulation is not lacking in a rational basis simply because it addresses a broader problem in small or incremental stages. <i>See City of New Orleans v. Dukes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109514\"><a href=\"/opinion/109514/new-orleans-v-dukes/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span>, 303, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109514\"><a href=\"/opinion/109514/new-orleans-v-dukes/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The <i>TVA</i> decision has direct application to the instant case, in that it involved private parties attempting to assert Tenth Amendment claims, whereas <i>New York</i> did not.

In responding that a state could never consent to an unconstitutional commandeering, the Supreme Court noted that the Amendment protects the individual citizens of the state generally by diffusing power among sovereigns, and therefore the State cannot waive a commandeering violation which in fact impinges upon that interest. <i>New York,</i> 505 U.S. at 182, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112768\"><a href=\"/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2408</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might suppose that this proposition leads inevitably to the conclusion that, if a State refuses to oppose an unlawful commandeering, an individual citizen is the only remaining party with an interest and incentive to vindicate that violation, and therefore the <i>New York</i> Court necessarily must have envisioned that the private citizen would have standing to bring suit on the Tenth Amendment claim. While this is one plausible interpretation, it is not an inexorable one. Rather, the Court may simply have intended that the State represents the interests of its citizens in general, and, if it refuses to prosecute a viable Tenth Amendment claim, the citizens of that state may have recourse to local political processes to effect change in the state's policy of acquiescence. If the Tenth Amendment is not waivable, individuals could petition state officials for redress at any time. We need not determine which interpretation is more likely, but only that it is at least debatable whether, or to what extent, the <i>New York</i> decision undermines the <i>TVA</i> holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Medeiros also notes that the Court recently granted a writ of certiorari for the purpose of deciding this very issue, <i>see Pierce County, Washington v. Guillen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122252\"><a href=\"/opinion/122252/pierce-county-v-guillen/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122252\"><a href=\"/opinion/122252/pierce-county-v-guillen/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span>, we should interpret this development as an indication of the Court's readiness to overturn <i>TVA.</i> We can draw no such inference on the basis of this development. Certiorari could mean either that the Court is interested in reexamining and/or overruling <i>TVA,</i> or that it merely intends to reaffirm <i>TVA</i> in the face of a circuit split on the issue. Those circuit court decisions which have held that private citizens possess standing to bring Tenth Amendment claims are problematic. For instance, the Eleventh Circuit's precedent commenced without any reference to <i>TVA,</i> and subsequent panels have expressed concern as to whether the omission has resulted in the perpetuation of a circuit precedent inconsistent with <i>TVA. See, e.g., Dillard v. Baldwin County Comm'rs,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></span>, 1283 &amp; n. 1 (11th Cir.2000) (Barkett, J., concurring). In addition, the Seventh Circuit has permitted a state police officer to maintain a Tenth Amendment claim that a federal regulation interfered with the officer's state law enforcement job by prohibiting persons convicted of domestic violence crimes from possessing guns, but in such specialized circumstances, it is debatable whether the plaintiff is acting in behalf of the state or simply as a private citizen. <i>See Gillespie v. City of Indianapolis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765405\"><a href=\"/opinion/765405/jerald-gillespie-v-city-of-indianapolis-indianapolis-police-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>, 702-04 (7th Cir.1999); <i>cf.

If and when the Supreme Court revisits <i>TVA,</i> it may be confronted with the question as to how a private citizen proceeds to establish a Tenth Amendment \"commandeering\" claim where the State itself has acquiesced in the federal-state arrangement. For example, if Medeiros were to possess standing, the question might arise as to whether he should be allowed discovery to determine why Rhode Island officials initially adopted Regulation 15.18, or why those officials reinstated the regulation with dispatch following its brief repeal in 2000. On the other hand, if the State cannot acquiesce in a commandeering regime, <i>see New York,</i> 505 U.S. at 182, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112768\"><a href=\"/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2408</span></a></span>, its actual motivation in enacting Regulation 15.18 might be immaterial. Finally, if private citizens possess standing to prosecute Tenth Amendment claims, it is not difficult to envision a substantial increase in such litigation before the federal courts. Given that potential, the prudential and precedential principle enunciated in <i>Rodriquez de Quijas</i> seems particularly apt. In the event <i>TVA</i> is no longer good law, it should be for the Supreme Court explicitly to overrule it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court holding that Medeiros lacks standing to pursue a Tenth Amendment claim that the Atlantic Coastal Act constitutes an unconstitutional commandeering of the Rhode Island legislative processes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As the history of Atlantic lobster regulation is complex, we confine the present discussion to the facts most material to this appeal.
