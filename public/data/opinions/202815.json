Barnes contends that the district court erred in\n\nconcluding that the affidavit submitted in support of a search\n\nwarrant demonstrated probable cause.           He also argues that the\n\nevidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction.               His final\n\ncontention is that the district court erred by relying on a prior\n\nconviction not proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in\n\nimposing his sentence.      We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1291 and 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a), and we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           In January 2005, Providence, Rhode Island, police officer\n\nNicholas Ludovici began surveillance of a residence at 91 Whatcheer\n\nAvenue (the “Whatcheer residence”) in Providence, where he saw\n\nBarnes leave the home and enter a car parked in the driveway.            In\n\nApril 2005, Detective Albert Faella of the Johnston, Rhode Island,\n\nPolice Department received information concerning Barnes from a\n\nconfidential informant (“CI”) who had proven reliable in the past.\n\nThe CI told Faella that Barnes was selling crack cocaine in\n\nJohnston, described Barnes’ car, that Barnes lived at the Whatcheer\n\nresidence, and that the CI had been in the residence many times.\n\nFaella   then     began   conducting    surveillance   of   the   Whatcheer\n\nresidence with Alan Ross, another Johnston police officer.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            Ross saw Barnes in the yard of the residence on two\n\noccasions in May 2005, and Faella saw him outside the residence on\n\ntwo different occasions in April and May.\n\n            On May 5, 2005, the CI told Faella that Barnes was going\n\nto 995 Atwood Avenue in Johnston to deliver crack cocaine to a\n\nwhite female at that address, and that Barnes would be driving a\n\nwhite Cadillac Escalade.             Faella contacted Ross, who went to the\n\naddress given by the CI and observed the transaction. After Barnes\n\nleft,    Ross   spoke    with    the    woman,   who   admitted    that   she    had\n\npurchased $100 worth of crack cocaine from Barnes.                  She gave the\n\nsubstance to Ross, and it later tested positive for cocaine.\n\n            On May 13, 2005, the CI again contacted Faella to tell\n\nhim that Barnes was going to make another delivery to 995 Atwood.\n\nFaella    and   Ross    went    to   the   Whatcheer   residence,     where     they\n\nobserved the Cadillac leave the house and followed it to 995\n\nAtwood.    After the sale, Faella, Ross, and Johnston police officer\n\nChristopher Correia stopped Barnes and arrested him.                      A white\n\nsubstance, later determined to be cocaine base, was found in the\n\nCadillac when it was searched.\n\n            Faella prepared an affidavit in support of an application\n\nfor a search warrant for the Whatcheer residence.                 Faella included\n\nin the affidavit the preceding facts, as well as a statement that,\n\non May 12, 2005, the CI told Faella that the CI observed a large\n\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fquantity of crack cocaine in a coffee can inside the Whatcheer\n\nresidence.\n\n           The search warrant was executed on May 13, 2005.            During\n\nthe search of the residence, the officers found large quantities,\n\nconsistent    with   distribution,     of    crack    and   powder   cocaine.\n\nOfficers   also   found   a   photo   of    Barnes,   two   Macy’s   invoices\n\naddressed to John Barnes at the Whatcheer residence, a cable\n\ntelevision bill similarly addressed to Barnes, a credit card\n\nreceipt in Barnes’ name, and a Sears sales receipt also with\n\nBarnes’ name.\n\n           Barnes was indicted on one count of possession with\n\nintent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base and one count\n\nof possession with intent to distribute an unspecified amount of\n\ncocaine.     Prior to trial, Barnes requested a hearing pursuant to\n\nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).              Barnes challenged the\n\ntruthfulness of the sentence in the search warrant affidavit in\n\nwhich Faella stated that the CI told him that the CI observed a\n\nlarge quantity of crack cocaine in a coffee can at the Whatcheer\n\nresidence.    The district court denied Barnes’ request for a Franks\n\nhearing, concluding that even if the contested sentence were\n\nexcluded from the affidavit, the remainder of the affidavit still\n\nsufficiently demonstrated probable cause that evidence of drug\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\ftrafficking would be found at the Whatcheer residence.1                 After an\n\ninitial jury trial resulted in a mistrial, a second jury trial\n\nreturned guilty verdicts on both counts.              The district court then\n\nsentenced Barnes to the statutory minimum term of 240 months’\n\nimprisonment.\n\nA.   Franks’ Hearing\n\n            Barnes contends that the search warrant for the Whatcheer\n\nresidence was not supported by probable cause and that the district\n\ncourt erred in its denial of an evidentiary hearing to challenge\n\nthe affidavit supporting the warrant.\n\n            A defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing under\n\nFranks    where    the   defendant     “makes   a    substantial   preliminary\n\nshowing”    that    both    (1)   “a    false       statement   knowingly     and\n\nintentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was\n\nincluded by the affiant in the warrant affidavit” and                   (2) “the\n\nallegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable\n\ncause.”    Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56.              An affidavit demonstrates\n\nprobable   cause    to   search   a    locale   \"where    information    in   the\n\naffidavit reveals 'a fair probability that contraband or evidence\n\n\n     1\n          The district court did not rule on the first prong of the\nFranks test: whether Barnes made “a substantial preliminary showing\nthat a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with\nreckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in\nthe warrant affidavit.” Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56. Instead, the\ndistrict court based its denial of an evidentiary hearing only on\nthe second prong of the Franks test, which requires that “the\nallegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable\ncause” in order for a hearing to be granted. Id.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fof a crime will be found in a particular place.'\"   United States v.\n\nSyphers, 426 F.3d 461, 464 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting United States\n\nv. Baldyga, 233 F.3d 674, 683 (1st Cir. 2000)), cert. denied, 126\n\nS. Ct. 2312 (2006).    Thus, we review the search warrant affidavit,\n\nwithout   the   contested   sentence,   to   determine   whether   it\n\ndemonstrated a fair probability of contraband being found at the\n\nWhatcheer residence.\n\n          We review the district court’s denial of a Franks hearing\n\nfor clear error.   United States v. Materas, 483 F.3d 27, 31 (1st\n\nCir. 2007). The “district court’s ruling is clearly erroneous only\n\nif ‘the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the\n\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.’”\n\nUnited States v. Castillo, 287 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting\n\nAnderson v. City of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985)).    Thus, in\n\norder to prevail, Barnes must make “a substantial preliminary\n\nshowing” that, but for the challenged paragraph of Detective\n\nFaella’s affidavit, the remaining portion would not demonstrate\n\nprobable cause, Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56, and that the district\n\ncourt’s denial of his motion was clearly erroneous.\n\n          Barnes argues, first, that the CI was unreliable because\n\nthe CI predicted that on May 5, 2005, Barnes would drive his\n\nEscalade to 995 Atwood to sell crack cocaine to a white female,\n\nwhereas the substance subsequently recovered by officers tested\n\npositive for powder cocaine, not crack cocaine. Barnes argues that\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fbecause the substance tested positive for powder cocaine, rather\n\nthan crack cocaine, this renders the CI unreliable. However, there\n\nis ample additional evidence to support the credibility of the CI,\n\nwhom the affidavit indicated was “reliable” and had supplied\n\ninformation that led to “numerous” arrests in the past.             Indeed,\n\nevery other aspect of the monitored drug deal occurred as the CI\n\npredicted; therefore, Barnes’ argument that the CI incorrectly\n\npredicted the type of cocaine being sold by Barnes is insufficient\n\nto carry the day.\n\n           Second, Barnes makes a nexus claim: that there was no\n\nprobable cause that evidence of Barnes’ drug dealing would be found\n\nat the Whatcheer residence.        Barnes notes that officers only\n\nmonitored drug sales from his Cadillac Escalade, not the Whatcheer\n\nresidence, and that Barnes’ car is registered at a different\n\naddress from the Whatcheer residence.      Barnes further argues that\n\npolice only saw him “leave” the Whatcheer residence, rather than\n\nactively   occupy   the   home.   This   court   has   repeatedly   found,\n\nhowever, that when a defendant sells drugs outside his home, it is\n\nreasonable to conclude that there is evidence of his drug dealing\n\nactivity in the home, particularly when the defendant is observed\n\nleaving the home immediately prior to selling drugs.          See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Dessesaure, 429 F.3d 359, 368-69 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(noting that when the defendant sold drugs to a person from his\n\ncar, the defendant “had just come from his apartment, making it\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\flikely that the drugs he sold . . . came from the apartment”);\n\nUnited States v. Feliz, 182 F.3d 82, 86-88 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding\n\nthat where police only observed a defendant selling drugs out of\n\nhis car, there is still probable cause to search his home, because\n\nhis home was “a likely place to seek to find incriminating items”);\n\naccord United States v. Angulo-Lopez, 791 F.2d 1394, 1399 (9th Cir.\n\n1986) (noting that \"in the case of drug dealers, evidence is likely\n\nto be found where the dealers live\").\n\n             Thus, to determine the sufficiency of the affidavit,\n\nexcluding the contested sentence, we look to “whether the ‘totality\n\nof the circumstances’ stated in the affidavit demonstrates probable\n\ncause to search either the premises or the person.”              United States\n\nv. Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Illinois\n\nv. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983)).         Here, given both that the CI\n\nstated that Barnes lived at the Whatcheer residence and that the\n\npolice observed Barnes exit the Whatcheer residence, drive away,\n\nand sell drugs on the day of his arrest and the search, the\n\ntotality of the circumstances strongly suggested that there was\n\nevidence of drug dealing at the Whatcheer residence.\n\n             Finally, Barnes argues that Faella’s affidavit, without\n\nthe    contested     sentence,   makes   a   claim   that   is    impossible,\n\nundermining a finding of probable cause.           Barnes notes that on the\n\nday of his arrest, the CI told Faella that Barnes was “on his way”\n\nto    995   Atwood   in   Johnston,   from   the   Whatcheer     residence   in\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fProvidence, to sell drugs.    Barnes argues that if he were “on his\n\nway” to Johnston, it is impossible that Faella himself responded\n\nfrom Johnston to the Whatcheer residence, a seven-minute drive from\n\nJohnston, in time to observe Barnes depart, as Faella affirms in\n\nthe affidavit.     However, “the law tells us that we are to read\n\ndescriptions in warrants (and in their supporting documents), not\n\n‘hypertechnically,’ but in a ‘commonsense’ fashion.” United States\n\nv. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955, 966 (1st Cir. 1994).              Here, Barnes’\n\nreading of the search warrant affidavit amounts to a hypertechnical\n\nparsing of the phrase “on his way,” where a more commonsense\n\nreading of the phrase is that Barnes was about to leave, although\n\nnot yet in transit.\n\n           Thus,   the   supporting    affidavit,   even    without   the\n\ncontested sentence, demonstrated that there was a fair probability\n\nthat evidence of drug dealing would be found at the Whatcheer\n\nresidence, because Barnes had been seen exiting that residence en\n\nroute to deliver drugs and because a reliable CI stated that Barnes\n\nsold drugs and lived at the Whatcheer residence.             The single\n\ncontested sentence does not undermine this conclusion.        Therefore,\n\nthe district court properly denied Barnes’ motion for a Franks\n\nhearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fB.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Barnes also argues that there is insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the verdict.     Ordinarily, a sufficiency of the evidence\n\nchallenge requires us to review\n\n            whether after viewing the evidence in the\n            light most favorable to the prosecution, any\n            rational trier of fact could have found the\n            essential elements of the crime beyond a\n            reasonable doubt. All reasonable evidentiary\n            inferences are to be drawn in harmony with the\n            [jury's]   verdict,    and   all   issues   of\n            credibility are to be resolved in the light\n            most favorable to the government.\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez-Ortiz, 455 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(alteration in original) (internal citations and quotation marks\n\nomitted), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1010 (2007).          Barnes, however,\n\nfailed to move for judgment of acquittal at the close of the\n\ngovernment’s   case,   after   the    defense   case,   or   following   the\n\nverdict, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29.              As\n\nsuch, our review of this un-preserved sufficiency claim is subject\n\nto a more limited review – for “clear and gross injustice.”         United\n\nStates v. Maldonado-Garcia, 446 F.3d 227, 230-31 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nBecause   Barnes’ un-preserved sufficiency challenge fails to meet\n\neven the more lenient standard for a preserved challenge, it\n\nnecessarily also fails to meet the “clear and gross injustice”\n\nstandard.    See United States v. Gobbi, 471 F.3d 302, 308-309 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f               The    core   of   Barnes’   argument   is    that   there   was\n\ninsufficient evidence to prove that he actually or constructively\n\npossessed the drugs found at the Whatcheer residence.                  Extensive\n\nevidence, however, links Barnes to the Whatcheer residence. First,\n\nBarnes was twice observed by police at the Whatcheer residence,\n\nonce leaving the side door in January 2005, and again on April 27,\n\n2005.       Second, Barnes was observed exiting the Whatcheer residence\n\non May 13, 2005 – the day of the search – to enter his car, in\n\nwhich officers subsequently discovered crack cocaine.                    Third,\n\nBarnes himself told Faella upon his arrest that he was coming from\n\nhis house at 91         Whatcheer.    Fourth, when officers conducted the\n\nsearch of the Whatcheer residence later that day, no one else was\n\npresent in the single-family home, and documents found in the\n\nresidence tied Barnes to the home, including a cable television\n\nbill addressed to Barnes at the Whatcheer residence.2                   Finally,\n\nsubsequent investigation confirmed that the cable service at the\n\nWhatcheer residence had been in Barnes’ name for the past four\n\nyears.\n\n               Taken together, all of this evidence easily gives rise to\n\nthe reasonable inference that Barnes resided at the Whatcheer\n\nresidence, and possessed the drugs found there.                 In response,\n\nBarnes       mounts    a     credibility    attack   and    suggests    further\n\n        2\n       Police also found: a photo of Barnes, two Macy's invoices\naddressed to John Barnes at 91 Whatcheer, a credit card receipt in\nBarnes' name, and a Sears sales receipt with Barnes' name.\n\n                                       -11-\n\finvestigative steps officers might have taken to prove that Barnes\n\nresided at the Whatcheer residence.         When evaluating a sufficiency\n\nclaim, however, “we may neither evaluate the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses nor weigh the relative merit of theories of innocence\n\npostulated by the defendant.”       Maldonado-Garcia, 446 F.3d at 231.\n\nThus, given Barnes’ own admission that he lived at the Whatcheer\n\nresidence, the multiple observations by police of Barnes at that\n\naddress, and the extensive documentary evidence found in the\n\nresidence linking Barnes to the residence, we conclude              that any\n\nrational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Barnes resided at the Whatcheer residence.\n\nC.   Sentencing Challenge\n\n           Barnes raises a constitutional challenge to the use of a\n\nprior   conviction   not   proven   to     the   jury   in   determining   his\n\nsentence, relying on three recent Supreme Court decisions, Shepard\n\nv. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005); United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. 220 (2005); and Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).\n\nThis court, however, continues       to interpret Almendarez-Torres v.\n\nUnited States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998), as permitting a criminal\n\nhistory exception.    See United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d\n\n514, 520 (1st Cir. 2006)(en banc).          This argument is, therefore,\n\nunavailing.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fIII.   Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction and\n\nthe sentence are\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f",

Barnes contends that the district court erred in concluding that the affidavit submitted in support of a search warrant demonstrated probable cause. He also argues that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction. His final contention is that the district court erred by relying on a prior conviction not proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in imposing his sentence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>In January 2005, Providence, Rhode Island, police officer Nicholas Ludovici began surveillance of a residence at 91 Whatcheer Avenue (the \"Whatcheer residence\") in Providence, where he saw Barnes leave the home and enter a car parked in the driveway. In April 2005, Detective Albert Faella of the Johnston, Rhode Island, Police Department received information concerning Barnes from a confidential informant (\"CI\") who had proven reliable in the past. The CI told Faella that Barnes was selling crack cocaine in Johnston, described Barnes' car, that Barnes lived at the Whatcheer residence, and that the CI had been in the residence many times. Faella then began conducting surveillance of the Whatcheer residence with Alan Ross, another Johnston police officer.</p>\n<p>Ross saw Barnes in the yard of the residence on two occasions in May 2005, and Faella saw him outside the residence on two different occasions in April and May.</p>\n<p>On May 5, 2005, the CI told Faella that Barnes was going to 995 Atwood Avenue in Johnston to deliver crack cocaine to a white female at that address, and that Barnes would be driving a white Cadillac Escalade. Faella contacted Ross, who went to the address given by the CI and observed the transaction. After Barnes left, Ross spoke with the woman, who admitted that she had purchased $100 worth of crack cocaine from Barnes. She gave the substance to Ross, and it later tested positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p>On May 13, 2005, the CI again contacted Faella to tell him that Barnes was going to make another delivery to 995 Atwood. Faella and Ross went to the Whatcheer residence, where they observed the Cadillac leave the house and followed it to 995 Atwood. After the sale, Faella, Ross, and Johnston police officer Christopher Correia stopped Barnes and arrested him. A white substance, later determined to be cocaine base, was found in the Cadillac when it was searched.</p>\n<p>Faella prepared an affidavit in support of an application for a search warrant for the Whatcheer residence. Faella included in the affidavit the preceding facts, as well as a statement that, on May 12, 2005, the CI told Faella that the CI observed a large quantity of crack cocaine in a coffee can inside the Whatcheer residence.</p>\n<p>The search warrant was executed on May 13, 2005. During the search of the residence, the officers found large quantities, consistent with distribution, of crack and powder cocaine. Officers also found a photo of Barnes, two Macy's invoices addressed to John Barnes at the Whatcheer residence, a cable television bill similarly addressed to Barnes, a credit card receipt <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> in Barnes' name, and a Sears sales receipt also with Barnes' name.</p>\n<p>Barnes was indicted on one count of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base and one count of possession with intent to distribute an unspecified amount of cocaine. Prior to trial, Barnes requested a hearing pursuant to <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). Barnes challenged the truthfulness of the sentence in the search warrant affidavit in which Faella stated that the CI told him that the CI observed a large quantity of crack cocaine in a coffee can at the Whatcheer residence. The district court denied Barnes' request for a <i>Franks</i> hearing, concluding that even if the contested sentence were excluded from the affidavit, the remainder of the affidavit still sufficiently demonstrated probable cause that evidence of drug trafficking would be found at the Whatcheer residence.<sup>[1]</sup> After an initial jury trial resulted in a mistrial, a second jury trial returned guilty verdicts on both counts. The district court then sentenced Barnes to the statutory minimum term of 240 months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Franks</i>' Hearing</p>\n<p>Barnes contends that the search warrant for the Whatcheer residence was not supported by probable cause and that the district court erred in its denial of an evidentiary hearing to challenge the affidavit supporting the warrant.</p>\n<p>A defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing under <i>Franks</i> where the defendant \"makes a substantial preliminary showing\" that both (1) \"a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit\" and (2) \"the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.\" <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674. An affidavit demonstrates probable cause to search a locale \"where information in the affidavit reveals `a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.'\" <i>United States v. Syphers,</i> 426 F.3d 461, 464 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>United States v. Baldyga,</i> 233 F.3d 674, 683 (1st Cir.2000)), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2312, 164 L.Ed.2d 831 (2006). Thus, we review the search warrant affidavit, without the contested sentence, to determine whether it demonstrated a fair probability of contraband being found at the Whatcheer residence.</p>\n<p>We review the district court's denial of a <i>Franks</i> hearing for clear error. <i>United States v. Materas,</i> 483 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2007). The \"district court's ruling is clearly erroneous only if `the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.'\" <i>United States v. Castillo,</i> 287 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Anderson v. City of Bessemer,</i> 470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). Thus, in order to prevail, Barnes must make \"a substantial preliminary showing\" that, but for the challenged paragraph of Detective Faella's affidavit, the remaining portion would not demonstrate probable cause, <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> and that the district court's denial of his motion was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>Barnes argues, first, that the CI was unreliable because the CI predicted that on May 5, 2005, Barnes would drive his Escalade to 995 Atwood to sell crack cocaine to a white female, whereas the substance subsequently recovered by officers tested positive for powder cocaine, not crack cocaine. Barnes argues that because the substance tested positive for powder cocaine, rather than crack cocaine, this renders the CI unreliable. However, there is ample additional evidence to support the credibility of the CI, whom the affidavit indicated was \"reliable\" and had supplied information that led to \"numerous\" arrests in the past. Indeed, every other aspect of the monitored drug deal occurred as the CI predicted; therefore, Barnes' argument that the CI incorrectly predicted the type of cocaine being sold by Barnes is insufficient to carry the day.</p>\n<p>Second, Barnes makes a nexus claim: that there was no probable cause that evidence of Barnes' drug dealing would be found at the Whatcheer residence. Barnes notes that officers only monitored drug sales from his Cadillac Escalade, not the Whatcheer residence, and that Barnes' car is registered at a different address from the Whatcheer residence. Barnes further argues that police only saw him \"leave\" the Whatcheer residence, rather than actively occupy the home. This court has repeatedly found, however, that when a defendant sells drugs outside his home, it is reasonable to conclude that there is evidence of his drug dealing activity in the home, particularly when the defendant is observed leaving the home immediately prior to selling drugs. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Dessesaure,</i> 429 F.3d 359, 368-69 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that when the defendant sold drugs to a person from his car, the defendant \"had just come from his apartment, making it likely that the drugs he sold . . . came from the apartment\"); <i>United States v. Feliz,</i> 182 F.3d 82, 86-88 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that where police only observed a defendant selling drugs out of his car, there is still probable cause to search his home, because his home was \"a likely place to seek to find incriminating items\"); <i>accord </i><i>United States v. Angulo-Lopez,</i> 791 F.2d 1394, 1399 (9th Cir.1986) (noting that \"in the case of drug dealers, evidence is likely to be found where the dealers live\").</p>\n<p>Thus, to determine the sufficiency of the affidavit, excluding the contested sentence, we look to \"whether the `totality of the circumstances' stated in the affidavit demonstrates probable cause to search either the premises or the person.\" <i>United States v. Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting <i>Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). Here, given both that the CI stated that Barnes lived at the Whatcheer residence and that the police observed Barnes exit the Whatcheer residence, drive away, and sell drugs on the day of his arrest and the search, the totality of the circumstances strongly suggested that there was evidence of drug dealing at the Whatcheer residence.</p>\n<p>Finally, Barnes argues that Faella's affidavit, without the contested sentence, makes a claim that is impossible, undermining a finding of probable cause. Barnes notes that on the day of his arrest, the CI told Faella that Barnes was \"on his way\" to 995 Atwood in Johnston, from the Whatcheer residence in Providence, to sell drugs. Barnes argues that if he were \"on his way\" to Johnston, it is impossible that Faella himself responded from Johnston to the Whatcheer residence, a seven-minute drive from Johnston, in time to observe Barnes depart, as Faella affirms in the affidavit. However, \"the law tells us that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> we are to read descriptions in warrants (and in their supporting documents), not `hypertechnically,' but in a `commonsense' fashion.\" <i>United States v. Gendron,</i> 18 F.3d 955, 966 (1st Cir.1994). Here, Barnes' reading of the search warrant affidavit amounts to a hypertechnical parsing of the phrase \"on his way,\" where a more commonsense reading of the phrase is that Barnes was about to leave, although not yet in transit.</p>\n<p>Thus, the supporting affidavit, even without the contested sentence, demonstrated that there was a fair probability that evidence of drug dealing would be found at the Whatcheer residence, because Barnes had been seen exiting that residence en route to deliver drugs and because a reliable CI stated that Barnes sold drugs and lived at the Whatcheer residence. The single contested sentence does not undermine this conclusion. Therefore, the district court properly denied Barnes' motion for a <i>Franks</i> hearing.</p>\n<p>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p>Barnes also argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the verdict. Ordinarily, a sufficiency of the evidence challenge requires us to review</p>\n<blockquote>whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. All reasonable evidentiary inferences are to be drawn in harmony with the [jury's] verdict, and all issues of credibility are to be resolved in the light most favorable to the government.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Rodriguez-Ortiz,</i> 455 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.2006) (alteration in original) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1010, 166 L.Ed.2d 759 (2007). Barnes, however, failed to move for judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's case, after the defense case, or following the verdict, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. As such, our review of this un-preserved sufficiency claim is subject to a more limited review  for \"clear and gross injustice.\" <i>United States v. Maldonado-Garcia,</i> 446 F.3d 227, 230-31 (1st Cir.2006). Because Barnes' un-preserved sufficiency challenge fails to meet even the more lenient standard for a preserved challenge, it necessarily also fails to meet the \"clear and gross injustice\" standard. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d 302, 308-309 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>The core of Barnes' argument is that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he actually or constructively possessed the drugs found at the Whatcheer residence. Extensive evidence, however, links Barnes to the Whatcheer residence. First, Barnes was twice observed by police at the Whatcheer residence, once leaving the side door in January 2005, and again on April 27, 2005. Second, Barnes was observed exiting the Whatcheer residence on May 13, 2005  the day of the search  to enter his car, in which officers subsequently discovered crack cocaine. Third, Barnes himself told Faella upon his arrest that he was coming from his house at 91 Whatcheer. Fourth, when officers conducted the search of the Whatcheer residence later that day, no one else was present in the single-family home, and documents found in the residence tied Barnes to the home, including a cable television bill addressed to Barnes at the Whatcheer residence.<sup>[2]</sup> Finally, subsequent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> investigation confirmed that the cable service at the Whatcheer residence had been in Barnes' name for the past four years.</p>\n<p>Taken together, all of this evidence easily gives rise to the reasonable inference that Barnes resided at the Whatcheer residence, and possessed the drugs found there. In response, Barnes mounts a credibility attack and suggests further investigative steps officers might have taken to prove that Barnes resided at the Whatcheer residence. When evaluating a sufficiency claim, however, \"we may neither evaluate the credibility of the witnesses nor weigh the relative merit of theories of innocence postulated by the defendant.\" <i>Maldonado-Garcia,</i> 446 F.3d at 231. Thus, given Barnes' own admission that he lived at the Whatcheer residence, the multiple observations by police of Barnes at that address, and the extensive documentary evidence found in the residence linking Barnes to the residence, we conclude that any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Barnes resided at the Whatcheer residence.</p>\n<p>C. Sentencing Challenge</p>\n<p>Barnes raises a constitutional challenge to the use of a prior conviction not proven to the jury in determining his sentence, relying on three recent Supreme Court decisions, <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); and <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). This court, however, continues to interpret <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), as permitting a criminal history exception. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 520 (1st Cir.2006)(en banc). This argument is, therefore, unavailing.</p>\n<p>II. Conclusion</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction and the sentence are</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The district court did not rule on the first prong of the <i>Franks</i> test: whether Barnes made \"a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit.\" <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674.

Barnes contends that the district court erred in concluding that the affidavit submitted in support of a search warrant demonstrated probable cause. He also argues that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction. His final contention is that the district court erred by relying on a prior conviction not proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in imposing his sentence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>In January 2005, Providence, Rhode Island, police officer Nicholas Ludovici began surveillance of a residence at 91 Whatcheer Avenue (the \"Whatcheer residence\") in Providence, where he saw Barnes leave the home and enter a car parked in the driveway. In April 2005, Detective Albert Faella of the Johnston, Rhode Island, Police Department received information concerning Barnes from a confidential informant (\"CI\") who had proven reliable in the past. The CI told Faella that Barnes was selling crack cocaine in Johnston, described Barnes' car, that Barnes lived at the Whatcheer residence, and that the CI had been in the residence many times. Faella then began conducting surveillance of the Whatcheer residence with Alan Ross, another Johnston police officer.</p>\n<p>Ross saw Barnes in the yard of the residence on two occasions in May 2005, and Faella saw him outside the residence on two different occasions in April and May.</p>\n<p>On May 5, 2005, the CI told Faella that Barnes was going to 995 Atwood Avenue in Johnston to deliver crack cocaine to a white female at that address, and that Barnes would be driving a white Cadillac Escalade. Faella contacted Ross, who went to the address given by the CI and observed the transaction. After Barnes left, Ross spoke with the woman, who admitted that she had purchased $100 worth of crack cocaine from Barnes. She gave the substance to Ross, and it later tested positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p>On May 13, 2005, the CI again contacted Faella to tell him that Barnes was going to make another delivery to 995 Atwood. Faella and Ross went to the Whatcheer residence, where they observed the Cadillac leave the house and followed it to 995 Atwood. After the sale, Faella, Ross, and Johnston police officer Christopher Correia stopped Barnes and arrested him. A white substance, later determined to be cocaine base, was found in the Cadillac when it was searched.</p>\n<p>Faella prepared an affidavit in support of an application for a search warrant for the Whatcheer residence. Faella included in the affidavit the preceding facts, as well as a statement that, on May 12, 2005, the CI told Faella that the CI observed a large quantity of crack cocaine in a coffee can inside the Whatcheer residence.</p>\n<p>The search warrant was executed on May 13, 2005. During the search of the residence, the officers found large quantities, consistent with distribution, of crack and powder cocaine. Officers also found a photo of Barnes, two Macy's invoices addressed to John Barnes at the Whatcheer residence, a cable television bill similarly addressed to Barnes, a credit card receipt <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> in Barnes' name, and a Sears sales receipt also with Barnes' name.</p>\n<p>Barnes was indicted on one count of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base and one count of possession with intent to distribute an unspecified amount of cocaine. Prior to trial, Barnes requested a hearing pursuant to <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span> (1978). Barnes challenged the truthfulness of the sentence in the search warrant affidavit in which Faella stated that the CI told him that the CI observed a large quantity of crack cocaine in a coffee can at the Whatcheer residence. The district court denied Barnes' request for a <i>Franks</i> hearing, concluding that even if the contested sentence were excluded from the affidavit, the remainder of the affidavit still sufficiently demonstrated probable cause that evidence of drug trafficking would be found at the Whatcheer residence.<sup>[1]</sup> After an initial jury trial resulted in a mistrial, a second jury trial returned guilty verdicts on both counts. The district court then sentenced Barnes to the statutory minimum term of 240 months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Franks</i>' Hearing</p>\n<p>Barnes contends that the search warrant for the Whatcheer residence was not supported by probable cause and that the district court erred in its denial of an evidentiary hearing to challenge the affidavit supporting the warrant.</p>\n<p>A defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing under <i>Franks</i> where the defendant \"makes a substantial preliminary showing\" that both (1) \"a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit\" and (2) \"the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.\" <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 155-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Gates,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 238, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2317</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span> (1983)). Here, given both that the CI stated that Barnes lived at the Whatcheer residence and that the police observed Barnes exit the Whatcheer residence, drive away, and sell drugs on the day of his arrest and the search, the totality of the circumstances strongly suggested that there was evidence of drug dealing at the Whatcheer residence.</p>\n<p>Finally, Barnes argues that Faella's affidavit, without the contested sentence, makes a claim that is impossible, undermining a finding of probable cause. Barnes notes that on the day of his arrest, the CI told Faella that Barnes was \"on his way\" to 995 Atwood in Johnston, from the Whatcheer residence in Providence, to sell drugs. Barnes argues that if he were \"on his way\" to Johnston, it is impossible that Faella himself responded from Johnston to the Whatcheer residence, a seven-minute drive from Johnston, in time to observe Barnes depart, as Faella affirms in the affidavit. However, \"the law tells us that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> we are to read descriptions in warrants (and in their supporting documents), not `hypertechnically,' but in a `commonsense' fashion.\" <i>United States v. Gendron,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195225\"><a href=\"/opinion/195225/united-states-v-gendron/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span>, 966 (1st Cir.1994). Here, Barnes' reading of the search warrant affidavit amounts to a hypertechnical parsing of the phrase \"on his way,\" where a more commonsense reading of the phrase is that Barnes was about to leave, although not yet in transit.</p>\n<p>Thus, the supporting affidavit, even without the contested sentence, demonstrated that there was a fair probability that evidence of drug dealing would be found at the Whatcheer residence, because Barnes had been seen exiting that residence en route to deliver drugs and because a reliable CI stated that Barnes sold drugs and lived at the Whatcheer residence. The single contested sentence does not undermine this conclusion. Therefore, the district court properly denied Barnes' motion for a <i>Franks</i> hearing.</p>\n<p>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p>Barnes also argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the verdict. Ordinarily, a sufficiency of the evidence challenge requires us to review</p>\n<blockquote>whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. All reasonable evidentiary inferences are to be drawn in harmony with the [jury's] verdict, and all issues of credibility are to be resolved in the light most favorable to the government.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Rodriguez-Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795065\"><a href=\"/opinion/795065/united-states-v-arsenio-rodriguez-ortiz-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2006) (alteration in original) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></span> (2007). Barnes, however, failed to move for judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's case, after the defense case, or following the verdict, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. As such, our review of this un-preserved sufficiency claim is subject to a more limited review  for \"clear and gross injustice.\" <i>United States v. Maldonado-Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202192\"><a href=\"/opinion/202192/united-states-v-maldonado-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 230-31 (1st Cir.2006). Because Barnes' un-preserved sufficiency challenge fails to meet even the more lenient standard for a preserved challenge, it necessarily also fails to meet the \"clear and gross injustice\" standard. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gobbi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202578\"><a href=\"/opinion/202578/united-states-v-gobbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 308-309 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>The core of Barnes' argument is that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he actually or constructively possessed the drugs found at the Whatcheer residence. Extensive evidence, however, links Barnes to the Whatcheer residence. First, Barnes was twice observed by police at the Whatcheer residence, once leaving the side door in January 2005, and again on April 27, 2005. Second, Barnes was observed exiting the Whatcheer residence on May 13, 2005  the day of the search  to enter his car, in which officers subsequently discovered crack cocaine. Third, Barnes himself told Faella upon his arrest that he was coming from his house at 91 Whatcheer. Fourth, when officers conducted the search of the Whatcheer residence later that day, no one else was present in the single-family home, and documents found in the residence tied Barnes to the home, including a cable television bill addressed to Barnes at the Whatcheer residence.<sup>[2]</sup> Finally, subsequent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> investigation confirmed that the cable service at the Whatcheer residence had been in Barnes' name for the past four years.</p>\n<p>Taken together, all of this evidence easily gives rise to the reasonable inference that Barnes resided at the Whatcheer residence, and possessed the drugs found there. In response, Barnes mounts a credibility attack and suggests further investigative steps officers might have taken to prove that Barnes resided at the Whatcheer residence. When evaluating a sufficiency claim, however, \"we may neither evaluate the credibility of the witnesses nor weigh the relative merit of theories of innocence postulated by the defendant.\" <i>Maldonado-Garcia,</i> 446 F.3d at 231. Thus, given Barnes' own admission that he lived at the Whatcheer residence, the multiple observations by police of Barnes at that address, and the extensive documentary evidence found in the residence linking Barnes to the residence, we conclude that any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Barnes resided at the Whatcheer residence.</p>\n<p>C. Sentencing Challenge</p>\n<p>Barnes raises a constitutional challenge to the use of a prior conviction not proven to the jury in determining his sentence, relying on three recent Supreme Court decisions, <i>Shepard v.

This argument is, therefore, unavailing.</p>\n<p>II. Conclusion</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction and the sentence are</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The district court did not rule on the first prong of the <i>Franks</i> test: whether Barnes made \"a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit.\" <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 155-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Instead, the district court based its denial of an evidentiary hearing only on the second prong of the <i>Franks</i> test, which requires that \"the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause\" in order for a hearing to be granted. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  Police also found: a photo of Barnes, two Macy's invoices addressed to John Barnes at 91 Whatcheer, a credit card receipt in Barnes' name, and a Sears sales receipt with Barnes' name.</p>\n\n</div>",
