Petitioner Aziza Ali appeals\n\nthe   Board    of     Immigration       Appeals's       (\"BIA\")    affirmance        of   an\n\nImmigration         Judge's    denial     of    her     applications      for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture.      We affirm.\n\n                                   I.    Background\n\n              Ali, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, entered the United\n\nStates at Washington, D.C., on June 23, 1999, as a nonimmigrant\n\nauthorized to remain in the United States until December 22, 1999.\n\nShe overstayed her visa, and on November 29, 2000, the Immigration\n\nand Naturalization Service (\"INS\")1 issued a Notice to Appear\n\ncharging      Ali    with     removability       under    §    237(a)(1)(B)     of        the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1227 (a)(1)(B),\n\nfor   remaining       in    the   United       States    for   a   time     longer    than\n\npermitted.\n\n              In written pleadings dated March 13, 2002, Ali admitted\n\nthe factual allegations against her, conceded removability, and\n\nrequested      asylum,        withholding       of    removal,     relief    under        the\n\nConvention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), and voluntary departure.                              Ali\n\ntestified at a hearing before an Immigration Judge on August 30,\n\n2002 that she was the head of the home economics department at\n\n\n1\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fKotebe College of Teacher Education, located in Addis Ababa, from\n\n1973 until she came to the United States in 1999.               She stated that,\n\nin 1974, the king of Ethiopia was overthrown and that, under the\n\nnew communist regime, \"[a]ll people, those people who are holding\n\noffice,   were     expected    to,   to    align   with     the    revolutionary\n\ngovernment.\"      The new regime assigned Ali to work as a chairperson\n\nwith a women's association in her kebele, a village or municipal\n\nunit. She served as the chairperson from 1978 until 1984, when she\n\ncame to the United States to study.           Ali returned to Ethiopia in\n\n1986 and once again became involved with the women's association.\n\nAli was also involved with a community watch group whose goals were\n\nto decrease domestic violence, alcoholism, and the number of\n\nrunaway children.\n\n            In September 1988, Ali remarried and moved to another\n\nkebele,   where    she   was   recruited    and    became   a     member   of   the\n\nEthiopian Labor Union Party.2        She testified that, in 1991, a new\n\nregime took over.        This regime considered all members of the\n\nEthiopian Labor Union Party to be supporters of the previous\n\ngovernment.      As a result, Ali was required to sign in with the\n\nlocal authorities each week and could not leave her town on\n\nweekends.\n\n\n2\n  The Ethiopian Labor Union Party (also called the Worker's Party)\nwas the party of the communist regime in control of the country at\nthe time. While Ali had worked for the women's association in her\nprior kebele, she did not officially join the Ethiopian Labor union\nParty until she remarried and moved.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f          Ali testified that, in June of 1993, three men, two of\n\nthem armed, came to her home in the middle of night.       One of the\n\nmen, named Bereket Gebre Egziabeher (\"Egziabeher\"), was the head\n\nrepresentative of Ali's kebele.     Ali testified that the men took\n\nAli to the kebele office, telling her they wanted to know what she\n\ndid for the former regime.    Once at the office, Egziabeher took Ali\n\ninto a separate room.     Ali testified that he put a pistol on a\n\ntable and began asking questions about Ali's involvement with the\n\nformer regime.   During questioning, Egziabeher hit and pushed Ali.\n\nAli testified that he then raped her, hit her on the face, and\n\nwarned her that he would kill her if she ever said anything.       The\n\ntwo other men then drove Ali home.       She did not tell her husband\n\nabout the rape because of Egziabeher's warning.         Ali testified\n\nthat, as a result of the assault, she missed a week of work.        On\n\ncross examination, Ali admitted that she did not mention the rape\n\nin her asylum interview because she did not want to talk about it.\n\n          Ali testified that she eventually returned to work and\n\nremained in her position as head of the home economics department\n\nuntil she left Ethiopia in 1999.        She lived at the same location\n\nand remained in the same kebele from the time of the rape until the\n\ntime she left Ethiopia.      In 1997, Ali traveled to India and the\n\nPhillippines for three weeks as part of her job.       Ali did not ask\n\nfor asylum or refugee status in either India or the Phillippines,\n\nand returned home at the end of her trip.       Ali was able to obtain\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fexit visas for her trips to India, the Phillippines, and the United\n\nStates without problems.\n\n            Ali testified that between 1993 and 1999, the government\n\narrested many other people who had been members of the Ethiopian\n\nLabor Union Party; Ali herself was not harmed or arrested again.\n\nIn March 1999, Seleshe Peshome (\"Peshome\"), the chairperson at\n\nAli's former kebele, was arrested by the government.                  Ali had not\n\nseen Peshome for eleven years, but she testified that hearing of\n\nhis arrest contributed to her desire to remain in the United\n\nStates.\n\n            In an oral decision after the hearing on August 30, 2002,\n\nthe   Immigration    Judge    denied       Ali's   applications      for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the CAT, and granted her\n\nrequest for voluntary departure on or before October 29, 2002.                  On\n\nSeptember   16,    2002,    Ali    filed     a   motion   to    reconsider.     On\n\nSeptember 27, 2002, Ali appealed the Immigration Judge's August 30,\n\n2002 decision to the BIA.           On October 11, 2002, the Immigration\n\nJudge   denied    Ali's    motion    to    reconsider.         Ali   appealed   the\n\nImmigration Judge's denial of her motion to reconsider to the BIA\n\non November 15, 2002.             On May 7, 2004, the BIA affirmed the\n\nAugust 30, 2002 decision of the Immigration Judge, and found that\n\nthe Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction to consider Ali's motion\n\nto reconsider, because jurisdiction of Ali's case vested with the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fBIA when she appealed the Immigration Judge's August 30, 2002\n\ndecision.    This appeal followed.3\n\n                              II.      Analysis\n\nA.   Burden of Proof and Standard of Review\n\n            In order to be eligible for asylum, Ali has the burden of\n\nestablishing that she is a refugee.               8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(a).       The term \"refugee\" means any person who is\n\noutside of their home country and \"is unable or unwilling to return\n\nto, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the\n\nprotection of, that country because of persecution or a well-\n\nfounded     fear   of   persecution     on   account    of   race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion . . . .\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).            Ali may therefore meet\n\nher burden by demonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution on account of one of the five statutory\n\ngrounds.     8 C.F.R § 208.13(b).\n\n             To establish past persecution, an applicant must provide\n\n\"conclusive evidence\" that she was targeted on any of the five\n\ngrounds.    Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2003).           To\n\nshow   a   well-founded    fear   of   future     persecution,   \"the   asylum\n\n\n3\n   Ali's brief only addressed the BIA's denial of her application\nfor asylum.    She makes no argument regarding withholding of\nremoval, relief under the CAT, or the BIA' determination that the\nImmigration Judge lacked jurisdiction to consider her motion to\nreconsider.   Ali has therefore waived any challenge to these\nissues.   See Qin v. Ashcroft, 360 F.3d 302, 305 n.5 (1st Cir.\n2004).\n\n                                       -6-\n\fapplicant's fear must be both genuine and objectively reasonable.\"\n\nAguilar-Solís v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).                  An\n\napplicant who has proven past persecution is \"presumed to have a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution unless the agency can prove\n\notherwise.\"      Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 18.   \"An applicant must support\n\nhis   claim    through   credible   testimony   at   all   stages   of   the\n\nproceedings, and if the testimony is credible, it may be sufficient\n\nto sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\" Settenda v.\n\nAshcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004)(internal quotation marks\n\nand citations omitted).\n\n              We review decisions of the BIA under the substantial\n\nevidence standard. Mihaylov v. Ashcroft, 379 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n2004). Under this standard, the BIA's decision will be upheld if it\n\nis \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\" INS v. Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992)(quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(4)).               Under this\n\nstandard, \"[t]o reverse the BIA finding, we must find that the\n\nevidence not only supports that conclusion, but compels it . . . .\"\n\nId. at 481 n.1 (emphasis in original).\n\nB.    Past Persecution\n\n              Ali first argues that she has proven past persecution on\n\naccount of her political opinion, due to her membership in the\n\nEthiopian Labor Union Party and her history of political and\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fcommunity activity in Ethiopia.                She bases this argument on her\n\ntestimony regarding her arrest, beating and rape by Egziabeher.\n\n              The Immigration Judge, while making clear that he could\n\nnot be sure that Ali was lying, nevertheless found Ali's story\n\nlacking in credibility.           He based this finding on several factors,\n\namong them that Ali did not mention the rape until her hearing on\n\nAugust 30, 2002.        The Immigration Judge stated that, while he\n\nunderstood that Ali may have been ashamed and fearful of discussing\n\nthe   rape,    he   found    it    hard   to    believe     \"that   such   a   highly\n\nmotivated, well-educated, and leader in the community would come to\n\nthe United States and appear for her political asylum interview and\n\nnot mention to the interviewer that she had been brutally raped by\n\na representative of the Ethiopian government.\"                      Noting that the\n\nasylum officer who interviewed Ali was a woman, the Immigration\n\nJudge stated that \"the respondent had every opportunity to testify\n\nwith respect to the occurrence of a brutal rape to another woman,\n\nespecially in light of the respondent's past history and record of\n\nwomen's right[s]      activism.\"       The Immigration Judge also based his\n\ndecision on the fact that, before and after the rape, Ali worked\n\nfor   the   Ethiopian       government     as   head   of    the    home   economics\n\ndepartment at Kotebe College, that she received exit visas and that\n\nshe was allowed to travel out of the country on several occasions.\n\nThe BIA also found it relevant that, after the alleged rape, Ali\n\nwas not harmed again by anyone, including the man who raped her.\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fThe BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge because of Ali's failure to\n\nmention the rape to the asylum officer who interviewed her.\n\n             \"[W]hen a hearing officer who saw and heard a witness\n\nmakes an adverse credibility determination and supports it with\n\nspecific findings, an appellate court ordinarily should accord it\n\nsignificant respect.\"          Aguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 571. In this\n\ncase, the Immigration Judge and BIA found that Ali failed to meet\n\nher burden of proof because of credibility problems and supported\n\nthis determination with specific findings that \"amply justified the\n\n.    .   .   conclusion      that    the   petitioner's       testimony    lacked\n\ncredibility.\"         Id.   We therefore affirm the decision of the BIA\n\nregarding past persecution.\n\nC.   Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n             Because Ali has not proven past persecution, she is not\n\nentitled     to   a    presumption   of    a   well-founded    fear   of   future\n\npersecution.      Therefore, to demonstrate a well-founded fear, Ali\n\nmust \"establish not only that [she] harbors a subjectively genuine\n\nfear of future persecution but also that an objectively reasonable\n\nbasis for that fear exists.\"           DaSilva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).        We focus our discussion on the objective prong.\n\n             Ali bases her argument that she has a well-founded fear\n\non several grounds: (1) her arrest and rape, and the threats to\n\nkill her and her family if she told anyone; (2) the evidence she\n\npresented regarding the treatment of people suspected of having\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fties with the former communist regime; and (3) the arrest of her\n\nformer colleague, Peshome.\n\n            After    reviewing    the    record,     we   find    that    there   is\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the determination that Ali did not\n\nhave a well-founded fear of future persecution.                  Ali lived in the\n\nsame home for six years after the rape without incident.                          She\n\nmaintained her job with the government, and was allowed to obtain\n\nexit visas and leave the country to go to India, the Phillippines,\n\nand the United States.      She did not request asylum in India or the\n\nPhillippines.       Her family safely remains in Ethiopia, and one of\n\nher sons works for the government-owned airline.                         Her former\n\ncolleague who was arrested was a man she had not seen for eleven\n\nyears, and it appears that Ali merely assumed that the arrest was\n\nbecause of his political activities. Given these facts, we are not\n\ncompelled to conclude that an objectively reasonable basis for\n\nAli's fear exists.        We therefore affirm the decision regarding\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.\n\n                             III.       Conclusion\n\n            For   the   reasons     stated     above,     the    BIA's    order   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f",

She stated that, in 1974, the king of Ethiopia was overthrown and that, under the new communist regime, \"[a]ll people, those people who are holding office, were expected to, to align with the revolutionary government.\" The new regime assigned Ali to work as a chairperson with a women's association in her kebele, a village or municipal unit.

She bases this argument on her testimony regarding her arrest, beating and rape by Egziabeher.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge, while making clear that he could not be sure that Ali was lying, nevertheless found Ali's story lacking in credibility. He based this finding on several factors, among them that Ali did not mention the rape until her hearing on August 30, 2002. The Immigration Judge stated that, while he understood that Ali may have been ashamed and fearful of discussing the rape, he found it hard to believe \"that such a highly motivated, well-educated, and leader in the community would come to the United States and appear for her political asylum interview and not mention to the interviewer that she had been brutally raped by a representative of the Ethiopian government.\" Noting that the asylum officer who interviewed Ali was a woman, the Immigration Judge stated that \"the respondent had every opportunity to testify with respect to the occurrence of a brutal rape to another woman, especially in light of the respondent's past history and record of women's right[s] activism.\" The Immigration Judge also based his decision on the fact that, before and after the rape, Ali worked for the Ethiopian government as head of the home economics department at Kotebe College, that she received exit visas and that she was allowed to travel out of the country on several occasions. The BIA also found it relevant that, after the alleged rape, Ali was not harmed again by anyone, including the man who raped her. The BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge because of Ali's failure to mention the rape to the asylum officer who interviewed her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[W]hen a hearing officer who saw and heard a witness makes an adverse credibility determination and supports it with specific findings, an appellate court ordinarily should accord it significant respect.\" <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 571. In this case, the Immigration Judge and BIA found that Ali failed to meet her burden of proof because of credibility problems and supported this determination with specific findings that \"amply justified the ... conclusion that the petitioner's testimony lacked credibility.\" <i>Id.</i> We therefore affirm the decision of the BIA regarding past persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Ali has not proven past persecution, she is not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Therefore, to demonstrate a well-founded fear, Ali must \"establish not only that [she] harbors a subjectively genuine fear of future persecution but also that an objectively reasonable basis for that fear exists.\" <i>DaSilva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005). We focus our discussion on the objective prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ali bases her argument that she has a well-founded fear on several grounds: (1) her arrest and rape, and the threats to kill her and her family if she told anyone; (2) the evidence she presented regarding the treatment of people suspected of having ties with the former communist regime; and (3) the arrest of her former colleague, Peshome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we find that there is substantial evidence to support the determination that Ali did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Ali lived in the same home for six years after the rape without incident. She maintained her job with the government, and was allowed to obtain exit visas and leave the country to go to India, the Philippines, and the United States. She did not request asylum in India or the Philippines. Her family safely remains in Ethiopia, and one of her sons works for the government-owned airline. Her former colleague who was arrested was a man she had not seen for eleven years, and it appears that Ali merely assumed that the arrest was because of his political activities. Given these facts, we are not compelled to conclude that an objectively reasonable basis for Ali's fear exists. We therefore affirm the decision regarding well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the BIA's order is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as United States Attorney General on February 3, 2005.

She overstayed her visa, and on November 29, 2000, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> issued a Notice to Appear charging Ali with removability under &#167; 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B), for remaining in the United States for a time longer than permitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In written pleadings dated March 13, 2002, Ali admitted the factual allegations against her, conceded removability, and requested asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), and voluntary departure. Ali testified at a hearing before an Immigration Judge on August 30, 2002 that she was the head of the home economics department at Kotebe College of Teacher Education, located in Addis Ababa, from 1973 until she came to the United States in 1999. She stated that, in 1974, the king of Ethiopia was overthrown and that, under the new communist regime, \"[a]ll people, those people who are holding office, were expected to, to align with the revolutionary government.\" The new regime assigned Ali to work as a chairperson with a women's association in her kebele, a village or municipal unit. She served as the chairperson from 1978 until 1984, when she came to the United States to study. Ali returned to Ethiopia in 1986 and once again became involved with the women's association. Ali was also involved with a community watch group whose goals were to decrease domestic violence, alcoholism, and the number of runaway children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1988, Ali remarried and moved to another kebele, where she was recruited and became a member of the Ethiopian Labor Union Party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> She testified that, in 1991, a new regime took over. This regime considered all members of the Ethiopian Labor Union Party to be supporters of the previous government.

One of the men, named Bereket Gebre Egziabeher (\"Egziabeher\"), was the head representative of Ali's kebele. Ali testified that the men took Ali to the kebele office, telling her they wanted to know what she did for the former regime. Once at the office, Egziabeher took Ali into a separate room. Ali testified that he put a pistol on a table and began asking questions about Ali's involvement with the former regime. During questioning, Egziabeher hit and pushed Ali. Ali testified that he then raped her, hit her on the face, and warned her that he would kill her if she ever said anything. The two other men then drove Ali home. She did not tell her husband about the rape because of Egziabeher's warning. Ali testified that, as a result of the assault, she missed a week of work.

Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Ali has not proven past persecution, she is not entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Therefore, to demonstrate a well-founded fear, Ali must \"establish not only that [she] harbors a subjectively genuine fear of future persecution but also that an objectively reasonable basis for that fear exists.\" <i>DaSilva v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201398\"><a href=\"/opinion/201398/da-silva-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2005). We focus our discussion on the objective prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ali bases her argument that she has a well-founded fear on several grounds: (1) her arrest and rape, and the threats to kill her and her family if she told anyone; (2) the evidence she presented regarding the treatment of people suspected of having ties with the former communist regime; and (3) the arrest of her former colleague, Peshome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we find that there is substantial evidence to support the determination that Ali did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Ali lived in the same home for six years after the rape without incident. She maintained her job with the government, and was allowed to obtain exit visas and leave the country to go to India, the Philippines, and the United States. She did not request asylum in India or the Philippines. Her family safely remains in Ethiopia, and one of her sons works for the government-owned airline. Her former colleague who was arrested was a man she had not seen for eleven years, and it appears that Ali merely assumed that the arrest was because of his political activities. Given these facts, we are not compelled to conclude that an objectively reasonable basis for Ali's fear exists. We therefore affirm the decision regarding well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the BIA's order is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as United States Attorney General on February 3, 2005.
