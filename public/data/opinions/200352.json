Murphy, Andrew G. Lizotte and Hanify & King, P.C. on\nbrief for appellees Donald F. Farrell, Harold B. Murphy, and Hanify\n& King, P.C.\n     Paul D. Moore, Anthony J. Fitzpatrick, Mobina F. Mohsin and\nDuane Morris LLP on brief for appellee Stephen S. Gray.\n\n\n\n                          February 24, 2003\n\f           Per Curiam.    Alphonse Mourad appeals from the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's dismissal of his claims, which were removed from state\n\ncourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1452(a), and its denial of his motion\n\nto remand.1   The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the First Circuit\n\naffirmed the bankruptcy court judgment and adopted its findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law.           On appeal, we review the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's findings of fact for clear error, and afford de novo review\n\nto its conclusions of law.         In re Healthco Int'l, Inc., 132 F.3d\n\n104, 107 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            Appellees--Trustee Stephen Gray and the Hanify & King\n\nfirm (\"H&K\") and the latter's attorneys--argue that this court\n\nlacks    jurisdiction    to    review   the   bankruptcy     court's   decision\n\ndenying Mourad's motion to remand this case to state court.              See 28\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1452(b) (2000).         However, Mourad argues that \"the U.S.\n\nBankruptcy Court has no or questionable jurisdiction to rule upon\n\nany matters regarding the State Court malpractice suit filed in the\n\nSuffolk Superior Court.\"        Because this argument attacks the lower\n\ncourt's subject matter jurisdiction, we not only have jurisdiction\n\nto review but are obligated to do so.          See Things Remembered, Inc.\n\nv.   Petrarca,   516    U.S.    124,    131   n.1   (1995)    (Ginsburg,   J.,\n\nconcurring)(citing Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U.S.\n\n379, 382 (1884)); In re Celotex Corp., 124 F.3d 619, 625 (4th Cir.\n\n\n\n     1\n       The bankruptcy court granted the motion to remand one of\nMourad's claims but dismissed the remaining claims on non-\njurisdictional grounds.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f1997).\n\n          Mourad's state law claims consist of various allegations\n\nof fraud, professional malpractice, and breach of fiduciary duty on\n\nthe part of Gray, H&K and its attorneys who served as legal counsel\n\nto the debtor corporation (\"the Debtor\" or \"V&M\").      The claims\n\nretained by the bankruptcy court wholly arise out of the trustee\n\nand counsel's performance of their duties with respect to the\n\nDebtor after the petition for bankruptcy was filed, and we have\n\nlittle difficulty in finding that these state law claims are civil\n\nproceedings \"arising under title 11, or arising in or related to [a\n\ncase] under title 11.\"   28 U.S.C. ยง 1334(b) (2000). See, e.g., In\n\nre Southmark Corp., 163 F.3d 925, 931 (5th Cir. 1999) (finding\n\njurisdiction over accountant malpractice claims), cert. denied, 527\n\nU.S. 1004 (1999).\n\n          Whether these state law claims are core or non-core is\n\nlargely immaterial--Mourad never challenged the district court's\n\nreference of these claims to the bankruptcy court, see 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n157 (2000)--except to the extent that this distinction might shed\n\nlight on how to classify Mourad's claims under the jurisdictional\n\nheadings of section 1334(b).   But this further question (whether\n\nhis claims qualify for the \"arise under\" or \"arise in\" heading\n\nrather than the \"relate to\" heading) is not presented to us, for\n\nMourad has not moved for mandatory abstention pursuant to section\n\n1334(c)(2), see also Fed. R. Bankr. P. 5011, and the abstention\n\nprovision, which is waivable by the parties, does not detract from\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fthe district court's subject matter jurisdiction. See Celotex, 124\n\nF.3d at 627 n.4.        Mourad's jurisdictional attack having failed,\n\nthere is no other ground upon which a review of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's remand decision can be had.         28 U.S.C. ยง 1452(b).\n\n            This brings us to the issue of Mourad's standing to bring\n\nthese     claims   as   former   president,    sole   director   and    sole\n\nshareholder of V&M. In dismissing Mourad's non-remanded claims for\n\nlack of standing, the bankruptcy court found that Mourad was\n\nprecluded from re-litigating the issue of his standing.          The court\n\nrelied upon its prior ruling, as part of the confirmation of the\n\nreorganization plan, that Mourad's equity interest in the Debtor\n\nhad no value.      The court also relied upon the preclusion effect of\n\nits prior determinations, in at least three proceedings in the V&M\n\nbankruptcy case, that Mourad lacked standing.\n\n            Applying    the   doctrine    of   collateral   estoppel,    the\n\nbankruptcy court concluded that its prior ruling on the value of\n\nMourad's equity interest precluded him from contending that his\n\nequity interest \"had (or could have) such value as would give him\n\nstanding in the present matter.\"         Because the only harm to himself\n\nwhich Mourad's non-remanded claims alleged was in his capacity as\n\nan equity security holder in the Debtor, the court reasoned, he was\n\nprecluded from arguing that he had standing to pursue the present\n\nclaims.\n\n            In support of his standing, Mourad now disputes the\n\nbankruptcy court's finding that his equity interest in the Debtor\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fhad no value.    We agree with the bankruptcy court that Mourad is\n\nprecluded from re-litigating the issue of the value of his equity\n\ninterest.    As the bankruptcy court stated, \"[b]y the 1997 order\n\nconfirming the Joint Plan of Reorganization, the [bankruptcy court]\n\nhas already adjudicated that Mr. Mourad's equity interest in the\n\nDebtor is of no value.\"       The requirements of issue preclusion are\n\nsatisfied. See Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).2\n\n            Mourad attempts on appeal, as he did in his opposition to\n\ndefendants' motion to dismiss, to base his standing on his 1)\n\npersonal    liability   (as   sole    shareholder   of   a   subchapter   S\n\ncorporation) for certain debts owed by the Debtor, and 2) stake in\n\nthe opportunity to recover the value of his equity.           We need not\n\ndecide whether standing can be supported on these grounds, because\n\nthese allegations could have been raised in the prior bankruptcy\n\nproceedings where Mourad's standing was adjudicated. To the extent\n\nthat Mourad now seeks to add these new (but previously available)\n\nfactual allegations to establish his standing to bring the present\n\nclaims, such assertions do not defeat the bar of issue preclusion.\n\nSee Perry v. Sheahan, 222 F.3d 309, 318 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n            In his brief on appeal, Mourad does not dispute (and\n\n     2\n       Specifically, the bankruptcy court found that \"Mr. Mourad\nwas a party to and active participant in the Plan confirmation\nprocess; this matter was actually litigated; the quantification of\nMr. Mourad's interest was necessary for confirmation of the plan;\nand the confirmation order is a valid final judgment.\" Mourad has\nnot disputed any of those findings, nor does there appear to be any\nvalid basis for doing so.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fappears to concede) that the issue of standing has been previously\n\nadjudicated.   His only challenge to the court's dismissal of his\n\nclaims on preclusion grounds is that \"the [bankruptcy court] has\n\nbeen and continues to be biased towards Mourad.\"   This contention,\n\nwhich is based on judicial rulings against him, is groundless. See\n\nLiteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 554 (1994). Moreover,\n\nMourad's brief contains no developed argument challenging the\n\nbankruptcy court's determination of no bias (made in connection\n\nwith denial of the motion for recusal in this case).   \"Our general\n\nrule with regard to such poorly developed arguments is to treat\n\nthem as forfeited.\" Donahue v. City of Boston, 304 F.3d 110, 122\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n     The bankruptcy appellate panel's decision dated February 26,\n\n2001, is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",

The claims retained by the bankruptcy court wholly arise out of the trustee and counsel's performance of their duties with respect to the Debtor after the petition for bankruptcy was filed, and we have little difficulty in finding that these state law claims are civil proceedings \"arising under title 11, or arising in or related to [a case] under title 11.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1334(b) (2000). <i>See, e.g., In re Southmark Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"16535\"><a href=\"/opinion/16535/southmark-v-coopers-lybrand/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span>, 931 (5th Cir.)

But this further question (whether his claims qualify for the \"arise under\" or \"arise in\" heading rather than the \"relate to\" heading) is not presented to us, for Mourad has not moved for mandatory abstention pursuant to section 1334(c)(2), <i>see also</i> Fed. R. Bankr.P. 5011, and the abstention provision, which is waivable by the parties, does not detract from the district court's subject matter jurisdiction. <i>See Celotex,</i> 124 F.3d at 627 n. 4. Mourad's jurisdictional attack having failed, there is no other ground upon which a review of the bankruptcy court's remand decision can be had. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1452(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the issue of Mourad's standing to bring these claims as former president, sole director and sole shareholder of V&amp;M. In dismissing Mourad's non-remanded claims for lack of standing, the bankruptcy court found that Mourad was precluded from re-litigating the issue of his standing. The court relied upon its prior ruling, as part of the confirmation of the reorganization plan, that Mourad's equity interest in the Debtor had no value. The court also relied upon the preclusion effect of its prior determinations, in at least three proceedings in the V&amp;M bankruptcy case, that Mourad lacked standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the bankruptcy court concluded that its prior ruling on the value of Mourad's equity interest precluded him from contending that his equity interest \"had (or could have) such value as would give him standing in the present matter.\" Because the only harm to himself which Mourad's non-remanded claims alleged was in his capacity as an equity security holder in the Debtor, the court reasoned, he was precluded from arguing that he had standing to pursue the present claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his standing, Mourad now disputes the bankruptcy court's finding that his equity interest in the Debtor had no value. We agree with the bankruptcy court that Mourad is precluded from re-litigating the issue of the value of his equity interest. As the bankruptcy court stated, \"[b]y the 1997 order confirming the Joint Plan of Reorganization, the [bankruptcy court] has already adjudicated that Mr. Mourad's equity interest in the Debtor is of no value.\" The requirements of issue preclusion are satisfied. <i>See Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684074\"><a href=\"/opinion/684074/paul-j-grella-trustee-v-salem-five-cent-savings-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mourad attempts on appeal, as he did in his opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss, to base his standing on his 1) personal liability (as sole shareholder of a subchapter S corporation) for certain debts owed by the Debtor, and 2) stake in the opportunity to recover the value of his equity. We need not decide whether standing can be supported on these grounds, because these allegations could have been raised in the prior bankruptcy proceedings where Mourad's standing was adjudicated. To the extent that Mourad now seeks to add these new (but previously available) factual allegations to establish his standing to bring the present claims, such assertions do not defeat the bar of issue preclusion. <i>See Perry v. Sheahan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769862\"><a href=\"/opinion/769862/rixson-m-perry-v-michael-f-sheahan-sheriff-of-cook-county-eugene/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span>, 318 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief on appeal, Mourad does not dispute (and appears to concede) that the issue of standing has been previously adjudicated. His only challenge to the court's dismissal of his claims on preclusion grounds is that \"the [bankruptcy court] has been and continues to be biased towards Mourad.\" This contention, which is based on judicial rulings against him, is groundless. <i>See Liteky v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 554, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span> (1994). Moreover, Mourad's brief contains no developed argument challenging the bankruptcy court's determination of no bias (made in connection with denial of the motion for recusal in this case). \"Our general rule with regard to such poorly developed arguments is to treat them as forfeited.\" <i>Donahue v.
