Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n          Syrie D. Fried, with whom the Federal Defender Office\nwas on brief, for appellant.\n          James F. Lang, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Donald\nL. Cabell, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Michael J. Sullivan, U.S.\nAttorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 22, 2005\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.   In January of 2002, Kevin Kelley\n\nput a gun to the head of a man he thought was the manager of the\n\nBest Western Roundhouse Suites Hotel in Boston, in an attempt to\n\nsteal the hotel receipts from that day.        The man was not the\n\nmanager, but was just a customer in his car in the parking lot, and\n\nall Kelley received was $70.00.       As a result of this incident,\n\nKelley was charged federally for being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm (the gun Kelley used that night), 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1),\n\nand charged in state court for the underlying crime of armed\n\nrobbery.    Since Kelley met the definition of an armed career\n\ncriminal under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), a conviction on the federal\n\ncharges would have meant a sentence of at least 15 years in prison\n\nby a statutory mandatory minimum.\n\n           In Massachusetts there is no separate federal pre-trial\n\ndetention facility.   Instead, the United States Marshals Service\n\ncontracts with the state and its counties to house detained federal\n\nprisoners at state and county facilities.     This, in turn, brings\n\ninto play the provisions of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers\n\n(\"IAD\"), which is the subject of this appeal.      18 U.S.C. App. 2\n\n§ 2.\n\n           During his state and federal prosecutions, Kelley was\n\nalternately a state, federal, and again a state detainee as a\n\nresult of what some might call a comedy of errors and others would\n\ncall a series of mistakes and negligence by various federal and\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fstate entities.       This includes the Marshals Service declining to\n\npay the bill properly submitted to it by the state for Kelley's\n\nstay as a federal detainee at Norfolk County Jail.                 Further,\n\nalthough Kelley was a federal pre-trial detainee from the time he\n\nwas indicted on federal charges on September 17, 2002, he was\n\nimproperly released from federal to state custody on October 4,\n\n2002, in order to appear in state court for proceedings related to\n\nhis state armed robbery charges, to which he pled guilty.                 On\n\nOctober 8, 2004, Kelley was sent to serve a state sentence on these\n\ncharges at MCI-Concord, again being placed in state custody.\n\nBecause he was a federal pre-trial detainee at the time, releasing\n\nKelley into state custody violated the anti-shuttling provisions of\n\nthe IAD.      See id. Art. III.        Those provisions are intended to\n\nprevent      \"uncertainties    which    obstruct   programs   of   prisoner\n\ntreatment and rehabilitation\" resulting from the existence of\n\noutstanding detainers lodged against prisoners, as well as to\n\nalleviate \"difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already\n\nincarcerated in other jurisdictions.\"          Id. Art. I.\n\n             When a violation of the IAD occurs, and when, as here,\n\nthe United States is the receiving government (because Kelley was\n\nin state custody when he was indicted on federal charges), \"any\n\norder   of    a   court   dismissing   any   indictment,   information,   or\n\ncomplaint [for an IAD violation] may be with or without prejudice.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. App. 2 § 9(1).        The IAD further states:\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f            In determining whether to dismiss the case\n            with or without prejudice, the court shall\n            consider, among others, each of the following\n            factors: The seriousness of the offense; the\n            facts and circumstances of the case which led\n            to the dismissal; and the impact of a\n            reprosecution on the administration of the\n            agreement   on    detainers   and    on   the\n            administration of justice . . . .\n\nId.\n\n            Kelley   moved   to    dismiss      with   prejudice   the   federal\n\ncharges for violation of the anti-shuttling provisions of the IAD.\n\nThe district court, after hearing evidence, wrote a comprehensive\n\nand thoughtful twenty-five page decision, guided by the Supreme\n\nCourt's opinion in Alabama v. Bozeman, 533 U.S. 146 (2001).                 See\n\nUnited States v. Kelley, 300 F. Supp. 2d 224 (D. Mass. 2003).               The\n\nopinion considered and weighed all of the appropriate factors. The\n\ncourt noted some possible prejudice to Kelley from the violation:\n\nit was possible Kelley could see a longer period of confinement as\n\na result of the snafu.       Id. at 234.        But this was, in the court's\n\njudgment, outweighed by the other factors, namely, that the offense\n\ninvolved was a serious one, and that the government had not\n\nwillfully violated the IAD.             Id. at 233-34.     The district court\n\nconcluded that the federal charges must be dismissed because the\n\nIAD   had   been   violated,      but    that   the    dismissal   was   without\n\nprejudice.    Id. at 235.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f             There is no dispute that the IAD was violated; the only\n\ndispute     on   appeal   is   as    to   the   remedy   of   dismissal    without\n\nprejudice.1\n\n                                           I.\n\n             This court has not before addressed the question of the\n\nstandard of review for challenges to a trial court's decision under\n\nthe IAD to dismiss an indictment with or without prejudice.                      In\n\nanalogous cases under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161-3174,\n\nwe review the trial court's rulings of law de novo, its factual\n\nfindings for clear error, United States v. Ramirez,                973 F.2d 36,\n\n38   (1st    Cir.   1992),     and   its    ultimate     ruling   for    abuse   of\n\ndiscretion, United States v. Trueber, 238 F.3d 79, 87 (1st Cir.\n\n2001). We now hold the same standard applies to rulings on motions\n\nto dismiss federal prosecutions under the IAD.\n\n             Kelley's principal argument is not that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion by applying wrong legal principles or\n\nthat there is clear error in the factual findings.2                     Rather, he\n\n\n      1\n      The government then on March 26, 2003 obtained a superseding\nindictment against Kelley and his accomplice, again charging a\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). On May 16, 2003 Kelley pled\nguilty to the federal charges.      As it turned out, the court\nsentenced in a way which ensured that the delay occasioned earlier\ndid not prejudice Kelley.\n      2\n      Kelley does claim that the district court erred in finding\nthat, after his initial appearance on federal charges on September\n17, he was not returned to state custody when he was sent back to\nNorfolk County Jail. However, since the district court did find\nthat an IAD violation occurred due to his subsequent return to\nstate custody, even were this finding clearly erroneous it would\n\n                                          -5-\n\fargues that the court gave too little weight to the effect of\n\nreprosecution on the goal of securing compliance with the IAD,\n\n\"mischaracterized the egregiousness of the [IAD] violation,\" and\n\n\"gave too much weight to the seriousness of the offense without\n\narticulating why this factor overrode other statutory factors.\"\n\n            Kelley has an uphill battle in arguing that an abuse of\n\ndiscretion arises from the relative weight given by the district\n\ncourt to the correct factors.        Assuming no error of law as to the\n\nfactors to be considered and no error of fact, the weight a court\n\ngives to the factors is usually upheld absent a clear error of\n\njudgment.     United States v. Taylor, 487 U.S. 326, 337 (1988)\n\n(\"[W]hen    the   statutory    factors     are   properly   considered,    and\n\nsupporting factual findings are not clearly in error, the district\n\ncourt's judgment of how opposing considerations balance should not\n\nbe lightly disturbed.\"); United States v. Hastings, 847 F.2d 920,\n\n924 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding, in the context of a Speedy Trial Act\n\nviolation,   that   \"when     all   proper   and   no   improper   facts   are\n\nconsidered,\" the district court's determination will be upheld\n\nunless \"the court in weighing those factors commits a clear error\n\n\n\n\nnot require a reversal of the district court's decision. Nor does\nKelley argue as much; he claims that this erroneous finding may\nhave affected the balancing analysis. In any event, the district\ncourt's finding that he was not returned to state custody after his\ninitial appearance on September 17 is supported by substantial\nevidence and certainly did not constitute clear error.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fof judgment\" (quoting United States v. Kramer, 827 F.2d 1174, 1179\n\n(8th Cir. 1987))).\n\n          Here, a simple reading of the district court's careful\n\nopinion itself shows the futility of the attack.     The soundness of\n\nthe reasoning speaks for itself.       We have little to add to the\n\nsubstantive analysis in the district court's opinion and affirm in\n\nlarge part on that basis.\n\n          It is worth making one additional point.      Kelley makes\n\nthe serious charge that the district court \"mischaracterized the\n\negregiousness of the violation.\"      This argument is both unfounded\n\nand unfair.   The court correctly found this was an inadvertent\n\nadministrative error and that there was no willful violation.\n\nThere is no evidence to the contrary.\n\n          We recognize that   Bozeman held there were no exceptions\n\nto finding violations of the IAD for \"technical\" or \"de minimis\"\n\nmissteps. 533 U.S. at 153-54. Bozeman overruled the contrary rule\n\nstated in United States v. Taylor, 861 F.2d 316 (1st Cir. 1988),\n\nwhich this court had cited favorably in United States v. Hunnewell,\n\n891 F.2d 955, 959 (1st Cir. 1989).     Under Bozeman, the question of\n\nwhether a violation is technical or de minimis has to do with\n\nwhether there is a violation of the IAD at all, not with the\n\nappropriateness of a particular remedy of dismissal with prejudice\n\nor without prejudice.   The circumstances under which the violation\n\noccurred is an entirely appropriate factor to consider in the\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fanalysis of whether the court abused its discretion in dismissing\n\nthe indictment without prejudice.\n\n          Like   the   district   court,   we   think   this   would   be   a\n\nmaterially different case if the United States had acted willfully\n\nor if there were a pattern of such violations in this district.3\n\nToward that end, we inquired of government counsel at oral argument\n\nwhat was being done to see that this situation did not replay\n\nitself.   We received assurances that there will be training both\n\nfor the prosecutors and the marshals in the district on the\n\nrequirements of the IAD to prevent recurrence of this type of\n\nviolation.\n\n          The judgment is easily affirmed.        So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Kelley attempts to argue that such a pattern exists, however\nhe relies on only three cases decided more than a decade ago, and\nnone involving the Norfolk County Jail. We can find no pattern of\nIAD violations similar to the instant case.\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

The circumstances under which the violation occurred is an entirely appropriate factor to consider in the analysis of whether the court abused its discretion in dismissing the indictment without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we think this would be a materially different case if the United States had acted willfully or if there were a pattern of such violations in this district.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Toward that end, we inquired of government counsel at oral argument what was being done to see that this situation did not replay itself.

Fried, with whom the Federal Defender Office was on brief, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">James F. Lang, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Donald L.

Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before TORRUELLA, LYNCH and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January of 2002, Kevin Kelley put a gun to the head of a man he thought was the manager of the Best Western Roundhouse Suites Hotel in Boston, in an attempt to steal the hotel receipts from that day. The man was not the manager, but was just a customer in his car in the parking lot, and all Kelley received was $70.00. As a result of this incident, Kelley was charged federally for being a felon in possession of a firearm (the gun Kelley used that night), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), and charged in state court for the underlying crime of armed robbery. Since Kelley met the definition of an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e), a conviction on the federal charges would have meant a sentence of at least 15 years in prison by a statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Massachusetts there is no separate federal pre-trial detention facility. Instead, the United States Marshals Service contracts with the state and its counties to house detained federal prisoners at state and county facilities. This, in turn, brings into play the provisions of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (\"IAD\"), which is the subject of this appeal. 18 U.S.C.App. 2 &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his state and federal prosecutions, Kelley was alternately a state, federal, and again a state detainee as a result of what some might call a comedy of errors and others would call a series of mistakes and negligence by various federal and state entities. This includes the Marshals Service declining to pay the bill properly submitted to it by the state for Kelley's stay as a federal detainee at Norfolk County Jail. Further, although Kelley was a federal pre-trial detainee from the time he was indicted on federal charges on September 17, 2002, he was improperly released from federal to state custody on October 4, 2002, in order to appear in state court for proceedings related to his state armed robbery charges, to which he pled guilty. On October 8, 2004, Kelley was sent to serve a state sentence on these charges at MCI-Concord, again being placed in state custody. Because he was a federal pre-trial detainee at the time, releasing Kelley into state custody violated the anti-shuttling provisions of the IAD. <i>See id.</i> Art. III. Those provisions are intended to prevent \"uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation\" resulting from the existence of outstanding detainers lodged against prisoners, as well as to alleviate \"difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions.\" <i>Id.</i> Art. I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a violation of the IAD occurs, and when, as here, the United States is the receiving government (because Kelley was in state custody when he was indicted on federal charges), \"any order of a court dismissing any indictment, information, or complaint [for an IAD violation] may be with or without prejudice.\" 18 U.S.C.App. 2 &#167; 9(1). The IAD further states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors: The seriousness of the offense; the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of the agreement on detainers and on the administration of justice....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kelley moved to dismiss <i>with prejudice</i> the federal charges for violation of the anti-shuttling provisions of the IAD. The district court, after hearing evidence, wrote a comprehensive and thoughtful twenty-five page decision, guided by the Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Alabama v. Bozeman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></span> (2001). <i>See United States v. Kelley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2563092\"><a href=\"/opinion/2563092/united-states-v-kelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2003). The opinion considered and weighed all of the appropriate factors. The court noted some possible prejudice to Kelley from the violation: it was possible Kelley could see a longer period of confinement as a result of the snafu. <i>Id.</i> at 234. But this was, in the court's judgment, outweighed by the other factors, namely, that the offense involved was a serious one, and that the government had not willfully violated the IAD. <i>Id.</i> at 233-34. The district court concluded that the federal charges must be dismissed because the IAD had been violated, but that the dismissal was without prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 235.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that the IAD was violated; the only dispute on appeal is as to the remedy of dismissal without prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has not before addressed the question of the standard of review for challenges to a trial court's decision under the IAD to dismiss an indictment with or without prejudice. In analogous cases under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161-3174, we review the trial court's rulings of law de novo, its factual findings for clear error, <i>United States v. Ramirez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589647\"><a href=\"/opinion/589647/united-states-v-domingo-ramirez-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.1992), and its ultimate ruling for abuse of discretion, <i>United States v. Trueber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199253\"><a href=\"/opinion/199253/united-states-v-trueber/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir.2001). We now hold the same standard applies to rulings on motions to dismiss federal prosecutions under the IAD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kelley's principal argument is not that the district court abused its discretion by applying wrong legal principles or that there is clear error in the factual findings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Rather, he argues that the court gave too little weight to the effect of reprosecution on the goal of securing compliance with the IAD, \"mischaracterized the egregiousness of the [IAD] violation,\" and \"gave too much weight to the seriousness of the offense without articulating why this factor overrode other statutory factors.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kelley has an uphill battle in arguing that an abuse of discretion arises from the relative weight given by the district court to the correct factors. Assuming no error of law as to the factors to be considered and no error of fact, the weight a court gives to the factors is usually upheld absent a clear error of judgment. <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112129\"><a href=\"/opinion/112129/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span>, 337, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112129\"><a href=\"/opinion/112129/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span> (1988) (\"[W]hen the statutory factors are properly considered, and supporting factual findings are not clearly in error, the district court's judgment of how opposing considerations balance should not be lightly disturbed.\"); <i>United States v.

The soundness of the reasoning speaks for itself. We have little to add to the substantive analysis in the district court's opinion and affirm in large part on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is worth making one additional point. Kelley makes the serious charge that the district court \"mischaracterized the egregiousness of the violation.\" This argument is both unfounded and unfair. The court correctly found this was an inadvertent administrative error and that there was no willful violation. There is no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that <i>Bozeman</i> held there were no exceptions to finding violations of the IAD for \"technical\" or \"de minimis\" missteps. 533 U.S. at 153-54, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2079</span></span>. <i>Bozeman</i> overruled the contrary rule stated in <i>United States v.

Under <i>Bozeman,</i> the question of whether a violation is technical or de minimis has to do with whether there is a violation of the IAD at all, not with the appropriateness of a particular remedy of dismissal with prejudice or without prejudice. The circumstances under which the violation occurred is an entirely appropriate factor to consider in the analysis of whether the court abused its discretion in dismissing the indictment without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court, we think this would be a materially different case if the United States had acted willfully or if there were a pattern of such violations in this district.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Toward that end, we inquired of government counsel at oral argument what was being done to see that this situation did not replay itself.
