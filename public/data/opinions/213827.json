Gustavo A. Gelpí, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n         Torruella, Lipez, and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Carlos A.

This case involves a claim of\n\npolitical       discrimination       stemming    from    the   2008   gubernatorial\n\nelection       in   Puerto   Rico.      Fourteen     maintenance      and    domestic\n\nworkers, all members of Puerto Rico's Popular Democratic Party\n\n(\"PDP\"), brought suit in federal district court alleging that they\n\nwere unconstitutionally terminated from their public employment at\n\nthe governor's mansion, La Fortaleza, shortly after the election of\n\nGovernor       Luis   Fortuño-Burset     (\"Fortuño\"),       President       of   Puerto\n\nRico's New Progressive Party (\"NPP\").                   The complaint named four\n\nprincipal       defendants,    in     both   their      individual    and    official\n\ncapacities, as well as their spouses and conjugal partnerships:\n\nGovernor Fortuño, the nominating authority at La Fortaleza; First\n\nLady Luce Vela (\"Vela\"), the chairperson of a committee for the\n\nmaintenance, restoration, and preservation of La Fortaleza; Chief\n\nof Staff Juan Carlos Blanco (\"Blanco\"); and Administrator Velmarie\n\nBerlingeri Marín (\"Berlingeri\").1 The district court, applying the\n\nfederal notice pleading standard articulated by the Supreme Court\n\nin Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and\n\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937 (2009), dismissed the workers'\n\ncomplaint for failing to state a plausible claim for relief.\n\n               After a careful review of the record and the teachings of\n\nTwombly and Iqbal, we conclude that the district court applied the\n\n\n\n        1\n            The record contains two different spellings of Berlingeri's\nname.       We adopt the spelling used in the defendants' brief.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fnotice pleading standard incorrectly.          The allegations in the\n\ncomplaint do state a plausible claim of political discrimination in\n\nviolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nWe vacate the dismissal of that claim.\n\n                                    I.\n\nA.   The Complaint\n\n           Because this appeal follows the allowance of a motion to\n\ndismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we\n\nrecite the facts of the plaintiffs' claim as alleged in the\n\ncomplaint.   See SEC v. Tambone, 597 F.3d 436, 438 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(en banc).\n\n           Fortuño was elected Governor of the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico on November 4, 2008, and he assumed that office on\n\nJanuary 2, 2009.     As Governor, he is the nominating authority at La\n\nFortaleza; he approves or disapproves of all personnel decisions\n\nrelating to employment at the mansion.         In early January 2009,\n\nGovernor Fortuño named defendant Berlingeri Administrator at La\n\nFortaleza, and he signed an executive order authorizing her to\n\nterminate employees there on his behalf.       He also named defendant\n\nBlanco Chief of Staff.    As the First Lady of Puerto Rico, defendant\n\nVela chairs the Conservation and Maintenance of La Fortaleza\n\nCommittee and is responsible for overseeing the mansion; she has\n\npublicly   acknowledged    her   personal   involvement   in   overseeing\n\nrepairs and refurbishing work at La Fortaleza.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f            Shortly    after       Governor    Fortuño    took   office,    logos,\n\nemblems, and flyers supporting the NPP and Governor Fortuño were\n\nprominently displayed at La Fortaleza.               Employees at the mansion\n\nopenly   discussed     their       political    affiliations,     as     some    NPP-\n\naffiliated employees were promoted to high-level trust positions\n\nwhile rumors spread of a list of PDP-affiliated employees who would\n\nbe terminated and replaced with NPP-affiliated workers.                   Employees\n\nwere   questioned     on    multiple    occasions,       including   by   Governor\n\nFortuño himself, about the circumstances of their hire at La\n\nFortaleza, which the plaintiffs contend was merely an attempt to\n\nascertain or verify each employee's political affiliation. Indeed,\n\nthe new administration brought in confidential clerical personnel\n\nwho interrogated employees for that very purpose.\n\n            Governor       Fortuño's    campaign      jingle,    \"It's    time    to\n\nchange,\" proved to be a recurring theme for employees at La\n\nFortaleza    following       the    change     in   administration.        One    of\n\nBerlingeri's trusted aides used the jingle as the ringtone on his\n\ncellular telephone (which also prominently displayed the NPP logo).\n\nHe would also loudly sing the jingle in front of the maintenance\n\nemployees he commanded and would state on occasion that things had\n\nindeed changed. Similarly, First Lady Vela informed employees that\n\n\"changes had come,\" and she would make disparaging and derogatory\n\ncomments about the prior PDP administration to employees as they\n\nexecuted their duties.         She was also overheard stating her intent\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fto \"clean up the kitchen,\" an apparent reference to an impending\n\nchange in kitchen staff.\n\n           The plaintiffs in this case performed maintenance work or\n\nhousekeeping tasks at La Fortaleza, such as laundry, ironing,\n\nsewing, and cleaning.         Some of the plaintiffs had held their\n\npositions at the mansion for nearly twenty years.                 On either\n\nFebruary 27 or March 11 of 2009, each of the plaintiffs received a\n\ntermination letter signed by Berlingeri.          They were fired without\n\nnotice, without cause, and without having their job performance\n\nevaluated by the incoming administration.          None of the plaintiffs\n\nhad been known members of the NPP.         Within days, their positions at\n\nLa Fortaleza were filled by NPP-affiliated workers.\n\n           In answering press questions about the layoffs at La\n\nFortaleza, Blanco stated falsely that the employees who were\n\nterminated had been privy to confidential, sensitive information.\n\nIn   actuality,   none   of   the   plaintiffs   had   held    policy-making\n\npositions,   performed    functions    similar    to   those   performed    by\n\npolicy-making employees, or had access to confidential information\n\nrelated to policy.       Blanco further informed the press, \"We are\n\nmaking employment evaluations every month,\" an assertion belied by\n\nthe lack of evaluation preceding the plaintiffs' terminations.\n\n           The defendants made other public statements indicating\n\nthat political affiliation may have been a consideration in the\n\nadministration's    employment      decisions,   including     those   at   La\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fFortaleza.     In addressing the press on the topic of government\n\nlayoffs generally, Governor Fortuño flatly stated that \"none of\n\nthem voted for him,\" in reference to the employees who might be\n\nterminated.    When specifically responding to criticism by a group\n\nof terminated employees who were protesting at La Fortaleza, Blanco\n\nmade disparaging comments about the prior PDP administration and\n\nacknowledged    that   the   fired    employees   were   part   of     that\n\nadministration.     Berlingeri similarly made disparaging remarks\n\nabout the prior administration when addressing criticism by a group\n\nof terminated employees.\n\nB.   Procedural Background\n\n           The plaintiffs brought suit in federal district court\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, supplemented by claims brought under\n\nthe laws and Constitution of Puerto Rico.          They alleged three\n\nconstitutional violations in the termination of their employment:\n\npolitical discrimination in violation of the First Amendment,\n\ndeprivation of a property interest without due process of law, and\n\nthe denial of equal protection.\n\n           At an initial case conference in April 2009, the district\n\ncourt informed the plaintiffs that their complaint satisfied the\n\nfederal notice pleading standard, and it advised the defendants not\n\nto file a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the complaint.             In May\n\n2009, however, the district court scheduled an emergency hearing\n\nmotu proprio to hear arguments on whether the recently issued Iqbal\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fdecision required the complaint to be dismissed due to insufficient\n\nfactual allegations.       At that hearing, the defendants officially\n\nmoved to dismiss the complaint.      The court denied the defendants'\n\nmotion without prejudice and granted the plaintiffs thirty days to\n\namend their complaint to comply with Iqbal.         The plaintiffs timely\n\nfiled an amended complaint, and the defendants again moved to\n\ndismiss. After a hearing, the district court dismissed the amended\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim.2\n\nC.   The District Court Opinion\n\n           The district court began its opinion and order in this\n\ncase by dismissing all claims against three of the four defendants\n\n-- Governor Fortuño, First Lady Vela, and Blanco. According to the\n\ncourt, the factual allegations in the complaint failed to show with\n\nthe required specificity that those three defendants had caused the\n\nplaintiffs' terminations. The court described the plaintiffs' case\n\nagainst those defendants as resting on \"an implicit assumption that\n\nthe defendants' [sic] participated in the decision\" because of\n\ntheir positions of authority. It noted that \"no additional factual\n\nallegations,   such   as   interactions   between    the   defendants   and\n\nparticular plaintiffs, . . . tie Fortuño, Vela, and Blanco to the\n\ndeprivation of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\"\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The plaintiffs do not challenge the dismissal of their\n§ 1983 claims based on the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f             The district court did find, however, that the plaintiffs\n\nhad \"minimally satisfied\" their burden of pleading Berlingeri's\n\nparticipation in the terminations, \"since the plaintiffs allege\n\nthat   she    signed   the   letter     which   officially   separated   the\n\nplaintiffs from their employment at La Fortaleza.\" It nevertheless\n\nconcluded    that   the   plaintiffs'    political    discrimination   claim\n\nfailed because the complaint lacked sufficient factual allegations\n\nto show that Berlingeri had knowledge of the plaintiffs' political\n\naffiliation or that political affiliation played a role in the\n\ntermination decision: \"The fact that Berlingeri may have made\n\ndisparaging remarks about the previous administration does not lead\n\nto the conclusion that she thought or knew that plaintiffs were PDP\n\nmembers or supporters.\"      It found that \"the same can be said\" with\n\nrespect to the plaintiffs' allegations that Berlingeri's trusted\n\naide was a staunch NPP supporter, wore the party's logo, and sang\n\nGovernor Fortuño's campaign jingle.         The court also discounted the\n\ncomplaint's allegation that Berlingeri, the other defendants, and\n\nnewly hired clerical staff had inquired into the circumstances of\n\nthe plaintiffs' hire at La Fortaleza.           It noted that the complaint\n\n\"contains no specific account of these conversations,\" and thus\n\ndescribed it as \"a generic allegation, made without reference to\n\nspecific facts that might make it 'plausible on its face.'\"              The\n\ncourt further explained that had such inquiries taken place, that\n\nfact would \"not lead to the conclusion that [the defendants] did so\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fin order to ascertain [the plaintiffs'] political affiliation, or\n\nthat they in fact gained that information.\"\n\n           The court likewise discounted the plaintiffs' allegation\n\nthat they were replaced in their positions by NPP-affiliated\n\nworkers, describing it as \"a conclusory statement.\" It pointed out\n\nthat the \"plaintiffs do not identify who replaced any or all of the\n\nplaintiffs, nor the date of these replacements\" and that the\n\ncomplaint merely asserts \"that this occurred as to all of the\n\nplaintiffs.\" Further, the court found that the defendants' failure\n\nto justify the terminations or to conduct performance evaluations\n\nwas not \"relevant\" to the claim, as \"plaintiffs were not entitled\n\nto any explanation.\"        Lastly, the court explained that \"mere\n\ntemporal proximity\" between a change in administration and an\n\nemployee's dismissal is \"insufficient to establish discriminatory\n\nanimus.\"\n\n                                     II.\n\n           We    review   the   dismissal    of    a   complaint   under   Rule\n\n12(b)(6) de novo.     E.g., Tasker v. DHL Retirement Sav. Plan, 621\n\nF.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir. 2010).        The sole inquiry under Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nis whether, construing the well-pleaded facts of the complaint in\n\nthe light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the complaint states a\n\nclaim for which relief can be granted.             Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n           The   Supreme    Court   has    twice    recently   clarified   the\n\nrequirements of an adequately stated federal claim.                 Given the\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fnature of the district court's errors in this case, and the\n\nfrequent invocation of these cases by litigants and the district\n\ncourts, we think it useful to set forth in some detail an account\n\nof those two decisions.\n\nA.   Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly\n\n            In Twombly, the Supreme Court affirmed the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of an antitrust class-action suit brought under\n\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1.            550 U.S. at 548.     The\n\nplaintiffs claimed that a group of regional telephone service\n\nproviders had conspired to restrain trade by restricting the growth\n\nof upstart competitors while refraining from competing with one\n\nanother.    Id. at 550.     The complaint both directly alleged that the\n\ndefendant    service    providers     \"'have    entered    into    a   contract,\n\ncombination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their\n\nrespective . . . markets'\" and also alleged conduct from which,\n\naccording to the plaintiffs, a conspiracy could be inferred, such\n\nas   an   \"'absence    of   any    meaningful   competition       between   [the\n\ndefendants] in one another's markets'\" and a \"'parallel course of\n\nconduct that each engaged in to prevent competition from [upstart\n\ncompetitors].'\"       Id. at 551.    The Court of Appeals for the Second\n\nCircuit reversed the district court's order dismissing the case,\n\nasserting    that     \"to   rule   that   allegations     of   parallel     anti-\n\ncompetitive conduct fail to support a plausible conspiracy claim,\n\na court would have to conclude that there is no set of facts that\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fwould   permit     a   plaintiff    to    demonstrate      that   the   particular\n\nparallelism asserted was the product of collusion rather than\n\ncoincidence.\"      Id. at 553 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The    Supreme   Court       reversed    the   Second   Circuit   and\n\nreinstated the district court's order of dismissal.                     The Court\n\nexplained that the propriety of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) turns\n\non the complaint's compliance with Rule 8(a)(2), which mandates\n\nthat every complaint contain \"a short and plain statement of the\n\nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 8(a)(2).       Id. at 555.      It further explained that a \"short and\n\nplain\" statement does not need detailed factual allegations.                  Id.\n\nat 555.   That aspect of the Rule merely requires sufficient detail\n\nin the complaint to give a defendant fair notice of the claim and\n\nthe grounds upon which it rests.           Id. (citing Conley v. Gibson, 355\n\nU.S. 41, 47 (1957)).\n\n            However, the Twombly Court reasoned, Rule 8(a)(2) also\n\nrequires \"that the plain statement possess enough heft to show that\n\nthe pleader is entitled to relief.\"             Id. at 557 (emphasis added)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).             It stated that a complaint\n\nonly \"shows\" an entitlement to relief if its factual allegations\n\nare \"enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level\n\non the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are\n\ntrue (even if doubtful in fact).\"                   See id. at 555 (citation\n\nomitted).    According to the Court, Rule 8(a)(2) must require more\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fthan mere \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of\n\nthe elements of a cause of action.\"          Id.    However, the Twombly\n\nCourt was also careful to explain that \"[h]ere, . . . we do not\n\nrequire heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough\n\nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n\nId. at 570.\n\n            Applying the Rule 8 pleading standard to the facts of the\n\ncase before it, the Twombly Court disregarded the complaint's\n\nallegations that the defendants had \"entered into a contract,\n\ncombination or conspiracy\" and had \"agreed not to compete with one\n\nanother.\"     According to the Court, \"on fair reading these are\n\nmerely legal conclusions resting on the prior allegations\" of\n\nparallel conduct and non-competition: \"the complaint leaves no\n\ndoubt that plaintiffs rest their § 1 claim on descriptions of\n\nparallel conduct and not on any independent allegation of actual\n\nagreement among the [defendants].\"3        Id. at 564.\n\n            Taking   as   true   the   remaining   allegations   that   the\n\ndefendants had \"engaged in parallel conduct\" and had failed to\n\n\n     3\n       The Court noted that if the plaintiffs had intended these\nstatements to serve as factual allegations that an agreement\noccurred, it is doubtful that they would have provided the\ndefendants with the notice required by Rule 8(a)(2): \"Apart from\nidentifying a seven-year span in which the § 1 violations were\nsupposed to have occurred,\" \"the complaint here furnishes no clue\nas to which of the four [defendants] (much less which of their\nemployees) supposedly agreed, or when and where the illicit\nagreement took place. . . . [A] defendant seeking to respond to\nplaintiffs' conclusory allegations in the § 1 context would have\nlittle idea where to begin.\" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 564 n.10.\n\n                                   -12-\n\f\"meaningfully pursue\" \"attractive business opportunit[ies],\" the\n\nTwombly Court concluded they were insufficient to \"invest[] either\n\nthe action or inaction alleged with a plausible suggestion of\n\nconspiracy.\"    Id. at 564-66.       It explained that, under the Sherman\n\nAct, \"[e]ven conscious parallelism, a common reaction of firms in\n\na   concentrated     market   that    recognize    their    shared   economic\n\ninterests . . . is not in itself unlawful,\" and that \"proof of a\n\n§   1   conspiracy   must   include   evidence    tending   to   exclude   the\n\npossibility of independent action.\"               Id. at 553-54 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (alterations omitted). The Court reasoned\n\nthat, though the alleged conduct was \"consistent with conspiracy,\"\n\nit was \"just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and\n\ncompetitive business strategy.\"         Id. at 554.\n\n             Indeed, the Court emphasized that the alleged conduct\n\nheld almost no probative value in showing the existence of a\n\nconspiracy:\n\n        [T]here is no reason to infer that the companies had\n        agreed among themselves to do what was only natural\n        anyway; so natural, in fact, that if alleging parallel\n        decisions to resist competition were enough to imply an\n        antitrust conspiracy, pleading a § 1 violation against\n        almost any group of competing business would be a sure\n        thing.\n\nId. at 566.    Finding an \"obvious alternative explanation\" for the\n\nalleged behavior of the defendants, the Twombly Court concluded\n\nthat the \"plaintiffs here have not nudged their claims across the\n\nline from conceivable to plausible.\"         Id. at 567, 570.\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            In   describing   facial   plausibility     as   the   governing\n\nstandard of Rule 8(a)(2), Twombly officially put to rest the well-\n\nknown \"no set of facts\" language used in one of the Court's\n\nearliest opinions interpreting the Federal Rules, Conley v. Gibson,\n\n355 U.S. at 45-46.       550 U.S. at 561.    Although the Twombly Court\n\nacknowledged that Conley's language had been sensible in the\n\ncontext of the case, it was at best \"an incomplete, negative gloss\n\non an accepted pleading standard.\"        Id. at 563.   That language had\n\nbeen erroneously employed by the Second Circuit to reverse the\n\ndistrict    court's   order   of   dismissal,   and   the    Twombly   Court\n\nexpressed its concern that the \"no set of facts\" formulation can\n\ntoo easily \"be read in isolation as saying that any statement\n\nrevealing the theory of the claim will suffice unless its factual\n\nimpossibility may be shown from the face of the pleadings.\"            Id. at\n\n561.    It elaborated:\n\n       On such a focused and literal reading . . . a wholly\n       conclusory statement of claim would survive a motion to\n       dismiss whenever the pleadings left open the possibility\n       that a plaintiff might later establish some set of\n       undisclosed facts to support recovery. . . . It seems\n       fair to say that this approach to pleading would dispense\n       with any showing of a reasonably founded hope that a\n       plaintiff would be able to make a case; Mr. Micawber's\n       optimism would be enough.\n\n\nId. at 561-62 (alteration omitted) (citation omitted) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).       The Court thus announced that, \"after\n\npuzzling the profession for 50 years, this famous observation has\n\nearned its retirement.\"       Id. at 563.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f            Importantly, even while retiring one famous precedent,\n\nthe Twombly Court explicitly affirmed another.               It emphasized that\n\nrequiring a plaintiff to show a plausible entitlement to relief was\n\nnot the same as imposing a \"heightened pleading requirement,\" and\n\nwas therefore not inconsistent with the Supreme Court's previous\n\ndeclaration in Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506 (2002),\n\nthat a court may not insist on the allegation of \"specific facts\"\n\nthat would be necessary to prove the claim at trial.                 See Twombly,\n\n550 U.S. at 570.      To do so is incompatible with the notice pleading\n\nstructure of the Federal Rules.         Id.    The Court reiterated: \"Here,\n\nour concern is not that the allegations in the complaint were\n\ninsufficiently 'particularized'; rather, the complaint warranted\n\ndismissal     because    it   failed    in    toto    to    render    plaintiffs'\n\nentitlement to relief plausible.\"              Id. at 569 n.14 (alteration\n\nomitted) (internal citation omitted).\n\nB.   Ashcroft v. Iqbal\n\n            Iqbal involved a § 1983 claim brought by a detainee who\n\nhad been held in a Brooklyn detention center in the wake of the\n\nSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.               129 S. Ct. at 1943.        The\n\ncomplaint alleged that the conditions of the plaintiff's detention\n\nresulted    from    unconstitutional     racial,      ethnic,    and   religious\n\ndiscrimination in designating him a person of \"high interest.\" Id.\n\nat 1943-44.       Among the defendants named in the suit were Attorney\n\nGeneral    John    Ashcroft   and   Director    of    the   Federal    Bureau   of\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fInvestigation (\"FBI\") Robert Mueller.                     Id. at 1942.       After the\n\nSecond Circuit affirmed the district court's denial of their motion\n\nto dismiss, these two defendants petitioned for certiorari.                        Id.\n\n            To provide guidance to lower courts on how best to apply\n\nthe plausibility requirement of Rule 8(a)(2), the Iqbal Court\n\nendorsed a two-pronged approach that it saw as implicit in the\n\nTwombly decision.             Id. at 1950.           Under this approach, a court\n\nresolving    a       Rule    12(b)(6)    motion      to   dismiss   should     begin   by\n\nseparating       a    complaint's       factual      allegations     from    its   legal\n\nconclusions.          See id. at 1949-50.             Unlike factual allegations,\n\nlegal conclusions contained within a complaint are not entitled to\n\na presumption of truth.                 Id.     The Iqbal Court pointed to the\n\nallegation       that       the   Twombly      defendants    had    \"entered    into     a\n\ncontract, combination, or conspiracy,\" which had been disregarded\n\nby the Twombly Court, as an example of a conclusory statement that,\n\nthough presented as an assertion of fact, simply describes the\n\nlegal conclusion that the plaintiffs sought to infer from the other\n\nconduct alleged in the complaint.                    See id. at 1950.        The Court\n\nexplained that, if this conclusory allegation were afforded a\n\npresumption of truth, the Twombly plaintiffs \"would have stated a\n\nclaim for relief and been entitled to proceed perforce.\"                        Id.\n\n            The second prong of the approach endorsed by the Iqbal\n\nCourt requires a reviewing court to accept the remaining factual\n\nallegations in the complaint as true and to evaluate whether, taken\n\n\n                                              -16-\n\fas a whole, they state a facially plausible legal claim.                See id.\n\nAccording to the Court, \"[a] claim has facial plausibility when the\n\nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the\n\nreasonable    inference      that   the   defendant     is    liable   for    the\n\nmisconduct alleged.\"         Id. at 1949.    Echoing Twombly's conclusion\n\nthat the allegation of parallel conduct was \"just as much in line\"\n\nwith innocent conduct as with conspiracy, 550 U.S. at 554, the\n\nIqbal Court reiterated that a complaint may not stand simply on the\n\n\"sheer possibility\" that a defendant acted unlawfully or on facts\n\nthat are merely consistent with a defendant's liability.                See 129\n\nS. Ct. at 1949.          It cautioned, however, that evaluating the\n\nplausibility of a legal claim is a \"context-specific task that\n\nrequires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and\n\ncommon sense.\"      Id. at 1950.\n\n            Applying    this   two-pronged     approach,      the   Iqbal    Court\n\nidentified    and    disregarded     an   allegation     in   the   plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint    that    these    two   defendants,      high-ranking    government\n\nofficials, \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed\n\nto subject [the plaintiff] to harsh conditions of confinement as a\n\nmatter of policy, solely on account of his religion, race, and/or\n\nnational origin.\"        Id. at 1951 (alteration omitted) (internal\n\nquotation    marks     omitted).      The    Court    emphasized     that    this\n\nconclusory allegation simply mirrored the legal standard against\n\nwhich the complaint is to be tested, noting that \"Rule 8 does not\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fempower [the plaintiff] to plead the bare elements of his cause of\n\naction, affix the label 'general allegation,' and expect his\n\ncomplaint to survive a motion to dismiss.\"                Id. at 1954.\n\n              Turning to the remaining factual allegations, the Court\n\nreasoned that the plaintiff's claim was implausible.                  Although the\n\ncomplaint included a factual allegation that the FBI \"arrested and\n\ndetained thousands of Arab Muslim men . . . as part of its\n\ninvestigation of the events of September 11,\" the Court found that\n\nan inference of discriminatory intent was unreasonable in light of\n\nthe   \"more    likely    explanations.\"       Id.    at   1951   (alteration    in\n\noriginal) (internal quotation marks omitted).                    Recounting the\n\ncircumstances of the September 11 attacks, the Court explained why\n\n\"[i]t should come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing\n\nlaw enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their\n\nsuspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental\n\nimpact on Arab Muslims, even though the purpose of the policy was\n\nto target neither Arabs nor Muslims.\"               Id.    It also pointed out\n\nthat the plaintiff's only factual allegation specific to the two\n\npetitioning defendants accused them of \"adopting a policy approving\n\nof restrictive conditions of confinement for post-September-11\n\ndetainees.\"     Id. at 1952 (internal quotation marks omitted).                The\n\nCourt   explained       that   nothing   in   this    allegation       shows   the\n\ndefendants'     discriminatory     intent:    \"[A]s       we   have   noted,   [the\n\ndefendants] cannot be held liable unless they themselves acted on\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\faccount of a constitutionally protected characteristic.                 Yet [the\n\nplaintiff's] complaint does not contain any factual allegation\n\nsufficient to plausibly suggest [the defendant's] discriminatory\n\nstate of mind.\"      Id.\n\nC.   The Current State of Federal Notice Pleading\n\n               We distill the following principles from Twombly and\n\nIqbal.\n\n               Dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is\n\ninappropriate if the complaint satisfies Rule 8(a)(2)'s requirement\n\nof \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the\n\npleader is entitled to relief,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).                      See\n\nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949; Twombly 550 U.S. at 555.               A \"short and\n\nplain\" statement needs only enough detail to provide a defendant\n\nwith \"'fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon\n\nwhich it rests.'\"       Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citing Conley, 355\n\nU.S. at 47); see also Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007)\n\n(\"Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only 'a short\n\nand plain statement . . . .' Specific facts are not necessary.\").\n\nHowever, in order to \"show\" an entitlement to relief a complaint\n\nmust contain enough factual material \"to raise a right to relief\n\nabove    the    speculative    level   on     the   assumption   that   all   the\n\nallegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\"\n\nSee Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citation omitted); see also Iqbal,\n\n129 S. Ct. at 1950.           \"Where a complaint pleads facts that are\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f'merely consistent with' a defendant's liability, it 'stops short\n\nof the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to\n\nrelief.'\"    Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at\n\n557).    In short, an adequate complaint must provide fair notice to\n\nthe defendants and state a facially plausible legal claim.\n\n            In resolving a motion to dismiss, a court should employ\n\na    two-pronged    approach.      It    should   begin   by    identifying    and\n\ndisregarding statements in the complaint that merely offer \"'legal\n\nconclusion[s] couched as . . . fact[]'\" or \"[t]hreadbare recitals\n\nof the elements of a cause of action.\"                Id. at 1949-50 (quoting\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555).         A plaintiff is not entitled to \"proceed\n\nperforce\" by virtue of allegations that merely parrot the elements\n\nof the cause of action.          See id. at 1950; cf. Sanchez v. Pereira-\n\nCastillo,    590    F.3d   31,    49    (1st   Cir.   2009)    (disregarding    as\n\nconclusory, under Iqbal's first prong, a factual allegation that\n\nmerely \"[p]arrot[ed] our standard for supervisory liability in the\n\ncontext of Section 1983\" in alleging that defendants had \"failed to\n\n[supervise] with deliberate indifference and/or reckless disregard\n\nof    Plaintiff's    federally     protected      rights\").      Non-conclusory\n\nfactual allegations in the complaint must then be treated as true,\n\neven if seemingly incredible.            Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1951 (\"To be\n\nclear, we do not reject these bald allegations on the ground that\n\nthey are unrealistic or nonsensical. . . . It is the conclusory\n\nnature of respondent's allegations, rather than their extravagantly\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\ffanciful nature, that disentitles them to the presumption of\n\ntruth.\").     But cf. Peñalbert-Rosa v. Fortuño-Burset, 631 F.3d 592,\n\n595    (1st   Cir.   2011)   (\"[S]ome   allegations,     while   not   stating\n\nultimate legal conclusions, are nevertheless so threadbare or\n\nspeculative that they fail to cross the line between the conclusory\n\nand the factual.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).                 If that\n\nfactual content, so taken, \"allows the court to draw the reasonable\n\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,\"\n\nthe claim has facial plausibility.            Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949.\n\n\"The make-or-break standard . . . is that the combined allegations,\n\ntaken as true, must state a plausible, not a merely conceivable,\n\ncase for relief.\"        Sepúlveda-Villarini v. Dep't of Educ. of P.R.,\n\n628 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2010) (Souter, J.).\n\n              Although evaluating the plausibility of a legal claim\n\n\"requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience\n\nand common sense,\" Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950, the court may not\n\ndisregard properly pled factual allegations, \"even if it strikes a\n\nsavvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable.\"\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556; see also Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S.\n\n319,   327    (1989)    (\"Rule   12(b)(6)   does   not   countenance   .   .   .\n\ndismissals based on a judge's disbelief of a complaint's factual\n\nallegations.\").        Nor may a court attempt to forecast a plaintiff's\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits; \"a well-pleaded complaint may\n\nproceed even if . . . a recovery is very remote and unlikely.\"\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556 (internal quotation marks omitted); see\n\nalso id. at 563 n.8 (\"[W]hen a complaint adequately states a claim,\n\nit may not be dismissed based on a district court's assessment that\n\nthe   plaintiff       will    fail     to    find   evidentiary      support    for   his\n\nallegations      or    prove     his    claim       to   the   satisfaction      of   the\n\nfactfinder.\").        The relevant inquiry focuses on the reasonableness\n\nof the inference of liability that the plaintiff is asking the\n\ncourt to draw from the facts alleged in the complaint.\n\n            With these principles in mind, we turn to the claim at\n\nissue.\n\n                                             III.\n\n            Government officials are forbidden by the First Amendment\n\nfrom taking adverse action against public employees on the basis of\n\npolitical affiliation, unless political loyalty is an appropriate\n\nrequirement of the employment.                   See Rutan v. Republican Party of\n\nIll., 497 U.S. 62, 75-76 (1990); Welch v. Ciampa, 542 F.3d 927,\n\n938-39    (1st    Cir.       2008).         An   actionable    claim    of     political\n\ndiscrimination consists of four elements: \"(1) that the plaintiff\n\nand defendant have opposing political affiliations, (2) that the\n\ndefendant is aware of the plaintiff's affiliation, (3) that an\n\nadverse    employment         action        occurred,    and   (4)    that     political\n\naffiliation was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse\n\nemployment action.\" Lamboy-Ortiz v. Ortiz-Vélez, 630 F.3d 228, 239\n\n(1st Cir. 2010).         There is no question about the adequacy of the\n\n\n                                             -22-\n\fplaintiffs' complaint in this case with respect to two of these\n\nelements.       The     complaint      contains       straightforward          factual\n\nallegations         describing      the      parties'     opposing           political\n\naffiliations, including that the \"[d]efendants all belong to the\n\nNPP,\" that \"[e]ach and all plaintiffs are members of the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party . . . or are believed to be a member of the PDP,\"\n\nand that each        plaintiff \"was not a known member of the New\n\nProgressive Party.\"          On review of a motion to dismiss, we must\n\naccept these allegations as true.            Additionally, the defendants do\n\nnot contest that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the\n\ntermination     of     the     plaintiffs'       employment    at      La    Fortaleza\n\nconstitutes an adverse employment action.\n\n            At issue, then, is the correctness of the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that the plaintiffs' complaint fails to show\n\nthat the defendants had knowledge of the plaintiffs' political\n\naffiliation     and     that     the   plaintiffs'      political           affiliation\n\nmotivated     the     defendants'      participation      in     the        plaintiffs'\n\nterminations.\n\nA.   The Defendants' Knowledge\n\n            The district court assessed only Berlingeri's knowledge\n\nof the plaintiffs' political affiliation because it dismissed all\n\nclaims against Governor Fortuño, First Lady Vela, and Blanco on the\n\nground   that   the     allegations       were    insufficient      to      show   their\n\nparticipation in the plaintiffs' terminations.                      In effect, the\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\fcourt performed a causation analysis at the outset of its opinion\n\nthat obviated the need for an element-by-element assessment of the\n\nplaintiffs' claims with respect to three of the four defendants.\n\nAs we explain below, we disagree with the court's conclusion on\n\ncausation.        Hence,      we     must      assess      whether    the   plaintiffs'\n\nallegations show that all four defendants had knowledge of the\n\nplaintiffs' political affiliation.\n\n           The        district      court      concluded     that     the   plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint inadequately alleged Berlingeri's knowledge. In reaching\n\nthat conclusion, it disregarded as \"conclusory\" an allegation that\n\nthe plaintiffs were replaced by NPP-affiliated workers because the\n\nplaintiffs      \"do    not    identify        who   replaced    any   or    all    of   the\n\nplaintiffs,      nor    the       date   of    these    replacements.\"            It    also\n\ndisregarded as \"generic, blanket statements\" numerous allegations\n\nthat the defendants and their subordinates had questioned the\n\nplaintiffs about the circumstances of their hires in order to\n\ndiscern their political affiliations. The court explained that the\n\ncomplaint \"contains no specific account of these conversations.\"\n\nThe court then added that, even if the defendants had questioned\n\nthe plaintiffs about the circumstances of their employment, such\n\nquestioning \"does not lead to the conclusion that [the defendants]\n\ndid   so   in    order       to     ascertain       [the    plaintiffs']      political\n\naffiliation, or that they in fact gained that information.\"                              It\n\nreasoned similarly with respect to allegations about disparaging\n\n\n                                            -24-\n\fremarks made by Berlingeri: \"The fact Berlingeri may have made\n\ndisparaging remarks about the previous administration does not lead\n\nto the conclusion that she thought or knew that plaintiffs were PDP\n\nmembers or supporters\" and that \"[t]he same can be said\" of the\n\nplaintiffs' allegations regarding the overtly politicized conduct\n\nof Berlingeri's aide.\n\n          The district court erred by not affording the plaintiffs'\n\nallegations the presumption of truth to which they were entitled.\n\nFirst, as we explained above, the Supreme Court's concerns about\n\nconclusory allegations expressed in Twombly and Iqbal focused on\n\nallegations    of   ultimate   legal   conclusions    and   on    unadorned\n\nrecitations of a cause-of-action's elements couched as factual\n\nassertions.    Allegations of discrete factual events such as the\n\ndefendants questioning the plaintiffs and replacing the plaintiffs\n\nwith new employees are not \"conclusory\" in the relevant sense.\n\nSecond, factual allegations in a complaint do not need to contain\n\nthe level of specificity sought by the district court.            See, e.g.,\n\nLeatherman v. Tarrant Cty. Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination\n\nUnit, 507 U.S. 163, 167-69 (1993); cf. Iqbal, 127 S. Ct. at 1951\n\n(accepting    allegations   that   the    FBI   \"arrested   and    detained\n\nthousands of Arab Muslim men\" pursuant to a policy that was\n\n\"approved by [the defendants] in discussions in the weeks after\n\nSeptember 11, 2001\") (internal quotation marks omitted); Twombly,\n\n550 U.S. at 550-51, 564-65 (accepting allegations that defendants\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f\"engaged in parallel conduct\" and failed to \"meaningfully . . .\n\npursue attractive business opportunities\") (alterations omitted)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 565 n.10\n\n(\"Here, our concern is not that the allegations in the complaint\n\nwere   insufficiently   'particularized';   rather,   the   complaint\n\nwarranted dismissal because it failed in toto to render plaintiffs'\n\nentitlement to relief plausible.\") (alteration omitted) (citation\n\nomitted).    The plaintiffs' allegations were sufficiently detailed\n\nto provide the defendants \"fair notice of what the . . . claim is\n\nand the grounds upon which it rests.\"         Id. at 555 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).    Those allegations should not have been\n\ndisregarded.\n\n            Additionally, the district court erred when it failed to\n\nevaluate the cumulative effect of the factual allegations.        The\n\nquestion confronting a court on a motion to dismiss is whether all\n\nthe facts alleged, when viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\nplaintiffs, render the plaintiff's entitlement to relief plausible.\n\nSee id. at 569 n.14; Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 588 F.3d 585,\n\n594 (8th Cir. 2009) (explaining that \"the complaint should be read\n\nas a whole, not parsed piece by piece to determine whether each\n\nallegation, in isolation, is plausible\").      No single allegation\n\nneed \"lead to the conclusion\" -- in the district court's words --\n\nof some necessary element, provided that, in sum, the allegations\n\nof the complaint make the claim as a whole at least plausible.    See\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fSepúlveda-Villarini, 628 F.3d at 29 (\"The make-or-break standard\n\n. . . is that the combined allegations, taken as true, must state\n\na plausible, not a merely conceivable, case for relief.\") (emphasis\n\nadded).   Indeed, the Supreme Court has suggested that allegations\n\nthat would individually lack the heft to make a claim plausible may\n\nsuffice to state a claim in the context of the complaint's other\n\nfactual allegations.        See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557 (\"An allegation\n\nof parallel conduct . . . gets the complaint close to stating a\n\nclaim, but without some further factual enhancement it stops short\n\nof the line between possibility and plausibility.\").\n\n              We   also   reject   the   district    court's    \"lead   to   the\n\nconclusion\" formulation to the extent it implies a stronger logical\n\nconnection than that demanded by plausibility.                As we have said\n\npreviously, \"[a] plausible but inconclusive inference from pleaded\n\nfacts will survive a motion to dismiss.\"            Sepúlveda-Villarini, 628\n\nF.3d at 30.\n\n              Taking all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, the\n\nplaintiffs in this case have pleaded adequate factual material to\n\nsupport   a    reasonable    inference    that   the   four    defendants    had\n\nknowledge of their political beliefs.            The complaint states that\n\nthe defendants asked several plaintiffs about \"the circumstances\n\npertaining to how and when they got to work at Fortaleza\"; that an\n\naide to Berlingeri similarly \"asked each of them as to how and when\n\nthey began work at the Governor's Mansion,\" taking notes on their\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fresponses; and that confidential clerical personnel brought in by\n\nthe new administration \"insisted on interrogating them in order to\n\nascertain their respective political affiliations.\"                    This last\n\nallegation, in particular, contains a clear assertion that the\n\nclerical staff inquired directly into the plaintiffs' political\n\naffiliations, rather than obliquely into circumstances that might\n\nimply such affiliations.         Cf. Montfort-Rodríguez v. Rey-Hernández,\n\n504 F.3d 221, 226 (1st Cir. 2007) (finding sufficient evidence of\n\na   defendant's      knowledge   where   he   had    asked   a   subordinate   to\n\ngenerate a list of trust employees and where subordinate thereby\n\nacquired knowledge of the political affiliation of employees). The\n\nplaintiffs' complaint thus plainly shows that the defendants were\n\nactively seeking the knowledge in question from the plaintiffs.\n\n           The plaintiffs' complaint also shows that the information\n\nwas potentially accessible to the defendants from sources other\n\nthan the plaintiffs.          The complaint states that employees at La\n\nFortaleza knew, and commonly discussed, the political affiliations\n\nof their co-workers. Cf. Peguero-Moronta v. Santiago, 464 F.3d 29,\n\n48 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding sufficient evidence of defendants'\n\nknowledge where \"evidence portrays a relatively small workplace\n\nwhere   everyone       knew   who    everyone    else    was     and   political\n\naffiliations      were   common     office    knowledge\").        In   the   same\n\nparagraph,     the    complaint     states    that    certain    NPP-affiliated\n\nemployees who possessed this information were promoted to \"high\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\flevel trust positions\" by the defendants following the change of\n\nadministration and were consulted by the defendants in making\n\nemployment decisions.          These allegations are also consistent with\n\nthe   plaintiffs'        allegation    of    rumors   that    had    spread    among\n\nemployees     at    La     Fortaleza    suggesting      the    defendants          were\n\nmaintaining a list of \"employees considered as PDP's [sic] . . .\n\nwho would be terminated and substituted with NPP'ers [sic].\"\n\n            In short, in light of the pleadings as a whole, these\n\nallegations       plausibly    show    the   defendants'      awareness       of    the\n\nplaintiffs' political affiliation at the time that they were\n\nterminated.\n\nB.    Causation\n\n            A plausible discrimination claim requires more than an\n\nawareness of the plaintiffs' political affiliations.                     It requires\n\na reasonable inference that the plaintiffs' political affiliation\n\nwas a substantial or motivating factor in the defendants' conduct.\n\nSee Peñalbert-Rosa, 631 F.3d at 594.              Moreover, each defendant's\n\nrole in the termination decision must be sufficiently alleged to\n\nmake him or her a plausible defendant.                   After all, \"we must\n\ndetermine whether, as to each defendant, a plaintiff's pleadings\n\nare sufficient to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\"\n\nSanchez, 590 F.3d at 48; see also Peñalbert-Rosa, 631 F.3d at 594\n\n(\"[S]ave under special conditions, an adequate complaint must\n\ninclude     not    only    a   plausible      claim   but     also   a     plausible\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fdefendant.\").\n\n            1.   The Defendants' Participation in the Termination\n            Decision.\n\n            Public officials may be held liable under § 1983 for a\n\nconstitutional violation only if a plaintiff can establish that his\n\nor her constitutional injury \"resulted from the direct acts or\n\nomissions of the official, or from indirect conduct that amounts to\n\ncondonation or tacit authorization.\"         Rodríguez-García v. Miranda-\n\nMarín, 610 F.3d 756, 768 (1st Cir. 2010).             This standard can be\n\nsatisfied by conduct \"'setting in motion a series of acts by others\n\nwhich the actor knows or reasonably should know would cause others\n\nto inflict the constitutional injury.'\"           Sanchez, 590 F.3d at 50\n\n(quoting Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 561 (1st\n\nCir. 1989)).      Because precise knowledge of the chain of events\n\nleading to the constitutional violation may often be unavailable to\n\na plaintiff at this early stage of the litigation, we take to heart\n\nthe Supreme Court's call to \"draw on our 'judicial experience and\n\ncommon   sense'    as   we   make   a    contextual   judgment   about   the\n\nsufficiency of the pleadings.\"          See id. (quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct.\n\nat 1950).\n\n            The district court concluded that the allegations of\n\nparticipation by Governor Fortuño, First Lady Vela, and Blanco were\n\ninadequate because they relied entirely on \"the positions these\n\ndefendants hold within the governor's mansion,\" and \"no additional\n\nfactual allegations, such as interactions between the defendants\n\n                                    -30-\n\fand particular plaintiffs, . . . tie Fortuño, Vela, and Blanco to\n\nthe deprivation of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\"                     That\n\nconclusion was erroneous.          Although § 1983 liability cannot rest\n\nsolely on a defendant's position of authority, see Ayala-Rodriguez\n\nv. Rullán, 511 F.3d 232, 236 (1st Cir. 2007), the plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint does include other well-pleaded factual allegations that\n\ndetail    each    of    these    three     defendants'       level    of    personal\n\ninvolvement in and familiarity with the plaintiffs' terminations.\n\n            According to the complaint, Governor Fortuño is the\n\nnominating authority at La Fortaleza.              He approves or disapproves\n\nof all personnel decisions at the mansion.                 As early as January\n\n2009,    Governor      Fortuño   signed    an    Executive    Order    authorizing\n\nBerlingeri to issue termination notices at La Fortaleza.                         The\n\nplaintiffs       have    alleged    that        Governor   Fortuño         personally\n\nparticipated in questioning them about how and when they began to\n\nwork at La Fortaleza in order to learn their political affiliation.\n\nWhen responding to press questions about the potential termination\n\nof government employees, Governor Fortuño allegedly stated that\n\nthose who would be terminated \"did not vote for him.\"\n\n            According to the complaint, First Lady Vela serves as the\n\nchair of a committee charged with the maintenance, restoration, and\n\npreservation of La Fortaleza. In that role, she allegedly oversees\n\nmaintenance and domestic workers.                Indeed, the complaint states\n\nthat she publicly took personal responsibility for overseeing\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fcertain renovations and improvements in her time at La Fortaleza,\n\ndemonstrating her active participation in that role.\n\n            Vela allegedly interacted with the plaintiffs while they\n\nexecuted their duties, making disparaging remarks to them about the\n\nprior PDP administration and informing them that \"changes had\n\ncome.\"   She is also alleged to have been overheard stating her\n\nintention     to   \"clean   up     the     kitchen,\"      a    remark    reasonably\n\nunderstood    as   reflecting      an    intent     to   replace      certain      staff\n\nmembers. The district court improperly disregarded this comment as\n\n\"an   ambiguous    remark   that      does    not   necessarily       refer     to   the\n\ndismissals at issue in this case.\"              On a motion to dismiss, we are\n\nobligated to view the facts of the complaint in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiffs, and to resolve any ambiguities in\n\ntheir favor.       Given these requirements, the \"necessarily refer\"\n\nstandard of the district court is particularly inappropriate for\n\nevaluating the sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.\n\n            Finally, Blanco is alleged to be the Chief of Staff at La\n\nFortaleza, a title which itself indicates his role in personnel\n\nmanagement.        According     to     the     complaint,      Blanco       was     also\n\nresponsible    for   answering     press        questions     about    the    specific\n\nterminations at La Fortaleza.            In responding to the press, Blanco\n\nallegedly lied about the reason for the plaintiffs' termination,\n\nclaiming that the plaintiffs were privy to confidential information\n\nand that performance evaluations were being regularly conducted.\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\fThe   allegations   in   the   complaint   show,   however,    that   Blanco\n\nunderstood the true reason for the terminations at La Fortaleza,\n\nwhich he revealed by making disparaging remarks about the prior PDP\n\nadministration to a group of former employees who were protesting\n\nat the mansion.      The complaint also states that Blanco openly\n\nacknowledged to the press that some of the terminated employees\n\nwould be replaced.\n\n           As we have often emphasized, one rarely finds \"smoking\n\ngun\" evidence in a political discrimination case.             Lamboy-Ortiz,\n\n630 F.3d at 240.    Circumstantial evidence must, at times, suffice.\n\nMoreover, the requirement of plausibility on a motion to dismiss\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) \"simply calls for enough fact to raise a\n\nreasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the\n\nillegal [conduct].\"      Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556.       The allegations\n\nabove plausibly show that each defendant possessed knowledge of and\n\nshared some responsibility for the termination of employees at La\n\nFortaleza.4\n\n           2. Political Affiliation as a Motivating Factor in the\n           Termination of the Plaintiffs' Employment.\n\n           Turning to the question of discriminatory motive, we must\n\nagain conclude that the district court erred.         The allegations of\n\nthe plaintiffs' complaint support the reasonable inference that the\n\n\n      4\n       As previously noted, the district court concluded that\nBerlingeri's participation was adequately pled because the\nplaintiffs alleged that she signed their termination letters. The\ndefendants do not dispute that conclusion.\n\n                                   -33-\n\fdefendants' decision to terminate the plaintiffs' employment was\n\nsubstantially motivated by political affiliation.\n\n          We have previously explained that a politically charged\n\nemployment atmosphere \"occasioned by the major political shift from\n\nthe NPP to the PDP . . . coupled with the fact that plaintiffs and\n\ndefendants   are   of   competing    political   persuasions[]   may   be\n\nprobative of discriminatory animus.\"        Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte, 1\n\nF.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir. 1993).        Here, the plaintiffs have alleged\n\njust such a case.       Following the election of Governor Fortuño,\n\n\"logos and flyers allusive to the NPP and Governor Fortuño were in\n\nfull display and clear to employees at the Governor's Mansion.\"\n\nThe political affiliation of employees was \"commonly shared and\n\ndiscussed\" while rumors spread concerning a list of PDP-affiliated\n\nworkers who were to be terminated. The plaintiffs alleged that the\n\ndefendants contributed to the politically charged atmosphere by\n\nrepeatedly inquiring into the political affiliation of employees\n\nand by making disparaging comments to employees about the prior PDP\n\nadministration, including Vela's expressed intent to \"clean up the\n\nkitchen\" and assertions by Vela and Berlingeri's aide that \"things\n\nhad indeed changed\" at La Fortaleza. Cf. Lamboy-Ortiz, 630 F.3d at\n\n239 (holding that it was reasonable for a plaintiff to bring a\n\npolitical discrimination suit against a PDP-affiliated mayor who\n\nhad made \"vitriolic, anti-NPP commentary,\" had stated an intent to\n\n\"make [a] cleanup\" of certain NPP-affiliated employees, and who was\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\frumored to have maintained a \"list\" of NPP-affiliated employees he\n\nintended to oust).\n\n           The allegations of the complaint go well beyond this\n\natmospheric evidence, however.          The plaintiffs alleged that they\n\nwere fired less than ten weeks after Governor Fortuño assumed\n\noffice.    Although the district court is correct that temporal\n\nproximity between the change in political administration and the\n\nturnover of staff is not itself sufficient to satisfy a plaintiff's\n\nburden    of   proof     on    the   causation     element   of   a   political\n\ndiscrimination claim, it unquestionably contributes at the motion\n\nto dismiss stage to the reasonable inference that the employment\n\ndecision was politically motivated.              See, e.g., Peguero-Moronta,\n\n464 F.3d at 53.         In contrast to their treatment, the plaintiffs\n\nalleged that NPP-affiliated employees were promoted to high-level\n\ntrust positions following the change in administration. Similarly,\n\nthe plaintiffs alleged that their positions at La Fortaleza were\n\nfilled almost immediately by NPP-affiliated workers.                    We have\n\npreviously described such comparative evidence as \"helpful\" in\n\ndemonstrating that a particular plaintiff was targeted for his or\n\nher political views.          See Mercado-Berrios v. Cancel-Alegría, 611\n\nF.3d 18, 24 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n           Lastly, plaintiffs again point to the public statements\n\nmade by the defendants as an acknowledgment of the political\n\nmotivation     behind    the    administration's      employment      decisions.\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\fBlanco's alleged misstatements to the press about the reasons for\n\nthe terminations at La Fortaleza and about conducting regular\n\nperformance evaluations bolster the plaintiffs' contention that the\n\nterminations had a discriminatory basis.5 See Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d\n\nat 68 (\"[T]o the extent the reasons given by the employer at the\n\ntime of the dismissal are later proven false or frivolous, the\n\nweight of the evidence of discriminatory animus may be enhanced.\").\n\nSimilarly, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,\n\nBlanco's and Berlingeri's alleged disparaging remarks about the\n\nprior PDP-affiliated administration to terminated employees, and\n\nGovernor Fortuño's press statements that \"none of them voted for\n\nhim\" when questioned about potential employee firings, serve to\n\nconfirm the plaintiffs' core allegation: the defendants' political\n\nbiases played a substantial role in the employment decisions at La\n\nFortaleza.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n           The    cumulative     weight    of    the    plaintiffs'    factual\n\nallegations easily nudges their claim of political discrimination\n\n\"across   the    line   from   conceivable      to   plausible\"   as   to   each\n\ndefendant.      Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1951.             Read as a whole, the\n\n\n     5\n       The district court concluded that, because of the nature of\ntheir positions, the plaintiffs \"were not entitled to any\nexplanation\" for their termination and that the lack of performance\nevaluations was not \"relevant\" to the claim. We disagree. The\nlack of any plausible alternative justification for the plaintiffs'\nterminations makes the inference of political discrimination from\nthe facts alleged more reasonable.\n\n                                    -36-\n\fplaintiffs'     complaint   unquestionably      describes    a   plausible\n\ndiscriminatory sequence that is all too familiar in this circuit.\n\nSee, e.g., Peñalbert-Rosa, 631 F.3d 592 (suit against newly elected\n\ngovernor brought by receptionist at public building within La\n\nFortaleza); Vazquez Rios v. Hernandez Colon, 819 F.2d 319 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (suit against newly elected governor and administrator for\n\npolitical discrimination against domestic workers at La Fortaleza);\n\nsee generally Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols, 375 F.3d 121, 126\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (\"With each change in administration . . . the\n\nfederal district courts in Puerto Rico are flooded with hundreds of\n\npolitical discrimination cases, many of which are appealed.\").\n\n            Under the Federal Rules, no more is required to \"unlock\n\nthe doors of discovery\" for these plaintiffs.          See Iqbal, 129 S.\n\nCt. at 1950.    Although discovery may reveal facts that belie the\n\nplaintiffs'     claim,    that   possibility    does   not   negate    its\n\nplausibility.    See Sepúlveda-Villarini, 628 F.3d at 30.        \"[I]t is\n\nsimply a reminder that plausibility of allegations may not be\n\nmatched by adequacy of evidence.\"         Id.\n\n            We therefore vacate the portion of the district court's\n\norder dismissing the plaintiffs' political discrimination claim and\n\nsupplemental Commonwealth law claims, and the case is hereby\n\nremanded.    Costs are awarded to the appellants.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\f",

This case involves a claim of\n\npolitical       discrimination       stemming    from    the   2008   gubernatorial\n\nelection       in   Puerto   Rico.

As Governor, he is the nominating authority at La\n\nFortaleza; he approves or disapproves of all personnel decisions\n\nrelating to employment at the mansion.         In early January 2009,\n\nGovernor Fortuño named defendant Berlingeri Administrator at La\n\nFortaleza, and he signed an executive order authorizing her to\n\nterminate employees there on his behalf.       He also named defendant\n\nBlanco Chief of Staff.    As the First Lady of Puerto Rico, defendant\n\nVela chairs the Conservation and Maintenance of La Fortaleza\n\nCommittee and is responsible for overseeing the mansion; she has\n\npublicly   acknowledged    her   personal   involvement   in   overseeing\n\nrepairs and refurbishing work at La Fortaleza.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f            Shortly    after       Governor    Fortuño    took   office,    logos,\n\nemblems, and flyers supporting the NPP and Governor Fortuño were\n\nprominently displayed at La Fortaleza.               Employees at the mansion\n\nopenly   discussed     their       political    affiliations,     as     some    NPP-\n\naffiliated employees were promoted to high-level trust positions\n\nwhile rumors spread of a list of PDP-affiliated employees who would\n\nbe terminated and replaced with NPP-affiliated workers.                   Employees\n\nwere   questioned     on    multiple    occasions,       including   by   Governor\n\nFortuño himself, about the circumstances of their hire at La\n\nFortaleza, which the plaintiffs contend was merely an attempt to\n\nascertain or verify each employee's political affiliation. Indeed,\n\nthe new administration brought in confidential clerical personnel\n\nwho interrogated employees for that very purpose.\n\n            Governor       Fortuño's    campaign      jingle,    \"It's    time    to\n\nchange,\" proved to be a recurring theme for employees at La\n\nFortaleza    following       the    change     in   administration.        One    of\n\nBerlingeri's trusted aides used the jingle as the ringtone on his\n\ncellular telephone (which also prominently displayed the NPP logo).\n\nHe would also loudly sing the jingle in front of the maintenance\n\nemployees he commanded and would state on occasion that things had\n\nindeed changed. Similarly, First Lady Vela informed employees that\n\n\"changes had come,\" and she would make disparaging and derogatory\n\ncomments about the prior PDP administration to employees as they\n\nexecuted their duties.         She was also overheard stating her intent\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fto \"clean up the kitchen,\" an apparent reference to an impending\n\nchange in kitchen staff.\n\n           The plaintiffs in this case performed maintenance work or\n\nhousekeeping tasks at La Fortaleza, such as laundry, ironing,\n\nsewing, and cleaning.         Some of the plaintiffs had held their\n\npositions at the mansion for nearly twenty years.                 On either\n\nFebruary 27 or March 11 of 2009, each of the plaintiffs received a\n\ntermination letter signed by Berlingeri.          They were fired without\n\nnotice, without cause, and without having their job performance\n\nevaluated by the incoming administration.          None of the plaintiffs\n\nhad been known members of the NPP.         Within days, their positions at\n\nLa Fortaleza were filled by NPP-affiliated workers.\n\n           In answering press questions about the layoffs at La\n\nFortaleza, Blanco stated falsely that the employees who were\n\nterminated had been privy to confidential, sensitive information.\n\nIn   actuality,   none   of   the   plaintiffs   had   held    policy-making\n\npositions,   performed    functions    similar    to   those   performed    by\n\npolicy-making employees, or had access to confidential information\n\nrelated to policy.       Blanco further informed the press, \"We are\n\nmaking employment evaluations every month,\" an assertion belied by\n\nthe lack of evaluation preceding the plaintiffs' terminations.\n\n           The defendants made other public statements indicating\n\nthat political affiliation may have been a consideration in the\n\nadministration's    employment      decisions,   including     those   at   La\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fFortaleza.     In addressing the press on the topic of government\n\nlayoffs generally, Governor Fortuño flatly stated that \"none of\n\nthem voted for him,\" in reference to the employees who might be\n\nterminated.    When specifically responding to criticism by a group\n\nof terminated employees who were protesting at La Fortaleza, Blanco\n\nmade disparaging comments about the prior PDP administration and\n\nacknowledged    that   the   fired    employees   were   part   of     that\n\nadministration.     Berlingeri similarly made disparaging remarks\n\nabout the prior administration when addressing criticism by a group\n\nof terminated employees.\n\nB.   Procedural Background\n\n           The plaintiffs brought suit in federal district court\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, supplemented by claims brought under\n\nthe laws and Constitution of Puerto Rico.          They alleged three\n\nconstitutional violations in the termination of their employment:\n\npolitical discrimination in violation of the First Amendment,\n\ndeprivation of a property interest without due process of law, and\n\nthe denial of equal protection.\n\n           At an initial case conference in April 2009, the district\n\ncourt informed the plaintiffs that their complaint satisfied the\n\nfederal notice pleading standard, and it advised the defendants not\n\nto file a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the complaint.             In May\n\n2009, however, the district court scheduled an emergency hearing\n\nmotu proprio to hear arguments on whether the recently issued Iqbal\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fdecision required the complaint to be dismissed due to insufficient\n\nfactual allegations.       At that hearing, the defendants officially\n\nmoved to dismiss the complaint.      The court denied the defendants'\n\nmotion without prejudice and granted the plaintiffs thirty days to\n\namend their complaint to comply with Iqbal.         The plaintiffs timely\n\nfiled an amended complaint, and the defendants again moved to\n\ndismiss. After a hearing, the district court dismissed the amended\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim.2\n\nC.   The District Court Opinion\n\n           The district court began its opinion and order in this\n\ncase by dismissing all claims against three of the four defendants\n\n-- Governor Fortuño, First Lady Vela, and Blanco. According to the\n\ncourt, the factual allegations in the complaint failed to show with\n\nthe required specificity that those three defendants had caused the\n\nplaintiffs' terminations. The court described the plaintiffs' case\n\nagainst those defendants as resting on \"an implicit assumption that\n\nthe defendants' [sic] participated in the decision\" because of\n\ntheir positions of authority. It noted that \"no additional factual\n\nallegations,   such   as   interactions   between    the   defendants   and\n\nparticular plaintiffs, . . . tie Fortuño, Vela, and Blanco to the\n\ndeprivation of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\"\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The plaintiffs do not challenge the dismissal of their\n§ 1983 claims based on the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f             The district court did find, however, that the plaintiffs\n\nhad \"minimally satisfied\" their burden of pleading Berlingeri's\n\nparticipation in the terminations, \"since the plaintiffs allege\n\nthat   she    signed   the   letter     which   officially   separated   the\n\nplaintiffs from their employment at La Fortaleza.\" It nevertheless\n\nconcluded    that   the   plaintiffs'    political    discrimination   claim\n\nfailed because the complaint lacked sufficient factual allegations\n\nto show that Berlingeri had knowledge of the plaintiffs' political\n\naffiliation or that political affiliation played a role in the\n\ntermination decision: \"The fact that Berlingeri may have made\n\ndisparaging remarks about the previous administration does not lead\n\nto the conclusion that she thought or knew that plaintiffs were PDP\n\nmembers or supporters.\"      It found that \"the same can be said\" with\n\nrespect to the plaintiffs' allegations that Berlingeri's trusted\n\naide was a staunch NPP supporter, wore the party's logo, and sang\n\nGovernor Fortuño's campaign jingle.         The court also discounted the\n\ncomplaint's allegation that Berlingeri, the other defendants, and\n\nnewly hired clerical staff had inquired into the circumstances of\n\nthe plaintiffs' hire at La Fortaleza.           It noted that the complaint\n\n\"contains no specific account of these conversations,\" and thus\n\ndescribed it as \"a generic allegation, made without reference to\n\nspecific facts that might make it 'plausible on its face.'\"              The\n\ncourt further explained that had such inquiries taken place, that\n\nfact would \"not lead to the conclusion that [the defendants] did so\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fin order to ascertain [the plaintiffs'] political affiliation, or\n\nthat they in fact gained that information.\"\n\n           The court likewise discounted the plaintiffs' allegation\n\nthat they were replaced in their positions by NPP-affiliated\n\nworkers, describing it as \"a conclusory statement.\" It pointed out\n\nthat the \"plaintiffs do not identify who replaced any or all of the\n\nplaintiffs, nor the date of these replacements\" and that the\n\ncomplaint merely asserts \"that this occurred as to all of the\n\nplaintiffs.\" Further, the court found that the defendants' failure\n\nto justify the terminations or to conduct performance evaluations\n\nwas not \"relevant\" to the claim, as \"plaintiffs were not entitled\n\nto any explanation.\"        Lastly, the court explained that \"mere\n\ntemporal proximity\" between a change in administration and an\n\nemployee's dismissal is \"insufficient to establish discriminatory\n\nanimus.\"\n\n                                     II.\n\n           We    review   the   dismissal    of    a   complaint   under   Rule\n\n12(b)(6) de novo.     E.g., Tasker v. DHL Retirement Sav. Plan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"176713\"><a href=\"/opinion/176713/tasker-v-dhl-retirement-savings-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38 (1st Cir. 2010).        The sole inquiry under Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nis whether, construing the well-pleaded facts of the complaint in\n\nthe light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the complaint states a\n\nclaim for which relief can be granted.             Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n           The   Supreme    Court   has    twice    recently   clarified   the\n\nrequirements of an adequately stated federal claim.                 Given the\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fnature of the district court's errors in this case, and the\n\nfrequent invocation of these cases by litigants and the district\n\ncourts, we think it useful to set forth in some detail an account\n\nof those two decisions.\n\nA.   Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly\n\n            In Twombly, the Supreme Court affirmed the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of an antitrust class-action suit brought under\n\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1.            550 U.S. at 548.     The\n\nplaintiffs claimed that a group of regional telephone service\n\nproviders had conspired to restrain trade by restricting the growth\n\nof upstart competitors while refraining from competing with one\n\nanother.    Id. at 550.     The complaint both directly alleged that the\n\ndefendant    service    providers     \"'have    entered    into    a   contract,\n\ncombination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their\n\nrespective . . . markets'\" and also alleged conduct from which,\n\naccording to the plaintiffs, a conspiracy could be inferred, such\n\nas   an   \"'absence    of   any    meaningful   competition       between   [the\n\ndefendants] in one another's markets'\" and a \"'parallel course of\n\nconduct that each engaged in to prevent competition from [upstart\n\ncompetitors].'\"       Id. at 551.    The Court of Appeals for the Second\n\nCircuit reversed the district court's order dismissing the case,\n\nasserting    that     \"to   rule   that   allegations     of   parallel     anti-\n\ncompetitive conduct fail to support a plausible conspiracy claim,\n\na court would have to conclude that there is no set of facts that\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fwould   permit     a   plaintiff    to    demonstrate      that   the   particular\n\nparallelism asserted was the product of collusion rather than\n\ncoincidence.\"      Id. at 553 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The    Supreme   Court       reversed    the   Second   Circuit   and\n\nreinstated the district court's order of dismissal.                     The Court\n\nexplained that the propriety of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) turns\n\non the complaint's compliance with Rule 8(a)(2), which mandates\n\nthat every complaint contain \"a short and plain statement of the\n\nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 8(a)(2).       Id. at 555.      It further explained that a \"short and\n\nplain\" statement does not need detailed factual allegations.                  Id.\n\nat 555.   That aspect of the Rule merely requires sufficient detail\n\nin the complaint to give a defendant fair notice of the claim and\n\nthe grounds upon which it rests.           Id. (citing Conley v. Gibson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1957)).\n\n            However, the Twombly Court reasoned, Rule 8(a)(2) also\n\nrequires \"that the plain statement possess enough heft to show that\n\nthe pleader is entitled to relief.\"             Id. at 557 (emphasis added)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).             It stated that a complaint\n\nonly \"shows\" an entitlement to relief if its factual allegations\n\nare \"enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level\n\non the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are\n\ntrue (even if doubtful in fact).\"                   See id. at 555 (citation\n\nomitted).    According to the Court, Rule 8(a)(2) must require more\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fthan mere \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of\n\nthe elements of a cause of action.\"          Id.    However, the Twombly\n\nCourt was also careful to explain that \"[h]ere, . . . we do not\n\nrequire heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough\n\nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n\nId. at 570.\n\n            Applying the Rule 8 pleading standard to the facts of the\n\ncase before it, the Twombly Court disregarded the complaint's\n\nallegations that the defendants had \"entered into a contract,\n\ncombination or conspiracy\" and had \"agreed not to compete with one\n\nanother.\"     According to the Court, \"on fair reading these are\n\nmerely legal conclusions resting on the prior allegations\" of\n\nparallel conduct and non-competition: \"the complaint leaves no\n\ndoubt that plaintiffs rest their § 1 claim on descriptions of\n\nparallel conduct and not on any independent allegation of actual\n\nagreement among the [defendants].\"3        Id. at 564.\n\n            Taking   as   true   the   remaining   allegations   that   the\n\ndefendants had \"engaged in parallel conduct\" and had failed to\n\n\n     3\n       The Court noted that if the plaintiffs had intended these\nstatements to serve as factual allegations that an agreement\noccurred, it is doubtful that they would have provided the\ndefendants with the notice required by Rule 8(a)(2): \"Apart from\nidentifying a seven-year span in which the § 1 violations were\nsupposed to have occurred,\" \"the complaint here furnishes no clue\nas to which of the four [defendants] (much less which of their\nemployees) supposedly agreed, or when and where the illicit\nagreement took place. . . . [A] defendant seeking to respond to\nplaintiffs' conclusory allegations in the § 1 context would have\nlittle idea where to begin.\" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 564 n.10.\n\n                                   -12-\n\f\"meaningfully pursue\" \"attractive business opportunit[ies],\" the\n\nTwombly Court concluded they were insufficient to \"invest[] either\n\nthe action or inaction alleged with a plausible suggestion of\n\nconspiracy.\"    Id. at 564-66.       It explained that, under the Sherman\n\nAct, \"[e]ven conscious parallelism, a common reaction of firms in\n\na   concentrated     market   that    recognize    their    shared   economic\n\ninterests . . . is not in itself unlawful,\" and that \"proof of a\n\n§   1   conspiracy   must   include   evidence    tending   to   exclude   the\n\npossibility of independent action.\"               Id. at 553-54 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (alterations omitted). The Court reasoned\n\nthat, though the alleged conduct was \"consistent with conspiracy,\"\n\nit was \"just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and\n\ncompetitive business strategy.\"         Id. at 554.\n\n             Indeed, the Court emphasized that the alleged conduct\n\nheld almost no probative value in showing the existence of a\n\nconspiracy:\n\n        [T]here is no reason to infer that the companies had\n        agreed among themselves to do what was only natural\n        anyway; so natural, in fact, that if alleging parallel\n        decisions to resist competition were enough to imply an\n        antitrust conspiracy, pleading a § 1 violation against\n        almost any group of competing business would be a sure\n        thing.\n\nId. at 566.    Finding an \"obvious alternative explanation\" for the\n\nalleged behavior of the defendants, the Twombly Court concluded\n\nthat the \"plaintiffs here have not nudged their claims across the\n\nline from conceivable to plausible.\"         Id. at 567, 570.\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            In   describing   facial   plausibility     as   the   governing\n\nstandard of Rule 8(a)(2), Twombly officially put to rest the well-\n\nknown \"no set of facts\" language used in one of the Court's\n\nearliest opinions interpreting the Federal Rules, Conley v. Gibson,\n\n355 U.S. at 45-46.       550 U.S. at 561.    Although the Twombly Court\n\nacknowledged that Conley's language had been sensible in the\n\ncontext of the case, it was at best \"an incomplete, negative gloss\n\non an accepted pleading standard.\"        Id. at 563.   That language had\n\nbeen erroneously employed by the Second Circuit to reverse the\n\ndistrict    court's   order   of   dismissal,   and   the    Twombly   Court\n\nexpressed its concern that the \"no set of facts\" formulation can\n\ntoo easily \"be read in isolation as saying that any statement\n\nrevealing the theory of the claim will suffice unless its factual\n\nimpossibility may be shown from the face of the pleadings.\"            Id. at\n\n561.    It elaborated:\n\n       On such a focused and literal reading . . . a wholly\n       conclusory statement of claim would survive a motion to\n       dismiss whenever the pleadings left open the possibility\n       that a plaintiff might later establish some set of\n       undisclosed facts to support recovery. . . . It seems\n       fair to say that this approach to pleading would dispense\n       with any showing of a reasonably founded hope that a\n       plaintiff would be able to make a case; Mr. Micawber's\n       optimism would be enough.\n\n\nId. at 561-62 (alteration omitted) (citation omitted) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).       The Court thus announced that, \"after\n\npuzzling the profession for 50 years, this famous observation has\n\nearned its retirement.\"       Id. at 563.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f            Importantly, even while retiring one famous precedent,\n\nthe Twombly Court explicitly affirmed another.               It emphasized that\n\nrequiring a plaintiff to show a plausible entitlement to relief was\n\nnot the same as imposing a \"heightened pleading requirement,\" and\n\nwas therefore not inconsistent with the Supreme Court's previous\n\ndeclaration in Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118482\"><a href=\"/opinion/118482/swierkiewicz-v-sorema-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002),\n\nthat a court may not insist on the allegation of \"specific facts\"\n\nthat would be necessary to prove the claim at trial.                 See Twombly,\n\n550 U.S. at 570.      To do so is incompatible with the notice pleading\n\nstructure of the Federal Rules.         Id.    The Court reiterated: \"Here,\n\nour concern is not that the allegations in the complaint were\n\ninsufficiently 'particularized'; rather, the complaint warranted\n\ndismissal     because    it   failed    in    toto    to    render    plaintiffs'\n\nentitlement to relief plausible.\"              Id. at 569 n.14 (alteration\n\nomitted) (internal citation omitted).\n\nB.   Ashcroft v. Iqbal\n\n            Iqbal involved a § 1983 claim brought by a detainee who\n\nhad been held in a Brooklyn detention center in the wake of the\n\nSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.               129 S. Ct. at 1943.        The\n\ncomplaint alleged that the conditions of the plaintiff's detention\n\nresulted    from    unconstitutional     racial,      ethnic,    and   religious\n\ndiscrimination in designating him a person of \"high interest.\" Id.\n\nat 1943-44.       Among the defendants named in the suit were Attorney\n\nGeneral    John    Ashcroft   and   Director    of    the   Federal    Bureau   of\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fInvestigation (\"FBI\") Robert Mueller.                     Id. at 1942.       After the\n\nSecond Circuit affirmed the district court's denial of their motion\n\nto dismiss, these two defendants petitioned for certiorari.                        Id.\n\n            To provide guidance to lower courts on how best to apply\n\nthe plausibility requirement of Rule 8(a)(2), the Iqbal Court\n\nendorsed a two-pronged approach that it saw as implicit in the\n\nTwombly decision.             Id. at 1950.           Under this approach, a court\n\nresolving    a       Rule    12(b)(6)    motion      to   dismiss   should     begin   by\n\nseparating       a    complaint's       factual      allegations     from    its   legal\n\nconclusions.          See id. at 1949-50.             Unlike factual allegations,\n\nlegal conclusions contained within a complaint are not entitled to\n\na presumption of truth.                 Id.     The Iqbal Court pointed to the\n\nallegation       that       the   Twombly      defendants    had    \"entered    into     a\n\ncontract, combination, or conspiracy,\" which had been disregarded\n\nby the Twombly Court, as an example of a conclusory statement that,\n\nthough presented as an assertion of fact, simply describes the\n\nlegal conclusion that the plaintiffs sought to infer from the other\n\nconduct alleged in the complaint.                    See id. at 1950.        The Court\n\nexplained that, if this conclusory allegation were afforded a\n\npresumption of truth, the Twombly plaintiffs \"would have stated a\n\nclaim for relief and been entitled to proceed perforce.\"                        Id.\n\n            The second prong of the approach endorsed by the Iqbal\n\nCourt requires a reviewing court to accept the remaining factual\n\nallegations in the complaint as true and to evaluate whether, taken\n\n\n                                              -16-\n\fas a whole, they state a facially plausible legal claim.                See id.\n\nAccording to the Court, \"[a] claim has facial plausibility when the\n\nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the\n\nreasonable    inference      that   the   defendant     is    liable   for    the\n\nmisconduct alleged.\"         Id. at 1949.    Echoing Twombly's conclusion\n\nthat the allegation of parallel conduct was \"just as much in line\"\n\nwith innocent conduct as with conspiracy, 550 U.S. at 554, the\n\nIqbal Court reiterated that a complaint may not stand simply on the\n\n\"sheer possibility\" that a defendant acted unlawfully or on facts\n\nthat are merely consistent with a defendant's liability.                See 129\n\nS. Ct. at 1949.          It cautioned, however, that evaluating the\n\nplausibility of a legal claim is a \"context-specific task that\n\nrequires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and\n\ncommon sense.\"      Id. at 1950.\n\n            Applying    this   two-pronged     approach,      the   Iqbal    Court\n\nidentified    and    disregarded     an   allegation     in   the   plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint    that    these    two   defendants,      high-ranking    government\n\nofficials, \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed\n\nto subject [the plaintiff] to harsh conditions of confinement as a\n\nmatter of policy, solely on account of his religion, race, and/or\n\nnational origin.\"        Id. at 1951 (alteration omitted) (internal\n\nquotation    marks     omitted).      The    Court    emphasized     that    this\n\nconclusory allegation simply mirrored the legal standard against\n\nwhich the complaint is to be tested, noting that \"Rule 8 does not\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fempower [the plaintiff] to plead the bare elements of his cause of\n\naction, affix the label 'general allegation,' and expect his\n\ncomplaint to survive a motion to dismiss.\"                Id. at 1954.\n\n              Turning to the remaining factual allegations, the Court\n\nreasoned that the plaintiff's claim was implausible.                  Although the\n\ncomplaint included a factual allegation that the FBI \"arrested and\n\ndetained thousands of Arab Muslim men . . . as part of its\n\ninvestigation of the events of September 11,\" the Court found that\n\nan inference of discriminatory intent was unreasonable in light of\n\nthe   \"more    likely    explanations.\"       Id.    at   1951   (alteration    in\n\noriginal) (internal quotation marks omitted).                    Recounting the\n\ncircumstances of the September 11 attacks, the Court explained why\n\n\"[i]t should come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing\n\nlaw enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their\n\nsuspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental\n\nimpact on Arab Muslims, even though the purpose of the policy was\n\nto target neither Arabs nor Muslims.\"               Id.    It also pointed out\n\nthat the plaintiff's only factual allegation specific to the two\n\npetitioning defendants accused them of \"adopting a policy approving\n\nof restrictive conditions of confinement for post-September-11\n\ndetainees.\"     Id. at 1952 (internal quotation marks omitted).                The\n\nCourt   explained       that   nothing   in   this    allegation       shows   the\n\ndefendants'     discriminatory     intent:    \"[A]s       we   have   noted,   [the\n\ndefendants] cannot be held liable unless they themselves acted on\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\faccount of a constitutionally protected characteristic.                 Yet [the\n\nplaintiff's] complaint does not contain any factual allegation\n\nsufficient to plausibly suggest [the defendant's] discriminatory\n\nstate of mind.\"      Id.\n\nC.   The Current State of Federal Notice Pleading\n\n               We distill the following principles from Twombly and\n\nIqbal.\n\n               Dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is\n\ninappropriate if the complaint satisfies Rule 8(a)(2)'s requirement\n\nof \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the\n\npleader is entitled to relief,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).                      See\n\nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949; Twombly 550 U.S. at 555.               A \"short and\n\nplain\" statement needs only enough detail to provide a defendant\n\nwith \"'fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon\n\nwhich it rests.'\"       Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citing Conley, 355\n\nU.S. at 47); see also Erickson v.

Ct. at 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at\n\n557).    In short, an adequate complaint must provide fair notice to\n\nthe defendants and state a facially plausible legal claim.\n\n            In resolving a motion to dismiss, a court should employ\n\na    two-pronged    approach.      It    should   begin   by    identifying    and\n\ndisregarding statements in the complaint that merely offer \"'legal\n\nconclusion[s] couched as . . . fact[]'\" or \"[t]hreadbare recitals\n\nof the elements of a cause of action.\"                Id. at 1949-50 (quoting\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555).         A plaintiff is not entitled to \"proceed\n\nperforce\" by virtue of allegations that merely parrot the elements\n\nof the cause of action.          See id. at 1950; cf. Sanchez v.

There is no question about the adequacy of the\n\n\n                                             -22-\n\fplaintiffs' complaint in this case with respect to two of these\n\nelements.       The     complaint      contains       straightforward          factual\n\nallegations         describing      the      parties'     opposing           political\n\naffiliations, including that the \"[d]efendants all belong to the\n\nNPP,\" that \"[e]ach and all plaintiffs are members of the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party . . . or are believed to be a member of the PDP,\"\n\nand that each        plaintiff \"was not a known member of the New\n\nProgressive Party.\"          On review of a motion to dismiss, we must\n\naccept these allegations as true.            Additionally, the defendants do\n\nnot contest that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the\n\ntermination     of     the     plaintiffs'       employment    at      La    Fortaleza\n\nconstitutes an adverse employment action.\n\n            At issue, then, is the correctness of the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that the plaintiffs' complaint fails to show\n\nthat the defendants had knowledge of the plaintiffs' political\n\naffiliation     and     that     the   plaintiffs'      political           affiliation\n\nmotivated     the     defendants'      participation      in     the        plaintiffs'\n\nterminations.\n\nA.   The Defendants' Knowledge\n\n            The district court assessed only Berlingeri's knowledge\n\nof the plaintiffs' political affiliation because it dismissed all\n\nclaims against Governor Fortuño, First Lady Vela, and Blanco on the\n\nground   that   the     allegations       were    insufficient      to      show   their\n\nparticipation in the plaintiffs' terminations.                      In effect, the\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\fcourt performed a causation analysis at the outset of its opinion\n\nthat obviated the need for an element-by-element assessment of the\n\nplaintiffs' claims with respect to three of the four defendants.\n\nAs we explain below, we disagree with the court's conclusion on\n\ncausation.        Hence,      we     must      assess      whether    the   plaintiffs'\n\nallegations show that all four defendants had knowledge of the\n\nplaintiffs' political affiliation.\n\n           The        district      court      concluded     that     the   plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint inadequately alleged Berlingeri's knowledge. In reaching\n\nthat conclusion, it disregarded as \"conclusory\" an allegation that\n\nthe plaintiffs were replaced by NPP-affiliated workers because the\n\nplaintiffs      \"do    not    identify        who   replaced    any   or    all    of   the\n\nplaintiffs,      nor    the       date   of    these    replacements.\"            It    also\n\ndisregarded as \"generic, blanket statements\" numerous allegations\n\nthat the defendants and their subordinates had questioned the\n\nplaintiffs about the circumstances of their hires in order to\n\ndiscern their political affiliations. The court explained that the\n\ncomplaint \"contains no specific account of these conversations.\"\n\nThe court then added that, even if the defendants had questioned\n\nthe plaintiffs about the circumstances of their employment, such\n\nquestioning \"does not lead to the conclusion that [the defendants]\n\ndid   so   in    order       to     ascertain       [the    plaintiffs']      political\n\naffiliation, or that they in fact gained that information.\"                              It\n\nreasoned similarly with respect to allegations about disparaging\n\n\n                                            -24-\n\fremarks made by Berlingeri: \"The fact Berlingeri may have made\n\ndisparaging remarks about the previous administration does not lead\n\nto the conclusion that she thought or knew that plaintiffs were PDP\n\nmembers or supporters\" and that \"[t]he same can be said\" of the\n\nplaintiffs' allegations regarding the overtly politicized conduct\n\nof Berlingeri's aide.\n\n          The district court erred by not affording the plaintiffs'\n\nallegations the presumption of truth to which they were entitled.\n\nFirst, as we explained above, the Supreme Court's concerns about\n\nconclusory allegations expressed in Twombly and Iqbal focused on\n\nallegations    of   ultimate   legal   conclusions    and   on    unadorned\n\nrecitations of a cause-of-action's elements couched as factual\n\nassertions.    Allegations of discrete factual events such as the\n\ndefendants questioning the plaintiffs and replacing the plaintiffs\n\nwith new employees are not \"conclusory\" in the relevant sense.\n\nSecond, factual allegations in a complaint do not need to contain\n\nthe level of specificity sought by the district court.

See\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fSepúlveda-Villarini, 628 F.3d at 29 (\"The make-or-break standard\n\n. . . is that the combined allegations, taken as true, must state\n\na plausible, not a merely conceivable, case for relief.\") (emphasis\n\nadded).   Indeed, the Supreme Court has suggested that allegations\n\nthat would individually lack the heft to make a claim plausible may\n\nsuffice to state a claim in the context of the complaint's other\n\nfactual allegations.        See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557 (\"An allegation\n\nof parallel conduct . . . gets the complaint close to stating a\n\nclaim, but without some further factual enhancement it stops short\n\nof the line between possibility and plausibility.\").\n\n              We   also   reject   the   district    court's    \"lead   to   the\n\nconclusion\" formulation to the extent it implies a stronger logical\n\nconnection than that demanded by plausibility.                As we have said\n\npreviously, \"[a] plausible but inconclusive inference from pleaded\n\nfacts will survive a motion to dismiss.\"            Sepúlveda-Villarini, 628\n\nF.3d at 30.\n\n              Taking all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, the\n\nplaintiffs in this case have pleaded adequate factual material to\n\nsupport   a    reasonable    inference    that   the   four    defendants    had\n\nknowledge of their political beliefs.            The complaint states that\n\nthe defendants asked several plaintiffs about \"the circumstances\n\npertaining to how and when they got to work at Fortaleza\"; that an\n\naide to Berlingeri similarly \"asked each of them as to how and when\n\nthey began work at the Governor's Mansion,\" taking notes on their\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fresponses; and that confidential clerical personnel brought in by\n\nthe new administration \"insisted on interrogating them in order to\n\nascertain their respective political affiliations.\"                    This last\n\nallegation, in particular, contains a clear assertion that the\n\nclerical staff inquired directly into the plaintiffs' political\n\naffiliations, rather than obliquely into circumstances that might\n\nimply such affiliations.

The\n\nplaintiffs' complaint thus plainly shows that the defendants were\n\nactively seeking the knowledge in question from the plaintiffs.\n\n           The plaintiffs' complaint also shows that the information\n\nwas potentially accessible to the defendants from sources other\n\nthan the plaintiffs.

In   the   same\n\nparagraph,     the    complaint     states    that    certain    NPP-affiliated\n\nemployees who possessed this information were promoted to \"high\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\flevel trust positions\" by the defendants following the change of\n\nadministration and were consulted by the defendants in making\n\nemployment decisions.          These allegations are also consistent with\n\nthe   plaintiffs'        allegation    of    rumors   that    had    spread    among\n\nemployees     at    La     Fortaleza    suggesting      the    defendants          were\n\nmaintaining a list of \"employees considered as PDP's [sic] . . .\n\nwho would be terminated and substituted with NPP'ers [sic].\"\n\n            In short, in light of the pleadings as a whole, these\n\nallegations       plausibly    show    the   defendants'      awareness       of    the\n\nplaintiffs' political affiliation at the time that they were\n\nterminated.\n\nB.    Causation\n\n            A plausible discrimination claim requires more than an\n\nawareness of the plaintiffs' political affiliations.                     It requires\n\na reasonable inference that the plaintiffs' political affiliation\n\nwas a substantial or motivating factor in the defendants' conduct.\n\nSee Peñalbert-Rosa, 631 F.3d at 594.              Moreover, each defendant's\n\nrole in the termination decision must be sufficiently alleged to\n\nmake him or her a plausible defendant.                   After all, \"we must\n\ndetermine whether, as to each defendant, a plaintiff's pleadings\n\nare sufficient to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\"\n\nSanchez, 590 F.3d at 48; see also Peñalbert-Rosa, 631 F.3d at 594\n\n(\"[S]ave under special conditions, an adequate complaint must\n\ninclude     not    only    a   plausible      claim   but     also   a     plausible\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fdefendant.\").\n\n            1.   The Defendants' Participation in the Termination\n            Decision.\n\n            Public officials may be held liable under § 1983 for a\n\nconstitutional violation only if a plaintiff can establish that his\n\nor her constitutional injury \"resulted from the direct acts or\n\nomissions of the official, or from indirect conduct that amounts to\n\ncondonation or tacit authorization.\"         Rodríguez-García v.

Because precise knowledge of the chain of events\n\nleading to the constitutional violation may often be unavailable to\n\na plaintiff at this early stage of the litigation, we take to heart\n\nthe Supreme Court's call to \"draw on our 'judicial experience and\n\ncommon   sense'    as   we   make   a    contextual   judgment   about   the\n\nsufficiency of the pleadings.\"          See id. (quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct.\n\nat 1950).\n\n            The district court concluded that the allegations of\n\nparticipation by Governor Fortuño, First Lady Vela, and Blanco were\n\ninadequate because they relied entirely on \"the positions these\n\ndefendants hold within the governor's mansion,\" and \"no additional\n\nfactual allegations, such as interactions between the defendants\n\n                                    -30-\n\fand particular plaintiffs, . . . tie Fortuño, Vela, and Blanco to\n\nthe deprivation of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\"                     That\n\nconclusion was erroneous.          Although § 1983 liability cannot rest\n\nsolely on a defendant's position of authority, see Ayala-Rodriguez\n\nv. Rullán, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203077\"><a href=\"/opinion/203077/ayala-rodriguez-v-rullan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236 (1st Cir. 2007), the plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint does include other well-pleaded factual allegations that\n\ndetail    each    of    these    three     defendants'       level    of    personal\n\ninvolvement in and familiarity with the plaintiffs' terminations.\n\n            According to the complaint, Governor Fortuño is the\n\nnominating authority at La Fortaleza.              He approves or disapproves\n\nof all personnel decisions at the mansion.                 As early as January\n\n2009,    Governor      Fortuño   signed    an    Executive    Order    authorizing\n\nBerlingeri to issue termination notices at La Fortaleza.                         The\n\nplaintiffs       have    alleged    that        Governor   Fortuño         personally\n\nparticipated in questioning them about how and when they began to\n\nwork at La Fortaleza in order to learn their political affiliation.\n\nWhen responding to press questions about the potential termination\n\nof government employees, Governor Fortuño allegedly stated that\n\nthose who would be terminated \"did not vote for him.\"\n\n            According to the complaint, First Lady Vela serves as the\n\nchair of a committee charged with the maintenance, restoration, and\n\npreservation of La Fortaleza. In that role, she allegedly oversees\n\nmaintenance and domestic workers.                Indeed, the complaint states\n\nthat she publicly took personal responsibility for overseeing\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fcertain renovations and improvements in her time at La Fortaleza,\n\ndemonstrating her active participation in that role.\n\n            Vela allegedly interacted with the plaintiffs while they\n\nexecuted their duties, making disparaging remarks to them about the\n\nprior PDP administration and informing them that \"changes had\n\ncome.\"   She is also alleged to have been overheard stating her\n\nintention     to   \"clean   up     the     kitchen,\"      a    remark    reasonably\n\nunderstood    as   reflecting      an    intent     to   replace      certain      staff\n\nmembers. The district court improperly disregarded this comment as\n\n\"an   ambiguous    remark   that      does    not   necessarily       refer     to   the\n\ndismissals at issue in this case.\"              On a motion to dismiss, we are\n\nobligated to view the facts of the complaint in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiffs, and to resolve any ambiguities in\n\ntheir favor.       Given these requirements, the \"necessarily refer\"\n\nstandard of the district court is particularly inappropriate for\n\nevaluating the sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.\n\n            Finally, Blanco is alleged to be the Chief of Staff at La\n\nFortaleza, a title which itself indicates his role in personnel\n\nmanagement.        According     to     the     complaint,      Blanco       was     also\n\nresponsible    for   answering     press        questions     about    the    specific\n\nterminations at La Fortaleza.            In responding to the press, Blanco\n\nallegedly lied about the reason for the plaintiffs' termination,\n\nclaiming that the plaintiffs were privy to confidential information\n\nand that performance evaluations were being regularly conducted.\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\fThe   allegations   in   the   complaint   show,   however,    that   Blanco\n\nunderstood the true reason for the terminations at La Fortaleza,\n\nwhich he revealed by making disparaging remarks about the prior PDP\n\nadministration to a group of former employees who were protesting\n\nat the mansion.      The complaint also states that Blanco openly\n\nacknowledged to the press that some of the terminated employees\n\nwould be replaced.\n\n           As we have often emphasized, one rarely finds \"smoking\n\ngun\" evidence in a political discrimination case.             Lamboy-Ortiz,\n\n630 F.3d at 240.    Circumstantial evidence must, at times, suffice.\n\nMoreover, the requirement of plausibility on a motion to dismiss\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) \"simply calls for enough fact to raise a\n\nreasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the\n\nillegal [conduct].\"      Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556.       The allegations\n\nabove plausibly show that each defendant possessed knowledge of and\n\nshared some responsibility for the termination of employees at La\n\nFortaleza.4\n\n           2. Political Affiliation as a Motivating Factor in the\n           Termination of the Plaintiffs' Employment.\n\n           Turning to the question of discriminatory motive, we must\n\nagain conclude that the district court erred.         The allegations of\n\nthe plaintiffs' complaint support the reasonable inference that the\n\n\n      4\n       As previously noted, the district court concluded that\nBerlingeri's participation was adequately pled because the\nplaintiffs alleged that she signed their termination letters. The\ndefendants do not dispute that conclusion.\n\n                                   -33-\n\fdefendants' decision to terminate the plaintiffs' employment was\n\nsubstantially motivated by political affiliation.\n\n          We have previously explained that a politically charged\n\nemployment atmosphere \"occasioned by the major political shift from\n\nthe NPP to the PDP . . . coupled with the fact that plaintiffs and\n\ndefendants   are   of   competing    political   persuasions[]   may   be\n\nprobative of discriminatory animus.\"        Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627336\"><a href=\"/opinion/627336/franco-acevedo-diaz-v-jose-e-aponte-ada-n-perez-franco-acevedo-diaz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69 (1st Cir. 1993).        Here, the plaintiffs have alleged\n\njust such a case.       Following the election of Governor Fortuño,\n\n\"logos and flyers allusive to the NPP and Governor Fortuño were in\n\nfull display and clear to employees at the Governor's Mansion.\"\n\nThe political affiliation of employees was \"commonly shared and\n\ndiscussed\" while rumors spread concerning a list of PDP-affiliated\n\nworkers who were to be terminated. The plaintiffs alleged that the\n\ndefendants contributed to the politically charged atmosphere by\n\nrepeatedly inquiring into the political affiliation of employees\n\nand by making disparaging comments to employees about the prior PDP\n\nadministration, including Vela's expressed intent to \"clean up the\n\nkitchen\" and assertions by Vela and Berlingeri's aide that \"things\n\nhad indeed changed\" at La Fortaleza. Cf. Lamboy-Ortiz, 630 F.3d at\n\n239 (holding that it was reasonable for a plaintiff to bring a\n\npolitical discrimination suit against a PDP-affiliated mayor who\n\nhad made \"vitriolic, anti-NPP commentary,\" had stated an intent to\n\n\"make [a] cleanup\" of certain NPP-affiliated employees, and who was\n\n\n                                    -34-\n\frumored to have maintained a \"list\" of NPP-affiliated employees he\n\nintended to oust).\n\n           The allegations of the complaint go well beyond this\n\natmospheric evidence, however.          The plaintiffs alleged that they\n\nwere fired less than ten weeks after Governor Fortuño assumed\n\noffice.    Although the district court is correct that temporal\n\nproximity between the change in political administration and the\n\nturnover of staff is not itself sufficient to satisfy a plaintiff's\n\nburden    of   proof     on    the   causation     element   of   a   political\n\ndiscrimination claim, it unquestionably contributes at the motion\n\nto dismiss stage to the reasonable inference that the employment\n\ndecision was politically motivated.              See, e.g., Peguero-Moronta,\n\n464 F.3d at 53.         In contrast to their treatment, the plaintiffs\n\nalleged that NPP-affiliated employees were promoted to high-level\n\ntrust positions following the change in administration. Similarly,\n\nthe plaintiffs alleged that their positions at La Fortaleza were\n\nfilled almost immediately by NPP-affiliated workers.                    We have\n\npreviously described such comparative evidence as \"helpful\" in\n\ndemonstrating that a particular plaintiff was targeted for his or\n\nher political views.          See Mercado-Berrios v. Cancel-Alegría, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149846\"><a href=\"/opinion/149846/mercado-berrios-v-cancel-alegria/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n           Lastly, plaintiffs again point to the public statements\n\nmade by the defendants as an acknowledgment of the political\n\nmotivation     behind    the    administration's      employment      decisions.\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\fBlanco's alleged misstatements to the press about the reasons for\n\nthe terminations at La Fortaleza and about conducting regular\n\nperformance evaluations bolster the plaintiffs' contention that the\n\nterminations had a discriminatory basis.5 See Acevedo-Diaz, 1 F.3d\n\nat 68 (\"[T]o the extent the reasons given by the employer at the\n\ntime of the dismissal are later proven false or frivolous, the\n\nweight of the evidence of discriminatory animus may be enhanced.\").\n\nSimilarly, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,\n\nBlanco's and Berlingeri's alleged disparaging remarks about the\n\nprior PDP-affiliated administration to terminated employees, and\n\nGovernor Fortuño's press statements that \"none of them voted for\n\nhim\" when questioned about potential employee firings, serve to\n\nconfirm the plaintiffs' core allegation: the defendants' political\n\nbiases played a substantial role in the employment decisions at La\n\nFortaleza.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n           The    cumulative     weight    of    the    plaintiffs'    factual\n\nallegations easily nudges their claim of political discrimination\n\n\"across   the    line   from   conceivable      to   plausible\"   as   to   each\n\ndefendant.      Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1951.             Read as a whole, the\n\n\n     5\n       The district court concluded that, because of the nature of\ntheir positions, the plaintiffs \"were not entitled to any\nexplanation\" for their termination and that the lack of performance\nevaluations was not \"relevant\" to the claim. We disagree. The\nlack of any plausible alternative justification for the plaintiffs'\nterminations makes the inference of political discrimination from\nthe facts alleged more reasonable.\n\n                                    -36-\n\fplaintiffs'     complaint   unquestionably      describes    a   plausible\n\ndiscriminatory sequence that is all too familiar in this circuit.\n\nSee, e.g., Peñalbert-Rosa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (suit against newly elected\n\ngovernor brought by receptionist at public building within La\n\nFortaleza); Vazquez Rios v.
