Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Marie E. Hansen and Willey Law Offices on brief for appellant.\n     Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, Donald C.\nLockhart, and Adi Goldstein, Assistant United States Attorneys, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                               August 1, 2006\n\f           Per Curiam. Defendant-appellant Hiawatha Burks appeals\n\nfrom the sentence imposed after this court granted the parties'\n\njoint motion for remand pursuant to United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. 220 (2005).     On re-sentencing, the district court imposed a\n\nsentence of 120 months, below the originally-imposed sentence of\n\n168 months, the bottom of the applicable guidelines range.                 On\n\nappeal,    Burks    maintains    that      the   120-month    sentence      is\n\nunreasonable, notwithstanding that it is the sentence that defense\n\ncounsel requested at the re-sentencing hearing.1\n\n           Under Booker, sentences are reviewed for reasonableness,\n\nregardless of whether they fall within or outside of the advisory\n\nguidelines range.     See United States v. Smith, 445 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).     The emphasis in reviewing post-Booker claims that a\n\nsentence   is   unreasonable    is   \"on   the   provision   of   a   reasoned\n\nexplanation, a plausible outcome and - where these criteria are met\n\n- some deference to different judgments by the district judges on\n\nthe scene.\" United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n           I. Mitigating Factors\n\n           Appellant faults the district court for failing to give\n\nadequate consideration to certain mitigating factors, including:\n\nage of the defendant (25 years old at the time of the offense),\n\n\n     1\n       It is unnecessary for us to decide whether, given defense\ncounsel's request, Burks has waived the right to challenge the\nlength of the sentence on reasonableness grounds.\n\n                                     -2-\n\feducation and vocational skills, past substance abuse and recent\n\nrehabilitation, and family ties and responsibilities (as father of\n\na four-year-old son).        \"That a factor is discouraged or forbidden\n\nunder the guidelines does not automatically make it irrelevant when\n\na   court   is   weighing     the    statutory      factors     apart    from    the\n\nguidelines.      The guidelines - being advisory - are no longer\n\ndecisive as to factors any more than as to results.\" Smith, 445\n\nF.3d at 5.\n\n            At   the    re-sentencing           hearing,    defendant     did    not\n\nspecifically ask the court to consider most of the mitigating\n\nfactors that he focuses on in the present appeal.                  Therefore, he\n\nmay have waived his claims based on those factors.                      See United\n\nStates v. Mayes, 332 F.3d 34, 37 n.4 (1st Cir. 2003).                  Nonetheless,\n\nthe sentencing transcripts indicate that the court considered the\n\nmitigating factors that Burks relies upon on appeal.                   In imposing\n\na sentence well below the applicable guidelines range, the court\n\ntook into consideration Burks' participation in education and other\n\nprograms during his incarceration.               With respect to Burks' youth\n\nand his family ties, the court reasonably determined that those\n\nwere not grounds for imposing a more lenient sentence in this case.\n\nSee Smith, 445 F.3d at 6 - 7 (reversing as unreasonable a sentence\n\nless than half the minimum range where district court had relied\n\nupon   defendant's     age   but    the    defendant       \"although    young,   has\n\naccumulated a significant criminal history\").\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f          II. Career Offender Status\n\n          Appellant further argues that the sentence imposed is\n\nunreasonable because of the unjustified extent of the disparity\n\nbetween the sentences imposed on a defendant designated as a\n\n\"career offender\" and a defendant not so designated.                We have held\n\nthat such disparity results \"from the policy choices made by\n\nCongress and implemented by the Sentencing Commission. See 28\n\nU.S.C. ยง 994(h),\" and that failure to reduce a sentence on that\n\nbasis is not unreasonable. United States v. Caraballo, 447 F.3d 26,\n\n28 (1st Cir. 2006).       Moreover, in this case, the court at re-\n\nsentencing    expressly   \"looked   .     .   .   at   what   the   Defendant's\n\nsentencing range would have been without the career offender\n\nprovision.\"\n\n          Independent of the reasonableness of his sentence, Burks\n\nchallenges his career offender designation on Sixth Amendment\n\ngrounds, objecting that he did not admit to more than one prior\n\nconviction to support his designation as a \"career offender,\" and\n\nthat there had been no finding by a jury that his prior offenses\n\nwere \"crimes of violence.\"     As an initial matter, it appears that\n\nBurks waived this argument.     At the original sentencing hearing,\n\ndefense counsel stated that \"there is not a dispute . . . that this\n\nDefendant was appropriately placed in criminal history category\n\n[VI] because he's a career offender within the meaning of the\n\nguidelines.\"   And the \"Joint Motion for Remand in Light of Booker\"\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fstates   that   \"Burks   does   not   challenge   .   .   .   the    sentencing\n\nguidelines calculations of the district court.\"\n\n           Even if the issue was not waived, however, we have held\n\nthat under Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998),\n\nthe Sixth Amendment does not require the fact and nature of prior\n\nstate convictions to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJimenez-Beltre,    440   F.3d   at    520.   \"Whatever        the    continuing\n\nviability of Almendarez-Torres, we have previously held that we are\n\nbound to follow it until it is expressly overruled.\"                Id.\n\n           III. Crack/Powder Disparity Under Guidelines\n\n           Finally, appellant challenges his sentence on the ground\n\nthat the degree of disparity in the guidelines' treatment of crack\n\nversus powder cocaine is unjustified and creates racial disparity\n\nin sentencing.     He also argues that in his case, the disparity\n\nresulted in a sentence that was longer than necessary to achieve\n\nthe goals of sentencing set forth in ยง 3553(a).                     As with the\n\ndisparity argument regarding the career offender provision, the\n\ncrack-to-powder ratio argument does not demonstrate that Burks'\n\nsentence is unreasonable.         First, this court has held that a\n\nsentencing court is without authority to make \"a categorical,\n\npolicy-based rejection of the 100:1 ratio.\" United States v. Pho,\n\n433 F.3d 53, 62 (1st Cir. 2006).        Second, in arriving at a below-\n\nguidelines sentence, the district court here specifically took into\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\faccount \"what the range would have been had the crack cocaine in\n\nthis case been treated as powder.\"\n\n            Independent of reasonableness, Burks also argues that the\n\ngovernment was required to charge and prove that the substance\n\ninvolved in the charged offense was \"crack.\"              However, Burks\n\nspecifically admitted in his written plea agreement, and confirmed\n\nat the change-of-plea hearing, that \"the substance involved . . .\n\nis cocaine base, also known by the street name of crack cocaine.\"\n\n\"A defendant waives his right to challenge sentencing factors when\n\nhe stipulates to the facts supporting the sentencing factor.\"\n\nUnited States v. Soto-Cruz, 449 F.3d 258, 262 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            None   of   appellant's    arguments   provides   grounds   for\n\nfinding that the sentence imposed following remand was unreasonably\n\nhigh.    The factors that Burks faults the court for not considering\n\nwere either considered by the court or not raised by Burks.2            The\n\ncourt gave a \"reasoned explanation\" for the sentence it imposed,\n\nand the 120-month sentence is \"a plausible outcome.\" Jimenez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d at 519.      The sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       In addition to the arguments mentioned above, Burks argued\nthat a lower sentence was warranted because he had been denied the\nadditional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility on\naccount of a change of counsel. However, the court specifically\ntook that fact into account at re-sentencing.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f",
