Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n               and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Héctor E. Piñeiro with whom Robert H. Beadel was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Stephen G. Cox for appellees.\n\n\n\n                             October 5, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the     Northern     District      of    California,     sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f          SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge.           Plaintiff-appellant\n\nDigna Guerrero (“Guerrero”) appeals the order denying her motion\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative, for a new\n\ntrial, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) and 59.          Because Guerrero\n\nhas not shown that a reasonable jury could not have had a legally\n\nsufficient basis on which to base its verdict, and because any\n\nerrors did not cause prejudice or a “miscarriage of justice,” we\n\naffirm.\n\n          Guerrero    alleges   that    on   June   22,   2000,   defendant-\n\nappellee Officer Daniel Ryan (“Ryan”) and his partner, Officer\n\nThomas Kearny, came to her apartment and confronted her about an\n\nincident involving Guerrero and her downstairs neighbor.           Guerrero\n\nclaims that Ryan repeatedly told her to “shut up” when she tried to\n\nexplain what had happened, grabbed her by the neck and arm, dragged\n\nher downstairs to the neighbor (who was at that time in another\n\nneighbor’s apartment), threatened her, pushed her onto her knees\n\nand demanded that she apologize.\n\n          Ryan’s account of these events is that he and Kearny\n\nasked Guerrero about a complaint from her downstairs neighbor that\n\nGuerrero had taken the neighbor’s grandson’s toys and told the\n\nneighbor to “shut up” numerous times.        Ryan told Guerrero that she\n\nshould not speak to people in this way, and asked her to go\n\ndownstairs   and   apologize.    Guerrero     then   went   downstairs   by\n\nherself, and upon her return told Ryan that she had apologized.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fRyan and Kearny then left.\n\n             On May 27, 2003, Guerrero, acting through her mother,\n\nfiled a complaint in Massachusetts state court alleging that Ryan\n\nand Kearney had violated her rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the\n\nMassachusetts Civil Rights Acts, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12 § 11H, and\n\nthat   the   officers    were   liable   for   intentional     infliction     of\n\nemotional distress. Guerrero also alleged liability on the part of\n\nthe City of Boston.         On July 1, 2003, the City of Boston removed\n\nthe case to federal court, where the claims were bifurcated and the\n\ninstant case proceeded against the two officers. On July 16, 2006,\n\nGuerrero dismissed her claims against Kearney and amended her\n\ncomplaint, making a § 1983 claim only against Ryan, and naming\n\nherself the plaintiff, as she had reached majority.\n\n             Ryan's trial began on July 17, 2006, and included five\n\nwitnesses for Guerrero and seven witnesses for Ryan, as well as\n\nseventy exhibits.       The jury returned a verdict for Ryan after less\n\nthan two hours of deliberation, and judgment was entered on July\n\n25, 2006.     On July 28, 2006, Guerrero filed a \"Motion JNOV, or in\n\nthe Alternative, Motion for New Trial Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n50(b) and 59.\"       After hearing oral argument, the district court\n\ndenied the motion on November 9, 2006.              Guerrero filed a timely\n\nnotice of appeal on December 6, 2006.\n\n             A   district   court’s   denial   of   a   Rule   50   motion   for\n\njudgment as a matter of law will be sustained “unless the evidence,\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\ftogether with all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict,\n\ncould lead a reasonable person to only one conclusion, namely, that\n\nthe moving party was entitled to judgment.”                 PH Group Ltd. v.\n\nBirch, 985 F.2d 649, 653 (1st Cir. 1993) (citation omitted).              Ryan\n\npresented a significant amount of evidence supporting his version\n\nof events, including two eye-witnesses and expert testimony about\n\nGuerrero’s mental state.      Guerrero made no attempt to demonstrate\n\nthat the evidence could only have led a reasonable person to find\n\nfor her, and her appeal cannot succeed on this basis.\n\n           Guerrero also argues that a new trial is merited under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59 because of the admission of testimony that (1)\n\nbriefly mentioned previous lawsuits brought by Guerrero’s mother,\n\nNieves Valenzuela (“Valenzuela”); (2) suggested that Valenzuela had\n\nnot been truthful in the past; and (3) referred to the fact that on\n\none   occasion   the   Massachusetts     Department    of    Social   Services\n\n(“DSS”) took custody of Guerrero for about a month.             In addition,\n\nGuerrero claims that the court below erred in allowing Ryan's\n\nattorney, during closing arguments, to refer to the potential for\n\nRyan to lose his job.\n\n           The   trial   judge   never    made   a   definitive    ruling   on\n\nGuerrero’s motion in limine to exclude some of the challenged\n\ntestimony, opting to take a “wait and see” approach.              Where there\n\nhas only been a provisional ruling on a motion in limine, a party\n\nmust renew its motion to exclude evidence at trial, or review will\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fbe for plain error.          Crowe v. Bolduc, 334 F.3d 124, 133 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   Guerrero points to two objections at trial, one for lack of\n\nfoundation, and one based on the purportedly argumentative nature\n\nof a piece of testimony.           None of the challenges to the testimony\n\nin   question      here   are    based    on     these    grounds,      and    the   trial\n\ntranscript      shows     that    Guerrero       failed    to    make    the    required\n\ncontemporaneous objections.              We therefore review for plain error.\n\nUnder plain error review, this court “consider[s] a forfeited\n\nobjection only if: (1) an error was committed; (2) the error was\n\n‘plain’ (i.e. obvious and clear under current law); (3) the error\n\nwas prejudicial (i.e. affected substantial rights); and (4) review\n\nis needed to prevent a miscarriage of justice.”                         Smith v. Kmart\n\nCorp., 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n              We do not decide whether admission of the testimony\n\nchallenged by Guerrero constitutes error, or whether any error is\n\nplain    or    prejudicial,        because       Guerrero       cannot    satisfy      the\n\n“miscarriage of justice” requirement.                The jury considered a great\n\ndeal of contradictory evidence from both sides, and evidence of\n\nValenzuela’s        purported      litigiousness          or    untruthfulness,        or\n\nGuerrero’s encounter with DSS, cannot be said to have “resulted in\n\na miscarriage of justice or seriously affected the fairness,\n\nintegrity     or    public      reputation     of   the    judicial      proceedings.”\n\nSmith, 177 F.3d at 28 (internal quotation and citation omitted).\n\nIt is difficult to see how the admission of testimony that briefly\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\freferred to Guerrero’s mother in an unflattering light could have\n\nhad   such   a   large    effect   on   a     trial   whose    essence    was   the\n\ncredibility of the plaintiff, defendant, and witnesses.\n\n             Guerrero’s    final   argument      is   that    defense    counsel’s\n\nclosing argument was improper because counsel posed the rhetorical\n\nquestion, “Why would [Ryan] risk everything, his job, his career,\n\nhis pension...?” Guerrero did not make a contemporaneous objection\n\nto this remark, and review is once again for plain error.                  Smith,\n\n177 F.3d at 25.      It is highly improbable that this stray remark\n\nover the course of counsel’s lengthy summation affected the jury’s\n\nverdict, and its admission can hardly be said to constitute a\n\n“miscarriage of justice” in the context of the competing stories\n\nthe jury considered.\n\n\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f",
