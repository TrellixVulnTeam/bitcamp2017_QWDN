Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Michael Cote, et. al., pro se, on memorandum.\n     Brian P.

Plaintiffs/appellants are four individuals\n\nwho have been adjudicated to be “sexually dangerous persons” and\n\ncivilly committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center under Mass.\n\nG.L. ch. 123A, §§ 1-16.          In this pro se action brought pursuant to\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983, they challenge the Center’s policy of “double-\n\nbunking” its residents, claiming that such a practice violates the\n\nFourteenth Amendment and the Center’s management plan. Upon motion\n\nfrom   defendants,        the    district          court     dismissed           the       amended\n\ncomplaint, inter alia, for failure to state a claim.                               Plaintiffs\n\nhave   timely    appealed       but    have    chosen        not   to   file           a    brief,\n\npreferring instead to rely on their submissions below.                                 We affirm\n\nessentially for the reasons enumerated by the district court,\n\nadding only the following.\n\n             It is undisputed that due process provides the governing\n\nstandards in this context.              See, e.g., Seling v. Young, 531 U.S.\n\n250,   265   (2001).       The    “dispositive             inquiry”     is       whether       the\n\nchallenged      restrictions       constitute         “punishment.”                Block        v.\n\nRutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 583 (1984).                         To pass muster, “the\n\nconditions    and   duration       of    confinement          [must].        .    .bear       some\n\nreasonable    relation      to    the    purpose[s]          for   which         persons       are\n\ncommitted,” Seling, 531 U.S. at 265–-which here include not only\n\ntreatment and rehabilitation but public safety, see, e.g., Kansas\n\nv.   Hendricks,     521    U.S.       346,    363    (1997).          Among        the       other\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fprotections afforded by due process is the right to “reasonable\n\nsafety.”   Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324 (1982).\n\n           Double-bunking is not a per se violation of due process,\n\nsee Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 541-43 (1979), but in rare cases\n\nmight amount to an unlawful practice when combined with other\n\nadverse conditions, see, e.g., id. at 542; Inmates of Suffolk\n\nCounty Jail v. Rufo, 12 F.3d 286, 293-94 (1st Cir. 1993); cf. Nami\n\nv. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 65-68 (3d Cir. 1996) (holding that such a\n\nchallenge stated Eighth Amendment claim).    Yet this is not such a\n\ncase. The district court properly found an absence of “any factual\n\nallegation that demonstrates that double-bunking has [caused] or\n\nwill cause these plaintiffs any sort of constitutionally-cognizable\n\ninjury.”   Based on the amended complaint alone, that conclusion is\n\ninescapably true; plaintiffs there simply asserted that they were\n\nbeing put “in harm[‘]s way.”       And it remains true even if (in\n\nrecognition of plaintiffs’ pro se status) one considers the factual\n\nallegations contained in all of their filings below.     We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n           In charging that double-bunking amounts to punishment,\n\nplaintiffs mainly argue that the practice increases the risk of\n\nsexual assaults and other violence.       They maintain that “room\n\nvisits” among residents were restricted in 1996 and then prohibited\n\nin 2003 largely for this reason.    They also allege that defendants\n\nhave failed to evaluate potential roommates for compatibility, as\n\n\n                                -3-\n\frequired    by   the    Center’s    management    plan.      What    is   missing,\n\nhowever, is any suggestion that plaintiffs themselves are in danger\n\nof being harmed.        Indeed, they offer brief descriptions of their\n\nown residential arrangements which are entirely devoid of such\n\nconcerns.     “While a pro se complaint is held to less stringent\n\nstandards than one drafted by an attorney. . ., courts need not\n\nconjure     up    unpleaded        facts     to   support.     .     .conclusory\n\n[allegations].” Hurney v. Carver, 602 F.2d 993, 995 (1st Cir. 1979)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original).\n\n            On   this    record,    plaintiffs’      due   process   claim      thus\n\neffectively      reduces   to   a   charge    that    double-bunking       of   sex\n\noffenders is a per se constitutional violation.               That proposition\n\nis without merit.        See, e.g., Allison v. Snyder, 332 F.3d 1076,\n\n1079 (7th Cir.) (holding that, in light of Wolfish, “[d]etails such\n\nas double celling add nothing” to due process claim brought by\n\ncivilly-committed sexually dangerous persons in Illinois), cert.\n\ndenied, 540 U.S. 985 (2003).\n\n            Plaintiffs also object that as pro se litigants they\n\nshould have been notified of any pleading deficiencies and given a\n\nchance to amend their complaint accordingly.                  Yet defendants’\n\nmemorandum provided ample notice, asserting that “plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to allege that they have suffered any injury as a result of\n\nbeing double bunked.”       And at no time since–-either in opposition\n\nto that memorandum, in response to the district court’s decision,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\for on appeal-–have plaintiffs proffered any new factual allegations\n\nin an attempt to address this shortcoming.   We also note that the\n\ncomplaint was not dismissed sua sponte pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1915(e)(2), as plaintiffs suggest, but rather under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
