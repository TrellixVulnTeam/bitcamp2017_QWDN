We add that it appears\n\nSolomon has forfeited his civil RICO and invasion of privacy claims\n\nby failing to provide any developed argument in support of those\n\nclaims in his appellate brief.   We find no abuse of discretion in\n\nthe district court's refusal to allow Solomon's late-filed motion\n\nto amend, see Maine State Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council v.
