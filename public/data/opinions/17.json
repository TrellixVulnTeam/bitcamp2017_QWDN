On the scheduled trial date, which had been\n\nset only six days earlier, the district court, acting sua sponte,\n\ndismissed this case with prejudice \"for lack of prosecution based\n\non   the   plaintiffs'    non-compliance   with     discovery    deadlines,\"\n\nparticularly their failure to produce a medical expert report.\n\nWithout condoning the plaintiffs' lengthy and unjustified delay in\n\nproducing their expert's report, we reluctantly vacate the dismissal\n\nbecause, in short, the absence of a clearly communicated deadline\n\nfor providing expert reports or notice that failing to do so more\n\npromptly could result in dismissal rendered that drastic sanction\n\nan abuse of discretion.      We explain.\n\n            We   review   dismissals   under    Rule   41(b)   for   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.      Malot v. Dorado Beach Cottage Assocs., 478 F.3d 40, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).      Although \"[c]laims that a court has abused its\n\ndiscretion in dismissing a case for failure to adhere to discovery\n\norders or for failure to prosecute have 'not received a sympathetic\n\near,'\" id. (quoting Damiani v. R.I. Hosp., 704 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1983)), we \"must fairly balance the court's venerable authority over\n\ncase management with the larger concerns of justice, including the\n\nstrong presumption in favor of deciding cases on the merits,\" id.,\n\nand \"procedural aspects such as notice,\" Benitez-Garcia v. Gonzalez-\n\nVega, 468 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2006).           This is the rare case where\n\nthe latter concerns outweigh the former.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          The    plaintiffs'   three-year   delay   in   producing   their\n\nexpert's report was sufficiently \"extreme\" to warrant the harsh\n\nsanction of dismissal,1 see Malot, 478 F.3d at 44 (describing this\n\ncourt's tendency \"to reserve dismissal with prejudice for delays\n\nmeasured in years\"); and they offered no legitimate excuse for that\n\nlengthy delay,2 see Benitez-Garcia, 468 F.3d at 5.         Nevertheless,\n\nother relevant factors weigh heavily against imposing that drastic\n\nsanction here.\n\n          First of all, without condoning the lethargic pace that\n\nthis litigation took, the responsibility for that pace was shared,\n\nin large part, by the district court,3 which failed to exercise its\n\n     1\n      Although the district court also premised its dismissal\norder, more generally, on the plaintiffs' \"non-compliance with\ndiscovery orders,\" it identified no such orders and none are\npointed out by the appellees or apparent in the record. Cf. Ortiz-\nLopez v. Sociedad Espanola De Auxilio Mutuo y Beneficiencia, 248\nF.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir. 2001) (affirming dismissal with prejudice\nwhere district court made \"explicit and lengthy findings of\negregious discovery abuses\"). The plaintiffs did delay in filing\ntheir second amended complaint, but their failure to do so more\npromptly was related to their delay in obtaining expert advice, not\nto any other discovery violations.\n     2\n      Other than the absence of a deadline, the plaintiffs' only\nexcuse was that their original expert took longer than expected to\nproduce his report and they were therefore forced to retain a new\none. But the plaintiffs apparently gave their original expert no\ndeadline for producing his report and were not aggressive in\nseeking it more promptly.    And even after they retained a new\nexpert, another year went by without production of an expert\nreport.\n     3\n      As in Ortiz-Anglada v. Ortiz-Perez, 183 F.3d 65, 67 n.4 (1st\nCir. 1999), and Malot, 478 F.3d at 45, the defendants here also\nshare this responsibility. One of the defendants failed to answer\nthe first amended complaint until more than two months after the\nalready extended deadline without seeking a further extension;\n\n                                  -3-\n\f\"abiding responsibility\" under federal and local rules to \"take an\n\nactive role in case management,\" Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of\n\nWestfield, 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir. 2002), by \"issu[ing] orders 'as\n\nsoon   as   practicable'   fixing    deadlines   for    the    completion   of\n\ndiscovery\" and other pretrial events.         Torres v. Puerto Rico, 485\n\nF.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)); see also\n\nOrtiz-Anglada,    183   F.3d   at   66-67   (vacating   a     dismissal   with\n\nprejudice where the district court failed to impose deadlines\n\nthrough a scheduling order).        Contrary to federal Rule 16(b), the\n\ndistrict court never issued an initial scheduling order; and,\n\ncontrary to the corresponding local rule, it never scheduled or held\n\na pretrial conference and did not set a trial date until six days\n\nbefore trial.     Although the court did set a deadline for the\n\nplaintiffs' production of their expert's report, once that deadline\n\nexpired without compliance, the court never set a new one even after\n\nthe defendants eventually asked the court to do so.\n\n            The court further contributed to delay by taking months\n\nto rule on the parties' motions, which, if promptly decided, would\n\nhave moved the case along more expeditiously.               For example, the\n\n\n\nanother defendant never answered the first amended complaint at\nall; and the principal defendant had not filed an answer to the\nsecond amended complaint, or sought more time to do so, by the time\nthe case was dismissed in March 2009, five months after that\ncomplaint had been filed.    Nor did the defendants bring to the\ncourt's attention the plaintiffs' failure to produce their expert\nreport by the original deadline of January 30, 2007, or ask the\ncourt to impose another deadline until November 26, 2008, almost\ntwo years later.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fcourt never ruled on the plaintiffs' April 2007 request for more\n\ntime to finalize their expert's report; took six months to rule on\n\nthe defendants' motion for a more definite statement; took seven\n\nmonths to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss; and never ruled\n\non the defendants' November 2008 motion to set a deadline for the\n\nplaintiffs to produce their expert's report.\n\n            The court's failure to set deadlines not only contributed\n\nto the case's slow pace but also rendered its ultimate dismissal\n\norder unfair in two respects.          First, there was no \"clearly\n\ncommunicated\" deadline for producing the plaintiffs' expert report.\n\nSee Velázquez Linares v. United States, 546 F.3d 710, 711-12 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (acknowledging \"'litigants' unflagging duty to comply\n\nwith clearly communicated case-management orders'\" (quoting Rosario-\n\nDíaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998)) but vacating\n\ndismissal order based on \"uncertainty\" of the missed deadline). Once\n\nthe original deadline passed and the court failed to set a new\n\ndeadline at both sides' requests, the only operative deadline was\n\nthe default deadline contained in Rule 26(a)(2)(C)(i), under which\n\nthe plaintiffs' expert report was due \"at least 90 days before the\n\ndate set for trial or for the case to be ready for trial.\"       But\n\nsince no trial date was set until six days before trial, it was\n\nimpossible for the plaintiffs to comply with that 90-day deadline.\n\nNor did the plaintiffs have any other way of knowing that trial was\n\nimminent.    Despite the relatively long time that had passed since\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe filing of the original complaint, the principal defendant had\n\nnot yet answered the second amended complaint.             Nor had pretrial\n\nmemoranda been filed or a pretrial conference scheduled or held.\n\n            Second, the plaintiffs were given no express notice of the\n\nconsequences    of    failure   to   produce    their   expert   report      more\n\npromptly.   Although the court included boilerplate language in two\n\norders   stating     that   \"[f]ailure   to    comply   will   result   in    the\n\nimposition of severe sanctions and/or dismissal of the complaint\n\nwith prejudice for lack of prosecution pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n41(b),\" neither of those orders set a deadline for the production\n\nof the plaintiffs' expert report.4            Therefore, those warnings did\n\nnot give the plaintiffs \"realistic notice\" that they faced the harsh\n\nsanction of dismissal with prejudice for failure to produce their\n\nexpert report before February 17, 2009, the date when the dismissal\n\norder issued.        Malot, 478 F.3d at 45 (so concluding in similar\n\ncircumstances).       Although prior notice of the consequences is not\n\nalways required, Pomales v. Celulares Telefónica, Inc., 342 F.3d 44,\n\n50 n.5 (1st Cir. 2003), \"in the absence of such a warning, the\n\npropriety of dismissal 'turns to a considerable extent, on the\n\nknowledge which the circumstances show such party may be taken to\n\nhave of the consequences of his own conduct.'\"             Id. (quoting Link\n\nv. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 632 (1962)).           As discussed above,\n\n     4\n      Rather, one of them set a deadline for complying with an\norder to show cause, which the plaintiffs did on time; and the\nother set a deadline for filing the second amended complaint, which\nthe plaintiffs did, albeit one day after the extended deadline.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fgiven the lack of notice of the imminence of trial, the plaintiffs\n\ncannot reasonably be deemed to have had notice that their delay in\n\nproducing their expert's report would lead to dismissal.\n\n          A further consideration weighing against the propriety of\n\ndismissal with prejudice is the absence of evidence--or even any\n\ncontention--that the   defendants were prejudiced by the delay.\n\nBenitez-Garcia, 468 F.3d at 5.   Given that the principal defendant\n\nhad not yet answered the second amended complaint and that no\n\npretrial memoranda had been filed or pretrial conference conducted,\n\nit is doubtful that the defendants (or the court) were any more\n\nready for trial than the plaintiffs or that, even if the plaintiffs\n\nhad produced their expert report more promptly, the trial would have\n\ngone forward on the precipitously announced date.\n\n          A final relevant factor is the absence of evidence that\n\nthe district court considered the adequacy of lesser sanctions, id.\n\nat 6, such as continuing the trial to a date certain and imposing\n\nmonetary sanctions to compensate the defendants for any harm caused\n\nby the continuance, Esposito v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 590 F.3d\n\n72, 80 (1st Cir. 2009), and then setting short deadlines for\n\nproduction of the expert's report and any other remaining pretrial\n\nevents and strictly enforcing them, Velázquez Linares, 546 F.3d at\n\n711-12.\n\n          In   sum, although the district court was justifiably\n\nunhappy with the plaintiffs' lengthy and unjustified delay in\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fproducing their expert's report, the court's failure to set a clear\n\ndeadline for doing so, to warn the plaintiffs of the consequences\n\nof noncompliance with that deadline, to make findings concerning the\n\nnature   of   the   plaintiffs'   conduct   and   the   prejudice   to   the\n\ndefendants, and to consider the adequacy of lesser sanctions renders\n\nthe sanction of dismissal with prejudice an abuse of its broad\n\ndiscretion to manage its caseload.          Accordingly, we vacate the\n\ndismissal and remand for further proceedings. Each party shall bear\n\nits own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

Gonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197880\"><a href=\"/opinion/197880/rosario-diaz-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 315 (1st Cir. 1998)) but vacating\n\ndismissal order based on \"uncertainty\" of the missed deadline). Once\n\nthe original deadline passed and the court failed to set a new\n\ndeadline at both sides' requests, the only operative deadline was\n\nthe default deadline contained in Rule 26(a)(2)(C)(i), under which\n\nthe plaintiffs' expert report was due \"at least 90 days before the\n\ndate set for trial or for the case to be ready for trial.\"       But\n\nsince no trial date was set until six days before trial, it was\n\nimpossible for the plaintiffs to comply with that 90-day deadline.\n\nNor did the plaintiffs have any other way of knowing that trial was\n\nimminent.    Despite the relatively long time that had passed since\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe filing of the original complaint, the principal defendant had\n\nnot yet answered the second amended complaint.             Nor had pretrial\n\nmemoranda been filed or a pretrial conference scheduled or held.\n\n            Second, the plaintiffs were given no express notice of the\n\nconsequences    of    failure   to   produce    their   expert   report      more\n\npromptly.   Although the court included boilerplate language in two\n\norders   stating     that   \"[f]ailure   to    comply   will   result   in    the\n\nimposition of severe sanctions and/or dismissal of the complaint\n\nwith prejudice for lack of prosecution pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n41(b),\" neither of those orders set a deadline for the production\n\nof the plaintiffs' expert report.4            Therefore, those warnings did\n\nnot give the plaintiffs \"realistic notice\" that they faced the harsh\n\nsanction of dismissal with prejudice for failure to produce their\n\nexpert report before February 17, 2009, the date when the dismissal\n\norder issued.        Malot, 478 F.3d at 45 (so concluding in similar\n\ncircumstances).       Although prior notice of the consequences is not\n\nalways required, Pomales v. Celulares Telefónica, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200617\"><a href=\"/opinion/200617/pomales-v-celulares/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n50 n.5 (1st Cir. 2003), \"in the absence of such a warning, the\n\npropriety of dismissal 'turns to a considerable extent, on the\n\nknowledge which the circumstances show such party may be taken to\n\nhave of the consequences of his own conduct.'\"             Id.

As discussed above,\n\n     4\n      Rather, one of them set a deadline for complying with an\norder to show cause, which the plaintiffs did on time; and the\nother set a deadline for filing the second amended complaint, which\nthe plaintiffs did, albeit one day after the extended deadline.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fgiven the lack of notice of the imminence of trial, the plaintiffs\n\ncannot reasonably be deemed to have had notice that their delay in\n\nproducing their expert's report would lead to dismissal.\n\n          A further consideration weighing against the propriety of\n\ndismissal with prejudice is the absence of evidence--or even any\n\ncontention--that the   defendants were prejudiced by the delay.\n\nBenitez-Garcia, 468 F.3d at 5.   Given that the principal defendant\n\nhad not yet answered the second amended complaint and that no\n\npretrial memoranda had been filed or pretrial conference conducted,\n\nit is doubtful that the defendants (or the court) were any more\n\nready for trial than the plaintiffs or that, even if the plaintiffs\n\nhad produced their expert report more promptly, the trial would have\n\ngone forward on the precipitously announced date.\n\n          A final relevant factor is the absence of evidence that\n\nthe district court considered the adequacy of lesser sanctions, id.\n\nat 6, such as continuing the trial to a date certain and imposing\n\nmonetary sanctions to compensate the defendants for any harm caused\n\nby the continuance, Esposito v.

Accordingly, we vacate the\n\ndismissal and remand for further proceedings. Each party shall bear\n\nits own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f</pre>",
