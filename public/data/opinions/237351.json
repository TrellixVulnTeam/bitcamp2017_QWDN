Upon the filing of a motion for summary judgment by the Board and its members, the court on November 9, 1954, entered its order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In No. 12,497, the Butler Savings and Trust Company, and the Workingmen's Building and Loan Association, of Butler, Pennsylvania, filed a similar suit against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its individual members, asking that the court declare illegal and enjoin the action of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in authorizing the Friendship Federal Savings and Loan Association of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to establish a branch office in Butler, Pennsylvania, and asking the court to declare that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board must rehear and determine the case in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1001 et seq. Upon the filing of cross motions for summary judgment, the court on October 15, 1954, denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, granted defendant's motion, and dismissed the amended complaint (reconsideration denied November 1, 1954).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In both cases the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its individual members were personally served, but the First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Homestead (a codefendant in No. 12,491) was served out of the District of Columbia, being served in Homestead, Pennsylvania, its home office. A motion to quash the substituted service on the First Federal of Homestead was granted by the District Court and forms the basis of the appeal in No. 12,460.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Appeals No. 12,491 and No. 12,497</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the cases of North Arlington Nat. Bank v. Kearny Fed. Sav. &amp; L. Ass'n, 3 Cir., 1951, 187 F.2d 564, certiorari denied, 1951, 342 U.S. 816, 72 S. Ct. 30, 96 L.Ed. 617, and Springfield Institution for Savings v. Worcester Fed. Sav. &amp; L. Ass'n, 329 Mass. 184, 107 N.E. 2d 315, certiorari denied, 1952, 344 U.S. 884, 73 S.Ct. 184, 97 L.Ed. 684, it was held that the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as amended,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> authorizes the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to permit federal associations, regularly organized, to establish branch offices. These cases make it clear that such authority does exist, and we follow the reasoning and conclusions of these cases on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We then reach the question as to whether the Administrative Procedure Act applies to proceedings directed to the approval of the establishment of such branches. Serious doubt arises as to whether any of the plaintiffs in the instant cases (other than the Workingmen's Building and Loan Association, one of the plaintiffs in No. 12,497) is covered within the definition of properly conducted existing \"local thrift and home-financing institutions\" (see Sec. 5(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as amended, <i>infra</i>), as such institutions are usually mutual savings banks and building and loan associations rather than national banks and trust companies. However, we will assume that plaintiffs may be considered \"local thrift and home-financing institutions\", as we consider the point raised now for the first time in connection with branch offices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulations adopted by the Board provide for the establishment of branch offices. Over two hundred branches had been authorized at the time of the disposition of these cases in the District Court. It will be noted from the controlling regulation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> that the applicant for a branch office must state the need for the branch, the functions to be performed, the personnel and office facilities to be provided, and the estimated annual volume of business, income and expenses of such branch office. There is also a requirement that the application be accompanied by a proposed annual budget of such association. Nothing is said about protection from \"undue injury to * * * local thrift and homefinancing institutions\", as is the case in an original grant. It seems reasonable, once a federal association is established under the grant of an original charter and able to make loans within a fifty-mile radius of the home office, that the question of the establishment of branches should be committed to agency discretion. Section 5(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as amended, provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>\"No charter</i> shall be granted except to persons of good character and responsibility, nor unless in the judgment of the Board a necessity exists for such an institution in the community to be served, nor unless there is a reasonable probability of its usefulness and success, nor unless the same can be established without undue injury to properly conducted existing local thrift and home-financing institutions.\" (Italics supplied.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While neither Section 5(e) nor any other section of the act specifically requires an agency hearing in granting an original charter, we may assume for the purposes of these cases that such a hearing is required in that instance. Even so, the same formalities are not required in the consideration of an application for a branch. Section 5(e) quoted above refers simply to \"charters,\" and governs the Board's consideration of an application for the grant of a charter to establish an \"institution.\" A branch, however, is not an \"institution\" and does not require a charter, its establishment being of an entirely different character.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1004, requires that \"(i)n every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing\" (except in six listed circumstances not here applicable), an agency shall observe certain procedures specified in subsequent sections of that act. Neither the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as amended, nor the regulations thereunder, contains any provision that an application for a branch must be \"determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants urge that Section 5(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act gives them protection from \"undue injury\" in the establishment of a branch, and contend that, even though that act does not specifically provide for a determination on the record, they are entitled, as a matter of constitutional due process, to the adjudication and procedural provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, citing in support Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 70 S.Ct. 445, 94 L.Ed. 616; Riss &amp; Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 907, 71 S.Ct. 620, 95 L.Ed. 1345; Cates v. Haderlein, 342 U.S. 804, 72 S.Ct. 47, 96 L.Ed. 609; United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, 344 U.S. 33, 73 S.Ct. 67, 97 L.Ed. 54. None of these cases has application here. We think it clear that, even if it be assumed that Section 5(e) requires an agency hearing on the original grant, there is no such requirement on an application for the establishment of a branch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have said disposes of these cases and we, therefore, are not bound to consider the question of appellants' standing. We merely call attention to the fact that, since authority to permit establishment of a branch is clearly committed to agency discretion, the matter is disposed of automatically by Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1009.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As we said in Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Neither the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as amended, nor the regulations thereunder, contains any provision that an application for a branch must be \"determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants urge that Section 5(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act gives them protection from \"undue injury\" in the establishment of a branch, and contend that, even though that act does not specifically provide for a determination on the record, they are entitled, as a matter of constitutional due process, to the adjudication and procedural provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, citing in support Wong Yang Sung v.

None of these cases has application here. We think it clear that, even if it be assumed that Section 5(e) requires an agency hearing on the original grant, there is no such requirement on an application for the establishment of a branch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have said disposes of these cases and we, therefore, are not bound to consider the question of appellants' standing. We merely call attention to the fact that, since authority to permit establishment of a branch is clearly committed to agency discretion, the matter is disposed of automatically by Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1009.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As we said in Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. v.
