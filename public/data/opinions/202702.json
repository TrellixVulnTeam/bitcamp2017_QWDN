Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella, and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Frank L. Bruno, for appellant.\n     Terry L. Ollila, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas P.

Defendant-appellant Keith\n\nMateras appeals the district court's denial of his motions to\n\nsuppress evidence seized and statements made during the search that\n\nled to his arrest for possession with intent to distribute ecstasy\n\nand methamphetamine. We agree with the district court that Materas\n\nwas not entitled to a Franks hearing1 on the suppression of the\n\nevidence, and that Materas was not entitled to suppression of\n\nstatements made after he waived his Miranda rights.\n\n                           I. Background\n\n           A. The Search Warrant\n\n           On October 14, 2004, Detective Frank Bourgeois of the\n\nNashua Police Department applied for a no-knock search warrant for\n\n374 Thornton Street, Manchester, New Hampshire, which he alleged\n\nwas Materas's residence.   In his supporting affidavit, Detective\n\nBourgeois relied on the following events as a basis for the\n\nwarrant.\n\n           In January 2004, a man complained to the Manchester\n\nPolice Department that his boyfriend was being held against his\n\nwill by Materas and Peter Deprisco at 374 Thornton Street.        He\n\nexpressed his belief that Materas and Deprisco were supplying large\n\n\n\n\n1\n    A defendant who believes that the police included false\nstatements or material omissions in an affidavit underlying a\nsearch warrant may request an evidentiary hearing pursuant to\nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978).\n\n                                   -2-\n\famounts of methamphetamine to dealers in Manchester, and eventually\n\nadmitted that he had bought drugs from them in the past.\n\n           Six months later, another man told the Manchester Police\n\nDepartment that he had been held against his will at 454 Hanover\n\nStreet in Manchester.          He claimed that he had smoked what he\n\nbelieved to be methamphetamine with several people, including one\n\nnamed   Keith.     The   police      responded    to    the   same    address   and\n\nidentified \"Keith\" as Keith Materas.\n\n           In    September     2004,    the   Manchester      Police    Department\n\nresponded to a domestic dispute at 374 Thornton Street, where\n\nMateras   and    Deprisco    identified       themselves      as   co-owners    and\n\nresidents of that address.\n\n           During the same month, the New Hampshire Drug Task Force,\n\nof which Detective Bourgeois was a member, received information\n\nthat an individual named Keith, a homosexual man who lived in\n\nManchester, was the largest supplier of methamphetamine in the\n\nstate. In an unrelated incident, the Nashua Police Department also\n\nlearned from a cooperating individual in its custody that two men\n\nnamed   Keith    and   Peter    of     454    Hanover    Street      were   selling\n\nmethamphetamine.\n\n           On October 12, 2004, Detective Bourgeois arranged a\n\ncontrolled purchase of a small amount of methamphetamine by a\n\nconfidential informant at 374 Thornton Street.                     The informant\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fentered the residence and returned with methamphetamine, which he\n\nclaimed to have bought inside from Materas.\n\n           B. The Search\n\n           After the Manchester District Court issued the no-knock\n\nwarrant on October 14, 2005, the police executed the warrant the\n\nsame day, led by Detective Bourgeois.            Ten to fifteen officers\n\nentered the residence with guns drawn2 and proceeded directly\n\ntoward the basement, where they believed Materas and Deprisco were\n\nresiding   while   the   upper   floors   of   the   residence   were   under\n\nconstruction.      In fact, Materas did not reside at 374 Thornton\n\nStreet; he had been living at 454 Hanover Street for more than\n\nthree months prior to the application for the search warrant.\n\nNonetheless, the officers found Materas and Deprisco standing in\n\nthe hall, where they were apprehended and handcuffed.               Materas\n\nmaintains that he was under the influence of methamphetamine at the\n\ntime of entry.\n\n           Detective Bourgeois proceeded into the basement, where he\n\nfound Materas's dog.     Materas claims that the detective threatened\n\nto shoot the dog if he did not keep him under control.            Detective\n\nBourgeois denied making such a threat, testifying that he put the\n\ndog in a closet in order to allow the officers to search the room.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   Detective Bourgeois's affidavit included information from a\nconfidential informant that Deprisco possessed a firearm.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f              The officers then moved the two men into the basement,\n\nwhere Deprisco became uncooperative.                After Deprisco was removed\n\nfrom the room, and while approximately six other officers searched\n\nthe   room,     Detective       Bourgeois    told    Materas,     who     was    still\n\nhandcuffed, that if he would tell them where the drugs were, it\n\nwould save them from having to tear the place apart.                       Detective\n\nBourgeois testified at trial that his intent was to make the\n\nprocess easier for everyone, given the clutter in the room and his\n\nbelief that the drugs were there.              Materas then indicated that the\n\ndrugs   were    located     in   a   clear   plastic      case   behind    Detective\n\nBourgeois.\n\n              At some point, Detective Bourgeois searched Materas, and\n\nin the process asked him to undo his pants.                  Because he was not\n\nwearing underwear, his genitals were exposed for a brief period.\n\n              After the drugs were found, Materas was removed upstairs\n\nto the kitchen area, where he was read his Miranda rights and\n\nquestioned further. Detective Bourgeois testified that Materas did\n\nnot exhibit signs of being under the influence of any substance,\n\nalthough      Materas     did     tell   the     detective       that     he    was   a\n\nmethamphetamine addict, using one to two grams a day.                   No guns were\n\ndrawn during Materas's interrogation.\n\n              Materas     was    cooperative        and   answered      Bourgeois's\n\nquestions, as well as those of a DEA agent also present.                       Materas\n\nstated that he received just under a pound of methamphetamine every\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fsix to eight weeks, which he used and distributed to friends.            He\n\nadmitted that most of the drugs found in the search were his.           Some\n\nof the drugs, however, he attributed to Deprisco, with whom he had\n\nlived at the 374 Thornton Street residence for twelve years.             He\n\nindicated that he and Deprisco had broken up, but were recently\n\nreunited.\n\n            Materas   was    then   moved    to   the   Manchester    Police\n\nDepartment. There, Detective Bourgeois read him his Miranda rights\n\nagain, and asked Materas to sign a form waiving his rights, which\n\nhe did.     Later, Detective Bourgeois relayed a message to Materas\n\nthat his attorney had called and was trying to reach him.            Materas\n\nvoluntarily signed another form waiving his rights and indicated\n\nthat he wanted to continue to cooperate. During his questioning at\n\nthe police station, Materas reiterated the statements he had\n\npreviously made after waiving his Miranda rights at the residence.\n\n            C. Proceedings\n\n            On March 23, 2005, a federal grand jury returned a three-\n\ncount indictment against Materas.           Count 1 charged Materas with\n\ndistribution of methamphetamine, and Counts 2 and 3 charged him\n\nwith possession with intent to distribute ecstasy and five or more\n\ngrams of methamphetamine, respectively, all in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1).\n\n            On July 18, 2005, Materas filed a motion to suppress the\n\nstatements he made during the search.         He asserted that he should\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fhave been read his Miranda rights before being questioned on the\n\nlocation of the drugs and that he was interrogated under coercive\n\ncircumstances while the police knew that he was under the influence\n\nof methamphetamine.    Materas also filed a separate motion to\n\nsuppress the evidence seized as a result of the search.   He argued\n\nthat the search was invalid because Detective Bourgeois failed to\n\nprovide proof of his informant's credibility, which was undermined\n\nby the informant's failure to tell the police that Materas did not\n\nreside at 374 Thornton Street.\n\n          On August 19, 2005, the district court heard and denied\n\nboth motions.    The court ruled that the circumstances of the\n\ncontrolled buy at 374 Thornton Street constituted adequate probable\n\ncause to justify the search, whether or not the warrant contained\n\nother material omissions or false statements.   The judge clarified\n\nat the defense's request that Materas was not entitled to a Franks\n\nhearing because even if he could prove everything that he claimed,\n\nit still would not be enough to support suppression.\n\n          With respect to Materas's statements subsequent to being\n\nread his Miranda rights, the court specifically determined that\n\nthere was nothing \"unusually coercive about the circumstances\"\n\nsurrounding Materas's waiver of his Miranda rights.        It also\n\nconcluded that Detective Bourgeois had acted \"entirely in good\n\nfaith\" and that his initial question about the location of the\n\ndrugs was not intended to undermine Materas's rights.     The court\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fwent on to note that Materas's intitial statement concerning the\n\nlocation of the drugs would be suppressed and that the government\n\nhad no intention of using the statement in its principal case.\n\nFinally, the court deferred the determination of whether the\n\nstatement could be used for impeachment purposes.\n\n            Following the denial of his motions to suppress, Materas\n\nchanged his plea to guilty on the two counts of possession,\n\nreserving his right to appeal the court's suppression rulings.       On\n\nMay 24, 2006, the court dismissed Count 1 and sentenced Materas to\n\nseventy months imprisonment on each of Counts 2 and 3, to be served\n\nconcurrently.\n\n                           II. Discussion\n\n            On appeal, Materas argues that the district court erred\n\nin imposing too high a burden for his preliminary showing that he\n\nwas entitled to a Franks hearing.         He further argues that the\n\npolice coerced him into making his initial statement indicating\n\nwhere the drugs were located, and that suppression of only that\n\ninitial statement, rather than all statements made to the police\n\nthereafter, is an inadequate remedy for the violation of his\n\nconstitutional   rights.    After    carefully   considering   Materas's\n\narguments, we affirm the district court's denial of his motions to\n\nsuppress.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f            A. Franks Hearing\n\n            We review the denial of a Franks hearing for clear error.\n\nUnited States v. Nelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d 12, 34 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nUnder Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978), a defendant\n\nmay request an evidentiary hearing to challenge police misconduct\n\nin drafting an affidavit in support of a search warrant.                 The\n\ndefendant \"must make a 'substantial preliminary showing' that the\n\naffidavit   included   a   false   statement    which   was   made   either\n\nknowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the\n\ntruth, and that this misstatement was necessary to the finding of\n\nprobable cause.\" Nelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d at 34 (quoting Franks,\n\n438 U.S. at 155-56).\n\n            Materas first challenges the constitutionality of the\n\nstandard set forth in Franks.         He cursorily argues that this\n\n\"overly   burdensome   requirement\"      essentially    demands   that   the\n\ndefendant prove his case before having an opportunity to obtain the\n\ntestimony necessary to prove his case.         We do not find the Franks\n\nstandard particularly burdensome, and we note that the Supreme\n\nCourt would not have announced an unconstitutional standard for\n\nchallenging an affidavit in support of a search warrant when it\n\ndecided the Fourth Amendment issue in Franks.\n\n            Materas then asserts that he made a sufficient showing to\n\nafford him a full Franks hearing.        He argues that the police knew\n\nthat he did not live at the address for which the search warrant\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fwas issued, and that they purposefully misled the magistrate into\n\nissuing the warrant based on a non-existent nexus between the drugs\n\nsought and the location to be searched.           See United States v.\n\nHargus, 128 F.3d 1358, 1362 (10th Cir. 1997) (\"A nexus between the\n\nobjects to be seized and the place to be searched for them is\n\nestablished when the circumstances set out in the affidavit would\n\nwarrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the articles\n\nsought would be found at the place to be searched.\").\n\n           We, however, agree with the district court that an\n\nevidentiary hearing was not required.      Even if Materas could prove\n\nthat the police intentionally misrepresented that Materas lived at\n\n374 Thornton Street, the affidavit describes a controlled buy that\n\ntook place two days earlier at the same location involving Materas.\n\nThe controlled buy from Materas alone provided sufficient probable\n\ncause for issuing the search warrant.      Common sense dictates that\n\nevidence of Materas's possession could probably be found in the\n\nlocation where he sold drugs two days before.           United States v.\n\nRibeiro, 397 F.3d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[T]he application must\n\ngive   someone   of   'reasonable   caution'   reason   to   believe   that\n\nevidence of a crime will be found at the place to be searched.\").\n\nIn addition, the affidavit contained other information linking\n\nMateras to the address, even though he no longer lived there.\n\nTherefore, there was no error at all in the district court's\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fdecision to deny the Franks hearing on the basis that probable\n\ncause existed independent of the alleged flaws in the affidavit.3\n\n          Finally, Materas claims that the district court imposed\n\ntoo high a burden on him by requiring him to show that suppression\n\nwas warranted as a result of the alleged flaws in the affidavit.\n\nHe bases his argument on the trial judge's statement at the\n\nsuppression hearing that Materas had not shown \"a sufficient basis\n\nto justify a conclusion that the evidence seized as a result of the\n\nwarrant should be suppressed based on the warrant containing\n\nmaterial omissions or material false statements.\"              Our prior\n\nconclusion that the affidavit supported probable cause independent\n\nof the alleged flaws, however, renders this argument toothless.\n\nRegardless   of   the   district    court's   language,   it   correctly\n\ndetermined that Materas was not entitled to a Franks hearing.\n\n          B. Motion to Suppress Materas's Statements\n\n          We review the denial of a motion to suppress de novo as\n\nto questions of law, and for clear error as to questions of fact.\n\nUnited States v. Vongkaysone, 434 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir. 2006).        We\n\n\n3\n  Materas also makes a cursory argument that \"the affidavit's sole\nreliance on the information provided by a previously unproven\nconfidential   informant   provided   the   magistrate   with   [an\ninsufficient] basis upon which to make a determination as to the\ninformant's credibility,\" citing United States v. Barnard, 299 F.3d\n90, 93 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"Where an affidavit relies on the reports\nof unnamed informants, it must provide some information upon which\nthe issuing justice can assess the credibility of the informant's\ninformation.\"). As we stated above, however, the detective's own\nreport on the controlled buy was sufficient to establish probable\ncause for the search warrant.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fwill uphold the district court's decision if \"any reasonable view\n\nof the evidence supports the decision.\"         United States v. Hawkins,\n\n279 F.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           Under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479 (1966),\n\nevidence obtained as a result of police interrogation prior to the\n\ndefendant being read his \"Miranda rights\" cannot generally be used\n\nagainst the defendant in the prosecution's case in chief.                 The\n\nconsequences of a Miranda violation, however, are limited.                For\n\ninstance, the Miranda rule is not subject to the \"fruits of the\n\npoisonous tree\" doctrine.4        United States v. Patane, 542 U.S. 630,\n\n642 (2004) (plurality opinion); see also Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S.\n\n298, 307 (1985) (\"[T]he Miranda presumption . . . does not require\n\nthat the [unwarned] statements and their fruits be discarded as\n\ninherently tainted.\"). As another example, the prosecution can use\n\nuncompelled     statements   obtained      without   Miranda   warnings   for\n\nimpeachment purposes. Elstad, 470 U.S. at 307-08 (citing Harris v.\n\nNew York, 401 U.S. 222 (1971)).\n\n           No    one   disputes     that    Materas's   initial   statement\n\nregarding the location of the drugs was obtained in violation of\n\nMiranda.   Although the government agreed not to use the statement,\n\nMateras argues that suppression of only that statement is not an\n\n\n\n4\n   This doctrine requires the exclusion \"not only [of] illegally\nobtained evidence itself, but also . . . other incriminating\nevidence derived from the primary evidence.\" Nix v. Williams, 467\nU.S. 431, 441 (1984).\n\n                                     -12-\n\fadequate remedy to redress the violation of his rights.   He claims\n\nthat use of the statement for impeachment purposes would deny a\n\ndefense that he did not know the drugs were present.   Further, he\n\nurges us to consider his entire interrogation as one ongoing event\n\nresulting from the hostile circumstances surrounding his initial\n\nstatement, and asks us to suppress all statements made during that\n\ntime.   He describes his initial coercion as \"turning on a spigot\"\n\nthat led to his continued confessions.\n\n           Materas's arguments are unpersuasive.   As to Materas's\n\nsecond argument that all of his statements should be suppressed\n\nbecause of the coercive nature of his initial divulgement, the\n\ndistrict court correctly limited the consequences of the Miranda\n\nviolation to the one statement elicited prior to reading the\n\ndefendant his rights.    The district court found that there was\n\nnothing particularly coercive about the circumstances of the waiver\n\nof Materas's Miranda rights and that Detective Bourgeois acted in\n\ngood faith.   These factual findings are firmly grounded in the\n\nrecord and therefore not clearly erroneous.\n\n           Based on these findings, we agree with the district\n\ncourt that there is no evidence that the police were attempting to\n\nundermine the purposes of the Miranda rule to gain subsequent\n\nMirandized confessions. See Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600, 616\n\n(2004). Other than asking where the drugs were located, the police\n\ndid not ask any other questions before explaining to Materas his\n\n\n                               -13-\n\frights in another location, fifteen minutes later.                             As the court\n\nfound,   \"the       first    questioning            was    not   at    all   systematic\"   or\n\nextensive.      See id. at 615-16 (discussing a number of factors\n\nrelated to the effectiveness of Miranda warnings, including \"the\n\ncompleteness and detail of the questions and answers in the first\n\nround    of   interrogation,          .       .    .   and   the    degree    to   which   the\n\ninterrogator's questions treated the second round as continuous\n\nwith the first.\").             The district court believed that Materas\n\nunderstood his rights and voluntarily waived them, and therefore\n\nthe court was justified in limiting the scope of the Miranda\n\nviolation to its usual consequences, i.e., excluding only the pre-\n\nMiranda statement.

We agree with the district court that Materas was not entitled to a <i>Franks</i> hearing<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> on the suppression of the evidence, and that Materas was not entitled to suppression of statements made after he waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Search Warrant</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 2004, Detective Frank Bourgeois of the Nashua Police Department applied for a no-knock search warrant for 374 Thornton Street, Manchester, New Hampshire, which he alleged was Materas's residence. In his supporting affidavit, Detective Bourgeois relied on the following events as a basis for the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 2004, a man complained to the Manchester Police Department that his boyfriend was being held against his will by Materas and Peter Deprisco at 374 Thornton Street. He expressed his belief that Materas and Deprisco were supplying large amounts of methamphetamine to dealers in Manchester, and eventually admitted that he had bought drugs from them in the past.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six months later, another man told the Manchester Police Department that he had been held against his will at 454 Hanover Street in Manchester. He claimed that he had smoked what he believed to be methamphetamine with several people, including one named Keith. The police responded to the same address and identified \"Keith\" as Keith Materas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2004, the Manchester Police Department responded to a domestic dispute at 374 Thornton Street, where Materas and Deprisco identified themselves as co-owners and residents of that address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the same month, the New Hampshire Drug Task Force, of which Detective Bourgeois was a member, received information that an individual named Keith, a homosexual man who lived in Manchester, was the largest supplier of methamphetamine in the state. In an unrelated incident, the Nashua Police Department also learned from a cooperating individual in its custody that two men named Keith and Peter of 454 Hanover Street were selling methamphetamine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 12, 2004, Detective Bourgeois arranged a controlled purchase of a small amount of methamphetamine by a confidential informant at 374 Thornton Street. The informant entered the residence and returned with methamphetamine, which he claimed to have bought inside from Materas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Search</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Manchester District Court issued the no-knock warrant on October 14, 2005, the police executed the warrant the same day, led by Detective Bourgeois. Ten to fifteen officers entered the residence with guns drawn<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and proceeded directly toward the basement, where they believed Materas and Deprisco were residing while the upper floors of the residence were under construction. In fact, Materas did not reside at 374 Thornton Street; he had been living at 454 Hanover Street for more than three months prior to the application for the search warrant. Nonetheless, the officers found Materas and Deprisco standing in the hall, where they were apprehended and handcuffed. Materas maintains that he was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detective Bourgeois proceeded into the basement, where he found Materas's dog. Materas claims that the detective threatened to shoot the dog if he did not keep him under control. Detective Bourgeois denied making such a threat, testifying that he put the dog in a closet in order to allow the officers to search the room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers then moved the two men into the basement, where Deprisco became uncooperative. After Deprisco was removed from the room, and while approximately six other officers searched the room, Detective Bourgeois told Materas, who was still handcuffed, that if he would tell them where the drugs were, it would save them from having to tear the place apart. Detective Bourgeois testified at trial that his intent was to make the process easier for everyone, given the clutter in the room and his belief that the drugs were there. Materas then indicated that the drugs were located in a clear plastic case behind Detective Bourgeois.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point, Detective Bourgeois searched Materas, and in the process asked him to undo his pants. Because he was not wearing underwear, his genitals were exposed for a brief period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the drugs were found, Materas was removed upstairs to the kitchen area, where he was read his <i>Miranda</i> rights and questioned further. Detective Bourgeois testified that Materas did not exhibit signs of being under the influence of any substance, although Materas did tell the detective that he was a methamphetamine addict, using one to two grams a day. No guns were drawn during Materas's interrogation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materas was cooperative and answered Bourgeois's questions, as well as those of a DEA agent also present. Materas stated that he received just under a pound of methamphetamine every six to eight weeks, which he used and distributed to friends. He admitted that most of the drugs found in the search were his. Some of the drugs, however, he attributed to Deprisco, with whom he had lived at the 374 Thornton Street residence for twelve years. He indicated that he and Deprisco had broken up, but were recently reunited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materas was then moved to the Manchester Police Department. There, Detective Bourgeois read him his <i>Miranda</i> rights again, and asked Materas to sign a form waiving his rights, which he did. Later, Detective Bourgeois relayed a message to Materas that his attorney had called and was trying to reach him. Materas voluntarily signed another form waiving his rights and indicated that he wanted to continue to cooperate. During his questioning at the police station, Materas reiterated the statements he had previously made after waiving his <i>Miranda</i> rights at the residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 23, 2005, a federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment against Materas. Count 1 charged Materas with distribution of methamphetamine, and Counts 2 and 3 charged him with possession with intent to distribute ecstasy and five or more grams of methamphetamine, respectively, all in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 18, 2005, Materas filed a motion to suppress the statements he made during the search. He asserted that he should have been read his <i>Miranda</i> rights before being questioned on the location of the drugs and that he was interrogated under coercive circumstances while the police knew that he was under the influence of methamphetamine. Materas also filed a separate motion to suppress the evidence seized as a result of the search. He argued that the search was invalid because Detective Bourgeois failed to provide proof of his informant's credibility, which was undermined by the informant's failure to tell the police that Materas did not reside at 374 Thornton Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, 2005, the district court heard and denied both motions. The court ruled that the circumstances of the controlled buy at 374 Thornton Street constituted adequate probable cause to justify the search, whether or not the warrant contained other material omissions or false statements. The judge clarified at the defense's request that Materas was not entitled to a <i>Franks</i> hearing because even if he could prove everything that he claimed, it still would not be enough to support suppression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Materas's statements subsequent to being read his <i>Miranda</i> rights, the court specifically determined that there was nothing \"unusually coercive about the circumstances\" surrounding Materas's waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. It also concluded that Detective Bourgeois had acted \"entirely in good faith\" and that his initial question about the location of the drugs was not intended to undermine Materas's rights. The court went on to note that Materas's initial statement concerning the location of the drugs would be suppressed and that the government had no intention of using the statement in its principal case. Finally, the court deferred the determination of whether the statement could be used for impeachment purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the denial of his motions to suppress, Materas changed his plea to guilty on the two counts of possession, reserving his right to appeal the court's suppression rulings. On May 24, 2006, the court dismissed Count 1 and sentenced Materas to seventy months imprisonment on each of Counts 2 and 3, to be served concurrently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Materas argues that the district court erred in imposing too high a burden for his preliminary showing that he was entitled to a <i>Franks</i> hearing. He further argues that the police coerced him into making his initial statement indicating where the drugs were located, and that suppression of only that initial statement, rather than all statements made to the police thereafter, is an inadequate remedy for the violation of his constitutional rights. After carefully considering Materas's arguments, we affirm the district court's denial of his motions to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Franks</i> Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a <i>Franks</i> hearing for clear error. <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 319 F.3d 12, 34 (1st Cir. 2003). Under <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> 438 U.S. 154, 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), a defendant may request an evidentiary hearing to challenge police misconduct in drafting an affidavit in support of a search warrant. The defendant \"must make a `substantial preliminary showing' that the affidavit included a false statement which was made either knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth, and that this misstatement was necessary to the finding of probable cause.\" <i>Nelson-Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 319 F.3d at 34 (quoting <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materas first challenges the constitutionality of the standard set forth in <i>Franks.</i> He cursorily argues that this \"overly burdensome requirement\" essentially demands that the defendant prove his case before having an opportunity to obtain the testimony necessary to prove his case. We do not find the <i>Franks</i> standard particularly burdensome, and we note that the Supreme Court would not have announced an unconstitutional standard for challenging an affidavit in support of a search warrant when it decided the Fourth Amendment issue in <i>Franks.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materas then asserts that he made a sufficient showing to afford him a full <i>Franks</i> hearing. He argues that the police knew that he did not live at the address for which the search warrant was issued, and that they purposefully misled the magistrate into issuing the warrant based on a non-existent nexus between the drugs sought and the location to be searched. <i>See United States v. Hargus,</i> 128 F.3d 1358, 1362 (10th Cir.1997) (\"A nexus between the objects to be seized and the place to be searched for them is established when the circumstances set out in the affidavit would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the articles sought would be found at the place to be searched.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, however, agree with the district court that an evidentiary hearing was not required. Even if Materas could prove that the police intentionally misrepresented that Materas lived at 374 Thornton Street, the affidavit describes a controlled buy that took place two days earlier at the same location involving Materas. The controlled buy from Materas alone provided sufficient probable cause for issuing the search warrant. Common sense dictates that evidence of Materas's possession could probably be found in the location where he sold drugs two days before. <i>United States v. Ribeiro,</i> 397 F.3d 43, 49 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[T]he application must give someone of `reasonable caution' reason to believe that evidence of a crime will be found at the place to be searched.\"). In addition, the affidavit contained other information linking Materas to the address, even though he no longer lived there. Therefore, there was no error at all in the district court's decision to deny the <i>Franks</i> hearing on the basis that probable cause existed independent of the alleged flaws in the affidavit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Materas claims that the district court imposed too high a burden on him by requiring him to show that suppression was warranted as a result of the alleged flaws in the affidavit. He bases his argument on the trial judge's statement at the suppression hearing that Materas had not shown \"a sufficient basis to justify a conclusion that the evidence seized as a result of the warrant should be suppressed based on the warrant containing material omissions or material false statements.\" Our prior conclusion that the affidavit supported probable cause independent of the alleged flaws, however, renders this argument toothless. Regardless of the district court's language, it correctly determined that Materas was not entitled to a <i>Franks</i> hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Motion to Suppress Materas's Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion to suppress <i>de novo</i> as to questions of law, and for clear error as to questions of fact. <i>United States v. Vongkaysone,</i> 434 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir.2006). We will uphold the district court's decision if \"any reasonable view of the evidence supports the decision.\" <i>United States v. Hawkins,</i> 279 F.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), evidence obtained as a result of police interrogation prior to the defendant being read his \"<i>Miranda</i> rights\" cannot generally be used against the defendant in the prosecution's case in chief. The consequences of a <i>Miranda</i> violation, however, are limited. For instance, the <i>Miranda</i> rule is not subject to the \"fruits of the poisonous tree\" doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>United States</i> <i>v. Patane,</i> 542 U.S. 630, 642, 124 S.Ct. 2620, 159 L.Ed.2d 667 (2004) (plurality opinion); <i>see also Oregon v. Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. 298, 307, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985) (\"[T]he <i>Miranda</i> presumption . . . does not require that the [unwarned] statements and their fruits be discarded as inherently tainted.\"). As another example, the prosecution can use uncompelled statements obtained without <i>Miranda</i> warnings for impeachment purposes. <i>Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. at 307-08, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (citing <i>Harris v. New York,</i> 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No one disputes that Materas's initial statement regarding the location of the drugs was obtained in violation of <i>Miranda.</i> Although the government agreed not to use the statement, Materas argues that suppression of only that statement is not an adequate remedy to redress the violation of his rights. He claims that use of the statement for impeachment purposes would deny a defense that he did not know the drugs were present. Further, he urges us to consider his entire interrogation as one ongoing event resulting from the hostile circumstances surrounding his initial statement, and asks us to suppress all statements made during that time. He describes his initial coercion as \"turning on a spigot\" that led to his continued confessions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materas's arguments are unpersuasive. As to Materas's second argument that all of his statements should be suppressed because of the coercive nature of his initial divulgement, the district court correctly limited the consequences of the <i>Miranda</i> violation to the one statement elicited prior to reading the defendant his rights. The district court found that there was nothing particularly coercive about the circumstances of the waiver of Materas's <i>Miranda</i> rights and that Detective Bourgeois acted in good faith. These factual findings are firmly grounded in the record and therefore not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these findings, we agree with the district court that there is no evidence that the police were attempting to undermine the purposes of the <i>Miranda</i> rule to gain subsequent Mirandized confessions. <i>See Missouri v. Seibert,</i> 542 U.S. 600, 616, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004). Other than asking where the drugs were located, the police did not ask any other questions before explaining to Materas his rights in another location, fifteen minutes later. As the court found, \"the first questioning was not at all systematic\" or extensive. <i>See id.</i> at 615-16, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (discussing a number of factors related to the effectiveness of <i>Miranda</i> warnings, including \"the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation, . . . and the degree to which the interrogator's questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.\"). The district court believed that Materas understood his rights and voluntarily waived them, and therefore the court was justified in limiting the scope of the <i>Miranda</i> violation to its usual consequences, <i>i.e.,</i> excluding only the pre-<i>Miranda</i> statement. <i>See United States v. Esquil&#237;n,</i> 208 F.3d 315, 319 (1st Cir.) (\"A subsequent administration of <i>Miranda</i> warnings to a suspect who has given a voluntary but unwarned statement ordinarily . . . suffice[s] to remove the conditions that precluded admission of the earlier statement.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Elstad,</i> 470 U.S. at 314, 105 S.Ct. 1285)); <i>see also Patane,</i> 542 U.S. at 642, 124 S.Ct. 2620 (\"`[T]he exclusion of unwarned statements . . . is a complete and sufficient remedy' for any perceived <i>Miranda</i> violation.\" (quoting <i>Ch&#225;vez v. Mart&#237;nez,</i> 538 U.S. 760, 790, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 155 L.Ed.2d 984 (2003) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject Materas's purely hypothetical argument that his initial statement should have been disallowed for impeachment purposes. Because Materas's subsequent Mirandized statements would not have been suppressed, it would make no sense for Materas to have claimed any kind of lack of knowledge defense. After waiving his <i>Miranda</i> rights, he repeatedly admitted that the drugs seized during the search were his. With this direct evidence, the government would have had no reason to use his initial statement for impeachment purposes. Furthermore, we will not assist a defendant in using \"[t]he shield provided by Miranda . . . [as] a license to use perjury by way of a defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances.\" <i>Harris,</i> 401 U.S. at 226, 91 S.Ct. 643.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's denial of Materas's motions to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A defendant who believes that the police included false statements or material omissions in an affidavit underlying a search warrant may request an evidentiary hearing pursuant to<i>Franks v.

We agree with the district court that Materas was not entitled to a <i>Franks</i> hearing<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> on the suppression of the evidence, and that Materas was not entitled to suppression of statements made after he waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Search Warrant</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 2004, Detective Frank Bourgeois of the Nashua Police Department applied for a no-knock search warrant for 374 Thornton Street, Manchester, New Hampshire, which he alleged was Materas's residence. In his supporting affidavit, Detective Bourgeois relied on the following events as a basis for the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 2004, a man complained to the Manchester Police Department that his boyfriend was being held against his will by Materas and Peter Deprisco at 374 Thornton Street. He expressed his belief that Materas and Deprisco were supplying large amounts of methamphetamine to dealers in Manchester, and eventually admitted that he had bought drugs from them in the past.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six months later, another man told the Manchester Police Department that he had been held against his will at 454 Hanover Street in Manchester. He claimed that he had smoked what he believed to be methamphetamine with several people, including one named Keith. The police responded to the same address and identified \"Keith\" as Keith Materas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2004, the Manchester Police Department responded to a domestic dispute at 374 Thornton Street, where Materas and Deprisco identified themselves as co-owners and residents of that address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the same month, the New Hampshire Drug Task Force, of which Detective Bourgeois was a member, received information that an individual named Keith, a homosexual man who lived in Manchester, was the largest supplier of methamphetamine in the state. In an unrelated incident, the Nashua Police Department also learned from a cooperating individual in its custody that two men named Keith and Peter of 454 Hanover Street were selling methamphetamine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 12, 2004, Detective Bourgeois arranged a controlled purchase of a small amount of methamphetamine by a confidential informant at 374 Thornton Street. The informant entered the residence and returned with methamphetamine, which he claimed to have bought inside from Materas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Search</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Manchester District Court issued the no-knock warrant on October 14, 2005, the police executed the warrant the same day, led by Detective Bourgeois. Ten to fifteen officers entered the residence with guns drawn<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and proceeded directly toward the basement, where they believed Materas and Deprisco were residing while the upper floors of the residence were under construction. In fact, Materas did not reside at 374 Thornton Street; he had been living at 454 Hanover Street for more than three months prior to the application for the search warrant. Nonetheless, the officers found Materas and Deprisco standing in the hall, where they were apprehended and handcuffed. Materas maintains that he was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time of entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detective Bourgeois proceeded into the basement, where he found Materas's dog. Materas claims that the detective threatened to shoot the dog if he did not keep him under control. Detective Bourgeois denied making such a threat, testifying that he put the dog in a closet in order to allow the officers to search the room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers then moved the two men into the basement, where Deprisco became uncooperative. After Deprisco was removed from the room, and while approximately six other officers searched the room, Detective Bourgeois told Materas, who was still handcuffed, that if he would tell them where the drugs were, it would save them from having to tear the place apart. Detective Bourgeois testified at trial that his intent was to make the process easier for everyone, given the clutter in the room and his belief that the drugs were there. Materas then indicated that the drugs were located in a clear plastic case behind Detective Bourgeois.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point, Detective Bourgeois searched Materas, and in the process asked him to undo his pants. Because he was not wearing underwear, his genitals were exposed for a brief period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the drugs were found, Materas was removed upstairs to the kitchen area, where he was read his <i>Miranda</i> rights and questioned further. Detective Bourgeois testified that Materas did not exhibit signs of being under the influence of any substance, although Materas did tell the detective that he was a methamphetamine addict, using one to two grams a day. No guns were drawn during Materas's interrogation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materas was cooperative and answered Bourgeois's questions, as well as those of a DEA agent also present. Materas stated that he received just under a pound of methamphetamine every six to eight weeks, which he used and distributed to friends. He admitted that most of the drugs found in the search were his. Some of the drugs, however, he attributed to Deprisco, with whom he had lived at the 374 Thornton Street residence for twelve years. He indicated that he and Deprisco had broken up, but were recently reunited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materas was then moved to the Manchester Police Department. There, Detective Bourgeois read him his <i>Miranda</i> rights again, and asked Materas to sign a form waiving his rights, which he did. Later, Detective Bourgeois relayed a message to Materas that his attorney had called and was trying to reach him. Materas voluntarily signed another form waiving his rights and indicated that he wanted to continue to cooperate. During his questioning at the police station, Materas reiterated the statements he had previously made after waiving his <i>Miranda</i> rights at the residence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 23, 2005, a federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment against Materas. Count 1 charged Materas with distribution of methamphetamine, and Counts 2 and 3 charged him with possession with intent to distribute ecstasy and five or more grams of methamphetamine, respectively, all in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 18, 2005, Materas filed a motion to suppress the statements he made during the search. He asserted that he should have been read his <i>Miranda</i> rights before being questioned on the location of the drugs and that he was interrogated under coercive circumstances while the police knew that he was under the influence of methamphetamine. Materas also filed a separate motion to suppress the evidence seized as a result of the search. He argued that the search was invalid because Detective Bourgeois failed to provide proof of his informant's credibility, which was undermined by the informant's failure to tell the police that Materas did not reside at 374 Thornton Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, 2005, the district court heard and denied both motions. The court ruled that the circumstances of the controlled buy at 374 Thornton Street constituted adequate probable cause to justify the search, whether or not the warrant contained other material omissions or false statements. The judge clarified at the defense's request that Materas was not entitled to a <i>Franks</i> hearing because even if he could prove everything that he claimed, it still would not be enough to support suppression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Materas's statements subsequent to being read his <i>Miranda</i> rights, the court specifically determined that there was nothing \"unusually coercive about the circumstances\" surrounding Materas's waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. It also concluded that Detective Bourgeois had acted \"entirely in good faith\" and that his initial question about the location of the drugs was not intended to undermine Materas's rights. The court went on to note that Materas's initial statement concerning the location of the drugs would be suppressed and that the government had no intention of using the statement in its principal case. Finally, the court deferred the determination of whether the statement could be used for impeachment purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the denial of his motions to suppress, Materas changed his plea to guilty on the two counts of possession, reserving his right to appeal the court's suppression rulings. On May 24, 2006, the court dismissed Count 1 and sentenced Materas to seventy months imprisonment on each of Counts 2 and 3, to be served concurrently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Materas argues that the district court erred in imposing too high a burden for his preliminary showing that he was entitled to a <i>Franks</i> hearing. He further argues that the police coerced him into making his initial statement indicating where the drugs were located, and that suppression of only that initial statement, rather than all statements made to the police thereafter, is an inadequate remedy for the violation of his constitutional rights. After carefully considering Materas's arguments, we affirm the district court's denial of his motions to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Franks</i> Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a <i>Franks</i> hearing for clear error. <i>United States v.

We do not find the <i>Franks</i> standard particularly burdensome, and we note that the Supreme Court would not have announced an unconstitutional standard for challenging an affidavit in support of a search warrant when it decided the Fourth Amendment issue in <i>Franks.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materas then asserts that he made a sufficient showing to afford him a full <i>Franks</i> hearing. He argues that the police knew that he did not live at the address for which the search warrant was issued, and that they purposefully misled the magistrate into issuing the warrant based on a non-existent nexus between the drugs sought and the location to be searched. <i>See United States v. Hargus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747823\"><a href=\"/opinion/747823/united-states-v-charley-hargus/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1358</span></a></span>, 1362 (10th Cir.1997) (\"A nexus between the objects to be seized and the place to be searched for them is established when the circumstances set out in the affidavit would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the articles sought would be found at the place to be searched.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, however, agree with the district court that an evidentiary hearing was not required. Even if Materas could prove that the police intentionally misrepresented that Materas lived at 374 Thornton Street, the affidavit describes a controlled buy that took place two days earlier at the same location involving Materas. The controlled buy from Materas alone provided sufficient probable cause for issuing the search warrant. Common sense dictates that evidence of Materas's possession could probably be found in the location where he sold drugs two days before. <i>United States v. Ribeiro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201438\"><a href=\"/opinion/201438/united-states-v-ribeiro/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[T]he application must give someone of `reasonable caution' reason to believe that evidence of a crime will be found at the place to be searched.\"). In addition, the affidavit contained other information linking Materas to the address, even though he no longer lived there. Therefore, there was no error at all in the district court's decision to deny the <i>Franks</i> hearing on the basis that probable cause existed independent of the alleged flaws in the affidavit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Materas claims that the district court imposed too high a burden on him by requiring him to show that suppression was warranted as a result of the alleged flaws in the affidavit. He bases his argument on the trial judge's statement at the suppression hearing that Materas had not shown \"a sufficient basis to justify a conclusion that the evidence seized as a result of the warrant should be suppressed based on the warrant containing material omissions or material false statements.\" Our prior conclusion that the affidavit supported probable cause independent of the alleged flaws, however, renders this argument toothless.

He claims that use of the statement for impeachment purposes would deny a defense that he did not know the drugs were present. Further, he urges us to consider his entire interrogation as one ongoing event resulting from the hostile circumstances surrounding his initial statement, and asks us to suppress all statements made during that time. He describes his initial coercion as \"turning on a spigot\" that led to his continued confessions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materas's arguments are unpersuasive. As to Materas's second argument that all of his statements should be suppressed because of the coercive nature of his initial divulgement, the district court correctly limited the consequences of the <i>Miranda</i> violation to the one statement elicited prior to reading the defendant his rights. The district court found that there was nothing particularly coercive about the circumstances of the waiver of Materas's <i>Miranda</i> rights and that Detective Bourgeois acted in good faith.

Other than asking where the drugs were located, the police did not ask any other questions before explaining to Materas his rights in another location, fifteen minutes later. As the court found, \"the first questioning was not at all systematic\" or extensive. <i>See id.</i> at 615-16, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137002\"><a href=\"/opinion/137002/missouri-v-seibert/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court believed that Materas understood his rights and voluntarily waived them, and therefore the court was justified in limiting the scope of the <i>Miranda</i> violation to its usual consequences, <i>i.e.,</i> excluding only the pre-<i>Miranda</i> statement. <i>See United States v.

Because Materas's subsequent Mirandized statements would not have been suppressed, it would make no sense for Materas to have claimed any kind of lack of knowledge defense. After waiving his <i>Miranda</i> rights, he repeatedly admitted that the drugs seized during the search were his. With this direct evidence, the government would have had no reason to use his initial statement for impeachment purposes. Furthermore, we will not assist a defendant in using \"[t]he shield provided by Miranda . . . [as] a license to use perjury by way of a defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances.\" <i>Harris,</i> 401 U.S. at 226, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108272\"><a href=\"/opinion/108272/harris-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
