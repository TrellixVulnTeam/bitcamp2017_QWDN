These consolidated appeals present\n\nthe issue of law of whether the term \"abandonment\" in section 1170\n\nof the Bankruptcy Code gives the bankruptcy courts the power to\n\nadversely abandon a non-debtor railroad's easement and trackage\n\nrights over rail lines owned by the debtor at the time of the\n\nbankruptcy.     This appears to be an issue of first impression in the\n\ncourts of appeals.\n\n           Section 1170, which resulted from the 1978 Bankruptcy\n\nCode Amendments, is an exception to the normal rule that only the\n\nSurface Transportation Board (STB), the successor to the earlier\n\nInterstate Commerce Commission (ICC), has jurisdiction to authorize\n\nthe abandonment of rail lines or the discontinuance of operations\n\nover any part of a rail line.                See 49 U.S.C. § 10903.         In the\n\nsection 1170 abandonment process, the STB still plays a role, but\n\nit is an advisory one.          See 11 U.S.C. § 1170 (b),(c).           Outside of\n\nthe   context    of    a    bankrupt   railroad,     in    order   to   achieve   an\n\nabandonment or a discontinuance, rail carriers must apply to the\n\nSTB for permission.\n\n           A discussion of some of the parlance of federal railroad\n\nregulation is helpful.          Generally, when a rail carrier or a third\n\nparty   wishes    to       \"abandon\"   its    own   rail   line,   it   must   seek\n\npermission from the STB.          49 U.S.C. § 10903.        If a rail carrier is\n\noperating rail transportation over its own line or over the line of\n\nanother by the grant of independent trackage rights, it must seek\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fpermission from the STB to \"discontinue\" the service.                  Id.   The\n\nSTB's authority and the standards governing its decisions are the\n\nsame regardless of whether it is granting an abandonment or a\n\ndiscontinuance.      See Id. § 10903(d).\n\n            Under 49 U.S.C. § 10903, this application can be brought\n\nto the STB by the rail carrier itself or, in a more unusual\n\ncircumstance, by a third party.              See Consolidated Rail Corp. v.\n\nI.C.C., 29 F.3d 706, 708-09 (D.C. Cir. 1994).            If the rail carrier\n\napplies to abandon or discontinue its own lines or service, the\n\napplication is for an \"abandonment\" or \"discontinuance\" (what we\n\nwill call a \"direct\" abandonment or discontinuance for purposes of\n\nclarity).     By contrast, if a third party applies to abandon or\n\ndiscontinue the lines or services of another rail carrier in an STB\n\nproceeding,     it      is    called     an     \"adverse\"    abandonment      or\n\ndiscontinuance.      Id.     The STB can grant an adverse abandonment or\n\ndiscontinuance on a third party's petition even if the owner of the\n\nline or the trackage rights objects.             The text of section 10903\n\nitself   does     not      distinguish       between   adverse   and     direct\n\nabandonments, but the case law makes it clear that the STB has\n\nauthority to hear both types of applications.               Thompson v. Texas\n\nMexican Ry. Co., 328 U.S. 134, 145 (1946)(\"There is no requirement\n\n. . . that the application [for abandonment to the STB] be made by\n\nthe carrier whose operations are sought to be abandoned.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           Here the debtor railroad through its trustee seeks to\n\nadversely abandon not its own interest, but the interests of a\n\nthird party in an easement and trackage rights over lines once\n\nowned by the debtor at the time of bankruptcy.          The rub is that it\n\nseeks to do so in the bankruptcy court, not before the STB.            The\n\ndistrict court held that the statutory language in section 1170,\n\ngiving the bankruptcy court authority over abandonments of rail\n\nlines, does not include the authority to grant adverse abandonments\n\nof a non-debtor's trackage or other rights.        The plaintiff/trustee\n\nin bankruptcy appeals this decision.\n\n           We affirm the district court's dismissal of Count III of\n\nthe trustee's complaint.      In doing so, we hold that the bankruptcy\n\ncourt does not have the authority under section 1170 to adversely\n\nabandon the lines or trackage rights of a non-debtor, on the\n\npetition of a debtor railroad who owned those lines at the time of\n\nbankruptcy.      Such authority lies, instead, within the jurisdiction\n\nof the STB under 49 U.S.C. § 10903.        We also affirm the decision of\n\nthe STB under 49 U.S.C. § 10903 denying permission for the relief\n\nthe trustee seeks.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           In March 2001, Bangor & Aroostook Railroad Company (BAR)\n\nand   Canadian    National   (CN)   (which   includes   Canadian   National\n\nRailway Company (CNR) and its subsidiary, Waterloo Railway Company\n\n(Waterloo)) entered into a series of pre-bankruptcy agreements\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\finvolving the movement of rail cars over the Madawaska rail line.\n\nAt the time of the agreements, BAR and its wholly owned subsidiary,\n\nVan Buren Bridge Company (VBBC), owned this line.                   The Madawaska\n\nline runs from the Fraser paper mill in Madawaska, Maine, to an\n\ninterchange with a CN line at St. Leonard, New Brunswick, Canada.\n\n               In exchange for the rights granted under the agreements,\n\nCN paid BAR five million dollars in cash.                  The first agreement\n\nbetween the two parties was a Junction Settlement Agreement, under\n\nwhich BAR agreed to move CN's railcars over BAR's Madawaska line,\n\nbetween the connection with CN's rail lines at St. Leonard and the\n\nFraser paper mill.1          CN agreed to pay BAR a specified per-car price\n\nfor performing these haulage services and has done so. The parties\n\nalso       entered    into   a   Trackage     Rights   Agreement.     Under   this\n\nagreement, CNR acquired limited local trackage rights which allowed\n\nit to run its own trains over the Madawaska line to the Fraser\n\npaper mill.          Finally, in a third agreement BAR granted Waterloo a\n\nnon-exclusive freight easement, under which Waterloo could also\n\noperate its trains over the line.               It is the last two agreements\n\nwhich the trustee seeks to undo here.\n\n               The    STB    approved   the    Trackage   Rights    and   Easement\n\nAgreements on an application by CN on March 21, 2001.                  Since this\n\ntime, CN has not itself used its own trackage rights or the\n\n\n\n       1\n       The parties and the STB agree that the STB does not have\nregulatory authority over this agreement.\n\n                                         -6-\n\feasement; instead it has relied on the haulage agreement to service\n\nthe Fraser mill, and pays BAR a fee for its services.\n\n            On     August   15,    2001,     certain    creditors     filed    an\n\ninvoluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding against BAR.                      In\n\nDecember 2001, the bankruptcy court entered an order for relief\n\nunder    Chapter    11.     It   appointed    James    Howard   as   trustee   in\n\nbankruptcy.2       As part of the bankruptcy plan, Montreal, Maine &\n\nAtlantic Railway LTD (MM&A) acquired the Madawaska line and other\n\nBAR rail assets from the trustee in January 2003.                The effect of\n\nthe agreement between MM&A and BAR is that the trustee no longer\n\nhas ownership rights as to the line.\n\n             There was also what we suspect was an unusual arrangement\n\nin a part of the acquisition agreement: MM&A agreed to pay BAR five\n\nmillion dollars if BAR successfully removed CN from the Madawaska\n\nline prior to January 1, 2005.               The trustee's sole remaining\n\ninterest in the line is the potential five million dollar payout\n\nfrom MM&A.       As a result, BAR had a financial incentive to attempt\n\nto oust CN from the Madawaska line, although it no longer owns the\n\nline.    CN, of course, had no interest in abandoning any of its\n\nrights in that line (which it recently had paid five million\n\ndollars to BAR to acquire).\n\n\n\n     2\n       In May 2002, BAR's subsidiary, Van Buren Bridge Company\n(VBBC), filed for voluntary bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the\nBankruptcy Code. The court appointed Howard as the trustee for its\nproceedings as well.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f             In March 2002, the trustee filed a motion in bankruptcy\n\ncourt to reject the Junction Settlement Agreement, the Trackage\n\nRights Agreement, and the easement as executory contracts under 11\n\nU.S.C.   §   365.     The     trustee   initially      acknowledged     that   the\n\nelimination of CN's trackage rights and easement was subject to the\n\nexclusive jurisdiction of the STB, but later changed his position\n\non this issue.\n\n             In May 2002, the bankruptcy court stayed the proceedings\n\npending action by the STB on appropriate requests for relief by the\n\ntrustee to the STB.      With the STB, the trustee filed a petition to\n\n\"revoke\" CN's trackage and easement rights, pursuant to 49 U.S.C.\n\n§ 10502(d).      This effort was unsuccessful, and the STB explained\n\nthat because CN's trackage and easement rights were \"authorized by\n\nthe agency, [they] will remain in effect until discontinuance\n\nauthority is granted [under 49 U.S.C. § 10903].\" Canadian Nat'l Ry.\n\nCo., STB Finance Docket No. 34014, 2002 WL 1365812 at *6 (STB June\n\n25, 2002).       Basically, the STB said the trustee had used the wrong\n\nprocedural vehicle.          The STB also said that even if it were to\n\nconstrue     a    petition    to   revoke     as   a    request   for    adverse\n\ndiscontinuance under 49 U.S.C. § 10903 (the correct vehicle), there\n\nwas no basis in the record to grant such a request.               Id. at *7.\n\n             After the STB's rejection of the trustee's petition to\n\nrevoke, the bankruptcy court extended the stay of the proceedings,\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fpending      the   trustee's        completion        of   the   adverse    abandonment\n\nproceedings before the STB under 49 U.S.C. § 10903.\n\n              The trustee then switched tracks (metaphorically).                        On\n\nApril   16,    2003,       the    trustee     asserted     for     the   first   time   in\n\nbankruptcy court that the STB did not have final authority over the\n\nforced abandonment of CN's rights, and that the bankruptcy court\n\ncould unilaterally oust CN from the line pursuant to its authority\n\nunder   11    U.S.C.       §     1170.      It   is    apparent     that   the   trustee\n\ncalculated, rightly or wrongly, that he was more likely to get the\n\nfive million dollar payment from MM&A by being in bankruptcy court\n\non the adverse abandonment issue, rather than before the STB.\n\n              On May 7, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an oral order\n\nthat lifted the stay on the proceedings and converted the matter to\n\nan adversary proceeding.                 The trustee filed his complaint in the\n\nadversary proceedings against CN on June 17, 2003.                         Count III of\n\nthe complaint sought an order from the bankruptcy court authorizing\n\nthe discontinuance of CN's trackage rights and the abandonment of\n\nCN's easement.\n\n              After    a    telephone       conference      with    the    parties,     the\n\nbankruptcy court issued a procedural order dated June 19, 2003.\n\nThe court stated that it was uncertain whether BAR's efforts \"not\n\nto discontinue its own existing service over a portion of a rail\n\nline, but . . . to 'adversely abandon' [CN's] rights to use [BAR's]\n\ntracks\" were within the scope of a bankruptcy court's power under\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\f11 U.S.C. § 1170.        On June 25, 2003, CN filed an unopposed motion\n\nto withdraw reference of the adversary proceeding to the bankruptcy\n\ncourt.    The motion was granted on June 30, 2003, and all further\n\nproceedings took place in the federal district court of Maine.                      On\n\nJuly 22, 2003, CN moved to dismiss the trustee's complaint, arguing\n\nthat the     bankruptcy     court    had   no   authority       to   issue     adverse\n\nabandonments of a non-debtor's lines under 11 U.S.C. § 1170.\n\n             The magistrate judge issued a recommended decision that\n\nsection 1170 of the Bankruptcy Code did not apply to the trustee's\n\nefforts to remove CN from the Madawaska Line, and that the relief\n\nsought by the trustee could only be obtained if the STB granted the\n\nadverse abandonment pursuant to section 10903.                        The decision\n\nconcluded that the plain language of the statute did not determine\n\nits meaning and that recourse to the legislative history was\n\nappropriate.         The magistrate judge concluded that the legislative\n\nhistory made it \"reasonably clear that in enacting section 1170\n\nCongress was concerned with streamlining and accelerating the\n\nprocess    of    abandonment    or   discontinuance        of    a   cash-strapped\n\ndebtor's own rail lines,\" not the lines of non-debtors.                           This\n\ninterpretation was further supported by the STB’s decision in\n\nChicago, Rock Island & Pac. R.R. Co., 363 I.C.C. 150 (1980), which\n\nthe magistrate judge found \"reasonably . . . construed sections\n\n10903 and 1170, in tandem, to preserve [the STB's] power . . . to\n\nadjudicate      an    adverse-abandonment       petition   filed      by   a    debtor\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\frailroad.\"        Finally, the magistrate judge concluded that the\n\nlanguage used by Congress in enacting different legislation in 1979\n\nwhich applied section 1170 to the then-pending Milwaukee Railroad\n\nrestructuring supported an interpretation limiting the abandonment\n\nauthority of the bankruptcy court to the debtor's own lines.                    In\n\nthis       legislation,   Congress   stated,    \"the    bankruptcy   court     may\n\nauthorize the abandonment of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad\n\npursuant to section 1170 of Title 11.\" 45 U.S.C. § 904(a)(1).3\n\n               On November 18, 2003, the district court agreed with the\n\ndecision of the magistrate judge and adopted its reasoning.                    The\n\ndistrict court's order granted CN's motion to dismiss Count III of\n\nthe complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P.                       It also\n\ndeferred       adjudication   of   the    motion   as   it   pertained    to   the\n\nremaining counts of the trustee's complaint pending the STB's\n\ndisposition on the trustee's adverse discontinuance application.\n\n               In the meantime, the trustee had filed on October 6,\n\n2003, an application with the STB for the abandonment of CN's\n\ntrackage rights and easement over the Madawaska line.                    This was\n\nessentially an application for an adverse abandonment under section\n\n10903; but the trustee noted that his position was that if the\n\nfinal authority was in the bankruptcy court under section 1170,\n\nthen the STB’s opinion should be viewed only as an advisory opinion\n\n\n       3\n       Unlike the district court, we do not rely on the later\nenacted 45 U.S.C. § 904(a)(1) in determining the meaning of 11\nU.S.C. § 1170.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fas permitted by section 1170.         From the perspective of the STB,\n\nwhether it is acting in an advisory capacity or as the final\n\nauthority, the substantive standards for the two determinations are\n\nthe same.   Treating it as a matter under section 10903, the STB on\n\nApril 30, 2004, denied the application because it found the trustee\n\nhad   failed   to   meet   its   burden    of    showing   that   the   \"public\n\nconvenience and necessity\" required the ouster of CN from the\n\nMadawaska line.     Waterloo Ry. Co., STB Docket No. AB-124, 2004 WL\n\n941227, at *1 (STB April 30, 2004).\n\n            The STB determined that the public is best served by\n\nallowing CN to remain on the Madawaska line.               In coming to its\n\nconclusion, the STB balanced the competing benefits and burdens on\n\nall interested parties.          One such interested party was Fraser\n\nPapers.   Fraser Papers had intervened in and opposed the trustee's\n\nabandonment action before the STB.              Fraser stressed that in the\n\npast its mill at Madawaska, Maine, had been served only by BAR and\n\nthat in late 2000 it had expressed strong concern to CN that BAR's\n\nfinancial condition4 was deteriorating and that a consequent loss\n\nof rail service would likely result in a shutdown of the Madawaska\n\nmill. Fraser said that the Madawaska mill is highly interdependent\n\n\n\n      4\n        Fraser points out that even if BAR ousts CN and brings in\nmore revenue to MM&A, somehow MM&A has to finance the five million\ndollar payment to BAR. That need to finance could weaken MM&A's\nfinancial condition, raising the prospect that MM&A would suffer\nthe same fate as BAR and that the Madawaska mill would be left with\nno rail service.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fwith another mill in Edmundston, New Brunswick, Canada.       If the\n\nMadawaska mill were shut down, the Edmundston mill would be shut\n\ndown as well, depriving 1600 employees of work and depriving Fraser\n\nof 8.5 million dollars in revenue per week.     The STB agreed that\n\nthe loss of competitive rail service would be a detriment to Fraser\n\nand perhaps would impact the economic development and well-being of\n\ncommunities and rural areas near the mill.     Id. at *4-*5, *8.\n\n            Although it was not required by statute to do so, the STB\n\nalso considered the needs of BAR's creditors, the benefits to the\n\nbankrupt estate, and the fairness of the arrangement to the parties\n\ninvolved.    Id. at *5-*8, *8-*9.   The STB found that the trackage\n\nrights obligation between CN and BAR (and now honored by MM&A) in\n\nMarch 2001 was fair and entered into at arm's length.        It also\n\ndetermined that the retention of CN on the Madawaska line would not\n\naffect MM&A's survival or cause the abandonment of other MM&A line\n\nsegments.    The Board ultimately determined that the interests of\n\nthe bankrupt estate did not \"justify stripping CN of its right to\n\nprovide competitive rail service to Fraser or depriving Fraser of\n\nits right to receive that service.\"     Id. at *9.\n\n            The STB rejected challenges made to the standing of the\n\ntrustee in light of the sale of the line by BAR to MM&A.      Id. at\n\n*3.5   No party challenges that determination on appeal.   After the\n\n\n       5\n       The bankruptcy court does not specifically address the issue\nof standing.     The bankruptcy court commented that this was\nessentially a \"transportation dispute\" between CN and MM&A, but\n\n                                 -13-\n\fSTB issued its decision, the trustee filed in court a consented to\n\nmotion for the voluntary dismissal of the remaining counts of the\n\ntrustee's complaint without prejudice, pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2),\n\nFed. R. Civ. P.      On June 3, 2004, the district court granted the\n\nvoluntary dismissal without prejudice as to the remaining counts of\n\nthe trustee's complaint and entered a separate and final judgment\n\nin CN's favor, pursuant to Rule 58(a), Fed. R. Civ. P.               The trustee\n\ntimely appealed the dismissal of Count III to this Court in No. 04-\n\n1819.   Fraser has intervened and has filed a brief in this court in\n\nsupport of affirmance of the district court's opinion.\n\n              In No. 04-1800, the trustee also timely petitioned this\n\ncourt   for    review   of   the   STB's    order   denying    the    trustee's\n\napplication for discontinuance and abandonment.               See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2321.   Both Fraser and CN have intervened in this matter.                  The\n\ntrustee argues that the STB had no jurisdiction to issue a binding\n\ndecision under 49 U.S.C. § 10903 and that it could only issue an\n\nadvisory report under 11 U.S.C. § 1170.               The trustee does not\n\nattack the merits of the STB's decision.            In response, the STB has\n\nalso filed a brief, pointing out that it had been made a party only\n\n\nrecognized the trustee's desire to effect a plan and the importance\nof the five million dollars to the estate. Also, the bankruptcy\ncourt included, upon the request of CN, a provision in its October\n9, 2002 order approving the sale of BAR's estate assets to MM&A\nthat expressly reserved \"all rights and obligations of the parties\nto the CN Junction Settlement Agreement, the CN Trackage Rights\nAgreement, and the Waterloo Easement . . . subject to further\nruling by this Court or any other court of competent jurisdiction.\"\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fin appeal No. 04-1800, and that the issue of whether section 1170\n\napplied was an issue only in appeal No. 04-1819.      The STB says that\n\nwhatever the outcome of that question, the trustee has waived any\n\nargument addressed to the merits of the STB's determination.             The\n\nSTB asks that we affirm the Board's decision.\n\n                                  II.\n\n           Review of the dismissal of a claim under Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nfor failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is de\n\nnovo.   Martin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n          The   trustee   makes   an   argument   based   on    the   \"plain\n\nmeaning\" of the statutory text of 11 U.S.C. § 1170.            The relevant\n\nparts of section 1170 provide as follows:\n\n          (a) The court, after notice and a hearing, may authorize\n          the abandonment of all or a portion of a railroad line if\n          such abandonment is --\n                 (1)(A) in the best interest of the estate; or\n                 (B) essential to the formulation of a plan; and\n                 (2) consistent with the public interest.\n          (b)If . . . such abandonment would require approval by\n          the [STB] under law of the United States, the trustee\n          shall initiate an appropriate application for such\n          abandonment with the [STB]. The court may fix a time\n          within which the [STB] shall report to the court on such\n          application.\n          (c) After the court receives the report of the [STB], or\n          the expiration of the time fixed under subsection (b) of\n          this section, whichever occurs first, the court may\n          authorize such abandonment, after notice to the [STB],\n          the Secretary of Transportation, the trustee, any party\n          in interest that has requested notice, any affected\n          shipper or community, and any other entity prescribed by\n          the court, and a hearing.\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f11 U.S.C. § 1170.    The trustee argues that section 1170 is not\n\nlimited to abandonment of the debtor's own operations and that the\n\nphrase \"all or a portion of a rail line\" shows that the term\n\n\"abandonment\" is not so limited.6\n\n          In fact, BAR's argument does not rely on the plain text\n\nof section 1170,     but requires reference to a prior judicial\n\nconstruction of section 10903. The relevant parts of that section,\n\nin turn, provide:\n\n          (d) A rail carrier providing transportation subject to\n          the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may--\n                 (1) abandon any part of its railroad lines; or\n                 (2) discontinue the operation of all rail\n                 transportation over any part of its railroad\n                 lines;\n          only if the Board finds that the present or future public\n          convenience and necessity require or permit the\n          abandonment or discontinuance.\n\n49 U.S.C. § 10903.   BAR's argument is that the term \"abandonment\"\n\nas used in section 10903 has been construed by both the agency and\n\nthe courts to include adverse abandonment.   See Consolidated Rail\n\nCorp., 29 F.3d at 708-09.     From this, the trustee argues that\n\n\n\n     6\n       The language of section 1170 refers only to \"abandonments.\"\nAs CN points out, an \"abandonment\" is distinct from a\n\"discontinuance.\" See 49 U.S.C. § 10903(d). Despite this, the\nlegislative history states that \"[t]he subchapter provides that the\ncourt rather than the [STB] has the authority to authorize\nabandonments or discontinuances of rail service.\" S. Rep. No. 95-\n989, at 12 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5798\n(emphasis added).    This case involves the abandonment of the\nWaterloo easement and the discontinuance of CN's trackage\nagreement.   Both parties have taken the term \"abandonment\" in\nsection 1170 to cover both abandonment and discontinuance.       We\npursue it no further.\n\n                               -16-\n\fCongress was aware of the construction of \"abandonment\" in section\n\n10903 and is presumed to have adopted that construction in section\n\n1170.\n\n          The trustee also argues that his reading of section 1170\n\nis sensible and would not have improper effects on third parties.\n\nThe trustee says first that concerns about non-debtor railroads are\n\nirrelevant because any consequences to them are exactly what\n\nCongress intended, as the plain text demonstrates.    Further, the\n\ntrustee points out that section 1170 requires the court to consult\n\n\n\n\n                               -17-\n\fthe STB and consider the public interest.7    That is enough, the\n\ntrustee says, to allay any untoward effects on third parties.8\n\n          Indeed the trustee attacks the district court ruling\n\nitself as leading to untoward results.    The trustee argues, for\n\nexample, that if the debtor wants to abandon its own underlying\n\n\n\n     7\n       The standards used by the bankruptcy court to determine\nwhether to permit abandonment under section 1170 are not identical\nto those used by the STB under section 10903. The court must find\nthat the abandonment is (1) \"in the best interest of the estate\" or\n\"essential to the formulation of a plan\" and (2) \"consistent with\nthe public interest.\"    11 U.S.C. § 1170(a)(1)-(2); see also 11\nU.S.C. § 1165 (\"In applying section[] . . . 1170 . . . the court\nand the trustee shall consider the public interest in addition to\nthe interests of the debtor, creditors, and equity security\nholders.\"). The STB's advisory report is supposed to represent the\npublic interest while the trustee and various creditors represent\nwhat is in the best interest of the debtor and its creditors. S.\nRep. No. 95-989, at 12 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787,\n5798. \"The court will balance the various interests and make an\nappropriate decision.\"     H. Rep. No. 95-595, at 424 (1978),\nreprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6380.\n     The STB may permit abandonment of rail lines or discontinuance\nof operations \"only if the [STB] finds that the present or future\npublic convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment\nor discontinuance.\" 49 U.S.C. § 10903(d). Unlike the court, the\nSTB is not required to consider what is in the best interests of\nthe debtor's estate. Further, in determining the public interest,\nthe STB must consider whether the abandonment or discontinuance\nwill have a \"serious, adverse impact on rural and community\ndevelopment.\"   Id.    The STB must also adhere to the national\ntransportation policy of promoting competition between rail\ncarriers.   49 U.S.C. § 10101(1),(4).      In applying the public\ninterest standard, the STB weighs the interests of the carrier, the\naffected shippers, the community, and interstate commerce\ngenerally. Purcell v. United States, 315 U.S. 381, 384 (1942).\n     8\n       The trustee argues it is highly unlikely a court would ever\nrule contrary to the STB's advisory opinion. This is ironic, given\nthat the STB has already ruled that the relief the trustee seeks is\nagainst the public interest and what the trustee wants is a second\nbite at the apple in district court.\n\n                               -18-\n\frail lines, the bankruptcy court could not grant this abandonment\n\nuntil the debtor first sought an application with the STB to\n\ndiscontinue the overlying trackage rights of a non-debtor. See Mo.\n\nPac. R.R. Co., 9 I.C.C.2d 1228, 1230 (1993) (An \"abandonment may\n\nnot be consummated until [the rail carrier with trackage rights']\n\ndiscontinuance has been authorized and interested persons are given\n\nan opportunity to seek imposition of trail use and public use\n\nconditions.\").9\n\n          Finally, the trustee argues that legislative history\n\nshould not be considered, but that if it is, it supports the\n\ntrustee's interpretation.10    We take each argument in turn.\n\n          The meaning of the term \"abandonment\" as it is used in 11\n\nU.S.C. § 1170 is not self-evident and cannot be resolved on textual\n\nplain meaning grounds.        One cannot tell by reading the term\n\n\n     9\n       Of course, BAR, pursuant to agreement with MM&A, does not\nseek the abandonment of the underlying Madawaska line, only the\ndiscontinuance of CN's trackage rights over that line and the\nabandonment of CN's easement. BAR wants to keep the lines and oust\nCN, so the issue it raises does not apply to its own situation.\n     In any event, requiring the debtor to apply to the STB for the\nadverse discontinuance of the trackage rights of a non-debtor will\nnot prevent the bankruptcy court from discontinuing the debtor's\nrail operations over that line. The bankruptcy court can still\ndiscontinue the debtor's own \"money-losing operations over the\nline\" in the short term to stem the cash drain that the rail\noperation is causing the debtor.\n     10\n       The trustee also argues that In re New York, Susquehanna &\nW. R.R. Co., 160 F.2d 29, 32 (3d Cir. 1946), illuminates the\nmeaning of 11 U.S.C. § 1170.      Susquehanna presents a factual\nscenario similar to the one before us, but the similarities stop\nthere. Susquehanna was decided before the passage of section 1170,\nand it did not squarely address the question before us today.\n\n                                 -19-\n\f\"abandonment\" in section 1170 whether the term includes \"adverse\n\nabandonment.\"        Nor can one tell whether this is so simply from the\n\nfact   that    the   term    \"abandonment\"     in   section   10903    has   been\n\nconstrued to include adverse abandonments as well.                In determining\n\nwhat the statute means, we cannot simply rely on a few phrases in\n\na complicated statutory structure.             Section 1170 must be read in\n\nthe context of what Congress was trying to do when it gave the\n\nbankruptcy court abandonment authority over a debtor railroad in\n\nbankruptcy.     Both that context and the legislative history lead us\n\nto reject the trustee's interpretation.\n\n              In designing the statutory scheme, Congress set up an\n\ninterplay between 11 U.S.C. § 1170 and 49 U.S.C. § 10903.                    Under\n\nsection 10903,       the    STB   is   the   regulatory   board    charged   with\n\nimplementing overall Congressional rail transportation policy.\n\nRail carriers are subject to the jurisdiction of the STB, and when\n\na rail carrier intends to abandon its underlying rail lines or\n\ndiscontinue rail transportation or trackage rights over a line, it\n\nmust seek permission by filing an application with the STB.                     49\n\nU.S.C. § 10903. Generally, the STB's authority over abandonment of\n\nrail lines is exclusive and plenary.           Chicago & N.W. Transp. Co. v.\n\nKalo Brick & Tile Co., 450 U.S. 311, 321-23 (1981).\n\n              One exception to this exclusive STB authority is the\n\nabandonment of rail lines when a debtor railroad is in bankruptcy.\n\nCongress designed special provisions in those limited circumstances\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\ffor railroad reorganization that attempted to allow the railroad to\n\nemerge as \"a living, not a dying, . . . enterprise.\" See New Haven\n\nInclusion Cases, 399 U.S. 392, 431 (1970)(internal quotations\n\nomitted).    One such provision can be found in the 1978 Amendments\n\nto the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 1170.\n\n            Section 1170 replaced section 77(o) of the Bankruptcy\n\nAct, formerly codified at 11 U.S.C. § 205(o).                    The courts had\n\nconstrued the former section dealing with railroads in bankruptcy\n\nto require an STB determination of whether an abandonment of a\n\ndebtor's    rail    line   was   adverse     to   the   public   interest   as    a\n\nprerequisite       to   abandonment   in   bankruptcy.       E.g.,   Palmer      v.\n\nMassachusetts, 308 U.S. 79, 87-88 (1939). Palmer involved a direct\n\nabandonment by a debtor rail line of its own lines.                In an effort\n\nto streamline the process, Congress made it clear in enacting 11\n\nU.S.C. § 1170 that it wanted the bankruptcy court, not the STB, to\n\nmake the final determination of whether a debtor's rail lines could\n\nbe abandoned and the STB to play an advisory role, subject to time\n\nconstraints.       This would speed up the decisional process.\n\n            Importantly, the STB was not ousted of its exclusive\n\njurisdiction over all matters pertaining to bankrupt railroads.\n\nSee 11 U.S.C. § 1166 (\"Except with respect to abandonment under\n\nsection 1170 [and certain other situations]. . . the trustee and\n\nthe debtor are subject to the provisions of subtitle IV of title 49\n\n[the chapter authorizing the STB] that are applicable to railroads\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f.   .    .   .).      If,     for    example,    the       debtor   as   part   of   its\n\nreorganization plan wanted to \"construct an extension to any of its\n\nrailroad     lines,\"        \"construct   an     additional      railroad    line,\"    or\n\n\"provide transportation over . . . an extended or additional\n\nrailroad line,\" it would first have to apply to the STB for a\n\ncertificate authorizing such activity.                     See 49 U.S.C. § 10901.11\n\n              Under section 1170, the STB still plays an important\n\nadvisory role in the granting of permission for the abandonment of\n\na reorganizing debtor's rail lines.                  If the STB issues an advisory\n\nreport within         the    time    allowed    by    the    bankruptcy    court,    the\n\nbankruptcy court should consider the STB's report, but the STB's\n\nconclusions are not binding.             11 U.S.C. § 1170 (b),(c).\n\n              The    legislative      history     of   section      1170   illuminates\n\nCongress's intent in several ways.                     First, it identifies the\n\nregulatory         problem    that   needed     to    be    remedied.      Second,    it\n\nidentifies the type of problems suffered by debtor railroads which\n\nwere of concern.        Third, it focuses on which railroads' (debtor or\n\nnon-debtor) interests were of concern.                 Fourth, it emphasizes that\n\nother types of issues concerning a debtor's rail line remain within\n\nthe STB's exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n        11\n       Under 11 U.S.C. § 1166, after the STB grants the debtor the\nright to go forward with the rail line or service, the bankruptcy\ncourt must also approve the plan if these actions require \"the\nexpenditure . . . of money from the estate.\" 11 U.S.C. § 1166 (1).\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\f           In enacting section 1170, Congress was attempting to\n\nremedy    specific   problems   which   arose   from   the   judicial\n\ninterpretation of the old scheme.   The regulatory problem was that\n\nwhen the debtor was first required to go to the STB to seek the\n\nabandonment without any time limits for the STB decisions and then\n\ngo to the court, there was a delay.     The Senate Report states:\n\n           The incorporation of railroad reorganizations into the\n           general reorganization provisions of the bill eliminates\n           the cumbersome and duplicative procedure of section 77\n           under which plans of reorganization shuttled back and\n           forth between the [STB] and the courts and proceedings\n           were inevitably more time consuming and expensive. Under\n           the bill, the bankruptcy court, rather than the [STB],\n           assumes the primary responsibility for the reorganization\n           proceeding.\n\nS. Rep. No. 95-989, at 11-12 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n5787, 5797-98.   In turn, this delay exacerbated the cash drain12 on\n\na rail carrier operating a financially unsound line while waiting\n\nfor the STB to consider its application to abandon that line:\n\n           In the case of a railroad being administered under title\n           11, the necessity to stem the bankrupt carrier's cash\n           drain requires expeditious treatment of abandonment\n           applications. This subchapter provides that the court\n\n\n\n     12\n       The trustee says that its earlier three agreements with CN,\nreached in late March 2001, before the December 2001 bankruptcy,\nhave proven to be bad deals for BAR (now MM&A). The trustee argues\nthat the fees it is paid by CN are not as profitable as BAR would\nlike and so BAR has an interest in forcing CN to abandon its\nrights. This is also the sort of \"cash drain\" referred to in the\nlegislative history, he says. However, as Fraser points out, the\ntrustee does not say BAR is losing money from its operation under\nthe haulage agreement. He says only that BAR can make more money\nif CN had no rights.     BAR (now MM&A) essentially would have a\nmonopoly if CN were ousted and it could exercise monopoly pricing.\n\n                                -23-\n\f          rather than the [STB] has the authority to authorize\n          abandonments or discontinuances of rail services.\n\nH. Rep. No. 95-595, at 423 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n5963, 6379.   The legislative history makes it clear that Congress\n\nwas concerned with making the system for the abandonment of debtor\n\nrailroad’s rail lines quicker, more efficient, and less costly for\n\nthe debtor railroad.\n\n          The legislative history emphasizes that many of the\n\noperations of the debtor railroad remain within the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of the STB:\n\n          [S]ince a plan of reorganization for a railroad may\n          propose changes in transportation patterns or operation\n          by, among other things, granting operating rights over,\n          or transferring, the debtor's rail lines, the bill\n          retains the [STB's] jurisdiction with respect to such\n          proposals. The subchapter requires that such proposals\n          be referred to the [STB] for its approval, disapproval,\n          or modification and requires the reorganization court to\n          give binding effect to the [STB's] findings on such\n          aspects of a plan.\n\nS. Rep. No. 95-989, at 11 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n5787, 5797 (emphasis added). In referring to the powers that are\n\nexclusively retained by the STB, the legislative history says, \"the\n\ndebtor's rail lines,\" evidence that Congress's concern was for the\n\ndebtor's own lines,13 not those of a financially sound railroad.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n        The parties have essentially framed the    issue as if BAR\ncontinued to own the line and have not suggested   that the sale of\nthe line to MM&A moots the matter. As the sale      of the line was\npart of the reorganization plan, this treatment     is a reasonable\nposition and we do not look behind it.\n\n                               -24-\n\f            Against this backdrop, there is little reason to think\n\nCongress intended, by using the word \"abandonment\" in section 1170\n\nto include \"adverse abandonment\" by a debtor railroad, to oust a\n\nthird party from rights in the debtor's own lines, and thus\n\nsilently strip the STB of its exclusive jurisdiction over the\n\nabandonment of a non-debtor’s lines or trackage rights.14\n\n            In addition to being at odds with the expressed intent of\n\nCongress, the trustee's interpretation would create a new set of\n\nproblems.     Included   among   those   problems   is   the   creation   of\n\nfinancial incentives for bankrupt railroads to attempt to disrupt\n\nthe operation of other healthy railroads.       This is against public\n\npolicy.   Congress surely did not intend to create a bounty system,\n\nas here, that allows debtors in bankruptcy to sell their lines to\n\na non-debtor and then use bankruptcy courts, not the STB, to\n\neliminate competition between other non-debtor rail carriers.\n\n            Finally, to the extent the STB has spoken on this issue,\n\nwe give some15 weight to what it has said.      In an advisory opinion\n\n\n     14\n       In the alternative, the trustee, in his reply brief and at\noral argument, argued a narrower interpretation of the statute.\nThe trustee’s interpretation would limit the bankruptcy court's\nreach, but still allow this court to grant the relief that the\ntrustee seeks. He proposes allowing the bankruptcy court authority\nover abandonments of a non-debtor's rail lines and trackage rights\nin situations in which the debtor has a property or contract\ninterest   in  the   non-debtor's   lines   or  trackage   rights.\nSignificantly, the interpretation resolves none of the problems\ndiscussed in this opinion, and we reject it.\n     15\n        We emphasize the word \"some.\"   The agency issued its\ninterpretation as an advisory opinion to the bankruptcy court\n\n                                  -25-\n\fto the bankruptcy court, Chicago, Rock Island & Pac. R.R. Co., 363\n\nI.C.C. 150, 171 (1980), the STB stated that the bankruptcy court\n\ncannot abandon or discontinue lines jointly owned by debtor and a\n\nfinancially healthy company.       The STB noted that the only way for\n\nthese lines to be abandoned is through an application to the STB,\n\npursuant   to   49   U.S.C.   §   10903.     This   holding   obviously   is\n\nconsistent with our disposition here.\n\n           It follows not only that the bankruptcy court had no\n\npower to approve the adverse abandonment and discontinuance sought\n\nby the trustee here, but also that the STB had power to issue a\n\nbinding final order in this case.          No attack on the merits of the\n\nSTB's decision having been made by the trustee, such an attack has\n\nbeen waived. We affirm the district court's dismissal of Count III\n\nof the trustee's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which\n\nrelief can be granted.    We affirm the STB’s final order denying the\n\ntrustee's application to adversely discontinue and abandon the\n\ntrackage rights and easement of CN.        So ordered.   Costs are awarded\n\nto CN and Fraser.\n\n\n\n\npursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1170(b). An advisory opinion, as opposed\nto the final order issued under section 10903, does not have the\nforce of law and indeed is not binding on the bankruptcy court.\nSee Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576 (2000).\n\n                                    -26-\n\f",

This appears to be an issue of first impression in the courts of appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1170, which resulted from the 1978 Bankruptcy Code Amendments, is an exception to the normal rule that only the Surface Transportation Board (STB), the successor to the earlier Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), has jurisdiction to authorize the abandonment of rail lines or the discontinuance of operations over any part of a rail line. <i>See</i> 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. In the section 1170 abandonment process, the STB still plays a role, but it is an advisory one. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170(b), (c). Outside of the context of a bankrupt railroad, in order to achieve an abandonment or a discontinuance, rail carriers must apply to the STB for permission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A discussion of some of the parlance of federal railroad regulation is helpful. Generally, when a rail carrier or a third party wishes to \"abandon\" its own rail line, it must seek permission from the STB. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. If a rail carrier is operating rail transportation over its own line or over the line of another by the grant of independent trackage rights, it must seek permission from the STB to \"discontinue\" the service. <i>Id.</i> The STB's authority and the standards governing its decisions are the same regardless of whether it is granting an abandonment or a discontinuance. <i>See Id.</i> &#167; 10903(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903, this application can be brought to the STB by the rail carrier itself or, in a more unusual circumstance, by a third party. <i>See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. I.C.C.,</i> 29 F.3d 706, 708-09 (D.C.Cir.1994). If the rail carrier applies to abandon or discontinue its own lines or service, the application is for an \"abandonment\" or \"discontinuance\" (what we will call a \"direct\" abandonment or discontinuance for purposes of clarity). By contrast, if a third party applies to abandon or discontinue the lines or services of another rail carrier in an STB proceeding, it is called an \"adverse\" abandonment or discontinuance. <i>Id.</i> The STB can grant an adverse abandonment or discontinuance on a third party's petition even if the owner of the line or the trackage rights objects. The text of section 10903 itself does not distinguish between adverse and direct abandonments, but the case law makes it clear that the STB has authority to hear both types of applications. <i>Thompson v. Texas Mexican Ry. Co.,</i> 328 U.S. 134, 145, 66 S.Ct. 937, 90 L.Ed. 1132 (1946)(\"There is no requirement ... that the application [for abandonment to the STB] be made by the carrier whose operations are sought to be abandoned.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the debtor railroad through its trustee seeks to adversely abandon not its own interest, but the interests of a third party in an easement and trackage rights over lines once owned by the debtor at the time of bankruptcy. The rub is that it seeks to do so in the bankruptcy court, not before the STB. The district court held that the statutory language in section 1170, giving the bankruptcy court authority over abandonments of rail lines, does not include the authority to grant adverse abandonments of a non-debtor's trackage or other rights. The plaintiff/trustee in bankruptcy appeals this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's dismissal of Count III of the trustee's complaint. In doing so, we hold that the bankruptcy court does not have the authority under section 1170 to adversely abandon the lines or trackage rights of a non-debtor, on the petition of a debtor railroad who owned those lines at the time of bankruptcy. Such authority lies, instead, within the jurisdiction of the STB under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. We also affirm the decision of the STB under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903 denying permission for the relief the trustee seeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2001, Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad Company (BAR) and Canadian National (CN) (which includes Canadian National Railway Company (CNR) and its subsidiary, Waterloo Railway Company (Waterloo)) entered into a series of pre-bankruptcy agreements involving the movement of rail cars over the Madawaska rail line. At the time of the agreements, BAR and its wholly owned subsidiary, Van Buren Bridge Company (VBBC), owned this line. The Madawaska line runs from the Fraser paper mill in Madawaska, Maine, to an interchange with a CN line at St. Leonard, New Brunswick, Canada. In exchange for the rights granted under the agreements, CN paid BAR five million dollars in cash. The first agreement between the two parties was a Junction Settlement Agreement, under which BAR agreed to move CN's railcars over BAR's Madawaska line, between the connection with CN's rail lines at St. Leonard and the Fraser paper mill.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> CN agreed to pay BAR a specified per-car price for performing these haulage services and has done so. The parties also entered into a Trackage Rights Agreement. Under this agreement, CNR acquired limited local trackage rights which allowed it to run its own trains over the Madawaska line to the Fraser paper mill. Finally, in a third agreement BAR granted Waterloo a non-exclusive freight easement, under which Waterloo could also operate its trains over the line. It is the last two agreements which the trustee seeks to undo here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The STB approved the Trackage Rights and Easement Agreements on an application by CN on March 21, 2001. Since this time, CN has not itself used its own trackage rights or the easement; instead it has relied on the haulage agreement to service the Fraser mill, and pays BAR a fee for its services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 15, 2001, certain creditors filed an involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding against BAR. In December 2001, the bankruptcy court entered an order for relief under Chapter 11. It appointed James Howard as trustee in bankruptcy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As part of the bankruptcy plan, Montreal, Maine &amp; Atlantic Railway LTD (MM &amp; A) acquired the Madawaska line and other BAR rail assets from the trustee in January 2003. The effect of the agreement between MM &amp; A and BAR is that the trustee no longer has ownership rights as to the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also what we suspect was an unusual arrangement in a part of the acquisition agreement: MM &amp; A agreed to pay BAR five million dollars if BAR successfully removed CN from the Madawaska line prior to January 1, 2005. The trustee's sole remaining interest in the line is the potential five million dollar payout from MM &amp; A. As a result, BAR had a financial incentive to attempt to oust CN from the Madawaska line, although it no longer owns the line. CN, of course, had no interest in abandoning any of its rights in that line (which it recently had paid five million dollars to BAR to acquire).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2002, the trustee filed a motion in bankruptcy court to reject the Junction Settlement Agreement, the Trackage Rights Agreement, and the easement as executory contracts under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 365. The trustee initially acknowledged that the elimination of CN's trackage rights and easement was subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the STB, but later changed his position on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2002, the bankruptcy court stayed the proceedings pending action by the STB on appropriate requests for relief by the trustee to the STB. With the STB, the trustee filed a petition to \"revoke\" CN's trackage and easement rights, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10502(d). This effort was unsuccessful, and the STB explained that because CN's trackage and easement rights were \"authorized by the agency, [they] will remain in effect until discontinuance authority is granted [under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903].\" <i>Canadian Nat'l Ry. Co.,</i> STB Finance Docket No. 34014, 2002 WL 1365812 at *6 (STB June 25, 2002). Basically, the STB said the trustee had used the wrong procedural vehicle. The STB also said that even if it were to construe a petition to revoke as a request for adverse discontinuance under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903 (the correct vehicle), there was no basis in the record to grant such a request. <i>Id.</i> at *7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the STB's rejection of the trustee's petition to revoke, the bankruptcy court extended the stay of the proceedings, pending the trustee's completion of the adverse abandonment proceedings before the STB under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee then switched tracks (metaphorically). On April 16, 2003, the trustee asserted for the first time in bankruptcy court that the STB did not have final authority over the forced abandonment of CN's rights, and that the bankruptcy court could unilaterally oust CN from the line pursuant to its authority under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170. It is apparent that the trustee calculated, rightly or wrongly, that he was more likely to get the five million dollar payment from MM &amp; A by being in bankruptcy court on the adverse abandonment issue, rather than before the STB.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 7, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an oral order that lifted the stay on the proceedings and converted the matter to an adversary proceeding. The trustee filed his complaint in the adversary proceedings against CN on June 17, 2003. Count III of the complaint sought an order from the bankruptcy court authorizing the discontinuance of CN's trackage rights and the abandonment of CN's easement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a telephone conference with the parties, the bankruptcy court issued a procedural order dated June 19, 2003. The court stated that it was uncertain whether BAR's efforts \"not to discontinue its own existing service over a portion of a rail line, but ... to `adversely abandon' [CN's] rights to use [BAR's] tracks\" were within the scope of a bankruptcy court's power under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170. On June 25, 2003, CN filed an unopposed motion to withdraw reference of the adversary proceeding to the bankruptcy court. The motion was granted on June 30, 2003, and all further proceedings took place in the federal district court of Maine. On July 22, 2003, CN moved to dismiss the trustee's complaint, arguing that the bankruptcy court had no authority to issue adverse abandonments of a non-debtor's lines under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge issued a recommended decision that section 1170 of the Bankruptcy Code did not apply to the trustee's efforts to remove CN from the Madawaska Line, and that the relief sought by the trustee could only be obtained if the STB granted the adverse abandonment pursuant to section 10903. The decision concluded that the plain language of the statute did not determine its meaning and that recourse to the legislative history was appropriate. The magistrate judge concluded that the legislative history made it \"reasonably clear that in enacting section 1170 Congress was concerned with streamlining and accelerating the process of abandonment or discontinuance of a cash-strapped debtor's own rail lines,\" not the lines of non-debtors. This interpretation was further supported by the STB's decision in <i>Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pac. R.R. Co.,</i> 1980 WL 14092, 363 I.C.C. 150 (1980), which the magistrate judge found \"reasonably ... construed sections 10903 and 1170, in tandem, to preserve [the STB's] power ... to adjudicate an adverse-abandonment petition filed by a debtor railroad.\" Finally, the magistrate judge concluded that the language used by Congress in enacting different legislation in 1979 which applied section 1170 to the then-pending Milwaukee Railroad restructuring supported an interpretation limiting the abandonment authority of the bankruptcy court to the debtor's own lines. In this legislation, Congress stated, \"the bankruptcy court may authorize the abandonment of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad pursuant to section 1170 of Title 11.\" 45 U.S.C. &#167; 904(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 18, 2003, the district court agreed with the decision of the magistrate judge and adopted its reasoning. The district court's order granted CN's motion to dismiss Count III of the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P. It also deferred adjudication of the motion as it pertained to the remaining counts of the trustee's complaint pending the STB's disposition on the trustee's adverse discontinuance application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, the trustee had filed on October 6, 2003, an application with the STB for the abandonment of CN's trackage rights and easement over the Madawaska line. This was essentially an application for an adverse abandonment under section 10903; but the trustee noted that his position was that if the final authority was in the bankruptcy court under section 1170, then the STB's opinion should be viewed only as an advisory opinion as permitted by section 1170. From the perspective of the STB, whether it is acting in an advisory capacity or as the final authority, the substantive standards for the two determinations are the same. Treating it as a matter under section 10903, the STB on April 30, 2004, denied the application because it found the trustee had failed to meet its burden of showing that the \"public convenience and necessity\" required the ouster of CN from the Madawaska line. <i>Waterloo Ry. Co.,</i> STB Docket No. AB-124, 2004 WL 941227, at *1 (STB April 30, 2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The STB determined that the public is best served by allowing CN to remain on the Madawaska line. In coming to its conclusion, the STB balanced the competing benefits and burdens on all interested parties. One such interested party was Fraser Papers. Fraser Papers had intervened in and opposed the trustee's abandonment action before the STB. Fraser stressed that in the past its mill at Madawaska, Maine, had been served only by BAR and that in late 2000 it had expressed strong concern to CN that BAR's financial condition<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> was deteriorating and that a consequent loss of rail service would likely result in a shutdown of the Madawaska mill. Fraser said that the Madawaska mill is highly interdependent with another mill in Edmundston, New Brunswick, Canada. If the Madawaska mill were shut down, the Edmundston mill would be shut down as well, depriving 1600 employees of work and depriving Fraser of 8.5 million dollars in revenue per week. The STB agreed that the loss of competitive rail service would be a detriment to Fraser and perhaps would impact the economic development and well-being of communities and rural areas near the mill. <i>Id.</i> at *4-*5, *8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it was not required by statute to do so, the STB also considered the needs of BAR's creditors, the benefits to the bankrupt estate, and the fairness of the arrangement to the parties involved. <i>Id.</i> at *5-*8, *8-*9. The STB found that the trackage rights obligation between CN and BAR (and now honored by MM &amp; A) in March 2001 was fair and entered into at arm's length. It also determined that the retention of CN on the Madawaska line would not affect MM &amp; A's survival or cause the abandonment of other MM &amp; A line segments. The Board ultimately determined that the interests of the bankrupt estate did not \"justify stripping CN of its right to provide competitive rail service to Fraser or depriving Fraser of its right to receive that service.\" <i>Id.</i> at * 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The STB rejected challenges made to the standing of the trustee in light of the sale of the line by BAR to MM &amp; A. <i>Id.</i> at *3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> No party challenges that determination on appeal. After the STB issued its decision, the trustee filed in court a consented to motion for the voluntary dismissal of the remaining counts of the trustee's complaint without prejudice, pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P. On June 3, 2004, the district court granted the voluntary dismissal without prejudice as to the remaining counts of the trustee's complaint and entered a separate and final judgment in CN's favor, pursuant to Rule 58(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. The trustee timely appealed the dismissal of Count III to this Court in No. 04-1819. Fraser has intervened and has filed a brief in this court in support of affirmance of the district court's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In No. 04-1800, the trustee also timely petitioned this court for review of the STB's order denying the trustee's application for discontinuance and abandonment. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2321. Both Fraser and CN have intervened in this matter. The trustee argues that the STB had no jurisdiction to issue a binding decision under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903 and that it could only issue an advisory report under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170. The trustee does not attack the merits of the STB's decision. In response, the STB has also filed a brief, pointing out that it had been made a party only in appeal No. 04-1800, and that the issue of whether section 1170 applied was an issue only in appeal No. 04-1819. The STB says that whatever the outcome of that question, the trustee has waived any argument addressed to the merits of the STB's determination. The STB asks that we affirm the Board's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of the dismissal of a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is <i>de novo.

The relevant parts of section 1170 provide as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) The court, after notice and a hearing, may authorize the abandonment of all or a portion of a railroad line if such abandonment is &#8212; (1)(A) in the best interest of the estate; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) essential to the formulation of a plan; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) consistent with the public interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b)If ... such abandonment would require approval by the [STB] under law of the United States, the trustee shall initiate an appropriate application for such abandonment with the [STB]. The court may fix a time within which the [STB] shall report to the court on such application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) After the court receives the report of the [STB], or the expiration of the time fixed under subsection (b) of this section, whichever occurs first, the court may authorize such abandonment, after notice to the [STB], the Secretary of Transportation, the trustee, any party in interest that has requested notice, any affected shipper or community, and any other entity prescribed by the court, and a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170. The trustee argues that section 1170 is not limited to abandonment of the debtor's own operations and that the phrase \"all or a portion of a rail line\" shows that the term \"abandonment\" is not so limited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, BAR's argument does not rely on the plain text of section 1170, but requires reference to a prior judicial construction of section 10903. The relevant parts of that section, in turn, provide:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) abandon any part of its railroad lines; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) discontinue the operation of all rail transportation over any part of its railroad lines;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">only if the Board finds that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. BAR's argument is that the term \"abandonment\" as used in section 10903 has been construed by both the agency and the courts to include adverse abandonment. <i>See Consolidated Rail Corp.,</i> 29 F.3d at 708-09. From this, the trustee argues that Congress was aware of the construction of \"abandonment\" in section 10903 and is presumed to have adopted that construction in section 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also argues that his reading of section 1170 is sensible and would not have improper effects on third parties. The trustee says first that concerns about non-debtor railroads are irrelevant because any consequences to them are exactly what Congress intended, as the plain text demonstrates. Further, the trustee points out that section 1170 requires the court to consult the STB and consider the public interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> That is enough, the trustee says, to allay any untoward effects on third parties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed the trustee attacks the district court ruling itself as leading to untoward results. The trustee argues, for example, that if the debtor wants to abandon its own underlying rail lines, the bankruptcy court could not grant this abandonment until the debtor first sought an application with the STB to discontinue the overlying trackage rights of a non-debtor. <i>See Mo. Pac. R.R. Co.,</i> 1993 WL 499802, 9 I.C.C.2d 1228, 1230 (1993) (An \"abandonment may not be consummated until [the rail carrier with trackage rights'] discontinuance has been authorized and interested persons are given an opportunity to seek imposition of trail use and public use conditions.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the trustee argues that legislative history should not be considered, but that if it is, it supports the trustee's interpretation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> We take each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meaning of the term \"abandonment\" as it is used in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170 is not self-evident and cannot be resolved on textual plain meaning grounds. One cannot tell by reading the term \"abandonment\" in section 1170 whether the term includes \"adverse abandonment.\" Nor can one tell whether this is so simply from the fact that the term \"abandonment\" in section 10903 has been construed to include adverse abandonments as well. In determining what the statute means, we cannot simply rely on a few phrases in a complicated statutory structure. Section 1170 must be read in the context of what Congress was trying to do when it gave the bankruptcy court abandonment authority over a debtor railroad in bankruptcy. Both that context and the legislative history lead us to reject the trustee's interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In designing the statutory scheme, Congress set up an interplay between 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170 and 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. Under section 10903, the STB is the regulatory board charged with implementing overall Congressional rail transportation policy. Rail carriers are subject to the jurisdiction of the STB, and when a rail carrier intends to abandon its underlying rail lines or discontinue rail transportation or trackage rights over a line, it must seek permission by filing an application with the STB. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. Generally, the STB's authority over abandonment of rail lines is exclusive and plenary. <i>Chicago &amp; N.W. Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick &amp; Tile Co.,</i> 450 U.S. 311, 321-23, 101 S.Ct. 1124, 67 L.Ed.2d 258 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One exception to this exclusive STB authority is the abandonment of rail lines when a debtor railroad is in bankruptcy. Congress designed special provisions in those limited circumstances for railroad reorganization that attempted to allow the railroad to emerge as \"a living, not a dying, ... enterprise.\" <i>See New Haven Inclusion Cases,</i> 399 U.S. 392, 431, 90 S.Ct. 2054, 26 L.Ed.2d 691 (1970)(internal quotations omitted). One such provision can be found in the 1978 Amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1170 replaced section 77(<i>o</i>) of the Bankruptcy Act, formerly codified at 11 U.S.C. &#167; 205(<i>o</i>). The courts had construed the former section dealing with railroads in bankruptcy to require an STB determination of whether an abandonment of a debtor's rail line was adverse to the public interest as a prerequisite to abandonment in bankruptcy. <i>E.g., Palmer v. Massachusetts,</i> 308 U.S. 79, 87-88, 60 S.Ct. 34, 84 L.Ed. 93 (1939). <i>Palmer</i> involved a direct abandonment by a debtor rail line of its own lines. In an effort to streamline the process, Congress made it clear in enacting 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170 that it wanted the bankruptcy court, not the STB, to make the final determination of whether a debtor's rail lines could be <i>abandoned</i> and the STB to play an advisory role, subject to time constraints. This would speed up the decisional process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, the STB was not ousted of its exclusive jurisdiction over <i>all</i> matters pertaining to bankrupt railroads. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1166 (\"Except with respect to abandonment under section 1170\" [and certain other situations]... the trustee and the debtor are subject to the provisions of subtitle IV of title 49 [the chapter authorizing the STB] that are applicable to railroads....). If, for example, the debtor as part of its reorganization plan wanted to \"construct an extension to any of its railroad lines,\" \"construct an additional railroad line,\" or \"provide transportation over... an extended or additional railroad line,\" it would first have to apply to the STB for a certificate authorizing such activity. <i>See</i> 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10901.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 1170, the STB still plays an important advisory role in the granting of permission for the abandonment of a reorganizing debtor's rail lines. If the STB issues an advisory report within the time allowed by the bankruptcy court, the bankruptcy court should consider the STB's report, but the STB's conclusions are not binding. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170(b), (c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of section 1170 illuminates Congress's intent in several ways. First, it identifies the regulatory problem that needed to be remedied. Second, it identifies the type of problems suffered by debtor railroads which were of concern. Third, it focuses on which railroads' (debtor or non-debtor) interests were of concern. Fourth, it emphasizes that other types of issues concerning a debtor's rail line remain within the STB's exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In enacting section 1170, Congress was attempting to remedy specific problems which arose from the judicial interpretation of the old scheme. The regulatory problem was that when the debtor was first required to go to the STB to seek the abandonment without any time limits for the STB decisions and then go to the court, there was a delay. The Senate Report states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incorporation of railroad reorganizations into the general reorganization provisions of the bill eliminates the cumbersome and duplicative procedure of section 77 under which plans of reorganization shuttled back and forth between the [STB] and the courts and proceedings were inevitably more time consuming and expensive. Under the bill, the bankruptcy court, rather than the [STB], assumes the primary responsibility for the reorganization proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 95-989, at 11-12 (1978), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5797-98. In turn, this delay exacerbated the cash drain<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> on a rail carrier operating a financially unsound line while waiting for the STB to consider its application to abandon that line:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of a railroad being administered under title 11, the necessity to stem the bankrupt carrier's cash drain requires expeditious treatment of abandonment applications.

Rep. No. 95-595, at 423 (1978), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6379. The legislative history makes it clear that Congress was concerned with making the system for the abandonment of debtor railroad's rail lines quicker, more efficient, and less costly for the debtor railroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history emphasizes that many of the operations of the debtor railroad remain within the exclusive jurisdiction of the STB:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[S]ince a plan of reorganization for a railroad may propose changes in transportation patterns or operation by, among other things, granting operating rights over, or transferring, <i>the debtor's rail lines,</i> the bill retains the [STB's] jurisdiction with respect to such proposals. The subchapter requires that such proposals be referred to the [STB] for its approval, disapproval, or modification and requires the reorganization court to give binding effect to the [STB's] findings on such aspects of a plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 95-989, at 11 (1978), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5797 (emphasis added). In referring to the powers that are exclusively retained by the STB, the legislative history says, \"<i>the debtor's rail lines,</i>\" evidence that Congress's concern was for the debtor's own lines,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> not those of a financially sound railroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, there is little reason to think Congress intended, by using the word \"abandonment\" in section 1170 to include \"adverse abandonment\" by a debtor railroad, to oust a third party from rights in the debtor's own lines, and thus silently strip the STB of its exclusive jurisdiction over the abandonment of a non-debtor's lines or trackage rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to being at odds with the expressed intent of Congress, the trustee's interpretation would create a new set of problems. Included among those problems is the creation of financial incentives for bankrupt railroads to attempt to disrupt the operation of other healthy railroads. This is against public policy. Congress surely did not intend to create a bounty system, as here, that allows debtors in bankruptcy to sell their lines to a non-debtor and then use bankruptcy courts, not the STB, to eliminate competition between other non-debtor rail carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, to the extent the STB has spoken on this issue, we give some<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> weight to what it has said. In an advisory opinion to the bankruptcy court, <i>Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pac. R.R. Co.,</i> 1980 WL 14092, 363 I.C.C. 150, 171 (1980), the STB stated that the bankruptcy court cannot abandon or discontinue lines jointly owned by debtor and a financially healthy company. The STB noted that the only way for these lines to be abandoned is through an application to the STB, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. This holding obviously is consistent with our disposition here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows not only that the bankruptcy court had no power to approve the adverse abandonment and discontinuance sought by the trustee here, but also that the STB had power to issue a binding final order in this case. No attack on the merits of the STB's decision having been made by the trustee, such an attack has been waived. We <i>affirm</i> the district court's dismissal of Count III of the trustee's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. We <i>affirm</i> the STB's final order denying the trustee's application to adversely discontinue and abandon the trackage rights and easement of CN. So ordered.

Also, the bankruptcy court included, upon the request of CN, a provision in its October 9, 2002 order approving the sale of BAR's estate assets to MM &amp; A that expressly reserved \"all rights and obligations of the parties to the CN Junction Settlement Agreement, the CN Trackage Rights Agreement, and the Waterloo Easement ... subject to further ruling by this Court or any other court of competent jurisdiction.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The language of section 1170 refers only to \"abandonments.\" As CN points out, an \"abandonment\" is distinct from a \"discontinuance.\"<i>See</i> 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903(d).

However, as Fraser points out, the trustee does not say BAR is losing money from its operation under the haulage agreement. He says only that BAR can make more money if CN had no rights. BAR (now MM &amp; A) essentially would have a monopoly if CN were ousted and it could exercise monopoly pricing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The parties have essentially framed the issue as if BAR continued to own the line and have not suggested that the sale of the line to MM &amp; A moots the matter.

The trustee's interpretation would limit the bankruptcy court's reach, but still allow this court to grant the relief that the trustee seeks. He proposes allowing the bankruptcy court authority over abandonments of a non-debtor's rail lines and trackage rights in situations in which the debtor has a property or contract interest in the non-debtor's lines or trackage rights.

This appears to be an issue of first impression in the courts of appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1170, which resulted from the 1978 Bankruptcy Code Amendments, is an exception to the normal rule that only the Surface Transportation Board (STB), the successor to the earlier Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), has jurisdiction to authorize the abandonment of rail lines or the discontinuance of operations over any part of a rail line. <i>See</i> 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. In the section 1170 abandonment process, the STB still plays a role, but it is an advisory one. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170(b), (c). Outside of the context of a bankrupt railroad, in order to achieve an abandonment or a discontinuance, rail carriers must apply to the STB for permission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A discussion of some of the parlance of federal railroad regulation is helpful. Generally, when a rail carrier or a third party wishes to \"abandon\" its own rail line, it must seek permission from the STB. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. If a rail carrier is operating rail transportation over its own line or over the line of another by the grant of independent trackage rights, it must seek permission from the STB to \"discontinue\" the service. <i>Id.</i> The STB's authority and the standards governing its decisions are the same regardless of whether it is granting an abandonment or a discontinuance. <i>See Id.</i> &#167; 10903(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903, this application can be brought to the STB by the rail carrier itself or, in a more unusual circumstance, by a third party. <i>See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. I.C.C.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674588\"><a href=\"/opinion/674588/consolidated-rail-corporation-v-interstate-commerce-commission-and-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 708-09 (D.C.Cir.1994). If the rail carrier applies to abandon or discontinue its own lines or service, the application is for an \"abandonment\" or \"discontinuance\" (what we will call a \"direct\" abandonment or discontinuance for purposes of clarity). By contrast, if a third party applies to abandon or discontinue the lines or services of another rail carrier in an STB proceeding, it is called an \"adverse\" abandonment or discontinuance. <i>Id.</i> The STB can grant an adverse abandonment or discontinuance on a third party's petition even if the owner of the line or the trackage rights objects. The text of section 10903 itself does not distinguish between adverse and direct abandonments, but the case law makes it clear that the STB has authority to hear both types of applications. <i>Thompson v.

The rub is that it seeks to do so in the bankruptcy court, not before the STB. The district court held that the statutory language in section 1170, giving the bankruptcy court authority over abandonments of rail lines, does not include the authority to grant adverse abandonments of a non-debtor's trackage or other rights. The plaintiff/trustee in bankruptcy appeals this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's dismissal of Count III of the trustee's complaint. In doing so, we hold that the bankruptcy court does not have the authority under section 1170 to adversely abandon the lines or trackage rights of a non-debtor, on the petition of a debtor railroad who owned those lines at the time of bankruptcy. Such authority lies, instead, within the jurisdiction of the STB under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. We also affirm the decision of the STB under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903 denying permission for the relief the trustee seeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2001, Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad Company (BAR) and Canadian National (CN) (which includes Canadian National Railway Company (CNR) and its subsidiary, Waterloo Railway Company (Waterloo)) entered into a series of pre-bankruptcy agreements involving the movement of rail cars over the Madawaska rail line. At the time of the agreements, BAR and its wholly owned subsidiary, Van Buren Bridge Company (VBBC), owned this line. The Madawaska line runs from the Fraser paper mill in Madawaska, Maine, to an interchange with a CN line at St. Leonard, New Brunswick, Canada. In exchange for the rights granted under the agreements, CN paid BAR five million dollars in cash. The first agreement between the two parties was a Junction Settlement Agreement, under which BAR agreed to move CN's railcars over BAR's Madawaska line, between the connection with CN's rail lines at St. Leonard and the Fraser paper mill.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> CN agreed to pay BAR a specified per-car price for performing these haulage services and has done so. The parties also entered into a Trackage Rights Agreement. Under this agreement, CNR acquired limited local trackage rights which allowed it to run its own trains over the Madawaska line to the Fraser paper mill. Finally, in a third agreement BAR granted Waterloo a non-exclusive freight easement, under which Waterloo could also operate its trains over the line. It is the last two agreements which the trustee seeks to undo here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The STB approved the Trackage Rights and Easement Agreements on an application by CN on March 21, 2001. Since this time, CN has not itself used its own trackage rights or the easement; instead it has relied on the haulage agreement to service the Fraser mill, and pays BAR a fee for its services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 15, 2001, certain creditors filed an involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding against BAR. In December 2001, the bankruptcy court entered an order for relief under Chapter 11. It appointed James Howard as trustee in bankruptcy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As part of the bankruptcy plan, Montreal, Maine &amp; Atlantic Railway LTD (MM &amp; A) acquired the Madawaska line and other BAR rail assets from the trustee in January 2003. The effect of the agreement between MM &amp; A and BAR is that the trustee no longer has ownership rights as to the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also what we suspect was an unusual arrangement in a part of the acquisition agreement: MM &amp; A agreed to pay BAR five million dollars if BAR successfully removed CN from the Madawaska line prior to January 1, 2005. The trustee's sole remaining interest in the line is the potential five million dollar payout from MM &amp; A. As a result, BAR had a financial incentive to attempt to oust CN from the Madawaska line, although it no longer owns the line. CN, of course, had no interest in abandoning any of its rights in that line (which it recently had paid five million dollars to BAR to acquire).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2002, the trustee filed a motion in bankruptcy court to reject the Junction Settlement Agreement, the Trackage Rights Agreement, and the easement as executory contracts under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 365. The trustee initially acknowledged that the elimination of CN's trackage rights and easement was subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the STB, but later changed his position on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2002, the bankruptcy court stayed the proceedings pending action by the STB on appropriate requests for relief by the trustee to the STB. With the STB, the trustee filed a petition to \"revoke\" CN's trackage and easement rights, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10502(d). This effort was unsuccessful, and the STB explained that because CN's trackage and easement rights were \"authorized by the agency, [they] will remain in effect until discontinuance authority is granted [under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903].\" <i>Canadian Nat'l Ry. Co.,</i> STB Finance Docket No. 34014, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1365812</span></span> at *6 (STB June 25, 2002). Basically, the STB said the trustee had used the wrong procedural vehicle. The STB also said that even if it were to construe a petition to revoke as a request for adverse discontinuance under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903 (the correct vehicle), there was no basis in the record to grant such a request. <i>Id.</i> at *7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the STB's rejection of the trustee's petition to revoke, the bankruptcy court extended the stay of the proceedings, pending the trustee's completion of the adverse abandonment proceedings before the STB under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee then switched tracks (metaphorically). On April 16, 2003, the trustee asserted for the first time in bankruptcy court that the STB did not have final authority over the forced abandonment of CN's rights, and that the bankruptcy court could unilaterally oust CN from the line pursuant to its authority under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170. It is apparent that the trustee calculated, rightly or wrongly, that he was more likely to get the five million dollar payment from MM &amp; A by being in bankruptcy court on the adverse abandonment issue, rather than before the STB.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 7, 2003, the bankruptcy court issued an oral order that lifted the stay on the proceedings and converted the matter to an adversary proceeding. The trustee filed his complaint in the adversary proceedings against CN on June 17, 2003. Count III of the complaint sought an order from the bankruptcy court authorizing the discontinuance of CN's trackage rights and the abandonment of CN's easement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a telephone conference with the parties, the bankruptcy court issued a procedural order dated June 19, 2003. The court stated that it was uncertain whether BAR's efforts \"not to discontinue its own existing service over a portion of a rail line, but ... to `adversely abandon' [CN's] rights to use [BAR's] tracks\" were within the scope of a bankruptcy court's power under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170. On June 25, 2003, CN filed an unopposed motion to withdraw reference of the adversary proceeding to the bankruptcy court. The motion was granted on June 30, 2003, and all further proceedings took place in the federal district court of Maine. On July 22, 2003, CN moved to dismiss the trustee's complaint, arguing that the bankruptcy court had no authority to issue adverse abandonments of a non-debtor's lines under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge issued a recommended decision that section 1170 of the Bankruptcy Code did not apply to the trustee's efforts to remove CN from the Madawaska Line, and that the relief sought by the trustee could only be obtained if the STB granted the adverse abandonment pursuant to section 10903. The decision concluded that the plain language of the statute did not determine its meaning and that recourse to the legislative history was appropriate. The magistrate judge concluded that the legislative history made it \"reasonably clear that in enacting section 1170 Congress was concerned with streamlining and accelerating the process of abandonment or discontinuance of a cash-strapped debtor's own rail lines,\" not the lines of non-debtors. This interpretation was further supported by the STB's decision in <i>Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pac. R.R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">14092</span></span>, 363 I.C.C. 150 (1980), which the magistrate judge found \"reasonably ... construed sections 10903 and 1170, in tandem, to preserve [the STB's] power ... to adjudicate an adverse-abandonment petition filed by a debtor railroad.\" Finally, the magistrate judge concluded that the language used by Congress in enacting different legislation in 1979 which applied section 1170 to the then-pending Milwaukee Railroad restructuring supported an interpretation limiting the abandonment authority of the bankruptcy court to the debtor's own lines. In this legislation, Congress stated, \"the bankruptcy court may authorize the abandonment of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad pursuant to section 1170 of Title 11.\" 45 U.S.C. &#167; 904(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 18, 2003, the district court agreed with the decision of the magistrate judge and adopted its reasoning. The district court's order granted CN's motion to dismiss Count III of the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P. It also deferred adjudication of the motion as it pertained to the remaining counts of the trustee's complaint pending the STB's disposition on the trustee's adverse discontinuance application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, the trustee had filed on October 6, 2003, an application with the STB for the abandonment of CN's trackage rights and easement over the Madawaska line. This was essentially an application for an adverse abandonment under section 10903; but the trustee noted that his position was that if the final authority was in the bankruptcy court under section 1170, then the STB's opinion should be viewed only as an advisory opinion as permitted by section 1170. From the perspective of the STB, whether it is acting in an advisory capacity or as the final authority, the substantive standards for the two determinations are the same. Treating it as a matter under section 10903, the STB on April 30, 2004, denied the application because it found the trustee had failed to meet its burden of showing that the \"public convenience and necessity\" required the ouster of CN from the Madawaska line. <i>Waterloo Ry. Co.,</i> STB Docket No. AB-124, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">941227</span></span>, at *1 (STB April 30, 2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The STB determined that the public is best served by allowing CN to remain on the Madawaska line. In coming to its conclusion, the STB balanced the competing benefits and burdens on all interested parties. One such interested party was Fraser Papers. Fraser Papers had intervened in and opposed the trustee's abandonment action before the STB. Fraser stressed that in the past its mill at Madawaska, Maine, had been served only by BAR and that in late 2000 it had expressed strong concern to CN that BAR's financial condition<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> was deteriorating and that a consequent loss of rail service would likely result in a shutdown of the Madawaska mill. Fraser said that the Madawaska mill is highly interdependent with another mill in Edmundston, New Brunswick, Canada. If the Madawaska mill were shut down, the Edmundston mill would be shut down as well, depriving 1600 employees of work and depriving Fraser of 8.5 million dollars in revenue per week. The STB agreed that the loss of competitive rail service would be a detriment to Fraser and perhaps would impact the economic development and well-being of communities and rural areas near the mill. <i>Id.</i> at *4-*5, *8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it was not required by statute to do so, the STB also considered the needs of BAR's creditors, the benefits to the bankrupt estate, and the fairness of the arrangement to the parties involved. <i>Id.</i> at *5-*8, *8-*9. The STB found that the trackage rights obligation between CN and BAR (and now honored by MM &amp; A) in March 2001 was fair and entered into at arm's length. It also determined that the retention of CN on the Madawaska line would not affect MM &amp; A's survival or cause the abandonment of other MM &amp; A line segments. The Board ultimately determined that the interests of the bankrupt estate did not \"justify stripping CN of its right to provide competitive rail service to Fraser or depriving Fraser of its right to receive that service.\" <i>Id.</i> at * 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The STB rejected challenges made to the standing of the trustee in light of the sale of the line by BAR to MM &amp; A. <i>Id.</i> at *3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> No party challenges that determination on appeal. After the STB issued its decision, the trustee filed in court a consented to motion for the voluntary dismissal of the remaining counts of the trustee's complaint without prejudice, pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P. On June 3, 2004, the district court granted the voluntary dismissal without prejudice as to the remaining counts of the trustee's complaint and entered a separate and final judgment in CN's favor, pursuant to Rule 58(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. The trustee timely appealed the dismissal of Count III to this Court in No. 04-1819. Fraser has intervened and has filed a brief in this court in support of affirmance of the district court's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In No. 04-1800, the trustee also timely petitioned this court for review of the STB's order denying the trustee's application for discontinuance and abandonment. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2321. Both Fraser and CN have intervened in this matter. The trustee argues that the STB had no jurisdiction to issue a binding decision under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903 and that it could only issue an advisory report under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170. The trustee does not attack the merits of the STB's decision. In response, the STB has also filed a brief, pointing out that it had been made a party only in appeal No. 04-1800, and that the issue of whether section 1170 applied was an issue only in appeal No. 04-1819. The STB says that whatever the outcome of that question, the trustee has waived any argument addressed to the merits of the STB's determination. The STB asks that we affirm the Board's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of the dismissal of a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is <i>de novo.

The court may fix a time within which the [STB] shall report to the court on such application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) After the court receives the report of the [STB], or the expiration of the time fixed under subsection (b) of this section, whichever occurs first, the court may authorize such abandonment, after notice to the [STB], the Secretary of Transportation, the trustee, any party in interest that has requested notice, any affected shipper or community, and any other entity prescribed by the court, and a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170. The trustee argues that section 1170 is not limited to abandonment of the debtor's own operations and that the phrase \"all or a portion of a rail line\" shows that the term \"abandonment\" is not so limited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, BAR's argument does not rely on the plain text of section 1170, but requires reference to a prior judicial construction of section 10903. The relevant parts of that section, in turn, provide:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) abandon any part of its railroad lines; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) discontinue the operation of all rail transportation over any part of its railroad lines;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">only if the Board finds that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. BAR's argument is that the term \"abandonment\" as used in section 10903 has been construed by both the agency and the courts to include adverse abandonment. <i>See Consolidated Rail Corp.,</i> 29 F.3d at 708-09. From this, the trustee argues that Congress was aware of the construction of \"abandonment\" in section 10903 and is presumed to have adopted that construction in section 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee also argues that his reading of section 1170 is sensible and would not have improper effects on third parties. The trustee says first that concerns about non-debtor railroads are irrelevant because any consequences to them are exactly what Congress intended, as the plain text demonstrates. Further, the trustee points out that section 1170 requires the court to consult the STB and consider the public interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> That is enough, the trustee says, to allay any untoward effects on third parties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed the trustee attacks the district court ruling itself as leading to untoward results. The trustee argues, for example, that if the debtor wants to abandon its own underlying rail lines, the bankruptcy court could not grant this abandonment until the debtor first sought an application with the STB to discontinue the overlying trackage rights of a non-debtor. <i>See Mo. Pac. R.R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">499802</span></span>, 9 I.C.C.2d 1228, 1230 (1993) (An \"abandonment may not be consummated until [the rail carrier with trackage rights'] discontinuance has been authorized and interested persons are given an opportunity to seek imposition of trail use and public use conditions.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the trustee argues that legislative history should not be considered, but that if it is, it supports the trustee's interpretation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> We take each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meaning of the term \"abandonment\" as it is used in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170 is not self-evident and cannot be resolved on textual plain meaning grounds. One cannot tell by reading the term \"abandonment\" in section 1170 whether the term includes \"adverse abandonment.\" Nor can one tell whether this is so simply from the fact that the term \"abandonment\" in section 10903 has been construed to include adverse abandonments as well. In determining what the statute means, we cannot simply rely on a few phrases in a complicated statutory structure. Section 1170 must be read in the context of what Congress was trying to do when it gave the bankruptcy court abandonment authority over a debtor railroad in bankruptcy. Both that context and the legislative history lead us to reject the trustee's interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In designing the statutory scheme, Congress set up an interplay between 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170 and 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. Under section 10903, the STB is the regulatory board charged with implementing overall Congressional rail transportation policy. Rail carriers are subject to the jurisdiction of the STB, and when a rail carrier intends to abandon its underlying rail lines or discontinue rail transportation or trackage rights over a line, it must seek permission by filing an application with the STB. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. Generally, the STB's authority over abandonment of rail lines is exclusive and plenary. <i>Chicago &amp; N.W. Transp. Co. v.

Congress designed special provisions in those limited circumstances for railroad reorganization that attempted to allow the railroad to emerge as \"a living, not a dying, ... enterprise.\" <i>See New Haven Inclusion Cases,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108198\"><a href=\"/opinion/108198/new-haven-inclusion-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 431, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108198\"><a href=\"/opinion/108198/new-haven-inclusion-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

One such provision can be found in the 1978 Amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1170 replaced section 77(<i>o</i>) of the Bankruptcy Act, formerly codified at 11 U.S.C. &#167; 205(<i>o</i>). The courts had construed the former section dealing with railroads in bankruptcy to require an STB determination of whether an abandonment of a debtor's rail line was adverse to the public interest as a prerequisite to abandonment in bankruptcy. <i>E.g., Palmer v. Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103237\"><a href=\"/opinion/103237/palmer-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 87-88, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></span> (1939). <i>Palmer</i> involved a direct abandonment by a debtor rail line of its own lines. In an effort to streamline the process, Congress made it clear in enacting 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170 that it wanted the bankruptcy court, not the STB, to make the final determination of whether a debtor's rail lines could be <i>abandoned</i> and the STB to play an advisory role, subject to time constraints. This would speed up the decisional process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, the STB was not ousted of its exclusive jurisdiction over <i>all</i> matters pertaining to bankrupt railroads. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1166 (\"Except with respect to abandonment under section 1170\" [and certain other situations]... the trustee and the debtor are subject to the provisions of subtitle IV of title 49 [the chapter authorizing the STB] that are applicable to railroads....). If, for example, the debtor as part of its reorganization plan wanted to \"construct an extension to any of its railroad lines,\" \"construct an additional railroad line,\" or \"provide transportation over... an extended or additional railroad line,\" it would first have to apply to the STB for a certificate authorizing such activity. <i>See</i> 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10901.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 1170, the STB still plays an important advisory role in the granting of permission for the abandonment of a reorganizing debtor's rail lines. If the STB issues an advisory report within the time allowed by the bankruptcy court, the bankruptcy court should consider the STB's report, but the STB's conclusions are not binding. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170(b), (c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of section 1170 illuminates Congress's intent in several ways. First, it identifies the regulatory problem that needed to be remedied. Second, it identifies the type of problems suffered by debtor railroads which were of concern. Third, it focuses on which railroads' (debtor or non-debtor) interests were of concern. Fourth, it emphasizes that other types of issues concerning a debtor's rail line remain within the STB's exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In enacting section 1170, Congress was attempting to remedy specific problems which arose from the judicial interpretation of the old scheme. The regulatory problem was that when the debtor was first required to go to the STB to seek the abandonment without any time limits for the STB decisions and then go to the court, there was a delay. The Senate Report states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incorporation of railroad reorganizations into the general reorganization provisions of the bill eliminates the cumbersome and duplicative procedure of section 77 under which plans of reorganization shuttled back and forth between the [STB] and the courts and proceedings were inevitably more time consuming and expensive.

In turn, this delay exacerbated the cash drain<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> on a rail carrier operating a financially unsound line while waiting for the STB to consider its application to abandon that line:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of a railroad being administered under title 11, the necessity to stem the bankrupt carrier's cash drain requires expeditious treatment of abandonment applications.

The legislative history makes it clear that Congress was concerned with making the system for the abandonment of debtor railroad's rail lines quicker, more efficient, and less costly for the debtor railroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history emphasizes that many of the operations of the debtor railroad remain within the exclusive jurisdiction of the STB:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[S]ince a plan of reorganization for a railroad may propose changes in transportation patterns or operation by, among other things, granting operating rights over, or transferring, <i>the debtor's rail lines,</i> the bill retains the [STB's] jurisdiction with respect to such proposals. The subchapter requires that such proposals be referred to the [STB] for its approval, disapproval, or modification and requires the reorganization court to give binding effect to the [STB's] findings on such aspects of a plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 95-989, at 11 (1978), <i>reprinted in</i> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5797 (emphasis added). In referring to the powers that are exclusively retained by the STB, the legislative history says, \"<i>the debtor's rail lines,</i>\" evidence that Congress's concern was for the debtor's own lines,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> not those of a financially sound railroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, there is little reason to think Congress intended, by using the word \"abandonment\" in section 1170 to include \"adverse abandonment\" by a debtor railroad, to oust a third party from rights in the debtor's own lines, and thus silently strip the STB of its exclusive jurisdiction over the abandonment of a non-debtor's lines or trackage rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to being at odds with the expressed intent of Congress, the trustee's interpretation would create a new set of problems. Included among those problems is the creation of financial incentives for bankrupt railroads to attempt to disrupt the operation of other healthy railroads. This is against public policy. Congress surely did not intend to create a bounty system, as here, that allows debtors in bankruptcy to sell their lines to a non-debtor and then use bankruptcy courts, not the STB, to eliminate competition between other non-debtor rail carriers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, to the extent the STB has spoken on this issue, we give some<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> weight to what it has said. In an advisory opinion to the bankruptcy court, <i>Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pac. R.R.

The STB noted that the only way for these lines to be abandoned is through an application to the STB, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 10903. This holding obviously is consistent with our disposition here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows not only that the bankruptcy court had no power to approve the adverse abandonment and discontinuance sought by the trustee here, but also that the STB had power to issue a binding final order in this case. No attack on the merits of the STB's decision having been made by the trustee, such an attack has been waived. We <i>affirm</i> the district court's dismissal of Count III of the trustee's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

This is ironic, given that the STB has already ruled that the relief the trustee seeks is against the public interest and what the trustee wants is a second bite at the apple in district court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Of course, BAR, pursuant to agreement with MM &amp; A, does not seek the abandonment of the underlying Madawaska line, only the discontinuance of CN's trackage rights over that line and the abandonment of CN's easement. BAR wants to keep the lines and oust CN, so the issue it raises does not apply to its own situation</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In any event, requiring the debtor to apply to the STB for the adverse discontinuance of the trackage rights of a non-debtor will not prevent the bankruptcy court from discontinuing the debtor's rail operations over that line. The bankruptcy court can still discontinue the debtor's own \"money-losing operations over the line\" in the short term to stem the cash drain that the rail operation is causing the debtor.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The trustee also argues that<i>In re New York, Susquehanna &amp; W.

The trustee argues that the fees it is paid by CN are not as profitable as BAR would like and so BAR has an interest in forcing CN to abandon its rights. This is also the sort of \"cash drain\" referred to in the legislative history, he says. However, as Fraser points out, the trustee does not say BAR is losing money from its operation under the haulage agreement. He says only that BAR can make more money if CN had no rights. BAR (now MM &amp; A) essentially would have a monopoly if CN were ousted and it could exercise monopoly pricing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The parties have essentially framed the issue as if BAR continued to own the line and have not suggested that the sale of the line to MM &amp; A moots the matter. As the sale of the line was part of the reorganization plan, this treatment is a reasonable position and we do not look behind it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> In the alternative, the trustee, in his reply brief and at oral argument, argued a narrower interpretation of the statute. The trustee's interpretation would limit the bankruptcy court's reach, but still allow this court to grant the relief that the trustee seeks. He proposes allowing the bankruptcy court authority over abandonments of a non-debtor's rail lines and trackage rights in situations in which the debtor has a property or contract interest in the non-debtor's lines or trackage rights. Significantly, the interpretation resolves none of the problems discussed in this opinion, and we reject it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> We emphasize the word \"some.\" The agency issued its interpretation as an advisory opinion to the bankruptcy court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1170(b).
