Appellant Steven Wesley\n\nBell pled guilty to and was sentenced for committing a credit union\n\nrobbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a).             He now contends that\n\nat the time of his sentencing, the district court committed clear\n\nerror in calculating his criminal history points.                   Specifically,\n\nBell argues that his eight prior juvenile crimes were consolidated\n\ninto two groups for sentencing, and as a result he should have\n\nreceived     just   three   criminal   history       points   for    those   prior\n\noffenses, rather than the thirteen points actually assessed by the\n\ndistrict court.       Because we conclude that the district court did\n\nnot commit clear error in calculating Bell's criminal history\n\npoints, we affirm the sentence imposed by the lower court.\n\n                               I. Background\n\nA. The Federal Sentence\n\n             Bell pled guilty to robbing a credit union in Bangor,\n\nMaine, on April 4, 2005.       In committing the robbery, Bell entered\n\nthe credit union office and handed a note to a teller that read:\n\n\"THIS IS A HOLDUP!! I HAVE A GUN. PUT 100'S, 50'S AND 20'S IN A BAG\n\nAND YOU WILL NOT GET HURT.\"         Notwithstanding the note, Bell, only\n\n19 years old at the time of the crime, did not have a weapon with\n\nhim.      In response to Bell's demand, the teller gave him $2,210,\n\nafter which Bell fled the credit union.\n\n             On February 21, 2006, the district court sentenced Bell\n\nto   77    months   in   prison,   three     years   of   supervised    release,\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\frestitution in the amount of $2,210, and a $100 special assessment.\n\nThe sentence imposed was at the low end of the 77- to 96-month\n\nsentencing guideline range calculated by the district court.                      In\n\ndetermining Bell's sentencing range, the district court began by\n\ncalculating a base offense level of 20, and added a two-level\n\nenhancement      because    the   offense    involved    the      property   of    a\n\nfinancial institution. Finding that Bell made a threat of death in\n\nthe    course   of   committing    the   robbery,    the      court   imposed     an\n\nadditional      two-level    enhancement     under   USSG     §   2B3.1(b)(2)(F)\n\n(2006), thus resulting in a total offense level of 24.                 The court\n\nthen     applied     a     two-level     reduction      for       acceptance      of\n\nresponsibility, under USSG § 3E1.1(a), and a one-level reduction\n\nunder USSG § 3E1.1(b), for timely entry of a guilty plea.                    These\n\nadjustments yielded a final offense level of 21.                  The court also\n\nassessed 13 criminal history points based on Bell's eight prior\n\nconvictions, placing him in Criminal History Category VI.                         On\n\nappeal, Bell contests the imposition of the 13 criminal history\n\npoints.\n\n            At his sentencing hearing for the credit union robbery,\n\nBell argued that his eight previous convictions, all of which were\n\nadjudicated by Maine's juvenile justice system, were actually two\n\nclusters of crimes that were consolidated by the juvenile court\n\ninto two groups for sentencing purposes.             Therefore, Bell argued\n\nthat he should receive only three criminal history points, under\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fUSSG § 4A1.2(d)(2), instead of the thirteen points the court\n\nultimately imposed upon him.           Had the district court accepted\n\nBell's argument that the prior convictions merited only three\n\npoints, he would have been put in Criminal History Category II,\n\nwhich would have yielded a guideline range of 41 to 51 months.           The\n\ndistrict    court,   in   rejecting   Bell's   argument   on   this   point,\n\nconcluded that there was no indication apparent on the face of the\n\nrecord that the juvenile court had consolidated his crimes for\n\nsentencing.\n\nB. The Juvenile Crimes\n\n            Bell's juvenile crimes occurred in two temporal clusters.\n\nThe first cluster (Cluster A) consisted of three crimes committed\n\nbetween October 12, 2000, and October 26, 2000.       In Cluster A, Bell\n\nwas convicted of terrorizing, for leaving a bomb threat in the\n\nbathroom of his high school; of petty theft, for stealing $55 from\n\na tip tray on the counter of a local restaurant; and of criminal\n\nthreatening with a dangerous weapon, for brandishing a knife and\n\ndemanding money and cigarettes at a local convenience store.           Bell\n\nwas arrested for all three offenses at the same time, on October\n\n31, 2000.     Each charged offense was assigned a separate docket\n\nnumber. The three charges were resolved at a unified dispositional\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fhearing on April 6, 2001. Separate sentences were imposed for each\n\ncrime,1 and the sentences were made to run concurrently.2\n\n           The    second   cluster    of   juvenile   crimes   (Cluster    B)\n\nconsisted of five crimes committed by Bell between December 17,\n\n2001 and March 28, 2002.        In Cluster B, Bell was convicted of\n\ndisorderly conduct, for kicking a wall at his high school; of petty\n\ntheft, for stealing three posters from a comic book store; of nine\n\ncounts of burglary, theft, and aggravated criminal mischief, for\n\nburglarizing five summer cottages; of forgery and theft, for\n\nattempting to negotiate a falsely made check in the name of his\n\nmother's roommate; and of possession of alcohol by a minor and\n\nescape.   Each of the five crimes was assigned a separate docket\n\nnumber;   these   separate   docket    numbers   were   retained   for    the\n\nduration of the legal proceedings.         All five charges were resolved\n\nat a unified dispositional hearing on May 16, 2002, before the same\n\njuvenile judge who had presided over the Cluster A sentencing.\n\n           There is some inconsistency among the court records\n\nregarding the sentences imposed for the Cluster B crimes.                 The\n\n\n\n     1\n      The sentences imposed for the Cluster A offenses were as\nfollows.   On the terrorizing charge, Bell received a suspended\nsentence until age 18 and one month of probation. On the petty\ntheft charge, Bell received 30 days of juvenile detention and one\nyear of probation.   On the threatening with a dangerous weapon\ncharge, Bell received 30 days of juvenile detention.\n     2\n      Maine's juvenile code requires that sentences of commitment\nto a juvenile correctional facility be served concurrently. See\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, § 3314(1)(H).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fcourt issued a unified Judgment and Commitment order, carrying the\n\ndocket       numbers   of   all   five   crimes,   imposing   a   sentence   of\n\ncommitment in a juvenile detention facility until Bell reached age\n\n19.3       This document might be read to suggest that, because of the\n\nimposition of one unified sentence, the crimes were consolidated\n\nfor sentencing purposes.            However, the court also maintained\n\nseparate docket numbers and individual docket sheets for each of\n\nthe charged crimes, and the docket sheets indicate that the court\n\nactually imposed separate, concurrent sentences as to each offense,\n\nas there were variations among the sentences imposed for each\n\ncrime.       For example, restitution of $5,200 was ordered for the\n\ndisorderly conduct charge, restitution of $17 was ordered for the\n\npetty theft charge, and the commitment period imposed for the\n\nalcohol and escape charges was set to run only until Bell reached\n\nage 18.\n\n               On a separate issue, the district court found that there\n\nwere no intervening arrests between the first four crimes in\n\nCluster B, but that there was an intervening arrest between the\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      One of the docket numbers listed on the Judgment and\nCommitment order is 02-27, which does not correspond to any of the\ndocket numbers assigned to Bell's offenses. In their briefs, both\nparties seem to have concluded that the 02-27 docket number was a\ntypographical error intended to be 02-57, which corresponds to\nBell's alcohol and escape charges. This is a sensible conclusion,\nwhich we adopt.\n\n                                         -6-\n\ffourth and fifth crimes.4        Because the sentencing guidelines state\n\nthat sentences are not \"related\" where they are separated by an\n\nintervening arrest, see USSG § 4A1.2, cmt. n.3, the district\n\ncourt's conclusion meant that the fifth crime in Cluster B could\n\nnot be \"related\" to the other crimes in that cluster.\n\n           Bell timely appealed the district court's rejection of\n\nhis claim of consolidation.\n\n                             II. Discussion\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n           The Supreme Court has held that an appellate court must\n\n\"deferentially\" review a lower court's assessment of whether a\n\ndefendant's prior crimes were consolidated for sentencing.          Buford\n\nv. United States, 532 U.S. 59, 64 (2001).         This is so because \"a\n\ndistrict   judge   sees   many    more   'consolidations'   than   does   an\n\nappellate judge. . . . [and] a district judge is likely to be more\n\nfamiliar with trial and sentencing practices in general.\"           Id. at\n\n\n\n     4\n      The fifth crime in Cluster B was charged as possession of\nalcohol by a minor and escape. Police had been alerted by motel\nemployees that minors in possession of alcohol had been spotted in\nthe area. When police arrived, they encountered Bell, and asked\nhim if he had been drinking. He responded in the negative. The\npolice contacted Bell's probation officer, who told them that Bell\nshould be taken to the police station for a blood alcohol test,\nwhich was permitted as a condition of his probation. The officers\nrequested that Bell accompany them to the police station for such\na test. When he agreed, they placed him in the backseat of the\npolice cruiser. While the police were speaking with other minors\nalso suspected of possessing alcohol, Bell's friend opened the\npolice cruiser door, and Bell and the friend fled. This was the\nbasis for the escape charge.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f64.   Thus, \"'where there is more than one plausible view of the\n\ncircumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable\n\nalternatives' is not clearly erroneous and a reviewing tribunal\n\ncannot disturb it.\"         United States v. Correa, 114 F.3d 314, 317\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (quoting United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508\n\n(1st Cir. 1990)).      \"However, to the extent that an alleged error\n\ninvolves   the     district    court's    interpretation         of   a    sentencing\n\nguideline,    it    presents    a     question    of    law    warranting     plenary\n\nreview.\"   Id.\n\nB. The Sentencing Guidelines\n\n           The Sentencing Guidelines assess criminal history points\n\nfor \"each prior sentence.\"          See USSG § 4A1.1.           However, sentences\n\nimposed in \"related cases\" are treated as one sentence for purposes\n\nof calculating a defendant's criminal history points.                      See id. §\n\n4A1.2(a)(2).       Note 3 of the commentary to USSG § 4A1.2 explains\n\nthat sentences are deemed related if \"they resulted from offenses\n\nthat (1) occurred on the same occasion, (2) were part of a single\n\ncommon scheme or plan, or (3) were consolidated for trial or\n\nsentencing.\"       Bell's     claim    rests     on    the    third   definition   of\n\nrelatedness -- namely, that his juvenile crimes were consolidated\n\nfor sentencing into two groups.\n\n           This circuit has established a categorical rule for\n\ndetermining    whether   charges       were    consolidated       for     sentencing:\n\n\"charges . . . should not be regarded as having been consolidated\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f(and, therefore, 'related') unless the original sentencing court\n\nentered an actual order of consolidation or there is some other\n\npersuasive indicium of formal consolidation apparent on the face of\n\nthe record which is sufficient to indicate that the offenses have\n\nsome relationship to one another beyond the sheer fortuity that\n\nsentence was imposed by the same judge at the same time.\"   Correa,\n\n114 F.3d at 317.    Correa identified several documents to which the\n\ncourts might look for formal indicia of consolidation, including\n\nthe indictment, docket entries, docket numbers, and the judgment of\n\nconviction.   Id.\n\nC. Assessing Bell's Criminal History Points\n\n          Bell asks us to review the district court's determination\n\nthat his eight juvenile offenses were not consolidated into two\n\nclusters for sentencing.5     Maine law does not provide a formal\n\n\n     5\n      Bell also seeks review of the district court's finding that\nthe fourth and fifth crimes in Cluster B were separated by an\nintervening arrest, meaning that the fifth crime was not \"related\"\nunder USSG § 4A1.2(a)(2). See supra note 4. The district court\nconcluded that because Bell was charged with escape, he must have\nbeen under arrest when he was placed in the back of the police\ncruiser. As the court said, \"[I]t seems inescapable that you don't\nget charged with escape unless you're under arrest.\" However, this\nconclusion does not appear to be supported by Maine law, which\ndefines \"escape\" as leaving \"official custody\" without permission.\nSee Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 755(1). Further, \"official\ncustody\" is defined not only as arrest but also as custody on the\nway to a police station. Id. at § 755(3). We need not resolve\nthis issue definitively, however, because the record contains\nsufficient grounds to conclude that the fifth crime in Cluster B,\nlike the other crimes in that cluster, was not consolidated for\nsentencing. See Estate of Soler v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d 45, 53 (1st\nCir. 1995) (\"An appellate court is not limited to the legal grounds\nrelied upon by the district court, but may affirm on any\n\n                                 -9-\n\fmechanism for consolidation of charges for sentencing.6 Therefore,\n\nwe must look at the face of the record to determine whether we\n\ndetect any formal indicia of consolidation.             See Correa, 114 F.3d\n\nat 317.\n\n              As to Cluster A, Bell argues that consolidation is\n\nevidenced by: (1) the Conditions of Probation order bearing the\n\ndocket numbers for the terrorizing and petty theft charges; (2) the\n\nunified dispositional hearing for all three charges; (3) a single\n\noffer     sheet   from    the    District      Attorney's   office;   (4)   the\n\ninvolvement of the same prosecutor, district attorney, and judge in\n\nall   three    matters;    and    (5)    \"the    comprehensive   approach   to\n\nsentencing that saw a structured sentence designed with a view\n\ntoward its collective impact.\"          In contrast, the government points\n\nout that there was no formal order of consolidation or docket entry\n\nsuggesting consolidation, all three charges retained their distinct\n\ndocket numbers, and different sentences were imposed for each\n\ncrime.\n\n\n\nindependently sufficient grounds.\").\n      6\n      The district court suggested that Rule 8(a) of the Maine\nRules of Criminal Procedure would permit a court to consolidate\nseparate charges for sentencing.      See Me. R. Crim. P. 8(a).\nHowever, that rule is directed toward joinder of charges for trial,\nnot sentencing. Further, the prosecution's sole witness at the\nsentencing hearing, the assistant district attorney who had\nresponsibility for all of Bell's charges, stated that he was not\naware of a procedure for formal consolidation for sentencing, and\nthat, in his experience, consolidation for sentencing was\naccomplished informally by the court, rather than formally.\n\n                                        -10-\n\f           Bell's arguments as to Cluster A are unpersuasive given\n\nthe categorical approach adopted by this circuit. Indeed, the only\n\npotential indicium of formal consolidation on the face of the\n\nrecord is the Conditions of Probation order bearing the docket\n\nnumbers   of   two   of   the   crimes.    However,   the   fact   that    the\n\nConditions of Probation order governed two of the three offenses is\n\nnot sufficient evidence of consolidation where each crime retained\n\nits original docket number and received a distinct sentence.              This\n\nis particularly so where our standard of review is clear error.\n\nTherefore, we affirm the district court's conclusion that no\n\nconsolidation occurred as to Cluster A.\n\n           Bell has a stronger argument that the Cluster B crimes\n\nwere consolidated for sentencing.         His most persuasive evidence of\n\nformal consolidation is the Judgment and Commitment order bearing\n\nthe docket numbers of all five crimes, which mandated a unified\n\nsentence of confinement until age 19.           However, as noted above,\n\nthere is contradictory evidence in the record as well.                    For\n\nexample, each crime retained its original docket number throughout\n\nthe adjudication.         In addition, the individual docket sheets\n\nindicate that the court imposed separate, concurrent sentences as\n\nto each crime, and that somewhat different sentences were imposed\n\nas to three of the crimes.        Given this contradictory evidence, it\n\nwould be difficult to conclude that the district court was clearly\n\nerroneous had it reached either result -- either that the charges\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fwere or were not consolidated for sentencing. Therefore, given our\n\ndeferential standard of review, we decline to assign error to the\n\njudge's conclusion as to Cluster B.\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ncalculation of Bell's criminal history points, and therefore also\n\naffirm the sentence imposed on the appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

In committing the robbery, Bell entered the credit union office and handed a note to a teller that read: \"THIS IS A HOLDUP!! I HAVE A GUN. PUT 100'S, 50'S AND 20'S IN A BAG AND YOU WILL NOT GET HURT.\" Notwithstanding the note, Bell, only 19 years old at the time of the crime, did not have a weapon with him.

The sentence imposed was at the low end of the 77- to 96-month sentencing guideline range calculated by the district court. In determining Bell's sentencing range, the district court began by calculating a base offense level of 20, and added a two-level enhancement because the offense involved the property of a financial institution. Finding that Bell made a threat of death in the course of committing the robbery, the court imposed an additional two-level enhancement under USSG &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) (2006), thus resulting in a total offense level of 24. The court then applied a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under USSG &#167; 3E1.1(a), and a one-level reduction under USSG &#167; 3E1.1(b), for timely entry of a guilty plea. These adjustments yielded a final offense level of 21. The court also assessed 13 criminal history points based on Bell's eight prior convictions, placing him in Criminal History Category VI.

Had the district court accepted Bell's argument that the prior convictions merited only three points, he would have been put in Criminal History Category II, which would have yielded a guideline range of 41 to 51 months.

The Juvenile Crimes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bell's juvenile crimes occurred in two temporal clusters. The first cluster (Cluster A) consisted of three crimes committed between October 12, 2000, and October 26, 2000. In Cluster A, Bell was convicted of terrorizing, for leaving a bomb threat in the bathroom of his high school; of petty theft, for stealing $55 from a tip tray on the counter of a local restaurant; and of criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, for brandishing a knife and demanding money and cigarettes at a local convenience store. Bell was arrested for all three offenses at the same time, on October 31, 2000. Each charged offense was assigned a separate docket number. The three charges were resolved at a unified dispositional hearing on April 6, 2001. Separate sentences were imposed for each crime,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the sentences were made to run concurrently.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second cluster of juvenile crimes (Cluster B) consisted of five crimes committed by Bell between December 17, 2001 and March 28, 2002. In Cluster B, Bell was convicted of disorderly conduct, for kicking a wall at his high school; of petty theft, for stealing three posters from a comic book store; of nine counts of burglary, theft, and aggravated criminal mischief, for burglarizing five summer cottages; of forgery and theft, for attempting to negotiate a falsely made check in the name of his mother's roommate; and of possession of alcohol by a minor and escape. Each of the five crimes was assigned a separate docket number; these separate docket numbers were retained for the duration of the legal proceedings. All five charges were resolved at a unified dispositional hearing on May 16, 2002, before the same juvenile judge who had presided over the Cluster A sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some inconsistency among the court records regarding the sentences imposed for the Cluster B crimes. The court issued a unified Judgment and Commitment order, carrying the docket numbers of all five crimes, imposing a sentence of commitment in a juvenile detention facility until Bell reached age 19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This document might be read to suggest that, because of the imposition of one unified sentence, the crimes were consolidated for sentencing purposes. However, the court also maintained separate docket numbers and individual docket sheets for each of the charged crimes, and the docket sheets indicate that the court actually imposed separate, concurrent sentences as to each offense, as there were variations among the sentences imposed for each crime. For example, restitution of $5,200 was ordered for the disorderly conduct charge, restitution of $17 was ordered for the petty theft charge, and the commitment period imposed for the alcohol and escape charges was set to run only until Bell reached age 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a separate issue, the district court found that there were no intervening arrests between the first four crimes in Cluster B, but that there was an intervening arrest between the fourth and fifth crimes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Because the sentencing guidelines state that sentences are not \"related\" where they are separated by an intervening arrest, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 4A1.2, cmt. n. 3, the district court's conclusion meant that the fifth crime in Cluster B could not be \"related\" to the other crimes in that cluster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bell timely appealed the district court's rejection of his claim of consolidation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that an appellate court must \"deferentially\" review a lower court's assessment of whether a defendant's prior crimes were consolidated for sentencing. <i>Buford v. United States,</i> 532 U.S. 59, 64, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001). This is so because \"a district judge sees many more `consolidations' than does an appellate judge. . . . [and] a district judge is likely to be more familiar with trial and sentencing practices in general.\" <i>Id.</i> at 64, 121 S.Ct. 1276. Thus, \"`where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives' is not clearly erroneous and a reviewing tribunal cannot disturb it.\" <i>United States v. Correa,</i> 114 F.3d 314, 317 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting <i>United States v. Ruiz,</i> 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir.1990)). \"However, to the extent that an alleged error involves the district court's interpretation of a sentencing guideline, it presents a question of law warranting plenary review.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines assess criminal history points for \"each prior sentence.\" <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 4A1.1. However, sentences imposed in \"related cases\" are treated as one sentence for purposes of calculating a defendant's criminal history points. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2). Note 3 of the commentary to USSG &#167; 4A1.2 explains that sentences are deemed related if \"they resulted from offenses that (1) occurred on the same occasion, (2) were part of a single common scheme or plan, or (3) were consolidated for trial or sentencing.\" Bell's claim rests on the third definition of relatedness &#8212; namely, that his juvenile crimes were consolidated for sentencing into two groups.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has established a categorical rule for determining whether charges were consolidated for sentencing: \"charges . . . should not be regarded as having been consolidated (and, therefore, `related') unless the original sentencing court entered an actual order of consolidation or there is some other persuasive indicium of formal consolidation apparent on the face of the record which is sufficient to indicate that the offenses have some relationship to one another beyond the sheer fortuity that sentence was imposed by the same judge at the same time.\" <i>Correa,</i> 114 F.3d at 317. <i>Correa</i> identified several documents to which the courts might look for formal indicia of consolidation, including the indictment, docket entries, docket numbers, and the judgment of conviction. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Assessing Bell's Criminal History Points</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bell asks us to review the district court's determination that his eight juvenile offenses were not consolidated into two clusters for sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Maine law does not provide a formal mechanism for consolidation of charges for sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Therefore, we must look at the face of the record to determine whether we detect any formal indicia of consolidation. <i>See Correa,</i> 114 F.3d at 317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Cluster A, Bell argues that consolidation is evidenced by: (1) the Conditions of Probation order bearing the docket numbers for the terrorizing and petty theft charges; (2) the unified dispositional hearing for all three charges; (3) a single offer sheet from the District Attorney's office; (4) the involvement of the same prosecutor, district attorney, and judge in all three matters; and (5) \"the comprehensive approach to sentencing that saw a structured sentence designed with a view toward its collective impact.\" In contrast, the government points out that there was no formal order of consolidation or docket entry suggesting consolidation, all three charges retained their distinct docket numbers, and different sentences were imposed for each crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bell's arguments as to Cluster A are unpersuasive given the categorical approach adopted by this circuit. Indeed, the only potential indicium of formal consolidation on the face of the record is the Conditions of Probation order bearing the docket numbers of two of the crimes. However, the fact that the Conditions of Probation order governed two of the three offenses is not sufficient evidence of consolidation where each crime retained its original docket number and received a distinct sentence. This is particularly so where our standard of review is clear error. Therefore, we affirm the district court's conclusion that no consolidation occurred as to Cluster A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bell has a stronger argument that the Cluster B crimes were consolidated for sentencing. His most persuasive evidence of formal consolidation is the Judgment and Commitment order bearing the docket numbers of all five crimes, which mandated a unified sentence of confinement until age 19. However, as noted above, there is contradictory evidence in the record as well. For example, each crime retained its original docket number throughout the adjudication. In addition, the individual docket sheets indicate that the court imposed separate, concurrent sentences as to each crime, and that somewhat different sentences were imposed as to three of the crimes. Given this contradictory evidence, it would be difficult to conclude that the district court was clearly erroneous had it reached either result &#8212; either that the charges were or were not consolidated for sentencing. Therefore, given our deferential standard of review, we decline to assign error to the judge's conclusion as to Cluster B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's calculation of Bell's criminal history points, and therefore also <i>affirm</i> the sentence imposed on the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The sentences imposed for the Cluster A offenses were as follows. On the terrorizing charge, Bell received a suspended sentence until age 18 and one month of probation. On the petty theft charge, Bell received 30 days of juvenile detention and one year of probation. On the threatening with a dangerous weapon charge, Bell received 30 days of juvenile detention</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Maine's juvenile code requires that sentences of commitment to a juvenile correctional facility be served concurrently<i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat.

In their briefs, both parties seem to have concluded that the 02-27 docket number was a typographical error intended to be 02-57, which corresponds to Bell's alcohol and escape charges. This is a sensible conclusion, which we adopt</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The fifth crime in Cluster B was charged as possession of alcohol by a minor and escape. Police had been alerted by motel employees that minors in possession of alcohol had been spotted in the area. When police arrived, they encountered Bell, and asked him if he had been drinking. He responded in the negative. The police contacted Bell's probation officer, who told them that Bell should be taken to the police station for a blood alcohol test, which was permitted as a condition of his probation. The officers requested that Bell accompany them to the police station for such a test. When he agreed, they placed him in the backseat of the police cruiser. While the police were speaking with other minors also suspected of possessing alcohol, Bell's friend opened the police cruiser door, and Bell and the friend fled. This was the basis for the escape charge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Bell also seeks review of the district court's finding that the fourth and fifth crimes in Cluster B were separated by an intervening arrest, meaning that the fifth crime was not \"related\" under USSG &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2)<i>See supra</i> note 4. The district court concluded that because Bell was charged with escape, he must have been under arrest when he was placed in the back of the police cruiser. As the court said, \"[I]t seems inescapable that you don't get charged with escape unless you're under arrest.\" However, this conclusion does not appear to be supported by Maine law, which defines \"escape\" as leaving \"official custody\" without permission. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 755(1). Further, \"official custody\" is defined not only as arrest but also as custody on the way to a police station. <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 755(3). We need not resolve this issue definitively, however, because the record contains sufficient grounds to conclude that the fifth crime in Cluster B, like the other crimes in that cluster, was not consolidated for sentencing. <i>See Estate of Soler v. Rodriguez,</i> 63 F.3d 45, 53 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"An appellate court is not limited to the legal grounds relied upon by the district court, but may affirm on any independently sufficient grounds.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The district court suggested that Rule 8(a) of the Maine Rules of Criminal Procedure would permit a court to consolidate separate charges for sentencing<i>See</i> Me. R.Crim. P. 8(a). However, that rule is directed toward joinder of charges for trial, not sentencing. Further, the prosecution's sole witness at the sentencing hearing, the assistant district attorney who had responsibility for all of Bell's charges, stated that he was not aware of a procedure for formal consolidation for sentencing, and that, in his experience, consolidation for sentencing was accomplished informally by the court, rather than formally.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

He now contends that at the time of his sentencing, the district court committed clear error in calculating his criminal history points. Specifically, Bell argues that his eight prior juvenile crimes were consolidated into two groups for sentencing, and as a result he should have received just three criminal history points for those prior offenses, rather than the thirteen points actually assessed by the district court. Because we conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in calculating Bell's criminal history points, we affirm the sentence imposed by the lower court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Federal Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bell pled guilty to robbing a credit union in Bangor, Maine, on April 4, 2005. In committing the robbery, Bell entered the credit union office and handed a note to a teller that read: \"THIS IS A HOLDUP!! I HAVE A GUN. PUT 100'S, 50'S AND 20'S IN A BAG AND YOU WILL NOT GET HURT.\" Notwithstanding the note, Bell, only 19 years old at the time of the crime, did not have a weapon with him. In response to Bell's demand, the teller gave him $2,210, after which Bell fled the credit union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 21, 2006, the district court sentenced Bell to 77 months in prison, three years of supervised release, restitution in the amount of $2,210, and a $100 special assessment. The sentence imposed was at the low end of the 77- to 96-month sentencing guideline range calculated by the district court. In determining Bell's sentencing range, the district court began by calculating a base offense level of 20, and added a two-level enhancement because the offense involved the property of a financial institution. Finding that Bell made a threat of death in the course of committing the robbery, the court imposed an additional two-level enhancement under USSG &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) (2006), thus resulting in a total offense level of 24. The court then applied a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under USSG &#167; 3E1.1(a), and a one-level reduction under USSG &#167; 3E1.1(b), for timely entry of a guilty plea. These adjustments yielded a final offense level of 21. The court also assessed 13 criminal history points based on Bell's eight prior convictions, placing him in Criminal History Category VI. On appeal, Bell contests the imposition of the 13 criminal history points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At his sentencing hearing for the credit union robbery, Bell argued that his eight previous convictions, all of which were adjudicated by Maine's juvenile justice system, were actually two clusters of crimes that were consolidated by the juvenile court into two groups for sentencing purposes. Therefore, Bell argued that he should receive only three criminal history points, under USSG &#167; 4A1.2(d)(2), instead of the thirteen points the court ultimately imposed upon him. Had the district court accepted Bell's argument that the prior convictions merited only three points, he would have been put in Criminal History Category II, which would have yielded a guideline range of 41 to 51 months. The district court, in rejecting Bell's argument on this point, concluded that there was no indication apparent on the face of the record that the juvenile court had consolidated his crimes for sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Each of the five crimes was assigned a separate docket number; these separate docket numbers were retained for the duration of the legal proceedings.

Note 3 of the commentary to USSG &#167; 4A1.2 explains that sentences are deemed related if \"they resulted from offenses that (1) occurred on the same occasion, (2) were part of a single common scheme or plan, or (3) were consolidated for trial or sentencing.\" Bell's claim rests on the third definition of relatedness &#8212; namely, that his juvenile crimes were consolidated for sentencing into two groups.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has established a categorical rule for determining whether charges were consolidated for sentencing: \"charges . . . should not be regarded as having been consolidated (and, therefore, `related') unless the original sentencing court entered an actual order of consolidation or there is some other persuasive indicium of formal consolidation apparent on the face of the record which is sufficient to indicate that the offenses have some relationship to one another beyond the sheer fortuity that sentence was imposed by the same judge at the same time.\" <i>Correa,</i> 114 F.3d at 317. <i>Correa</i> identified several documents to which the courts might look for formal indicia of consolidation, including the indictment, docket entries, docket numbers, and the judgment of conviction. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Assessing Bell's Criminal History Points</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bell asks us to review the district court's determination that his eight juvenile offenses were not consolidated into two clusters for sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Maine law does not provide a formal mechanism for consolidation of charges for sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Therefore, we must look at the face of the record to determine whether we detect any formal indicia of consolidation. <i>See Correa,</i> 114 F.3d at 317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Cluster A, Bell argues that consolidation is evidenced by: (1) the Conditions of Probation order bearing the docket numbers for the terrorizing and petty theft charges; (2) the unified dispositional hearing for all three charges; (3) a single offer sheet from the District Attorney's office; (4) the involvement of the same prosecutor, district attorney, and judge in all three matters; and (5) \"the comprehensive approach to sentencing that saw a structured sentence designed with a view toward its collective impact.\" In contrast, the government points out that there was no formal order of consolidation or docket entry suggesting consolidation, all three charges retained their distinct docket numbers, and different sentences were imposed for each crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bell's arguments as to Cluster A are unpersuasive given the categorical approach adopted by this circuit. Indeed, the only potential indicium of formal consolidation on the face of the record is the Conditions of Probation order bearing the docket numbers of two of the crimes. However, the fact that the Conditions of Probation order governed two of the three offenses is not sufficient evidence of consolidation where each crime retained its original docket number and received a distinct sentence. This is particularly so where our standard of review is clear error. Therefore, we affirm the district court's conclusion that no consolidation occurred as to Cluster A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bell has a stronger argument that the Cluster B crimes were consolidated for sentencing. His most persuasive evidence of formal consolidation is the Judgment and Commitment order bearing the docket numbers of all five crimes, which mandated a unified sentence of confinement until age 19. However, as noted above, there is contradictory evidence in the record as well. For example, each crime retained its original docket number throughout the adjudication. In addition, the individual docket sheets indicate that the court imposed separate, concurrent sentences as to each crime, and that somewhat different sentences were imposed as to three of the crimes. Given this contradictory evidence, it would be difficult to conclude that the district court was clearly erroneous had it reached either result &#8212; either that the charges were or were not consolidated for sentencing. Therefore, given our deferential standard of review, we decline to assign error to the judge's conclusion as to Cluster B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's calculation of Bell's criminal history points, and therefore also <i>affirm</i> the sentence imposed on the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The sentences imposed for the Cluster A offenses were as follows. On the terrorizing charge, Bell received a suspended sentence until age 18 and one month of probation. On the petty theft charge, Bell received 30 days of juvenile detention and one year of probation. On the threatening with a dangerous weapon charge, Bell received 30 days of juvenile detention</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Maine's juvenile code requires that sentences of commitment to a juvenile correctional facility be served concurrently<i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat.

In their briefs, both parties seem to have concluded that the 02-27 docket number was a typographical error intended to be 02-57, which corresponds to Bell's alcohol and escape charges. This is a sensible conclusion, which we adopt</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The fifth crime in Cluster B was charged as possession of alcohol by a minor and escape. Police had been alerted by motel employees that minors in possession of alcohol had been spotted in the area. When police arrived, they encountered Bell, and asked him if he had been drinking. He responded in the negative. The police contacted Bell's probation officer, who told them that Bell should be taken to the police station for a blood alcohol test, which was permitted as a condition of his probation. The officers requested that Bell accompany them to the police station for such a test. When he agreed, they placed him in the backseat of the police cruiser. While the police were speaking with other minors also suspected of possessing alcohol, Bell's friend opened the police cruiser door, and Bell and the friend fled. This was the basis for the escape charge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Bell also seeks review of the district court's finding that the fourth and fifth crimes in Cluster B were separated by an intervening arrest, meaning that the fifth crime was not \"related\" under USSG &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2)<i>See supra</i> note 4. The district court concluded that because Bell was charged with escape, he must have been under arrest when he was placed in the back of the police cruiser. As the court said, \"[I]t seems inescapable that you don't get charged with escape unless you're under arrest.\" However, this conclusion does not appear to be supported by Maine law, which defines \"escape\" as leaving \"official custody\" without permission. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &#167; 755(1). Further, \"official custody\" is defined not only as arrest but also as custody on the way to a police station. <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 755(3). We need not resolve this issue definitively, however, because the record contains sufficient grounds to conclude that the fifth crime in Cluster B, like the other crimes in that cluster, was not consolidated for sentencing. <i>See Estate of Soler v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196244\"><a href=\"/opinion/196244/estate-of-soler-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"An appellate court is not limited to the legal grounds relied upon by the district court, but may affirm on any independently sufficient grounds.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The district court suggested that Rule 8(a) of the Maine Rules of Criminal Procedure would permit a court to consolidate separate charges for sentencing<i>See</i> Me. R.Crim. P. 8(a). However, that rule is directed toward joinder of charges for trial, not sentencing. Further, the prosecution's sole witness at the sentencing hearing, the assistant district attorney who had responsibility for all of Bell's charges, stated that he was not aware of a procedure for formal consolidation for sentencing, and that, in his experience, consolidation for sentencing was accomplished informally by the court, rather than formally.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
