Plaintiff-appellants Joseph\n                                  \n\nand   Mar a  Senra  sued  two  Cumberland,  Rhode  Island  police\n\nofficers,  Stephen Cunningham and Douglas Laird, for violation of\n\ntheir  constitutional rights under  42 U.S.C.    1983 and various\n\nstate laws.  Mr. Senra alleged that  he had been falsely arrested\n\nand  imprisoned, subjected  to  excessive force,  and maliciously\n\nprosecuted;  Mrs. Senra claimed  only that the  officers had used\n\nexcessive force against her during the arrest of her husband.  At\n\nthe close of the evidence, the district court granted defendants'\n\nmotion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  on  the  malicious\n\nprosecution claims.   The remaining counts went to  a jury, which\n\nfound for the police officers.  The court then denied plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for a new trial, and plaintiffs appealed.  For the reasons\n\nstated herein, we affirm.\n\n                                I\n\n                            Background\n                                      \n\n          On May 20, 1989, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Mr. Senra\n\nstruck a neighbor's car while driving home.  Instead of stopping,\n\nhe  proceeded to  his  house just  down  the street,  purportedly\n\nintending  to settle the matter the next day.  The neighbor heard\n\nthe accident and learned from a  bystander that Mr. Senra had hit\n\nhis car.  The neighbor called the police and went to  Mr. Senra's\n\nhome, where he was told to return in the morning.\n\n          The Senras claim that Mr. Senra  answered the door when\n\nthe police arrived,  but before he could explain,  he was grabbed\n\nby the officers, dragged out of  the house, and thrown over  some\n\n                               -2-\n\nhedges in  the front lawn.   During the struggle,  his right arm,\n\nwhich was withered from polio, was broken.\n\n          The  police officers offer  a different version  of the\n\nstory.   They contend that  no one answered when  they originally\n\nknocked at the Senras' door.  Mr. Senra only appeared later after\n\nthe officers remained  in the yard to  wait for a tow  truck they\n\nhad  called to  remove Mr.  Senra's  car.   The officers  smelled\n\nalcohol  on his breath  and noticed that he  was staggering.  Mr.\n\nSenra shouted  vulgarities at the officers and  flailed his arms.\n\nHe then lost his balance, tripped over the shrubbery, and fell to\n\nthe ground.  At that point, Officer Laird approached Mr. Senra to\n\nrestrain him  and a struggle  ensued.  The officers  contend that\n\nMr. Senra attempted to hit, kick, and bite Officer Laird and that\n\nMr. Senra kicked Officer Cunningham in the groin when he tried to\n\nassist Officer Laird.\n\n          The Senras  claim that,  after Mr.  Senra was  attacked\n\nwithout provocation,  Mrs. Senra  sought to  assist her  husband.\n\nThey maintain that one  of the officers hit  her in the  stomach,\n\nloosening  stitches from her  recent hysterectomy.   The officers\n\nassert that  Mrs. Senra and  her daughter struck and  kicked them\n\nwhile they sought  to restrain Mr. Senra.   Mrs. Senra ultimately\n\nlocked herself in the car to prevent its removal.\n\n          After the altercation subsided,  Mr. Senra informed the\n\nofficers of  the pain in  his arm.   He was taken  to a hospital,\n\nwhere he  learned that  his arm  was broken.   A  nurse from  the\n\nhospital  testified that Mr.  Senra was  uncooperative, combative\n\n                               -3-\n\nand vulgar  when he arrived and  that a blood  test revealed that\n\nhis  blood alcohol  level  exceeded  the  permissible  limit  for\n\ndriving a motor vehicle.\n\n          Mr.  Senra was later  charged with assaulting  a police\n\nofficer,   disorderly  conduct,  and  leaving  the  scene  of  an\n\naccident.  A  jury acquitted him of assault,  and a judge granted\n\nhis  motion for judgment  of acquittal on  the disorderly conduct\n\ncharge.     The  motor   vehicle  offense  was   administratively\n\ndismissed.\n\n          The Senras  then brought  this action  in the  district\n\ncourt seeking damages.  After an unfavorable outcome,  the Senras\n\nappealed.\n\n                                II\n\n                        Jury Instructions\n                                         \n\n          The Senras first  assign error to the  district court's\n\nrefusal to consider  jury instructions that they  offered shortly\n\nbefore  the  close of  the  evidence.    The court  rejected  the\n\ninstructions  because,  in  its  view,  the  plaintiffs'  proffer\n\narrived too  late, in violation  of the court's  Amended Pretrial\n\nOrder.   That  Order required  the  parties to  submit \"full  and\n\ncomplete proposed  jury instructions\"  to the  court twenty  days\n\nprior to  trial.   The  Senras  claim that,  notwithstanding  the\n\ndistrict  court's   broad  power   to  organize   and  facilitate\n\nlitigation  pursuant to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  16,\n\nrequiring instructions much  in advance of trial and  refusing to\n\nconsider instructions proposed  before the close of  the evidence\n\n                               -4-\n\nconflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51.1\n\n          Rule  16 provides the district courts  with  a powerful\n\nmechanism  to organize  and expedite  litigation.   The  pretrial\n\nconferences  contemplated  by the  Rule  create  an indispensable\n\nopportunity  to clarify  and delimit  issues to  be tried  and to\n\nestablish a timetable  for the proceedings as a  whole.  As such,\n\nthe   outcome  of  pretrial   conferences  are  central   to  the\n\nlitigation,  for as  the  Rule  states,  pretrial  orders  \"shall\n\ncontrol the subsequent course of  the action unless modified by a\n\nsubsequent order.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(e).   \"Trial judges enjoy\n\ngreat latitude in carrying out case-management functions.\"  Jones\n                                                                 \n\nv.

We review  a\n                                \n\ndistrict  court's imposition of  sanctions for failure  to comply\n\nwith pretrial  orders only for  abuse of discretion.

Jones, 990 F.2d at 5.\n                            \n\n          The  district  court  requested  the jury  instructions\n\ntwenty days  in advance  of trial.   The  pretrial order was  not\n\nambiguous and appellants offered two instructions within the time\n\nset by the court.  We have  found no cases that even suggest that\n\nan order  requiring jury instructions  before trial would  in any\n\nway violate the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   Absent such a\n\ncase,  the  district  court's  refusal  to  consider  appellants'\n\nproffered  instructions  was  not an  abuse  of  discretion where\n\nappellants  understood   that  the   court   had  requested   the\n\ninstructions  in advance  of trial  and  had not  shown that  the\n\ntardily  filed jury instructions  pertained to a  matter that was\n\nnot foreseeable at the time set by the court.\n\n          Having  found  no  error  in  the  court's  refusal  to\n\nconsider  appellants'  proffered  instructions,  we  turn to  the\n\nappellants'  objections  to  the  instructions  on  appeal.    To\n\npreserve an  objection on appeal  to a jury instruction,  a party\n\nmust  contemporaneously object to the instruction.  The exception\n\nmust apprise the judge of the  basis of the error.  Fed. R.  Civ.\n\nP. 51 (\"No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to\n\ngive  an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the\n\njury  retires to  consider its  verdict,  stating distinctly  the\n\n                               -6-\n\nmatter objected to and the  grounds of the objection.\").  Failure\n\nto timely  object waives  the error  on appeal.   See  Elgabri v.\n                                                              \n\nLekas, 964 F.2d 1255, 1258 (1st Cir. 1992).\n     \n\n          In  this case,  the  record  indicates  that  the  jury\n\nretired to deliberate prior to appellants' objections to the jury\n\ninstructions.  Appellants therefore have waived their exceptions.\n\nWe  have  reviewed,  as we  must,  the  claims of  error  made by\n\nappellants in relation  to the instructions to  ensure that there\n\nhas been  no plain error  amounting to a miscarriage  of justice.\n\nSee Elgabri, 964 F.2d at 1259; Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater\n                                                                 \n\nLowell  Bd. of  Realtors, 850  F.2d  803, 809  (1st Cir.),  cert.\n                                                                 \n\ndenied, 488 U.S. 955 (1988).  We are satisfied that no such error\n      \n\nexists.\n\n                               III\n\n                       Evidentiary Rulings\n                                          \n\n          The Senras contend that  the district court erroneously\n\nadmitted  into  evidence  Officer   Laird's  knowledge  of  prior\n\nincidents of intoxication and domestic disturbance at Mr. Senra's\n\nhome and evidence that Mr. Senra previously had been convicted of\n\ndriving  while  intoxicated.   Officer  Laird  testified  that he\n\npersonally had been  involved in at least six  incidents in which\n\nthe police were called to  respond to domestic disturbances  that\n\nresulted  from Mr. Senra's  drunken and  violent  behavior.   The\n\ndrunk driving conviction occurred in 1986.  Mr. Senra argues that\n\nFederal  Rules  of  Evidence  403,  404,  608,  and  609  require\n\nexclusion of such evidence.\n\n                               -7-\n\n          In  this  case,  Mr.  Senra  was  not  on  trial  as  a\n\ndefendant.   Rather,  he  sued  the police  officers  for use  of\n\nexcessive  force  and   false  arrest.    To  defend  against  an\n\nallegation  of  excessive  force,  defendant officers  needed  to\n\ndemonstrate that  their  conduct was  \"objectively reasonable  in\n\nlight of the facts  and circumstances confronting them.\"   Graham\n                                                                 \n\nv. Connor, 490  U.S. 386, 397 (1989).   Defendant police officers\n         \n\nintroduced  the testimony  about  Mr. Senra's  prior  conduct  to\n\nexplain the \"facts  and circumstances\" that they  confronted when\n\nthey  arrived  at the  Senra  household  and to  demonstrate  the\n\nreasonableness  of  their  conduct.     Similarly,  the  officers\n\nproffered the fact of conviction to show a motivation for fleeing\n\nthe scene  of the accident.   They theorized that Mr.  Senra left\n\nthe  accident because  he wanted  to avoid another  drunk driving\n\nconviction.\n\n          With respect to the officers explanation of their prior\n\ndealings with Mr. Senra, we find that the district court did  not\n\nerr by admitting the evidence.   The officers' prior knowledge of\n\nMr.   Senra  is   relevant  because   it  sheds   light  on   the\n\nreasonableness  of their responses,  a matter quite  pertinent to\n\nthe undue  force claim.  Because  the evidence is probative  of a\n\nmatter other than Mr. Senra's bad character, Rule 404(b) poses no\n\nbar.2  \n\n                    \n\n2  Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) provides in relevant part:\n\n            Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\n            is not admissible to prove the  character\n            of  a person in  order to show  action in\n\n                               -8-\n\n          Appellants'    Rule   403    challenge   is    likewise\n\nunavailing.3  Admittedly the evidence  is of limited value to the\n\nofficers  since their  version  of  the events  on  the night  in\n\nquestion amply supported their actions without reference to prior\n\nbad   conduct.    The  prejudicial  impact,  however,  cannot  be\n\nconsidered  significant  in  light  of  the  officers'  testimony\n\nconcerning  Mr. Senra's outrageous  behavior on that  night.  The\n\nofficers  testified  that  they smelled  alcohol  on  Mr. Senra's\n\nbreath and that Mr.  Senra acted in a hostile  manner by verbally\n\nand physically attacking  them.  As such, the  district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion by  admitting the testimony.  See United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Walters, 904 F.2d 765, 768 (1st Cir. 1990).\n                 \n\n          With  respect to Mr. Senra's prior conviction for drunk\n\ndriving,  the district  court admitted  the  evidence because  it\n\nbelieved that the evidence was relevant to Mr. Senra's motivation\n\nfor  leaving the  scene  of  the accident.    His motivation  for\n\nleaving the scene was irrelevant,  however, to any disputed issue\n\n                    \n\n            conformity therewith.   It  may, however,\n            be admissible for other purposes, such as\n            proof  of  motive,  opportunity,  intent,\n            preparation,   knowledge,  identity,   or\n            absence of mistake or accident . . . .\n\n3  Fed. R. Evid. 403 states:\n\n            Although   relevant,   evidence   may  be\n            excluded  if   its  probative   value  is\n            substantially outweighed by the danger of\n            unfair   prejudice,   confusion   of  the\n            issues,  or misleading  the  jury, or  by\n            considerations of  undue delay,  waste of\n            time,   or   needless   presentation   of\n            cumulative evidence.\n\n                               -9-\n\nin the  case.  To justify arrest, it  would be sufficient to know\n\nthat he had  departed.  The previous conviction  therefore had no\n\nprobative  value.    It  is  also quite  likely  that  the  prior\n\nconviction  would  be  inadmissible  for impeachment  under  Rule\n\n609.4  \n\n          Assuming thus that  it was error  to admit evidence  of\n\nthe prior conviction, we consider whether the error was harmless.\n\n\"The  erroneous  admission  of  evidence  of  earlier  crimes  is\n\nharmless if  we determine that  it is 'highly probable'  that the\n\nerror  did not  contribute to  the  verdict.\"   United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nGonz lez-S nchez,  825 F.2d  572, 580  (1st  Cir. 1989)  (quoting\n                \n\nUnited States v.

Evid. 609 states in pertinent part:\n\n            (a) General  rule. -- For the  purpose of\n            attacking the credibility of a witness, \n\n            (l) evidence that a witness other than an\n            accused  has been  convicted  of a  crime\n            shall be admitted,  subject to Rule  403,\n            if the  crime was punishable  by death or\n            imprisonment in excess  of one year under\n            the  law  under  which  the  witness  was\n            convicted, and  evidence that  an accused\n            has been  convicted of such a crime shall\n            be admitted if the  court determines that\n            the  probative  value of  admitting  this\n            evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect\n            to the accused; and\n\n            (2)  evidence that  any witness  has been\n            convicted of a crime shall be admitted if\n            it   involved    dishonesty   or    false\n            statement, regardless of the punishment.\n\n                               -10-\n\nparticular piece  of evidence  or improper  coloring provided  by\n\nevidence of prior bad acts.  Because three sources (both officers\n\nand  the hospital nurse) testified that Mr. Senra was intoxicated\n\nand belligerent  on the  night of the  arrest, the effect  of the\n\nevidence of prior incidents, which  occurred at least two or more\n\nyears  earlier, was  greatly muted.    If the  jury believed  the\n\npolice and the hospital nurse, which it apparently did, Mr. Senra\n\nhit a parked  car, fled the scene,  and attacked the police  in a\n\ndrunken fit.  This evidence was more than sufficient to support a\n\nverdict  for the  defendants  and  remote  incidents  of  similar\n\nconduct added little.  The improper admission of the evidence was\n\ntherefore harmless.\n\n                                IV\n\n                      Malicious Prosecution\n                                           \n\n          At the close  of all the  evidence, the district  court\n\ngranted defendants  judgment as  a matter of  law on  Mr. Senra's\n\naction for malicious prosecution under   1983 and a pendent state\n\nlaw claim.5   The district  court directed the  verdict of the   \n\n1983  claim  because Mr.  Senra  had  not demonstrated  that  the\n\nalleged  misconduct  rose  to  constitutional  magnitude.    With\n\nrespect to the state law claim, the  court found that as a matter\n\nof law, Mr. Senra failed  to show that defendants \"initiated\" the\n\nprosecution within  the meaning of  that term under  Rhode Island\n\n                    \n\n5   Although Mr. Senra's  original complaint and brief  on appeal\nlacked  specificity,  the  district  court  treated  Mr.  Senra's\nproffers as alleging both state and federal causes of action.  As\nsuch, we will do so as well.\n\n                               -11-\n\nlaw.  Mr. Senra now argues that the court erred in  directing the\n\nverdict on both actions.  \n\n          \"Under the  accepted standard  of appellate  review, we\n\n'examine the evidence and the  inferences reasonably to be  drawn\n\ntherefrom  in  the  light most  favorable  to  the  nonmovant' to\n\ndetermine  whether  'reasonable  persons  could  reach  but   one\n\nconclusion.'\"  Veranda Beach Club v.

Ct. 1382 (1993)).\n       \n\n          Mr. Senra  clearly has  not stated  a  claim under  the\n\nsubstantive   due  process  branch   of  the      1983  malicious\n\nprosecution analysis.   Mr. Senra did not allege  that the police\n\nofficers  maliciously  prosecuted  him  for  racial or  political\n\n                               -13-\n\nreasons or to  deprive him of equal  protection of the law.   Nor\n\nhas Mr.  Senra stated a claim  for a violation of  his procedural\n\ndue  process  rights   because  he  failed  to   demonstrate  the\n\ninadequacy of the state law malicious prosecution remedy.  \n\n          We turn  then to  whether the  district court  properly\n\ndirected the verdict in favor  of defendant officers on the state\n\nlaw malicious  prosecution  claim.    To  establish  a  claim  of\n\nmalicious  prosecution under Rhode  Island law, a  plaintiff must\n\nprove that (1) defendants initiated a criminal proceeding against\n\nhim; (2) with  malice; (3) and without probable  cause; which (4)\n\nterminated in  plaintiff's favor.   Solitro v. Moffatt,  523 A.2d\n                                                      \n\n858, 861-62 (R.I. 1987); Nagy v. McBurney, 120 R.I. 925, 929, 392\n                                         \n\nA.2d 365, 367 (1978).  In the district court, the success  of Mr.\n\nSenra's state law  action hinged on  the proof he offered  on the\n\n\"initiation\"  element.6  The  district court conceded  that Rhode\n\nIsland  case law  offered little  guidance  with respect  to what\n\nactions constitute initiation in cases involving police officers.\n\nNonetheless, the district court indicated early in the proceeding\n\nthat plaintiffs' case would benefit from evidence concerning what\n\n                    \n\n6  In order to survive a motion for judgment as a matter of  law,\nplaintiff must offer proof sufficient to  state a claim as to all\nelements of  the cause of  action.  It  is not disputed  that the\nalleged malicious  prosecution terminated  in Mr. Senra's  favor.\nActual  proof of malice  is not necessary  as it may  be inferred\nfrom the  absence of probable cause to prosecute.  Nagy, 392 A.2d\n                                                       \nat 367; De Fusco v. Brophy, 112 R.I.  461, 463 n.1, 311 A.2d 286,\n                          \n287  n.1 (1973).   Finally,  it is  clear that  the existence  of\nprobable cause to arrest, which  in this case is coterminous with\nprobable  cause to prosecute, was sufficiently in doubt since the\ndistrict court  allowed the claim  of false arrest  to go to  the\njury.   As  such, the  critical  inquiry, as  the district  court\nrealized, is whether defendants initiated the prosecution.\n\n                               -14-\n\ninformation  the  officers  transmitted  to  the  state  Attorney\n\nGeneral's office, what other  information the prosecuting officer\n\npossessed,  and who  finally  made  the  decision  to  prosecute.\n\n(Trial  Transcript at  21, Nov.  2,  1992).   The district  judge\n\nultimately  directed the verdict in favor of defendants, however,\n\nbecause he believed \"[t]here  [was] no evidence that  [the police\n\nofficers] initiated or  actively participated in the  bringing of\n\nthe  charges  by   the  Attorney  General's  Office   by  way  of\n\ninformation.\"    (Trial   Transcript  at  34,  Nov.   3,  1992).7\n\nAccording to the court, defendants were entitled to a judgment as\n\na  matter of  law  because (1)  the state  prosecuting attorney's\n\ndiscretionary decision  to prosecute  constituted an  intervening\n\ncause that insulated  defendant officers from liability,  and (2)\n\nMr. Senra failed to provide sufficient evidence about the process\n\nby which criminal  charges are brought to survive  the motion for\n\ndirected verdict.\n\n          We  agree  with the  district  court  that the  law  of\n\ninitiation in Rhode Island  is not clear.   We draw, however,  on\n\nthe  law  concerning  liability  for  private   persons  bringing\n\ninformation before the police.   The chain of causation is broken\n\nif the  filing of the  information by  the attorney at  the state\n\nAttorney  General's  office  was free  of  pressure  or influence\n\nexerted by the police  officers or knowing misstatements made  by\n\nthe officers  to the Attorney  General's office.  See  Dellums v.\n                                                              \n\n                    \n\n7   The charges in  this case were  brought by information.   See\n                                                                 \nRhode Island Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure 7.\n\n                               -15-\n\nPowell,  566  F.2d  167, 192-193  (D.C.

Page Keeton, Prosser &amp; Keeton\n                                                                 \n\non The Law of  Torts   119, at 872-73 &amp; nn.33-36  (5th ed. 1984).\n                    \n\nAt  the  time  the  district  court  directed   the  verdict  for\n\ndefendants, it  remained possible  that the  police officers  had\n\nlied about the events in question and had communicated that false\n\ninformation to state prosecutors.  If the evidence upon which the\n\nprosecutors based  the filing of  the information was  false, the\n\nstate prosecutors could not have exercised their discretion.   As\n\na result, the actions of the prosecutors would not have insulated\n\nthe  police officers from suit for  malicious prosecution.  Given\n\nthis  possibility,  the   district  court  therefore   improperly\n\ndirected the verdict for defendant officers at that time.\n\n          In light of the  jury's verdict, however, the error  is\n\nharmless.  The jury found in favor  of the police officers on the\n\nexcessive  force claim, finding that they reasonably responded to\n\nMr. Senra's behavior  the night that Mr. Senra  was arrested.  It\n\nfollows then that officers possessed sufficient information about\n\nMr.  Senra  to  charge  him with  assaulting  a  police  officer,\n\ndisorderly conduct,  and leaving the  scene of an accident.   The\n\njury's   verdict  therefore  precludes  a  finding  of  malicious\n\nprosecution.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                                                        \n\n                               -16-\n",

Sec. 1983 and various state laws.  Mr. Senra alleged that he had been falsely arrested and imprisoned, subjected to excessive force, and maliciously prosecuted;  Mrs. Senra claimed only that the officers had used excessive force against her during the arrest of her husband.  At the close of the evidence, the district court granted defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law on the malicious prosecution claims.  The remaining counts went to a jury, which found for the police officers.  The court then denied plaintiffs' motion for a new trial, and plaintiffs appealed.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 20, 1989, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Mr. Senra struck a neighbor's car while driving home.  Instead of stopping, he proceeded to his house just down the street, purportedly intending to settle the matter the next day.  The neighbor heard the accident and learned from a bystander that Mr. Senra had hit his car.  The neighbor called the police and went to Mr. Senra's home, where he was told to return in the morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senras claim that Mr. Senra answered the door when the police arrived, but before he could explain, he was grabbed by the officers, dragged out of the house, and thrown over some hedges in the front lawn.  During the struggle, his right arm, which was withered from polio, was broken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police officers offer a different version of the story.  They contend that no one answered when they originally knocked at the Senras' door.  Mr. Senra only appeared later after the officers remained in the yard to wait for a tow truck they had called to remove Mr. Senra's car.  The officers smelled alcohol on his breath and noticed that he was staggering.  Mr. Senra shouted vulgarities at the officers and flailed his arms.  He then lost his balance, tripped over the shrubbery, and fell to the ground.  At that point, Officer Laird approached Mr. Senra to restrain him and a struggle ensued.  The officers contend that Mr. Senra attempted to hit, kick, and bite Officer Laird and that Mr. Senra kicked Officer Cunningham in the groin when he tried to assist Officer Laird.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senras claim that, after Mr. Senra was attacked without provocation, Mrs. Senra sought to assist her husband.  They maintain that one of the officers hit her in the stomach, loosening stitches from her recent hysterectomy.  The officers assert that Mrs. Senra and her daughter struck and kicked them while they sought to restrain Mr. Senra.  Mrs. Senra ultimately locked herself in the car to prevent its removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the altercation subsided, Mr. Senra informed the officers of the pain in his arm.  He was taken to a hospital, where he learned that his arm was broken.  A nurse from the hospital testified that Mr. Senra was uncooperative, combative and vulgar when he arrived and that a blood test revealed that his blood alcohol level exceeded the permissible limit for driving a motor vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Senra was later charged with assaulting a police officer, disorderly conduct, and leaving the scene of an accident.  A jury acquitted him of assault, and a judge granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on the disorderly conduct charge.  The motor vehicle offense was administratively dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senras then brought this action in the district court seeking damages.  After an unfavorable outcome, the Senras appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senras first assign error to the district court's refusal to consider jury instructions that they offered shortly before the close of the evidence.  The court rejected the instructions because, in its view, the plaintiffs' proffer arrived too late, in violation of the court's Amended Pretrial Order.  That Order required the parties to submit \"full and complete proposed jury instructions\" to the court twenty days prior to trial.  The Senras claim that, notwithstanding the district court's broad power to organize and facilitate litigation pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16, requiring instructions much in advance of trial and refusing to consider instructions proposed before the close of the evidence conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 16 provides the district courts with a powerful mechanism to organize and expedite litigation.  The pretrial conferences contemplated by the Rule create an indispensable opportunity to clarify and delimit issues to be tried and to establish a timetable for the proceedings as a whole.  As such, the outcome of pretrial conferences are central to the litigation, for as the Rule states, pretrial orders \"shall control the subsequent course of the action unless modified by a subsequent order.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(e).  \"Trial judges enjoy great latitude in carrying out casemanagement functions.\"  Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty, 990 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993) (citing In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 859 F.2d 1007, 1019 (1st Cir.1988)).  The Rule also allows sanctions for noncompliance.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f).  The district court, for example, may refuse to hear testimony or give instructions on issues not originally encompassed by the pretrial order.  See generally Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary K. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 1527 (1990).  We review a district court's imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with pretrial orders only for abuse of discretion.  Jones, 990 F.2d at 5;  Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 920 F.2d 1072, 1075 (1st Cir.1990).  \"Although such a deferential approach does not confer carte blanche power to the district court,\" litigants bear a formidable burden to show that the district court erred.  Jones, 990 F.2d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court requested the jury instructions twenty days in advance of trial.  The pretrial order was not ambiguous and appellants offered two instructions within the time set by the court.  We have found no cases that even suggest that an order requiring jury instructions before trial would in any way violate the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Absent such a case, the district court's refusal to consider appellants' proffered instructions was not an abuse of discretion where appellants understood that the court had requested the instructions in advance of trial and had not shown that the tardily filed jury instructions pertained to a matter that was not foreseeable at the time set by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found no error in the court's refusal to consider appellants' proffered instructions, we turn to the appellants' objections to the instructions on appeal.  To preserve an objection on appeal to a jury instruction, a party must contemporaneously object to the instruction.  The exception must apprise the judge of the basis of the error.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 (\"No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\").  Failure to timely object waives the error on appeal.  See Elgabri v. Lekas, 964 F.2d 1255, 1258 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the record indicates that the jury retired to deliberate prior to appellants' objections to the jury instructions.  Appellants therefore have waived their exceptions.  We have reviewed, as we must, the claims of error made by appellants in relation to the instructions to ensure that there has been no plain error amounting to a miscarriage of justice.  See Elgabri, 964 F.2d at 1259;  Wells Real Estate, Inc. v. Greater Lowell Bd. of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803, 809 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 955, 109 S.Ct. 392, 102 L.Ed.2d 381 (1988).  We are satisfied that no such error exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senras contend that the district court erroneously admitted into evidence Officer Laird's knowledge of prior incidents of intoxication and domestic disturbance at Mr. Senra's home and evidence that Mr. Senra previously had been convicted of driving while intoxicated.  Officer Laird testified that he personally had been involved in at least six incidents in which the police were called to respond to domestic disturbances that resulted from Mr. Senra's drunken and violent behavior.  The drunk driving conviction occurred in 1986.  Mr. Senra argues that Federal Rules of Evidence 403, 404, 608, and 609 require exclusion of such evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Mr. Senra was not on trial as a defendant.  Rather, he sued the police officers for use of excessive force and false arrest.  To defend against an allegation of excessive force, defendant officers needed to demonstrate that their conduct was \"objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them.\"  Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989).  Defendant police officers introduced the testimony about Mr. Senra's prior conduct to explain the \"facts and circumstances\" that they confronted when they arrived at the Senra household and to demonstrate the reasonableness of their conduct.  Similarly, the officers proffered the fact of conviction to show a motivation for fleeing the scene of the accident.  They theorized that Mr. Senra left the accident because he wanted to avoid another drunk driving conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the officers explanation of their prior dealings with Mr. Senra, we find that the district court did not err by admitting the evidence.  The officers' prior knowledge of Mr. Senra is relevant because it sheds light on the reasonableness of their responses, a matter quite pertinent to the undue force claim.  Because the evidence is probative of a matter other than Mr. Senra's bad character, Rule 404(b) poses no bar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' Rule 403 challenge is likewise unavailing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Admittedly the evidence is of limited value to the officers since their version of the events on the night in question amply supported their actions without reference to prior bad conduct.  The prejudicial impact, however, cannot be considered significant in light of the officers' testimony concerning Mr. Senra's outrageous behavior on that night.  The officers testified that they smelled alcohol on Mr. Senra's breath and that Mr. Senra acted in a hostile manner by verbally and physically attacking them.  As such, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony.  See United States v. Walters, 904 F.2d 765, 768 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Mr. Senra's prior conviction for drunk driving, the district court admitted the evidence because it believed that the evidence was relevant to Mr. Senra's motivation for leaving the scene of the accident.  His motivation for leaving the scene was irrelevant, however, to any disputed issue in the case.  To justify arrest, it would be sufficient to know that he had departed.  The previous conviction therefore had no probative value.  It is also quite likely that the prior conviction would be inadmissible for impeachment under Rule 609.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming thus that it was error to admit evidence of the prior conviction, we consider whether the error was harmless.  \"The erroneous admission of evidence of earlier crimes is harmless if we determine that it is 'highly probable' that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\"  United States v. Gonzalez- Sanchez, 825 F.2d 572, 580 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting United States v. Bosch, 584 F.2d 1113, 1117-18 (1st Cir.1978)).  The jury was asked to choose between two contradictory versions of the events in question.  The verdict did not hinge on a particular piece of evidence or improper coloring provided by evidence of prior bad acts.  Because three sources (both officers and the hospital nurse) testified that Mr. Senra was intoxicated and belligerent on the night of the arrest, the effect of the evidence of prior incidents, which occurred at least two or more years earlier, was greatly muted.  If the jury believed the police and the hospital nurse, which it apparently did, Mr. Senra hit a parked car, fled the scene, and attacked the police in a drunken fit.  This evidence was more than sufficient to support a verdict for the defendants and remote incidents of similar conduct added little.  The improper admission of the evidence was therefore harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>Malicious Prosecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of all the evidence, the district court granted defendants judgment as a matter of law on Mr. Senra's action for malicious prosecution under Sec. 1983 and a pendent state law claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The district court directed the verdict of the Sec. 1983 claim because Mr. Senra had not demonstrated that the alleged misconduct rose to constitutional magnitude.  With respect to the state law claim, the court found that as a matter of law, Mr. Senra failed to show that defendants \"initiated\" the prosecution within the meaning of that term under Rhode Island law.  Mr. Senra now argues that the court erred in directing the verdict on both actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Under the accepted standard of appellate review, we 'examine the evidence and the inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmovant' to determine whether 'reasonable persons could reach but one conclusion.' \"  Veranda Beach Club v. Western Surety Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1375 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1987)).  \"In conducting that exercise, we may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\"  Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To state a federal claim for malicious prosecution under Sec. 1983, \"the complaint must assert that the malicious conduct was so egregious that it violated substantive or procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Torres v. Superintendent of Police, 893 F.2d 404, 409 (1st Cir.1990).  A substantive due process violation occurs when the malicious prosecution is \"conscience-shocking.\"  Id. at 410.  \"Where plaintiff has not been physically abused, detained, prosecuted due to racial or political motivation or otherwise deprived of equal protection of the law, courts are reluctant to find 'conscience shocking' conduct that would implicate a constitutional violation.\"  Id.  A procedural due process claim will lie where the alleged conduct deprived plaintiff of liberty by \"a distortion and corruption of the processes of law,\" such as \"falsification of evidence or some other egregious conduct resulting in a denial of a fair trial.\"  Id.  Furthermore, to establish a malicious prosecution claim under Sec. 1983 on the grounds that his right to procedural due process was violated, the plaintiff must \"show that there was no adequate state postdeprivation remedy available to rectify the harm.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" 'The federal claim under [42 U.S.C.] section 1983 for malicious prosecution differs from the state civil suit in that it requires that state officials acting 'under color of law' institute the criminal proceedings against the plaintiff and thereby deprive him of rights secured under the Constitution.' \"  Smith v. Massachusetts Dept. of Correction, 936 F.2d 1390, 1402 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting Torres, 893 F.2d at 409) (emphasis added in Smith ).   Malicious prosecution does not amount to a constitutional tort, unless the plaintiff has been deprived of life, liberty, or property, or another constitutional right.  Ayala-Martinez v. Anglero, 982 F.2d 26, 27 (1st Cir.1992) (citing Albright v. Oliver, 975 F.2d 343, 347 (7th Cir.1992) (holding that malicious prosecution, like defamation, does not amount to a constitutional tort, unless the plaintiff is deprived of his right to liberty by wrongful incarceration), cert. granted, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1382, 122 L.Ed.2d 757 (1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Senra clearly has not stated a claim under the substantive due process branch of the Sec. 1983 malicious prosecution analysis.  Mr. Senra did not allege that the police officers maliciously prosecuted him for racial or political reasons or to deprive him of equal protection of the law.  Nor has Mr. Senra stated a claim for a violation of his procedural due process rights because he failed to demonstrate the inadequacy of the state law malicious prosecution remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn then to whether the district court properly directed the verdict in favor of defendant officers on the state law malicious prosecution claim.  To establish a claim of malicious prosecution under Rhode Island law, a plaintiff must prove that (1) defendants initiated a criminal proceeding against him;  (2) with malice;  (3) and without probable cause;  which (4) terminated in plaintiff's favor.  Solitro v. Moffatt, 523 A.2d 858, 861-62 (R.I.1987);  Nagy v. McBurney, 120 R.I. 925, 929, 392 A.2d 365, 367 (1978).  In the district court, the success of Mr. Senra's state law action hinged on the proof he offered on the \"initiation\" element.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The district court conceded that Rhode Island case law offered little guidance with respect to what actions constitute initiation in cases involving police officers.  Nonetheless, the district court indicated early in the proceeding that plaintiffs' case would benefit from evidence concerning what information the officers transmitted to the state Attorney General's office, what other information the prosecuting officer possessed, and who finally made the decision to prosecute.  (Trial Transcript at 21, Nov. 2, 1992).  The district judge ultimately directed the verdict in favor of defendants, however, because he believed \"[t]here [was] no evidence that [the police officers] initiated or actively participated in the bringing of the charges by the Attorney General's Office by way of information.\"  (Trial Transcript at 34, Nov. 3, 1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  According to the court, defendants were entitled to a judgment as a matter of law because (1) the state prosecuting attorney's discretionary decision to prosecute constituted an intervening cause that insulated defendant officers from liability, and (2) Mr. Senra failed to provide sufficient evidence about the process by which criminal charges are brought to survive the motion for directed verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the law of initiation in Rhode Island is not clear.  We draw, however, on the law concerning liability for private persons bringing information before the police.  The chain of causation is broken if the filing of the information by the attorney at the state Attorney General's office was free of pressure or influence exerted by the police officers or knowing misstatements made by the officers to the Attorney General's office.  See Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d 167, 192-193 (D.C.Cir.1977);  Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 653 cmt. g;  W. Page Keeton, Prosser &amp; Keeton on The Law of Torts Sec. 119, at 872-73 &amp; nn. 33-36 (5th ed. 1984).  At the time the district court directed the verdict for defendants, it remained possible that the police officers had lied about the events in question and had communicated that false information to state prosecutors.  If the evidence upon which the prosecutors based the filing of the information was false, the state prosecutors could not have exercised their discretion.  As a result, the actions of the prosecutors would not have insulated the police officers from suit for malicious prosecution.  Given this possibility, the district court therefore improperly directed the verdict for defendant officers at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the jury's verdict, however, the error is harmless.  The jury found in favor of the police officers on the excessive force claim, finding that they reasonably responded to Mr. Senra's behavior the night that Mr. Senra was arrested.  It follows then that officers possessed sufficient information about Mr. Senra to charge him with assaulting a police officer, disorderly conduct, and leaving the scene of an accident.  The jury's verdict therefore precludes a finding of malicious prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>At the close of the evidence or at such earlier time during the trial as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests that the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the requests.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) provides in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.

As such, we will do so as well</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In order to survive a motion for judgment as a matter of law, plaintiff must offer proof sufficient to state a claim as to all elements of the cause of action.  It is not disputed that the alleged malicious prosecution terminated in Mr. Senra's favor.

Brophy, 112 R.I. 461, 463 n. 1, 311 A.2d 286, 287 n. 1 (1973).  Finally, it is clear that the existence of probable cause to arrest, which in this case is coterminous with probable cause to prosecute, was sufficiently in doubt since the district court allowed the claim of false arrest to go to the jury.  As such, the critical inquiry, as the district court realized, is whether defendants initiated the prosecution</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The charges in this case were brought by information.

Sec. 1983 and various state laws.  Mr. Senra alleged that he had been falsely arrested and imprisoned, subjected to excessive force, and maliciously prosecuted;  Mrs. Senra claimed only that the officers had used excessive force against her during the arrest of her husband.  At the close of the evidence, the district court granted defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law on the malicious prosecution claims.  The remaining counts went to a jury, which found for the police officers.  The court then denied plaintiffs' motion for a new trial, and plaintiffs appealed.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 20, 1989, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Mr. Senra struck a neighbor's car while driving home.  Instead of stopping, he proceeded to his house just down the street, purportedly intending to settle the matter the next day.  The neighbor heard the accident and learned from a bystander that Mr. Senra had hit his car.  The neighbor called the police and went to Mr. Senra's home, where he was told to return in the morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senras claim that Mr. Senra answered the door when the police arrived, but before he could explain, he was grabbed by the officers, dragged out of the house, and thrown over some hedges in the front lawn.  During the struggle, his right arm, which was withered from polio, was broken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police officers offer a different version of the story.  They contend that no one answered when they originally knocked at the Senras' door.  Mr. Senra only appeared later after the officers remained in the yard to wait for a tow truck they had called to remove Mr. Senra's car.  The officers smelled alcohol on his breath and noticed that he was staggering.  Mr. Senra shouted vulgarities at the officers and flailed his arms.  He then lost his balance, tripped over the shrubbery, and fell to the ground.  At that point, Officer Laird approached Mr. Senra to restrain him and a struggle ensued.  The officers contend that Mr. Senra attempted to hit, kick, and bite Officer Laird and that Mr. Senra kicked Officer Cunningham in the groin when he tried to assist Officer Laird.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senras claim that, after Mr. Senra was attacked without provocation, Mrs. Senra sought to assist her husband.  They maintain that one of the officers hit her in the stomach, loosening stitches from her recent hysterectomy.  The officers assert that Mrs. Senra and her daughter struck and kicked them while they sought to restrain Mr. Senra.  Mrs. Senra ultimately locked herself in the car to prevent its removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the altercation subsided, Mr. Senra informed the officers of the pain in his arm.  He was taken to a hospital, where he learned that his arm was broken.  A nurse from the hospital testified that Mr. Senra was uncooperative, combative and vulgar when he arrived and that a blood test revealed that his blood alcohol level exceeded the permissible limit for driving a motor vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Senra was later charged with assaulting a police officer, disorderly conduct, and leaving the scene of an accident.  A jury acquitted him of assault, and a judge granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on the disorderly conduct charge.  The motor vehicle offense was administratively dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senras then brought this action in the district court seeking damages.  After an unfavorable outcome, the Senras appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senras first assign error to the district court's refusal to consider jury instructions that they offered shortly before the close of the evidence.  The court rejected the instructions because, in its view, the plaintiffs' proffer arrived too late, in violation of the court's Amended Pretrial Order.  That Order required the parties to submit \"full and complete proposed jury instructions\" to the court twenty days prior to trial.  The Senras claim that, notwithstanding the district court's broad power to organize and facilitate litigation pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16, requiring instructions much in advance of trial and refusing to consider instructions proposed before the close of the evidence conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 16 provides the district courts with a powerful mechanism to organize and expedite litigation.  The pretrial conferences contemplated by the Rule create an indispensable opportunity to clarify and delimit issues to be tried and to establish a timetable for the proceedings as a whole.  As such, the outcome of pretrial conferences are central to the litigation, for as the Rule states, pretrial orders \"shall control the subsequent course of the action unless modified by a subsequent order.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(e).  \"Trial judges enjoy great latitude in carrying out casemanagement functions.\"  Jones v.

Absent such a case, the district court's refusal to consider appellants' proffered instructions was not an abuse of discretion where appellants understood that the court had requested the instructions in advance of trial and had not shown that the tardily filed jury instructions pertained to a matter that was not foreseeable at the time set by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found no error in the court's refusal to consider appellants' proffered instructions, we turn to the appellants' objections to the instructions on appeal.

Officer Laird testified that he personally had been involved in at least six incidents in which the police were called to respond to domestic disturbances that resulted from Mr. Senra's drunken and violent behavior.  The drunk driving conviction occurred in 1986.  Mr. Senra argues that Federal Rules of Evidence 403, 404, 608, and 609 require exclusion of such evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Mr. Senra was not on trial as a defendant.  Rather, he sued the police officers for use of excessive force and false arrest.

Defendant police officers introduced the testimony about Mr. Senra's prior conduct to explain the \"facts and circumstances\" that they confronted when they arrived at the Senra household and to demonstrate the reasonableness of their conduct.  Similarly, the officers proffered the fact of conviction to show a motivation for fleeing the scene of the accident.  They theorized that Mr. Senra left the accident because he wanted to avoid another drunk driving conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the officers explanation of their prior dealings with Mr. Senra, we find that the district court did not err by admitting the evidence.  The officers' prior knowledge of Mr. Senra is relevant because it sheds light on the reasonableness of their responses, a matter quite pertinent to the undue force claim.  Because the evidence is probative of a matter other than Mr. Senra's bad character, Rule 404(b) poses no bar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' Rule 403 challenge is likewise unavailing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Admittedly the evidence is of limited value to the officers since their version of the events on the night in question amply supported their actions without reference to prior bad conduct.  The prejudicial impact, however, cannot be considered significant in light of the officers' testimony concerning Mr. Senra's outrageous behavior on that night.  The officers testified that they smelled alcohol on Mr. Senra's breath and that Mr. Senra acted in a hostile manner by verbally and physically attacking them.  As such, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony.  See United States v. Walters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542855\"><a href=\"/opinion/542855/united-states-v-ira-glen-anthony-walters-united-states-v-neville-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 768 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Mr. Senra's prior conviction for drunk driving, the district court admitted the evidence because it believed that the evidence was relevant to Mr. Senra's motivation for leaving the scene of the accident.  His motivation for leaving the scene was irrelevant, however, to any disputed issue in the case.  To justify arrest, it would be sufficient to know that he had departed.  The previous conviction therefore had no probative value.  It is also quite likely that the prior conviction would be inadmissible for impeachment under Rule 609.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming thus that it was error to admit evidence of the prior conviction, we consider whether the error was harmless.  \"The erroneous admission of evidence of earlier crimes is harmless if we determine that it is 'highly probable' that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\"  United States v.

The jury was asked to choose between two contradictory versions of the events in question.  The verdict did not hinge on a particular piece of evidence or improper coloring provided by evidence of prior bad acts.  Because three sources (both officers and the hospital nurse) testified that Mr. Senra was intoxicated and belligerent on the night of the arrest, the effect of the evidence of prior incidents, which occurred at least two or more years earlier, was greatly muted.  If the jury believed the police and the hospital nurse, which it apparently did, Mr. Senra hit a parked car, fled the scene, and attacked the police in a drunken fit.  This evidence was more than sufficient to support a verdict for the defendants and remote incidents of similar conduct added little.

In the district court, the success of Mr. Senra's state law action hinged on the proof he offered on the \"initiation\" element.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The district court conceded that Rhode Island case law offered little guidance with respect to what actions constitute initiation in cases involving police officers.  Nonetheless, the district court indicated early in the proceeding that plaintiffs' case would benefit from evidence concerning what information the officers transmitted to the state Attorney General's office, what other information the prosecuting officer possessed, and who finally made the decision to prosecute.  (Trial Transcript at 21, Nov. 2, 1992).  The district judge ultimately directed the verdict in favor of defendants, however, because he believed \"[t]here [was] no evidence that [the police officers] initiated or actively participated in the bringing of the charges by the Attorney General's Office by way of information.\"  (Trial Transcript at 34, Nov. 3, 1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  According to the court, defendants were entitled to a judgment as a matter of law because (1) the state prosecuting attorney's discretionary decision to prosecute constituted an intervening cause that insulated defendant officers from liability, and (2) Mr. Senra failed to provide sufficient evidence about the process by which criminal charges are brought to survive the motion for directed verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the law of initiation in Rhode Island is not clear.  We draw, however, on the law concerning liability for private persons bringing information before the police.  The chain of causation is broken if the filing of the information by the attorney at the state Attorney General's office was free of pressure or influence exerted by the police officers or knowing misstatements made by the officers to the Attorney General's office.  See Dellums v. Powell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"350868\"><a href=\"/opinion/350868/honorable-ronald-v-dellums-v-james-m-powell-chief-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 192-193 (D.C.Cir.1977);  Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 653 cmt. g;  W.

At the time the district court directed the verdict for defendants, it remained possible that the police officers had lied about the events in question and had communicated that false information to state prosecutors.  If the evidence upon which the prosecutors based the filing of the information was false, the state prosecutors could not have exercised their discretion.  As a result, the actions of the prosecutors would not have insulated the police officers from suit for malicious prosecution.  Given this possibility, the district court therefore improperly directed the verdict for defendant officers at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the jury's verdict, however, the error is harmless.  The jury found in favor of the police officers on the excessive force claim, finding that they reasonably responded to Mr. Senra's behavior the night that Mr. Senra was arrested.
