NOONAN,\n\n                       Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                   v.\n\n                           STAPLES, INC.,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                                 Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,*\n          Torruella, Boudin, Wallace,** Lipez, and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF COURT\n\n                      Entered:   March 18, 2009\n\n\n     Staples's petition for rehearing en banc, construed also as a\npetition for panel rehearing, challenges the constitutionality of\nthe Massachusetts General Laws ch. 231, § 92, as construed in the\npanel's rehearing opinion. Since its initial brief, Staples has\nargued under the premise that the term \"actual malice\" in § 92\nmeans \"malevolent intent.\" Yet, Staples did not then challenge the\nconstitutionality of such a construction.     Thus, the rehearing\nopinion found that it need not consider the issue. See Rehearing\n\n*\n  Judge Lynch is recused from this case and did not participate in\nthe vote.\n**\n     Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\fOpinion at p. 17, n.7.\n\n     Staples now contends that it raised the issue in its initial\nbrief. But that brief simply acknowledged that the statute was not\nconstitutional as applied to a matter of public concern. Staples\ndid not timely argue that the present matter was a matter of public\nconcern or that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to a\nmatter of private concern.    That Staples did not timely raise the\nissue is also made clear by the fact that it has not, until now,\nfiled the notice required for a challenge to the constitutionality\nof a state statute.     See Fed. R. App. P. 44(b).    The issue is\nwaived, and the fact that the issue raises constitutional concerns\ndoes not save the waiver. See, e.g., Rosado-Quiñones v. Toledo,\n528 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2008) (deeming waived the \"question of law\nabout whether there is added First Amendment protection for public\nemployees' filing of lawsuits against their employers on matters in\nwhich the public has no interest\"); Pérez-Acevedo v. Rivero-Cubano,\n520 F.3d 26, 29 n.7 (1st Cir. 2008); see also Ins. Corp. of Ir. v.\nCompagnie Des Bauxites De Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703 (1982)\n(\"Because the requirement of personal jurisdiction represents first\nof all an individual [due process] right, it can, like other such\nrights, be waived.\").\n\n     Further, Staples has not shown that the constitutional issue\nis so clear that the panel should have acted sua sponte to strike\ndown a state statute, without the required notice to the state\nattorney general.   Staples still does not cite a case for the\nproposition that the First Amendment does not permit liability for\ntrue statements concerning matters of private concern.         The\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") case relied upon by\nStaples did not hold that truth is an absolute defense in private\nconcern cases, but rather that a private figure may recover for a\nnegligently made defamatory falsehood in a case of public concern.\nStone v. Essex County Newspapers, Inc., 330 N.E.2d 161, 164 (Mass.\n1975).   And the Supreme Court has stated that as to matters of\nprivate concern, the First Amendment does \"not necessarily force\nany change in at least some of the features of the common-law\nlandscape.\" Phila. Newspapers v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767, 775 (1986);\nsee also Dun & Bradstreet v. Greenmoss Builders, 472 U.S. 749, 761\n(1985) (\"In light of the reduced constitutional value of speech\ninvolving no matters of public concern, we hold that the state\ninterest adequately supports awards of presumed and punitive\ndamages -- even absent a showing of 'actual malice.'\"). In fact,\nwere the issue as clear-cut as Staples suggests, the SJC would not\nlikely have limited its own invalidation of § 92 to matters of\npublic concern. Shaari v. Harvard Student Agencies, 691 N.E.2d\n925, 929 (Mass. 1998) (\"To apply this statute to the defendants'\ntruthful defamatory statement concerning a matter of public\n\n                               -2-\n\fconcern, even if the statement is malicious, violates the First\nAmendment.\" (emphasis added)). Thus, whether § 92 is a \"feature[]\nof the common-law landscape\" left unchanged for matters of private\nconcern is an issue on which we now take no position.\n\n     Nor it is appropriate to now certify the question to the SJC.\nWe have answered the question of state law regarding the proper\ninterpretation of the statute, and Staples has not challenged that\nmatter on rehearing. The question of the constitutionality of that\nstate law under the First Amendment is a federal question, which we\ncould answer without certification. Though Staples suggests that\n§ 92 may violate the Massachusetts Constitution, it presents no\nargumentation whatsoever relating specifically to that contention.\nFurther, Staples should not be allowed to escape the consequences\nof waiver through certification.\n\n     The petition for rehearing having been denied by the panel of\njudges who decided the case, and the petition for rehearing en banc\nhaving been submitted to the active judges of this court and a\nmajority of the judges not having voted that the case be heard en\nbanc, it is ordered that the petition for rehearing and the\npetition for rehearing en banc be denied. The alternative request\nfor certification to the SJC is also denied.\n\n\n                              By the Court:\n\n                              /s/ Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk\n\n\n\n\ncc: Hon.

Thus, whether § 92 is a \"feature[] of the common-law landscape\" left unchanged for matters of private concern is an issue on which we now take no position.</p>\n<p>Nor it is appropriate to now certify the question to the SJC. We have answered the question of state law regarding the proper interpretation of the statute, and Staples has not challenged that matter on rehearing. The question of the constitutionality of that state law under the First Amendment is a federal question, which we could answer without certification. Though Staples suggests that § 92 may violate the Massachusetts Constitution, it presents no argumentation whatsoever relating specifically to that contention. Further, Staples should not be allowed to escape the consequences of waiver through certification.</p>\n<p>The petition for rehearing having been denied by the panel of judges who decided the case, and the petition for rehearing en banc having been submitted to the active judges of this court and a majority of the judges not having voted that the case be heard en banc, it is ordered that the petition for rehearing and the petition for rehearing en banc be <i>denied.</i> The alternative request for certification to the SJC is also <i>denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Judge Lynch is recused from this case and did not participate in the vote.</p>\n<p>[**]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n\n</div>",
