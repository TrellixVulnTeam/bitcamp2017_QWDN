D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Margaret D.

This appeal is a sequel to our en\n\nbanc decision in United States v. Giggey, 551 F.3d 27 (1st Cir.\n\n2008), in which we remanded a criminal case for re-sentencing.\n\nFollowing the new sentence the government now appeals; it does not\n\nchallenge the new sentence on the merits but requests that we ask\n\nthe Sentencing Commission to clarify how courts ought properly to\n\napply the Sentencing Guidelines to non-dwelling burglary.\n\n           The history of this case, elsewhere recounted, Giggey,\n\n551 F.3d at 30-32; United States v. Giggey, 501 F. Supp. 2d 237 (D.\n\nMe. 2007), can be abbreviated. On December 19, 2006, Giggey, along\n\nwith his brother and a juvenile male, set out to burglarize a\n\nbuilding in Lewiston, Maine.      To create a diversion, the three set\n\na series of small fires in a nearby vacant building; but the fires\n\nspread and razed four neighboring buildings that had received\n\nfunding   pursuant   to   a   federal   rehabilitation   grant   from   the\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. Giggey pled guilty to\n\nmaliciously destroying by fire a building owned by an organization\n\nthat received federal financial assistance.         18 U.S.C. § 844(f)\n\n(2006).\n\n           During sentencing, the district court found Giggey to be\n\na career offender, a category that embraces one who, being 18 or\n\nolder, commits a felony that is a \"crime of violence\" (or a drug\n\noffense) as defined by the guidelines and has at least two other\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fsuch convictions. U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a); see also 28 U.S.C. § 994(h)\n\n(2006).   Section 4B1.2(a) of the guidelines states that:\n\n           The term “crime of violence” means any offense\n           under federal or state law, punishable by\n           imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\n           that--\n\n           (1) has as an element the use, attempted use,\n           or threatened use of physical force against\n           the person of another, or\n\n           (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson,          or\n           extortion, involves use of explosives,         or\n           otherwise involves conduct that presents        a\n           serious potential risk of physical injury      to\n           another.1\n\n           This   career   offender   designation   increased   Giggey's\n\nguidelines range from 63 to 78 months to 151 to 188 months.          See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b).       Giggey's prior convictions supporting the\n\ndesignation were two earlier burglary convictions: one for the\n\nburglary of a garage in March 2000 for which Giggey received a two-\n\nyear sentence with all but 90 days suspended, and the second for\n\nthe burglary of a convenience store in June 2004 for which he\n\nreceived a 30-month sentence with all but four months suspended.\n\n           At the time of his initial sentence, the district court\n\nin designating Giggey a career offender was constrained by First\n\n\n     1\n      The Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e),\nwhich has other sentencing consequences not here relevant, uses\nsimilar language to define the phrase \"violent felony\" except that\nthe term \"burglary\" is not qualified by the phrase \"of a dwelling.\"\nId. § 924(e)(2)(B). In other respects cases construing the statute\nare also frequently authority as to the guideline.       See United\nStates v. Pratt, 568 F.3d 11, 19 n.7 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                                  -3-\n\fCircuit precedent holding that non-residential burglaries were per\n\nse crimes of violence.          See United States v. Sawyer, 144 F.3d 191,\n\n195-96 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 4-5\n\n(1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied 507 U.S. 1024 (1993).             Nevertheless,\n\nin sentencing Giggey as a career offender, the district judge--\n\npointing to developments since Sawyer and Fiore--urged this court\n\nto reconsider the holding of those cases.            Giggey was sentenced     to\n\n95 months' imprisonment, a downward variance from the Guidelines\n\nrange based on statutory factors.              18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n                  Giggey appealed, and this court en banc overruled Sawyer\n\nand Fiore, holding that the district court had to examine, using a\n\ncategorical approach, whether the predicate offenses \"present[ed]\n\na serious potential risk of physical injury.\" See Giggey, 551 F.3d\n\nat 38-39.          On remand, the district court held that Giggey's prior\n\nburglary offenses did not pose such a danger and that he was not a\n\ncareer       offender.      Giggey   was   then    sentenced   to   42   months'\n\nimprisonment, reflecting cooperation with the government and time\n\nspent being held on state charges.              The government now appeals.\n\n                  Under the categorical approach adopted by the Supreme\n\nCourt       and    repeatedly   reaffirmed,2    career   offender   designation\n\ndepends not on the conduct of the defendant in the case at hand but\n\n\n        2\n      See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600-02 (1990);\nChambers v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 687, 690-93 (2009); Begay v.\nUnited States, 128 S. Ct. 1581, 1584 (2008); James v. United\nStates, 550 U.S. 192, 201-02 (2007); Shepard v. United States, 544\nU.S. 13, 17 (2005).\n\n                                        -4-\n\fon whether the offense of conviction is one of those identified in\n\nthe relevant statute or guideline. As Taylor explained, sentencing\n\ncourts may \"look[] only to the statutory definitions of the prior\n\noffenses,    and   not    to   the    particular      facts       underlying    those\n\nconvictions.\"      495 U.S. at 600.         Accord Begay, 128 S. Ct. at 1584\n\n(\"In   determining    whether      this     crime   is   a   violent       felony,   we\n\nconsider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine it in\n\nterms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an\n\nindividual   offender      might     have    committed       it   on   a   particular\n\noccasion.\").\n\n            In other words, if the crime is one identified in the\n\nstatute or guideline--such as arson or extortion, U.S.S.G. §\n\n4B1.2(a)(2)--it counts as one of violence for career offender\n\npurposes, regardless of whether the defendant's own conduct was\n\nactually violent.        And if the defendant's crime does not have the\n\nuse of force as an enumerated element and is not an enumerated\n\ncrime or within the residual clause, it is irrelevant that the\n\ndefendant committed it in a violent way.                  The key is the crime\n\ncommitted, not the facts of the particular event.\n\n            In implementing this approach, the first step is to\n\nidentify the offense of conviction.                  Where the statute covers\n\nmultiple crimes--as where it is                 divided into categories--it is\n\nsometimes difficult to tell which subordinate crime is the offense\n\nof conviction; for this purpose alone, it is permissible to consult\n\n                                          -5-\n\fa restricted set of sources (e.g., indictment, plea colloquy, jury\n\ninstructions) to answer this question.           Shepard, 544 U.S. at 26;\n\nTaylor, 495 U.S. at 602.     But such information is       permissibly used\n\nnot to determine whether the defendant committed the crime in a way\n\nthat involved or threatened violence, but merely to help decide\n\nwhich offense he was convicted of by trial or plea.\n\n           The Maine statute embracing Giggey's prior crimes broadly\n\ndefines burglary to cover one who \"enters or surreptitiously\n\nremains   in   a   structure,   knowing   that   he   is   not   licensed   or\n\nprivileged to do so, with the intent to commit a crime therein,\"\n\nbut it then sub-categorizes burglaries, each of which is a separate\n\ncrime carrying a different penalty. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A,\n\n§ 401 (2000).      Giggey pled in both of the earlier cases to a class\n\nC burglary and so this is the offense that must be classified under\n\nthe guideline; unlike Shepard there is no uncertainty here as to\n\nwhich offense Giggey pled to.\n\n           Class C burglaries as defined under Maine law are a\n\nresidual category which, by contrast to class A or B burglaries, do\n\nnot involve firearms, other dangerous weapons, entry into dwellings\n\nor the infliction or attempt to inflict bodily injury. See Giggey,\n\n551 F.3d at 44 (Lipez, J., concurring in judgment).              Accordingly,\n\na class C burglary does not have as an element physical force\n\nagainst another, nor is it one of the crimes (such as burglary of\n\na dwelling) expressly named in the guideline. The question then is\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fwhether the class C burglary viewed categorically creates a risk of\n\nphysical injury comparable to that of the crimes listed in section\n\n4B1.2(a)(2) of the guidelines.                  Begay, 128 S. Ct. 1585.\n\n               Admittedly this comparability question may be difficult,\n\nbut answering it is what the categorical approach entails.                             By\n\n\"comparable,\" the Supreme Court means that the offense must be\n\n\"roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed.\"\n\nBegay, 128 S. Ct. at 1585.               James resolved a related burglary issue\n\nby common sense and analogy, 550 U.S. at 203-05; in Begay, the\n\nCourt found that DUI was different in the way or manner the risk\n\nwas   produced      and,       unlike    the    listed   crimes,      did   not   involve\n\n\"purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\"                     128 S. Ct. at 1586\n\n(internal      quotation        marks     omitted).      Most    recently,        Chambers\n\nfollowed a similar approach.                129 S. Ct. at 692-93.3\n\n               In   this       appeal,    the    government     has   not   argued    for\n\nreversal on the grounds that the district court mis-identified the\n\ncrime of conviction, that it mis-assessed the risk presented by the\n\nnature    of    class      C    burglary    or    that   it   improperly     considered\n\nevidence of Giggey's specific conduct. Instead, it urges our court\n\n\n      3\n      In Chambers the court held that failure to report for\nimprisonment does not satisfy ACCA's physical force, enumerated\ncrime, or serious potential risk of physical injury requirements,\nand is crime of inaction, not purposeful violent and aggressive\nconduct; in reaching this result the Court rejected the\ngovernment's argument that three individual cases showed violence\nby reference to United States Sentencing Commission report. 129 S.\nCt. at 691-93.\n\n                                               -7-\n\fto   stay   the   government's     appeal   and   request    the   Sentencing\n\nCommission to clarify whether non-dwelling burglary is a \"crime of\n\nviolence\" for career offender purposes.           Conceivably we could do\n\nso, although no exact precedent for this course is cited.                  Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Gondek, 65 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995) (advising\n\nthe Commission of a recurring problem after decision).\n\n            However, the Commission has been aware for some time of\n\nthe debate about non-dwelling burglaries and, even if it chose to\n\namend or clarify its existing guideline, that is usually a lengthy\n\nprocess.4   Further, it is not clear what help the Commission would\n\nbe likely to furnish where, under Taylor's approach, we face the\n\ntask of assessing the comparability of the risk of an offense as\n\ndefined by a particular state statute.            No doubt the Commission\n\ncould amend its guideline to enlarge or narrow its coverage, but an\n\nenlargement would not apply retroactively and a narrowing would not\n\nchange the result in this case.\n\n            Because   there   is   no   specification   of    error   by   the\n\ngovernment directed to the district court's reasoning or findings\n\nand the government's alternative request that we consult the\n\nCommission is unpromising, we dismiss the appeal.\n\n\n\n      4\n      As we explained in Giggey's first appeal, the Commission had\ntwo opportunities to make a definitive statement as to whether non-\nresidential burglaries should be enumerated as crimes of violence;\nit considered proposals in 1992 and 1993 to amend § 4B1.2 and its\ncommentary to provide a definitive answer, but each proposal\nfailed. Giggey, 551 F.3d at 34-35.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                    -9-\n\f",

Giggey,</i> 551 F.3d 27 (1st Cir.2008), in which we remanded a criminal case for re-sentencing. Following the new sentence the government now appeals; it does not challenge the new sentence on the merits but requests that we ask the Sentencing Commission to clarify how courts ought properly to apply the Sentencing Guidelines to non-dwelling burglary.</p>\n<p>The history of this case, elsewhere recounted, <i>Giggey,</i> 551 F.3d at 30-32; <i>United States v. Giggey,</i> 501 F.Supp.2d 237 (D.Me.2007), can be abbreviated. On December 19, 2006, Giggey, along with his brother and a juvenile male, set out to burglarize a building in Lewiston, Maine. To create a diversion, the three set a series of small fires in a nearby vacant building; but the fires spread and razed four neighboring buildings that had received funding pursuant to a federal rehabilitation grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Giggey pled guilty to maliciously destroying by fire a building owned by an organization that received federal financial assistance. 18 U.S.C. § 844(f) (2006).</p>\n<p>During sentencing, the district court found Giggey to be a career offender, a category that embraces one who, being 18 or older, commits a felony that is a \"crime of violence\" (or a drug offense) as defined by the guidelines and has at least two other such convictions. U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. § 994(h) (2006). Section 4B1.2(a) of the guidelines states that:</p>\n<blockquote>The term \"crime of violence\" means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>This career offender designation increased Giggey's guidelines range from 63 to 78 months to 151 to 188 months. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b). Giggey's prior convictions supporting the designation were two earlier burglary convictions: one for the burglary of a garage in March 2000 for which Giggey received a two-year sentence with all but 90 days suspended, and the second for the burglary of a convenience store in June 2004 for which he received a 30-month sentence with all but four months suspended.</p>\n<p>At the time of his initial sentence, the district court in designating Giggey a career <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> offender was constrained by First Circuit precedent holding that non-residential burglaries were per se crimes of violence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sawyer,</i> 144 F.3d 191, 195-96 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Fiore,</i> 983 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1992), <i>cert. denied</i> 507 U.S. 1024, 113 S.Ct. 1830, 123 L.Ed.2d 458 (1993). Nevertheless, in sentencing Giggey as a career offender, the district judgepointing to developments since <i>Sawyer</i> and <i>Fiore</i> urged this court to reconsider the holding of those cases. Giggey was sentenced to 95 months' imprisonment, a downward variance from the Guidelines range based on statutory factors. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).</p>\n<p>Giggey appealed, and this court <i>en banc</i> overruled <i>Sawyer</i> and <i>Fiore,</i> holding that the district court had to examine, using a categorical approach, whether the predicate offenses \"present[ed] a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" <i>See </i><i>Giggey,</i> 551 F.3d at 38-39. On remand, the district court held that Giggey's prior burglary offenses did not pose such a danger and that he was not a career offender. Giggey was then sentenced to 42 months' imprisonment, reflecting cooperation with the government and time spent being held on state charges. The government now appeals.</p>\n<p>Under the categorical approach adopted by the Supreme Court and repeatedly reaffirmed,<sup>[2]</sup> career offender designation depends not on the <i>conduct</i> of the defendant in the case at hand but on whether the <i>offense</i> of conviction is one of those identified in the relevant statute or guideline. As <i>Taylor</i> explained, sentencing courts may \"look[] only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\" 495 U.S. at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143. <i>Accord </i><i>Begay,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1584 (\"In determining whether this crime is a violent felony, we consider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\").</p>\n<p>In other words, if the crime is one identified in the statute or guidelinesuch as arson or extortion, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(2)it counts as one of violence for career offender purposes, regardless of whether the defendant's own conduct was actually violent.

By \"comparable,\" the Supreme Court means that the offense must be \"roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed.\" <i>Begay,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585. <i>James</i> resolved a related burglary issue by common sense and analogy, 550 U.S. at 203-05, 127 S.Ct. 1586; in <i>Begay,</i> the Court found that DUI was different in the way or manner the risk was produced and, unlike the listed crimes, did not involve \"purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\" 128 S.Ct. at 1586 (internal quotation marks omitted). Most recently, <i>Chambers</i> followed a similar approach. 129 S.Ct. at 692-93.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In this appeal, the government has not argued for reversal on the grounds that the district court mis-identified the crime of conviction, that it mis-assessed the risk presented by the nature of class C burglary or that it improperly considered evidence of Giggey's specific conduct. Instead, it urges our court to stay the government's appeal and request the Sentencing Commission to clarify whether non-dwelling burglary is a \"crime of violence\" for career offender purposes. Conceivably we could do so, although no exact precedent for this course is cited. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v.

Following the new sentence the government now appeals; it does not challenge the new sentence on the merits but requests that we ask the Sentencing Commission to clarify how courts ought properly to apply the Sentencing Guidelines to non-dwelling burglary.</p>\n<p>The history of this case, elsewhere recounted, <i>Giggey,</i> 551 F.3d at 30-32; <i>United States v. Giggey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2377835\"><a href=\"/opinion/2377835/united-states-v-giggey/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span> (D.Me.2007), can be abbreviated. On December 19, 2006, Giggey, along with his brother and a juvenile male, set out to burglarize a building in Lewiston, Maine. To create a diversion, the three set a series of small fires in a nearby vacant building; but the fires spread and razed four neighboring buildings that had received funding pursuant to a federal rehabilitation grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Giggey pled guilty to maliciously destroying by fire a building owned by an organization that received federal financial assistance. 18 U.S.C. § 844(f) (2006).</p>\n<p>During sentencing, the district court found Giggey to be a career offender, a category that embraces one who, being 18 or older, commits a felony that is a \"crime of violence\" (or a drug offense) as defined by the guidelines and has at least two other such convictions. U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. § 994(h) (2006). Section 4B1.2(a) of the guidelines states that:</p>\n<blockquote>The term \"crime of violence\" means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>This career offender designation increased Giggey's guidelines range from 63 to 78 months to 151 to 188 months. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b). Giggey's prior convictions supporting the designation were two earlier burglary convictions: one for the burglary of a garage in March 2000 for which Giggey received a two-year sentence with all but 90 days suspended, and the second for the burglary of a convenience store in June 2004 for which he received a 30-month sentence with all but four months suspended.</p>\n<p>At the time of his initial sentence, the district court in designating Giggey a career <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> offender was constrained by First Circuit precedent holding that non-residential burglaries were per se crimes of violence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sawyer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197981\"><a href=\"/opinion/197981/united-states-v-sawyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 195-96 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Fiore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597517\"><a href=\"/opinion/597517/united-states-v-anthony-fiore/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.1992), <i>cert. denied</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1024</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></span> (1993). Nevertheless, in sentencing Giggey as a career offender, the district judgepointing to developments since <i>Sawyer</i> and <i>Fiore</i> urged this court to reconsider the holding of those cases. Giggey was sentenced to 95 months' imprisonment, a downward variance from the Guidelines range based on statutory factors. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).</p>\n<p>Giggey appealed, and this court <i>en banc</i> overruled <i>Sawyer</i> and <i>Fiore,</i> holding that the district court had to examine, using a categorical approach, whether the predicate offenses \"present[ed] a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" <i>See </i><i>Giggey,</i> 551 F.3d at 38-39. On remand, the district court held that Giggey's prior burglary offenses did not pose such a danger and that he was not a career offender. Giggey was then sentenced to 42 months' imprisonment, reflecting cooperation with the government and time spent being held on state charges. The government now appeals.</p>\n<p>Under the categorical approach adopted by the Supreme Court and repeatedly reaffirmed,<sup>[2]</sup> career offender designation depends not on the <i>conduct</i> of the defendant in the case at hand but on whether the <i>offense</i> of conviction is one of those identified in the relevant statute or guideline. As <i>Taylor</i> explained, sentencing courts may \"look[] only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\" 495 U.S. at 600, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2143</span></a></span>. <i>Accord </i><i>Begay,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1584 (\"In determining whether this crime is a violent felony, we consider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\").</p>\n<p>In other words, if the crime is one identified in the statute or guidelinesuch as arson or extortion, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(2)it counts as one of violence for career offender purposes, regardless of whether the defendant's own conduct was actually violent. And if the defendant's crime does not have the use of force as an enumerated element and is not an enumerated crime or within the residual clause, it is irrelevant that the defendant committed it in a violent way. The key is the crime committed, not the facts of the particular event.</p>\n<p>In implementing this approach, the first step is to identify the offense of conviction. Where the statute covers multiple crimesas where it is divided into categoriesit is sometimes difficult to tell which subordinate crime is the offense of conviction; for this purpose alone, it is permissible to consult a restricted set of sources (<i>e.g.,</i> indictment, plea colloquy, jury instructions) to answer this question. <i>Shepard,</i> 544 U.S. at 26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span>; <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S. at 602, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2143</span></a></span>. But such information is permissibly used not to determine whether the defendant committed the crime in a way that involved or threatened violence, but merely to help <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> decide <i>which offense</i> he was convicted of by trial or plea.</p>\n<p>The Maine statute embracing Giggey's prior crimes broadly defines burglary to cover one who \"enters or surreptitiously remains in a structure, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so, with the intent to commit a crime therein,\" but it then sub-categorizes burglaries, each of which is a separate crime carrying a different penalty. Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, § 401 (2000). Giggey pled in both of the earlier cases to a class C burglary and so this is the offense that must be classified under the guideline; unlike <i>Shepard</i> there is no uncertainty here as to which offense Giggey pled to.</p>\n<p>Class C burglaries as defined under Maine law are a residual category which, by contrast to class A or B burglaries, do not involve firearms, other dangerous weapons, entry into dwellings or the infliction or attempt to inflict bodily injury. <i>See </i><i>Giggey,</i> 551 F.3d at 44 (Lipez, J., concurring in judgment). Accordingly, a class C burglary does not have as an element physical force against another, nor is it one of the crimes (such as burglary of a dwelling) expressly named in the guideline. The question then is whether the class C burglary <i>viewed categorically</i> creates a risk of physical injury comparable to that of the crimes listed in section 4B1.2(a)(2) of the guidelines. <i>Begay,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585.</p>\n<p>Admittedly this comparability question may be difficult, but answering it is what the categorical approach entails. By \"comparable,\" the Supreme Court means that the offense must be \"roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed.\" <i>Begay,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 1585. <i>James</i> resolved a related burglary issue by common sense and analogy, 550 U.S. at 203-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145743\"><a href=\"/opinion/145743/james-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Most recently, <i>Chambers</i> followed a similar approach. 129 S.Ct. at 692-93.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In this appeal, the government has not argued for reversal on the grounds that the district court mis-identified the crime of conviction, that it mis-assessed the risk presented by the nature of class C burglary or that it improperly considered evidence of Giggey's specific conduct. Instead, it urges our court to stay the government's appeal and request the Sentencing Commission to clarify whether non-dwelling burglary is a \"crime of violence\" for career offender purposes.
