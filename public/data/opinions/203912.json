George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Howard, Selya, and Hansen,*\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Joseph P. Kitteredge, with whom Rafanelli & Kitteredge,\nP.C., Brian Rogal, and Rogal & Donnellan, P.C., were on brief,\nfor appellant/cross-appellee.\n     Robert S. Sinsheimer, with whom Lauren Thomas and Denner\nPellegrino, LLP, were on brief, for appellee/cross-appellant.\n\n\n\n                             July 17, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f                HOWARD, Circuit Judge.          In 1998, despite the fact that\n\npolice had obtained DNA evidence excluding him as the perpetrator,\n\nEdmund Burke was arrested for murder and forced to spend a total of\n\nforty-two days in jail.             Burke subsequently filed a civil rights\n\nlawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against a panoply of those involved\n\nin the investigation of the crime, and after years of litigation,\n\na federal jury found Massachusetts State Police Trooper (Tpr.)\n\nSteven McDonald liable for violating Burke’s Fourth Amendment\n\nrights and awarded $400,000 in damages.              After trial, the district\n\ncourt denied Tpr. McDonald’s motions for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw,       a   new   trial,   and    remittitur.      The   court    also   awarded\n\nattorneys' fees to Burke, although it reduced the amount of the\n\nfees       award     from   the   requested   $292,463.50    (plus    expenses   of\n\n$34,358.55) to $118,882.50 (plus expenses of $12,632.89) on the\n\nground that Burke’s success was “decidedly partial.”1\n\n                Both parties now appeal decisions of the district court:\n\nTpr. McDonald appeals the decision not to limit damages (and\n\nevidence thereof) to the period between arrest and arraignment;\n\nBurke, as cross-appellant, appeals the attorneys' fees reduction.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      These figures are drawn from the district court's Order\nAwarding Attorneys' Fees, which notes that Burke's underlying fee\napplication asked for $294,024.50, but that the application\n\"mistakenly includes hours that the plaintiff subsequently\nvoluntarily withdrew.\" The parties on appeal do not dispute the\ndistrict court's correction.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f            Discerning no errors in the district court's handling of\n\nthe case on either matter, we affirm.\n\nI.   Background\n\n           A.   The Factual Milieu\n\n           Because we had the opportunity to develop the factual\n\ncontext of this case in some depth when considering an appeal from\n\nthe district court's prior entry of summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants, see Burke v. Town of Walpole (Burke I), 405 F.3d 66\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (vacating the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment as to Burke's Fourth Amendment § 1983 claim against Tpr.\n\nMcDonald, and affirming in all other respects), we will limit our\n\nfactual exposition to a summary of the necessary details.             Except\n\nwhere   indicated,   these   facts   are   not   in   serious   dispute   for\n\npurposes of these appeals.\n\n           On December 1, 1998, Irene Kennedy, a 75-year-old woman,\n\nwas the victim of a particularly grisly murder involving a severe\n\nbeating, strangulation, and multiple stab wounds.               The victim's\n\nbreasts, which were exposed when her body was found in a wooded\n\nWalpole, Massachusetts park, each bore a human bite mark.                 The\n\nensuing investigation into the crime included the collection of DNA\n\nsamples in the form of saliva from the bite marks on the victim's\n\nbody, and of saliva and other forensic samples from Burke, a\n\nsuspect in the crime.    Because Massachusetts did not at that time\n\noperate a facility capable of expedited DNA analysis of multiple-\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fsource samples, the samples were sent to the Maine Crime Laboratory\n\nfor   immediate     analysis   by   Theresa   Calicchio,    a    forensic   DNA\n\nchemist.\n\n            Calicchio testified at the trial in this case that, on\n\nthe morning of December 10, 1998, she called Tpr. McDonald and told\n\nhim that the DNA analysis had excluded Burke as the source of DNA\n\ncollected from the victim's body.2          Tpr. McDonald, however, failed\n\nto convey this information to his colleagues, this despite the fact\n\nthat he successfully conveyed the findings of other non-DNA bite\n\nmark analyses that implicated Burke in the crime.               As a result, a\n\nwarrant application was filed that afternoon which omitted any\n\nmention of the DNA results, and an arrest warrant issued shortly\n\nthereafter.\n\n            Burke    was   arrested   at    his   home   that   afternoon   and\n\ndetained overnight, prior to being arraigned in state court the\n\nnext day.     Shortly after the arraignment began, Tpr. Kevin Shea,\n\nTpr. McDonald's colleague and co-investigator into the murder of\n\n\n      2\n      Whether Calicchio actually told Tpr. McDonald that Burke was\nexcluded on the day of the arrest was hotly contested at trial, and\nTpr. McDonald maintains on appeal that the evidence supporting\nCalicchio's version of events is insufficient to support a finding\nof liability, thereby entitling him to judgment as a matter of law.\nWe disagree. Calicchio testified that she \"told [Tpr. McDonald]\nthat Ed Burke was excluded,\" and when asked if she had any doubt\nabout that fact, she stated, \"No, no doubt.\" Suffice it to say\nthat \"it was the jury's role to assess the credibility of witnesses\nand to resolve inconsistencies in the evidence.\"      Wagenmann v.\nAdams, 829 F.2d 196, 206 (1st Cir. 1987); see also Ayala-Rodriguez\nv. Rullan, 511 F.3d 232, 237 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Credibility issues\nare for the jury . . . .\").\n\n                                      -4-\n\fMrs. Kennedy, entered the courtroom and interrupted Assistant\n\nDistrict Attorney (ADA) Gerald Pudolsky mid-argument.                 The facts\n\nsurrounding this event are disputed. In essence, it is McDonald's\n\nand Shea's contention that McDonald called Shea and told him about\n\nthe DNA exclusion of Burke, thereby leading Tpr. Shea to interrupt\n\nADA    Pudolsky.       At    trial,   however,    Burke   marshaled   evidence,\n\ndiscussed in detail below, suggesting that the results of the DNA\n\ntest    were   never        communicated   from    Tpr.   McDonald    to   those\n\nresponsible for prosecuting the arraignment hearing, or to the\n\npresiding magistrate.\n\n            In any event, it is undisputed that after Tpr. Shea\n\ninterrupted the arraignment and spoke to ADA Pudolsky, ADA Pudolsky\n\nwas left with the impression that \"some evidence\" had \"come to\n\nlight.\"    He requested a recess, called his supervisors, and was\n\ntold (he does not remember by whom) that            \"more testing\" of the DNA\n\nwas required before any definitive result could be obtained.                ADA\n\nPudolsky then sought and secured Burke's detention without bail.\n\nBurke spent the next forty-one days in custody until, after palm\n\nprints provided by Burke pursuant to court order revealed that\n\nBurke was not the source of a palm print on the victim's body, the\n\ndistrict attorney filed a nolle prosequi in the case on the ground\n\nthat Burke's prosecution was premature.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f              B.   The Instant Litigation\n\n              Burke subsequently filed a civil rights action in state\n\ncourt against the Town of Walpole, the dentist who provided the\n\nnon-DNA bite mark analysis, and various officers and supervisors of\n\nthe Walpole Police Department in their individual and official\n\ncapacities.        In addition to a § 1983 claim, he claimed defamation\n\nbased    on   having    been   publicly     identified   as   Mrs.   Kennedy's\n\nmurderer.      Shortly thereafter, Burke filed a similar lawsuit in\n\nfederal court against various Massachusetts State Police troopers,\n\nemployees of the Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner's Office, and\n\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts.              After the state case was\n\nremoved to federal court, Burke amended his complaint to combine\n\nthe two cases, and then amended his complaint two more times to add\n\nclaims of negligence against the Commonwealth and to join a second\n\ndentist as a defendant.           His attempt to amend the complaint a\n\nfourth time was denied.\n\n              In time, the district court granted summary judgment to\n\nall defendants on all claims, and Burke appealed.             As noted above,\n\nwe affirmed the district court in every respect except for one:             we\n\nvacated the grant of summary judgment to Tpr. McDonald on Burke's\n\n§ 1983 claim alleging a Fourth Amendment violation, concluding that\n\n\"the    record     contains    evidence,    sufficient   to   create   a   jury\n\nquestion, that he intentionally or recklessly withheld exculpatory\n\nDNA evidence from the magistrate who issued the warrant to arrest\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fBurke, and a reasonable officer would know that such conduct\n\nviolated a clearly established Fourth Amendment right.\"                  Burke I,\n\n405 F.3d at 70.\n\n           Before,     during,      and    after   the    ensuing     trial,   Tpr.\n\nMcDonald maintained in the district court his position that he\n\nshould   not    be   found    liable      for   damages    incurred    after   the\n\narraignment.     In support of this position, Tpr. McDonald cited\n\nevidence, which he characterized as uncontroverted, suggesting that\n\nhe had made a full disclosure of the exculpatory DNA evidence to\n\nthe prosecution before ADA Pudolsky requested Burke's continued\n\ndetention without bail. In McDonald's view, the district attorney,\n\nwho after Tpr. McDonald's disclosure had all available information\n\nabout the evidence inculpating and exculpating Burke, made a fully-\n\ninformed and independent decision to ask for continued detention,\n\nand a fully-informed magistrate agreed.              Tpr. McDonald argued to\n\nthe district court, and maintains on appeal, that the arraignment\n\ntherefore cut off the damages for which he can be liable, either as\n\na matter of law or as a matter of fact.\n\n           The district court disagreed, and instead submitted the\n\nquestion   to    the   jury    as    a    matter   of     proximate    cause   and\n\nconsequential damages.         The court instructed the jury that \"the\n\nplaintiff must establish the defendant's acts were the proximate\n\ncause of injuries to him and consequent damages sustained by him.\"\n\nAdditionally, after defining and explaining the term \"proximate\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fcause\"   and    emphasizing   that   an    intervening   cause   cuts   off\n\nliability,3 the court instructed:\n\n           In this case it is the defendant's contention\n           that even if he had withheld material\n           information   from  other   investigators  on\n           December 10th, he disclosed that the DNA\n           testing had excluded Mr. Burke at the time of\n           the arraignment on December 11th, so that any\n           continued detention of Mr. Burke after that\n           time could not have been caused by his\n           withholding of information.    That is also a\n           factual issue for you to determine -- for you\n           to resolve, if, of course, you find that\n           Trooper McDonald had withheld information\n           prior to the application for a warrant.\n\n           Before the jury retired, the district court held a\n\nsidebar discussion and invited objections and corrections to its\n\ninstructions.    Tpr. McDonald's attorney objected, to no avail, as\n\nfollows:   \"Your Honor, just for the record, I wanted to state that\n\nI believe I'm entitled to as a matter of law instruction that the\n\nprobable cause determination by the Court on the 11th terminates\n\nany exposure my client has to damages.\"           This objection was in\n\naddition to an instruction that Tpr. McDonald had proposed, also to\n\nno avail, which would have instructed:\n\n           [Y]ou may award [the Plaintiff] only such\n           damages as will reasonably compensate him for\n           such injury and damages as you find, from a\n           preponderance of the evidence in the case,\n           that he sustained from the time of his arrest\n           until when the DNA results were disclosed.\n           You are not permitted to award any damages you\n           find the Plaintiff may have suffered following\n\n\n     3\n      Tpr. McDonald has not challenged the district                court's\ninstructions as to the meaning of \"proximate cause.\"\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           when the DNA results were disclosed by the\n           Defendant.\n\n           The jury found in favor of Burke using a general verdict\n\nform, and a flurry of post-trial motions followed.          Among them was\n\nBurke's request for attorneys' fees, originally in the amount of\n\n$324,859.75, but voluntarily reduced to $292,463.50 after a filing\n\nfrom Tpr. McDonald challenged the amount.            The district court\n\nfurther   reduced   the   fee   award   to   $118,882.50,   declaring   the\n\nplaintiff's success \"decidedly partial.\"            In arriving at this\n\namount, the district court depended heavily on the fact that the\n\nplaintiff obtained a jury verdict against \"only one of twenty-one\n\ndefendants on only one of sixteen causes of action.\"4\n\n           As for the amount of the reduction, the district court\n\ndescribed the time and billing records as providing \"little, if any\n\nbasis for determining what work reflected in them was done to\n\ndevelop what claims,\" and therefore made a \"proportional estimate\"\n\nthat, prior to Burke I, \"it is fair to estimate that 15% of the .\n\n. . work was of direct or indirect benefit to the plaintiff's\n\n\n     4\n      The court also awarded $12,632.89 in total expenses, an\namount arrived at by way of the same global eighty-five percent\nreduction that was applied to the claimed attorneys' fees. It is\nunclear whether Burke intends his cross-appeal to encompass the\ndistrict court's decision to reduce the expenses: except for a few\npassing references to costs, the brief complains only of the \"fees\"\nreduction and refers only to \"time\" records and \"time spent\"; not\nsurprisingly, Tpr. McDonald takes the position that Burke has made\n\"no argument challenging . . . the reduction of costs.\" But the\nmatter is immaterial to our decision, for to the extent it has been\nappealed, we affirm the district court's reduction of expenses for\nsubstantially the same reasons we affirm its fee award.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fability to prevail on his [successful] claim against McDonald.\"\n\nThe district court recognized only 15% of the claimed pre-Burke I\n\nhours, added them to the hours spent on the case after Burke I\n\n(100% of which were recognized), and proceeded to calculate the\n\nfinal award using the \"lodestar method.\"5              Both parties appealed.\n\nII.   TPR. MCDONALD'S APPEAL\n\n            The gravamen of Tpr. McDonald's appeal is simply put: he\n\nbelieves   that   his     liability   is   limited     to   the   damages   Burke\n\nincurred between the arrest and the arraignment.              He advances this\n\nposition with three related arguments.           First, he argues that the\n\ndistrict court should have cut off the damages as a matter of law\n\nwith a legal ruling before trial, an instruction to the jury not to\n\nconsider damages incurred after the arraignment, a post-trial\n\njudgment as a matter of law, or a remittitur.6                     Second, Tpr.\n\nMcDonald argues that even if the district court was theoretically\n\ncorrect    in   framing    McDonald's      potential    liability    for    post-\n\narraignment damages as a question of proximate cause, in this case\n\nthe prosecutors' informed and independent decision to proceed with\n\n\n      5\n      The \"lodestar method\" of calculating attorneys' fees awards\nrequires the district judge to multiply the number of hours\nproductively expended by counsel by a reasonable hourly rate. See\nDe Jesus Nazario v. Morris Rodriguez, 554 F.3d 196, 207 (1st Cir.\n2009). The resulting amount is presumptively reasonable, Lipsett\nv. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir. 1992), although the district\ncourt enjoys some discretion to adjust the lodestar amount upwards\nor downwards, see De Jesus Nazario, 554 F.3d at 207.\n      6\n      McDonald's challenge to the size of the verdict stands or\nfalls on his intervening cause argument.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fthe arraignment should have cut off his damages as a matter of law.\n\nThird, Tpr. McDonald argues that the evidence of his liability for\n\npost-arraignment damages was insufficient on any theory to support\n\nthe jury's verdict.\n\n           A.   Standards of Review\n\n           \"We review the district court's denial of a motion for\n\njudgment   as   a    matter   of   law,   including   legal    decisions   made\n\ntherein,   de       novo.\"     Mass.

Discussion\n\n           For his argument that the district court should have\n\nlimited his liability for damages to the period preceding the\n\narraignment, Tpr. McDonald relies primarily on the Supreme Court's\n\nstatement in Heck v. Humphrey that \"'If there is a false arrest\n\nclaim, damages for that claim cover the time of detention up until\n\nissuance of process or arraignment, but no more.'\"        512 U.S. 477,\n\n484 (1994) (quoting    W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on\n\nLaw of Torts 888 (5th ed., 1984)).          The appellant correctly\n\nacknowledges, however, that an exception to that rule exists where\n\nfacts are withheld from the prosecutor or judge such that the\n\naffected official(s) cannot be understood to have exercised an\n\ninformed, independent judgment.     See Wagenmann, 829 F.2d 196, 211\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (observing, in action against police officer for\n\nviolating, inter alia, right to be free from excessive bail, \"if a\n\nperson wrongfully brings about an end by manipulating another,\" in\n\nthis case the court clerk responsible for setting the bail, \"the\n\nnaked fact that he lacked . . . authority to accomplish the end by\n\nhimself does not provide an impenetrable shield\" against damages);\n\nsee also, Harper v. City of Los Angeles, 533 F.3d 1010, 1027 (9th\n\nCir. 2008) (citing Smiddy v. Varney, 665 F.2d 261, 266 (9th Cir.\n\n1981))   (prosecutor's   decision   to   proceed   does   not   cut   off\n\n\n                                -13-\n\finvestigating officers' liability where plaintiff can show that the\n\nprosecutor was pressured or caused by the investigating officers to\n\nact contrary to his independent judgment); Townes v. City of New\n\nYork, 176 F.3d 138, 147 (2d Cir. 1999); Jones v. City of Chicago,\n\n586 F.2d 985, 994 (7th Cir. 1988).     Thus, bearing in mind the\n\napplicable standard of review, Tpr. McDonald's appeal of the\n\ndistrict court's refusal to enter judgment as a matter of law must\n\nfail if, when viewing the facts and drawing inferences in the light\n\nmost favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could have found\n\nthat Tpr. McDonald withheld the exclusionary DNA test results from\n\nthe prosecutors and the magistrate in a manner that prevented those\n\nofficials from making informed and independent decisions.7\n\n          On the record before us, no stretch of imagination is\n\nrequired to fathom how a rational jury could have so found.    For\n\ninstance, the jury could have credited the testimony of Walpole\n\n\n\n     7\n      In their briefs, the parties debate whether an independent\nFourth Amendment malicious-prosecution claim is cognizable under §\n1983, an open question in this circuit. See Nieves v. McSweeney,\n241 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"It is an open question whether\nthe Constitution permits the assertion of a section 1983 claim for\nmalicious prosecution on the basis of an alleged Fourth Amendment\nviolation.\"). We need not reach that question here; it suffices to\nrepeat that \"the essential elements of actionable section 1983\nclaims derive first and foremost from the Constitution itself, not\nnecessarily from the analogous common law tort.\" Calero-Colon v.\nBetancourt-Lebron, 68 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995); id. at 5 (Lynch,\nJ., concurring) (same); cf. Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 270\nn.4 (1994) (\"[T]he extent to which a claim of malicious prosecution\nis actionable under § 1983 is one on which there is an embarrassing\ndiversity of judicial opinion.\" (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n\n                               -14-\n\fPolice Officer James Dolan, called by Burke as a hostile witness,\n\nthat the information presented to the magistrate at the arraignment\n\ndid not include the exculpatory DNA test results that, according to\n\nCalicchio, had already been tendered to Tpr. McDonald.    The jury\n\ncould also have disbelieved Tpr. McDonald's testimony that he fully\n\ninformed the prosecutors involved in the bail decision about the\n\nDNA test results. Tpr. McDonald claimed to have unburdened himself\n\nto First Assistant District Attorney John Kivlan directly on the\n\nday of the arraignment, but ADA Kivlan was never called to testify,\n\nnor was any other evidence offered to support McDonald's assertion.\n\n          The jury might well have determined that Tpr. McDonald's\n\ntestimony was nakedly self-serving and not credible. Tpr. McDonald\n\nalso claimed to have informed ADA Pudolsky of Burke's exclusion by\n\nway of Tpr. Shea, who testified that he told ADA Pudolsky that\n\nBurke was excluded when he interrupted the arraignment.    But the\n\nrest of the evidence does not fully corroborate that account.\n\nAmong the infirmities in Tpr. McDonald's version of events is the\n\nfact that, while both Tprs. McDonald and Shea testified that Tpr.\n\nMcDonald told Tpr. Shea that \"Burke is excluded\" based on the DNA\n\ntest results, and while Tpr. Shea testified that he passed this\n\nmessage on to ADA Pudolsky, ADA Pudolsky testified that Tpr. Shea\n\nonly told him to \"go downstairs and call\" his supervisors, leaving\n\nADA Pudolsky with the impression that there was \"some evidence\"\n\nthat had \"come to light.\"   ADA Pudolsky did not testify that Tpr.\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fShea told him that Burke was excluded, nor did he testify that Tpr.\n\nShea so much as mentioned DNA or test results to him.        The gap\n\nbetween these two versions of this chain of events -- Tprs.\n\nMcDonald and Shea's version on the one hand, and ADA Pudolsky's on\n\nthe other -- was wide enough to accommodate the inference that Tpr.\n\nMcDonald did not, in fact, unburden himself to the prosecution by\n\nway of Tpr. Shea.\n\n             Other evidence before the jury bolstered this inference,\n\nsuch as the fact that ADA Pudolsky, after phoning his supervisors,\n\nargued to the magistrate that the DNA test results were ambiguous\n\nas to Burke's culpability, a position he would have been unlikely\n\nto adopt had he heard Calicchio's opinion, which she said she\n\nrendered to Tpr. McDonald the previous day, that the DNA test\n\nresults unquestionably excluded Burke.      The jury also heard that\n\nTprs. Shea and McDonald were colleagues and that both participated\n\nin the investigation and arrest of Burke, thus providing at least\n\nsome basis for the jury to infer that the two troopers might have\n\nhad untoward incentives or inclinations to corroborate each other's\n\ntestimony.      When taken together, these additional facts could\n\nreasonably have led the jury to discount Tprs. McDonald's and\n\nShea's testimony about what disclosures Tpr. McDonald made to whom,\n\nand when.8\n\n\n     8\n      As a postscript to our discussion of this evidence, we\nbriefly note that Calicchio testified at trial that, the day before\nthe arraignment, she spoke to Robert Martin, a chemist for the\n\n                                 -16-\n\f          None of the evidence just described leads inexorably to\n\nthe conclusion that Tpr. McDonald failed to disclose the DNA test\n\nresults to the prosecution, but we need no such certainty to reject\n\nMcDonald's argument that his liability for damages must end, as a\n\nmatter of law, when the prosecutors weighed in at the bail hearing.\n\nAll that is required is a finding that, when these facts are viewed\n\nin the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could\n\nhave found that Tpr. McDonald failed to disclose what he knew, and\n\nthat this failure prevented the magistrate and prosecutors from\n\nmaking informed, independent judgments.    The evidence discussed\n\nabove supports that finding.9\n\n\nMassachusetts State Police Crime Laboratory, and that during this\nconversation she may have advised him that Burke was excluded. She\nalso testified that, on the day of the arraignment, she spoke to\nRichard Iwanicki, then a forensic chemist with the Massachusetts\nState Police, and that in the context of discussing the specific\nprocedures used in the DNA tests, she did in fact advise him of\nBurke's exclusion. What was said between Calicchio, Martin, and\nIwanicki, and whether those discussions sufficiently broke the\nchain of causation between Tpr. McDonald's failure to disclose what\nhe knew of the DNA test results and Burke's eventual damages, were,\nfor the reasons provided herein, questions appropriately left to\nthe jury.\n     9\n      This is so even assuming -- without deciding -- that Tpr.\nMcDonald is correct to assert that the \"presumption of regularity\"\nthat often attaches to a prosecutor's charging decision in the\ncontext of retaliatory-prosecution actions, see Hartman v. Moore,\n547 U.S. 250, 263 (2006), could also attach to the prosecutors'\ndecision at the arraignment to seek Burke's continued detention in\nthis case. In light of the exclusionary DNA test results already\nin Tpr. McDonald's hands, probable cause to detain Burke was\nlacking, see id. at 265 (describing \"the significance of probable\ncause or the lack of it\" as one fact having \"obvious evidentiary\nvalue\" when determining liability in the context of prosecutorial\ndecisions urged by investigating officers); moreover, probable\n\n                                -17-\n\f           None of Tpr. McDonald's other arguments in support of his\n\nappeal fare better.      We find no cognizable error in the district\n\ncourt's jury instructions, which framed the question of damages as\n\na matter of proximate cause.           This approach to the issue is\n\nconsistent with Supreme Court precedent emphasizing that liability\n\nunder § 1983 flows against the defendant for all damages that are\n\nthe \"natural consequences of his actions.\"        Malley v. Briggs, 475\n\nU.S. 335, 344 n.7 (1986) (quoting Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187\n\n(1961)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Indeed, in Wagenmann we upheld a jury verdict against a\n\npolice   officer   who   manipulated    the   independent   and   informed\n\ndecisions of judicial officers after the jury instructions had put\n\nthe question of damages in terms of causation.       829 F.2d at 211-13.\n\nIn so doing, we noted that \"[t]he law looks to causation in fact\"\n\nwhen assessing damages, id. at 211, and that the evidence supported\n\n\"the finding that [the defendant officer] proximately caused bail\n\nto be set,\" id. at 212 (emphasis added).        We also emphasized that\n\n§ 1983 \"should be read against the background of tort liability\n\nthat makes a man responsible for the natural consequences of his\n\nactions,\" id. (quoting Monroe, 365 U.S. at 187), and endorsed \"the\n\nuse of traditional tort principles for making intervening cause\n\n\n\ncause aside, the jury could easily have inferred from the evidence\ndescribed above that the prosecutors' decision was in fact\ninfluenced by Tpr. McDonald's failure to disclose the DNA test\nresults.\n\n                                  -18-\n\fdeterminations in the § 1983 milieu,\" id. (citing Springer v.\n\nSeaman, 821 F.2d 871, 877 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n           The district court's instructions were correct as a\n\nmatter of substantive law. They properly and clearly explained the\n\nconcept   of     proximate   causation,    and   plainly   and     concretely\n\ncommitted the question of whether Tpr. McDonald disclosed the DNA\n\ntest results to the prosecution at the time of the arraignment to\n\nthe judgment of the jury.         The instructions also substantially\n\nincorporated Tpr. McDonald's position that, so long as he timely\n\ndisclosed the DNA test results to the prosecution, he should not\n\nbear liability for damages after the arraignment. The instructions\n\ntherefore were not erroneous.\n\n           For     similar   reasons,     we   are   unpersuaded    by   Tpr.\n\nMcDonald's argument that the district court's decision to allow\n\nevidence on the conditions of Burke's post-arraignment confinement\n\nso confused the jury as to taint the damages award.           The jury was\n\ninstructed not to consider this evidence if it found that Tpr.\n\nMcDonald disclosed the DNA test results to the prosecutors at the\n\ntime of the arraignment, and we presume that the jury understood\n\nand followed those instructions.          See Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary,\n\n552 F.3d at 58 n.12 (citing United States v. Griffin, 524 F.3d 71,\n\n78 (1st Cir. 2008)); see also id. at 73 (\"Where, as here, the jury\n\nheard a legally adequate instruction, which was supported by\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fcompetent evidence, we will not assume jury confusion or verdict\n\ntaint.\").\n\n            Moreover, while we think it most plausible to infer that,\n\nas explained above, the jury disbelieved Tprs. McDonald's and\n\nShea's assertions that Tpr. McDonald informed the prosecutors about\n\nthe DNA test results, we also recognize an alternative possible\n\nbasis for the jury's award: that the jury awarded damages to cover\n\nonly the natural consequences of the false arrest which, as Burke\n\nargues in his brief on appeal, did not \"come to a screeching halt\n\nin [the] twenty four . . . hours\" between the arrest and the\n\narraignment.\n\n            In light of our precedent, discussed below, the evidence\n\nat trial may be viewed as providing an adequate basis for the jury\n\nto award significant damages against Tpr. McDonald for his role in\n\nBurke's arrest.       Given the heinousness and visibility of the crime\n\nat issue, Burke's arrest attracted a significant amount of public\n\nattention.        Burke testified at trial to having seen the scene\n\ndevelop outside his house on the day of his arrest.                    He described\n\nlooking     out    the     window   in    the    morning   and    seeing     police\n\n\"everywhere,\" including what he believed to be unmarked observation\n\nvans in the parking lot.            He also described hearing a helicopter\n\n\"circling the house.\"         By lunchtime, Burke said that he saw people\n\nother   than      police   \"gathering     on    the   sidewalk   and    across   the\n\nstreet,\" perhaps as many as one hundred or more, some with cameras.\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fThereafter, the police, including Tprs. Shea and McDonald and\n\nOfficer Dolan, entered Burke's house by breaking in through the\n\nback door, arrested him, and led him handcuffed into the street\n\nwearing a \"torn, crummy tee-shirt that was on inside out.\"\n\n            At trial, after a videotape of Burke's walk into the\n\nstreet was published to the jury, Burke described the reaction of\n\nthe bystanders as sounding \"sort of like the 4th of July with\n\nfloats going by, people clapping, you know, when you're in a\n\nparade.\"     He   described   a   television   reporter   who   \"stuck   a\n\nmicrophone in [his] face and asked [him] if [he] murdered Mrs.\n\nKennedy.\"    He also testified to his knowledge -- acquired later --\n\nof newspaper and television news stories that publicized his arrest\n\nfor the murder, saying, \"Every video media, every TV station in\n\nBoston and Cable News New England was there.       Every newspaper was\n\nreporting:    the Herald, the Transcript, the Walpole Times, the\n\nGlobe.\"\n\n            Burke also described his experience being held that night\n\nin a \"very small\" cell at the police station that was equipped with\n\nlittle more than \"a short wooden thing that you could sit on.\"           He\n\ntestified to hearing another inmate say from an adjacent holding\n\ncell at the courthouse the next day that the suspect in Mrs.\n\nKennedy's murder (at that point, Burke) is \"not going to last long\"\n\nin prison, and that the suspect should be executed.              He also\n\ntestified to his humiliation at the prospect of being led into a\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fpublic    arraignment         hearing    in    handcuffs,          chains,     and   ankle\n\nbracelets, an event that eventually occurred.\n\n               Burke's qualitative assessments of the impact of these\n\nevents    on    his    life    emphasized      the    extent       of   his   mental     and\n\nemotional anguish.             He described feeling like his house was a\n\n\"pressure cooker\" as the police and bystanders gathered outside on\n\nthe day of his arrest, making him \"very tense.\"                          Of his anxiety\n\nleading up to the arraignment hearing, he stated, \"I thought it was\n\nthe end of my life.           It was something that I didn't think there was\n\nany way that I'd be able to deal with. . . . I didn't think I could\n\nget   through     what    I     was    about   to    face.     .    .   .     It   was   too\n\nhumiliating.\"         Of the publicity surrounding his arrest, Burke said\n\nsimply,    \"It    destroyed       my   life.        It   destroyed       my   life,\"     and\n\nelaborated by pointing out that the articles had portrayed him not\n\njust as a murderer but also an \"abuser,\" \"weirdo,\" and \"loner,\"\n\nlabels which clearly and understandably upset him.                            On multiple\n\noccasions during his testimony, Burke hesitated to describe the\n\nfull extent of his ordeal, stating that he was being asked to\n\ndescribe events that were uncomfortable for him to think about.\n\n               The jury was also presented with evidence that Burke's\n\nemotional and mental anguish had potentially long-lasting effects.\n\nBurke testified that he lost friends at the time of the arrest\n\n\"because they didn't want to be associated with what was about to\n\ncome down.\" Burke's brother also testified that Burke's reputation\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fin the Walpole community prior to the arrest was as a \"gentle,\n\nkind, animal lover, non-violent,\" and juxtaposed it with a more\n\nrecent event he had witnessed in Burke's new home town in another\n\nstate, during which a stranger yelled the word \"murderer\" at Burke\n\nfrom a passing car.     Burke's brother also contrasted Burke's pre-\n\narrest personality, which he described as including \"a great sense\n\nof humor,\" with his post-arrest personality, which he described as\n\n\"tearful, hopeless, despondent, enraged,\" and observed that, post-\n\narrest, Burke \"focused all his mental . . . activity to try and\n\nunderstand how and why this happened to him. . . . [I]t engulfed\n\nhis life.\"    If the jury awarded damages to compensate Burke for his\n\ntrauma, there is a basis for concluding that it was entitled to do\n\nso: the jury was presented with adequate evidence upon which to\n\nbase the award, it was properly instructed as to the circumstances\n\nunder which such damages are compensable, and it was entitled to\n\nmake the award as a matter of law.      See, e.g., Wagenmann, 829 F.2d\n\nat 215-16 (upholding a jury award based on \"the stress, fear,\n\nhumiliation, embarrassment, anguish, and stigmatization\" that a\n\ndefendant \"suffered (and continues to suffer)\" after his arrest\n\nwithout probable cause).\n\n             In sum, we discern no error of law by the district court\n\nwhen it refused to cut off damages at the moment of arraignment or\n\nwhen it instructed the jury as to Tpr. McDonald's liability for\n\ndamages.     We further find that the jury's award can fairly be\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\funderstood to be supported by at least one and probably two\n\nrational appraisals of the damages.     We therefore have no cause to\n\nconclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying\n\nthe motions for a new trial and remittitur, nor reason to upset the\n\nverdict ourselves.\n\nIII.    BURKE'S CROSS-APPEAL\n\n            Burke's   cross-appeal   mounts   two   challenges   to   the\n\ndistrict court's attorneys' fees award.       First, Burke argues that\n\nthe district court erred in declaring Burke's victory \"decidedly\n\npartial,\" given that he ultimately secured a jury verdict in the\n\namount of $400,000 on his § 1983 claim.        Burke acknowledges, of\n\ncourse, that many of his claims were unsuccessful, but he argues\n\nthose claims were so inseparable from the successful claim that\n\n\"each and every minute spent was necessary to the actual verdict.\"\n\nSecond, Burke characterizes the district judge's decision as an\n\nadjustment to the lodestar amount based on the \"results obtained,\"\n\nand argues that the district court erred in so doing by considering\n\nBurke's claim-by-claim success without also considering \"the relief\n\nactually achieved\" and the \"societal importance of the right which\n\nhas been vindicated.\"10\n\n\n\n\n       10\n       Burke's challenge relates only to the district court's\ncalculation of recognizable hours; he does not challenge the\ndistrict court's findings regarding appropriate hourly billing\nrates.\n\n                                 -24-\n\f          A.   Standard of Review\n\n          District courts are provided broad discretion to make fee\n\ndeterminations, and we consequently review the denial in whole or\n\nin part of a motion for attorneys' fees for manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Boston's Children First v. City of Boston, 395 F.3d\n\n10, 13 (1st Cir. 2005).     \"Apart from mistakes of law -- which\n\nalways constitute abuses of a court's discretion -- we will set\n\naside a fee award only if it clearly appears that the trial court\n\nignored a factor deserving significant weight, relied upon an\n\nimproper factor, or evaluated all the proper factors (and no\n\nimproper ones), but made a serious mistake in weighing them.\"    Gay\n\nOfficers Action League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d 288, 292-93 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (citations omitted).\n\n          The party claiming attorneys' fees bears the burden of\n\nproving the reasonableness of the hours it claims.     Torres-Rivera\n\nv. O'Neill-Cancel, 524 F.3d 331, 340 (1st Cir. 2008).        \"If the\n\nfee-seeker properly documents her claim and plausibly asserts that\n\nthe time cannot be allocated between successful and unsuccessful\n\nclaims, it becomes the fee-target's burden to show a basis for\n\nsegregability,\" although \"[i]n reviewing determinations that claims\n\nare or are not interrelated for purposes of an award of attorneys'\n\nfees, we have exhibited great deference to the trial court's\n\ndiscretion.\"   Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 941.   For purposes of this case,\n\nwe note also that we repeatedly have warned that time entries that\n\n\n                                -25-\n\famount to no more than \"gauzy generalities\" will be \"substantially\n\ndiscounted,\" id. at 938, and that the failure of a fee-seeker to\n\nsubmit    reasonably        explicit     time     records     may   have    \"dire\n\nconsequences\" on the amount of fees awarded.                  Gay Officers, 207\n\nF.3d at 297.\n\n              B.   Discussion\n\n              In light of the limits of our review, we conclude that\n\nthe district court's fee reduction should be affirmed. It is well-\n\nestablished that \"fees are appropriately excluded from the lodestar\n\n. . . 'when different claims for relief are not interconnected,\n\nthat    is,   when   the   claims     rest   on   different   facts   and   legal\n\ntheories.'\"        Bogan v. City of Boston, 489 F.3d 417, 428-29 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (quoting Figueroa-Torres v. Toledo-Davila, 232 F.3d 270,\n\n278 (1st Cir. 2000)).         Excluding fees for unsuccessful claims not\n\ninterconnected with the successful claim is precisely what the\n\ndistrict court did in this case:                in calculating the number of\n\nhours to recognize for purposes of its lodestar calculation, it\n\ndistinguished Burke's successful § 1983 claim against Tpr. McDonald\n\nfrom his other, unsuccessful claims, each of which was made against\n\nother    defendants,       premised    on    significantly     different    legal\n\ntheories, or both.         For instance, the district court noted that\n\nwhereas \"the jury verdict against Trooper McDonald was supported by\n\nevidence that he, being the only investigating officer aware of\n\nexculpatory DNA evidence prior to the plaintiff's arrest, knowingly\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fwithheld that information from others who were applying for the\n\narrest     warrant\"    (emphasis    added),    Burke's    lawsuit     included\n\nunsuccessful claims that other officers executed his arrest without\n\na validly issued warrant, that other defendants mishandled DNA\n\nevidence, and that other defendants had withheld or misstated non-\n\nDNA evidence bearing on probable cause (such as the bite mark\n\nevidence).     The district court further noted          that Burke brought\n\n\"completely distinct claims . . . against forensic odontologists,\"\n\nand a separate defamation claim against the Walpole police chief\n\nfor statements he made to the news media about the arrest.              While\n\nacknowledging that \"the multiple and varied claims asserted were\n\nall related in a very broad sense – they all pertained to the\n\nevents that culminated in Burke's arrest,\" the district court\n\nnonetheless concluded \"that preparation of the successful case\n\nagainst McDonald did not benefit from legal efforts expended in\n\npursuit of theories based on different facts against different\n\ndefendants,\" and it thus decided to exclude the hours Burke's\n\nattorneys     spent     on   unsuccessful     claims   from    the    lodestar\n\ncalculation.\n\n            The only wrinkle in this case is the manner in which the\n\ndistrict    court     calculated   the   number   of   hours   that   were   so\n\nunrelated to the successful claim as to be excludable from the\n\nlodestar calculation, to wit, a global reduction of eighty-five\n\npercent to the pre-Burke I hours based on the district court's\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\f\"proportionate estimate.\"        To be sure, a more exacting approach to\n\nthe lodestar method is preferred, but this case did not allow for\n\nmore precision:          as the district court noted after providing\n\nexamples of the ambiguous time entries contained in the time and\n\nbilling records (\"strategy meeting\" and \"telephone conference\"),\n\nthose records provided \"little, if any, basis for determining what\n\nwork reflected in them was done to develop what claims,\" and,\n\ndespite   the     fact    that   he   bore      the   burden   to    prove   the\n\nreasonableness of the hours he claimed, Burke did not provide an\n\naffidavit explaining with sufficient detail how the line item\n\nentries -- or even categories of line item entries -- were related\n\nto the meritorious claim.        Therefore, under the circumstances, we\n\ncannot conclude that a global reduction based on a proportionate\n\nestimate of the time spent on the meritorious claim constituted\n\nerror.\n\n          On the contrary, it was the best approach available to\n\nthe district court, and it was consistent with Burke's burden to\n\nprove his hours.     See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 436-37\n\n(1983) (noting that the district court, in reducing amount of fees\n\ncalculated   by    the    lodestar    method,    \"may   attempt     to   identify\n\nspecific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce\n\nthe award to account for . . . limited success\"); see also Torres-\n\nRivera, 524 F.3d at 336 (permitting district courts, when computing\n\nthe lodestar amount, to \"discount or disallow\" hours when time\n\n\n                                      -28-\n\frecords are \"too generic and, thus, insufficient as a practical\n\nmatter to permit a court to answer questions about excessiveness,\n\nredundancy, and the like\"); cf. Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 941 (\"If the\n\nfee-seeker properly documents her claim and plausibly asserts that\n\nthe time cannot be allocated between successful and unsuccessful\n\nclaims, it becomes the fee-target's burden to show a basis for\n\nsegregability.\" (emphasis added)).\n\n          Burke's arguments to the contrary are all unpersuasive.\n\nHis argument that the district court failed to consider the \"the\n\nrelief actually achieved\" and the \"societal importance of the right\n\nwhich has been vindicated\" is based on an incorrect premise:     the\n\ndistrict court's use of phrases suggesting an \"adjustment of the\n\nwhole-case lodestar\" notwithstanding, it is apparent from the\n\ndistrict court's order that it considered Burke's claim-by-claim\n\nsuccess in an attempt to estimate the reduction in hours when\n\ncalculating the lodestar amount, not as part of a reduction to that\n\namount.   Our prior statements encouraging district courts to\n\nconsider the relief achieved and the societal importance of the\n\nright, see e.g. De Jesus Nazario, 554 F.3d at 206 n.13, 207; Coutin\n\nv. Young & Rubicam P.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 331, 338 (1st Cir. 1997),\n\nwere   made   in   the   latter     context,   not   the   former.\n\n          More importantly, under the circumstances of this case,\n\nthe district court was faced with the task of estimating which\n\nhours were necessary and sufficiently related to the successful\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\fclaim and which hours were not for purposes of the lodestar\n\ncalculation.       A claim-by-claim analysis of the case was necessary\n\nto reach that end; considerations of the relief obtained and\n\nsocietal importance were not.          If those considerations had a place\n\nin   the   district       court's    analysis,    it   would      have   been   when\n\nconsidering    whether      to   adjust     the   lodestar     amount    upward   or\n\ndownward, not when calculating it in the first instance.11\n\n            Finally, we note that the size of the district court's\n\nglobal reduction under these circumstances -- eighty-five percent\n\nof the pre-Burke I fees, which amounts to a nearly sixty-percent\n\nreduction     to    the    overall    fee    request   --    is    unquestionably\n\nsubstantial.       Reasonable minds could differ about whether some of\n\nthe claims against other defendants, or some of the mishandling or\n\n\n      11\n      After computing the lodestar, the district court would have\nbeen within its discretion to consider an adjustment -- upward or\ndownward -- based on the results obtained by taking into account\nBurke's claim-by-claim success, the relief obtained, and the\nsocietal importance of the right vindicated. That the district\ncourt appears not to have done so, however, is of no moment under\nthe circumstances, for two reasons. First, Burke has not argued on\nappeal that the district court's decision not to consider such an\nadjustment constituted error, and therefore the argument is waived.\nSecond, the burden of proving that an upward adjustment is\nnecessary to the determination of a reasonable fee is on the fee\napplicant. Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 898 (1984). Although\nBurke made mention of an upward adjustment in his affidavit\naccompanying his motion for attorneys' fees, that affidavit also\nincluded what could be understood as an abandonment of the request\nwhen it acknowledged that \"enhancements are rarely allowed\" and\nadvocated   for  the   district   court   to  award   \"the   actual\ncontemporaneously recorded time-slips.\" In any event, nothing in\nthe record compels us to find that Burke proved the necessity of an\nupward enhancement, or that the district court erred by not\nconsidering one. See, e.g., id. at 898-902.\n\n                                       -30-\n\fwithholding of evidence claims, were sufficiently interrelated with\n\nthe ultimately successful claim against Tpr. McDonald.    Reasonable\n\nminds might also doubt that the pre-Burke I fee award, which\n\namounts to just $28,050 for the period of 1999 through 2005,\n\nadequately recognizes the undoubtedly significant attorney time\n\nrequired to develop the facts underlying the successful claim\n\nagainst Tpr. McDonald.   But our limited review for manifest abuse\n\nof discretion in the attorneys' fees context is designed to defer\n\nto the district court in the face of such disagreements, and this\n\nis particularly the case when, as here, the fee application is\n\ninsufficiently documented and insufficiently explained.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           For the reasons provided above, we AFFIRM the decisions\n\nof the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\f",

In 1998, despite the fact that\n\npolice had obtained DNA evidence excluding him as the perpetrator,\n\nEdmund Burke was arrested for murder and forced to spend a total of\n\nforty-two days in jail.             Burke subsequently filed a civil rights\n\nlawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against a panoply of those involved\n\nin the investigation of the crime, and after years of litigation,\n\na federal jury found Massachusetts State Police Trooper (Tpr.)\n\nSteven McDonald liable for violating Burke’s Fourth Amendment\n\nrights and awarded $400,000 in damages.              After trial, the district\n\ncourt denied Tpr. McDonald’s motions for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw,       a   new   trial,   and    remittitur.      The   court    also   awarded\n\nattorneys' fees to Burke, although it reduced the amount of the\n\nfees       award     from   the   requested   $292,463.50    (plus    expenses   of\n\n$34,358.55) to $118,882.50 (plus expenses of $12,632.89) on the\n\nground that Burke’s success was “decidedly partial.”1\n\n                Both parties now appeal decisions of the district court:\n\nTpr. McDonald appeals the decision not to limit damages (and\n\nevidence thereof) to the period between arrest and arraignment;\n\nBurke, as cross-appellant, appeals the attorneys' fees reduction.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      These figures are drawn from the district court's Order\nAwarding Attorneys' Fees, which notes that Burke's underlying fee\napplication asked for $294,024.50, but that the application\n\"mistakenly includes hours that the plaintiff subsequently\nvoluntarily withdrew.\" The parties on appeal do not dispute the\ndistrict court's correction.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f            Discerning no errors in the district court's handling of\n\nthe case on either matter, we affirm.\n\nI.   Background\n\n           A.   The Factual Milieu\n\n           Because we had the opportunity to develop the factual\n\ncontext of this case in some depth when considering an appeal from\n\nthe district court's prior entry of summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants, see Burke v.

Except\n\nwhere   indicated,   these   facts   are   not   in   serious   dispute   for\n\npurposes of these appeals.\n\n           On December 1, 1998, Irene Kennedy, a 75-year-old woman,\n\nwas the victim of a particularly grisly murder involving a severe\n\nbeating, strangulation, and multiple stab wounds.               The victim's\n\nbreasts, which were exposed when her body was found in a wooded\n\nWalpole, Massachusetts park, each bore a human bite mark.                 The\n\nensuing investigation into the crime included the collection of DNA\n\nsamples in the form of saliva from the bite marks on the victim's\n\nbody, and of saliva and other forensic samples from Burke, a\n\nsuspect in the crime.    Because Massachusetts did not at that time\n\noperate a facility capable of expedited DNA analysis of multiple-\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fsource samples, the samples were sent to the Maine Crime Laboratory\n\nfor   immediate     analysis   by   Theresa   Calicchio,    a    forensic   DNA\n\nchemist.\n\n            Calicchio testified at the trial in this case that, on\n\nthe morning of December 10, 1998, she called Tpr. McDonald and told\n\nhim that the DNA analysis had excluded Burke as the source of DNA\n\ncollected from the victim's body.2          Tpr. McDonald, however, failed\n\nto convey this information to his colleagues, this despite the fact\n\nthat he successfully conveyed the findings of other non-DNA bite\n\nmark analyses that implicated Burke in the crime.               As a result, a\n\nwarrant application was filed that afternoon which omitted any\n\nmention of the DNA results, and an arrest warrant issued shortly\n\nthereafter.\n\n            Burke    was   arrested   at    his   home   that   afternoon   and\n\ndetained overnight, prior to being arraigned in state court the\n\nnext day.     Shortly after the arraignment began, Tpr. Kevin Shea,\n\nTpr. McDonald's colleague and co-investigator into the murder of\n\n\n      2\n      Whether Calicchio actually told Tpr. McDonald that Burke was\nexcluded on the day of the arrest was hotly contested at trial, and\nTpr. McDonald maintains on appeal that the evidence supporting\nCalicchio's version of events is insufficient to support a finding\nof liability, thereby entitling him to judgment as a matter of law.\nWe disagree. Calicchio testified that she \"told [Tpr. McDonald]\nthat Ed Burke was excluded,\" and when asked if she had any doubt\nabout that fact, she stated, \"No, no doubt.\" Suffice it to say\nthat \"it was the jury's role to assess the credibility of witnesses\nand to resolve inconsistencies in the evidence.\"      Wagenmann v.\nAdams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206 (1st Cir. 1987); see also Ayala-Rodriguez\nv.

The facts\n\nsurrounding this event are disputed. In essence, it is McDonald's\n\nand Shea's contention that McDonald called Shea and told him about\n\nthe DNA exclusion of Burke, thereby leading Tpr. Shea to interrupt\n\nADA    Pudolsky.       At    trial,   however,    Burke   marshaled   evidence,\n\ndiscussed in detail below, suggesting that the results of the DNA\n\ntest    were   never        communicated   from    Tpr.   McDonald    to   those\n\nresponsible for prosecuting the arraignment hearing, or to the\n\npresiding magistrate.\n\n            In any event, it is undisputed that after Tpr. Shea\n\ninterrupted the arraignment and spoke to ADA Pudolsky, ADA Pudolsky\n\nwas left with the impression that \"some evidence\" had \"come to\n\nlight.\"    He requested a recess, called his supervisors, and was\n\ntold (he does not remember by whom) that            \"more testing\" of the DNA\n\nwas required before any definitive result could be obtained.                ADA\n\nPudolsky then sought and secured Burke's detention without bail.\n\nBurke spent the next forty-one days in custody until, after palm\n\nprints provided by Burke pursuant to court order revealed that\n\nBurke was not the source of a palm print on the victim's body, the\n\ndistrict attorney filed a nolle prosequi in the case on the ground\n\nthat Burke's prosecution was premature.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f              B.   The Instant Litigation\n\n              Burke subsequently filed a civil rights action in state\n\ncourt against the Town of Walpole, the dentist who provided the\n\nnon-DNA bite mark analysis, and various officers and supervisors of\n\nthe Walpole Police Department in their individual and official\n\ncapacities.        In addition to a § 1983 claim, he claimed defamation\n\nbased    on   having    been   publicly     identified   as   Mrs.   Kennedy's\n\nmurderer.      Shortly thereafter, Burke filed a similar lawsuit in\n\nfederal court against various Massachusetts State Police troopers,\n\nemployees of the Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner's Office, and\n\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts.              After the state case was\n\nremoved to federal court, Burke amended his complaint to combine\n\nthe two cases, and then amended his complaint two more times to add\n\nclaims of negligence against the Commonwealth and to join a second\n\ndentist as a defendant.           His attempt to amend the complaint a\n\nfourth time was denied.\n\n              In time, the district court granted summary judgment to\n\nall defendants on all claims, and Burke appealed.             As noted above,\n\nwe affirmed the district court in every respect except for one:             we\n\nvacated the grant of summary judgment to Tpr. McDonald on Burke's\n\n§ 1983 claim alleging a Fourth Amendment violation, concluding that\n\n\"the    record     contains    evidence,    sufficient   to   create   a   jury\n\nquestion, that he intentionally or recklessly withheld exculpatory\n\nDNA evidence from the magistrate who issued the warrant to arrest\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fBurke, and a reasonable officer would know that such conduct\n\nviolated a clearly established Fourth Amendment right.\"                  Burke I,\n\n405 F.3d at 70.\n\n           Before,     during,      and    after   the    ensuing     trial,   Tpr.\n\nMcDonald maintained in the district court his position that he\n\nshould   not    be   found    liable      for   damages    incurred    after   the\n\narraignment.     In support of this position, Tpr. McDonald cited\n\nevidence, which he characterized as uncontroverted, suggesting that\n\nhe had made a full disclosure of the exculpatory DNA evidence to\n\nthe prosecution before ADA Pudolsky requested Burke's continued\n\ndetention without bail. In McDonald's view, the district attorney,\n\nwho after Tpr. McDonald's disclosure had all available information\n\nabout the evidence inculpating and exculpating Burke, made a fully-\n\ninformed and independent decision to ask for continued detention,\n\nand a fully-informed magistrate agreed.              Tpr. McDonald argued to\n\nthe district court, and maintains on appeal, that the arraignment\n\ntherefore cut off the damages for which he can be liable, either as\n\na matter of law or as a matter of fact.\n\n           The district court disagreed, and instead submitted the\n\nquestion   to    the   jury    as    a    matter   of     proximate    cause   and\n\nconsequential damages.         The court instructed the jury that \"the\n\nplaintiff must establish the defendant's acts were the proximate\n\ncause of injuries to him and consequent damages sustained by him.\"\n\nAdditionally, after defining and explaining the term \"proximate\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fcause\"   and    emphasizing   that   an    intervening   cause   cuts   off\n\nliability,3 the court instructed:\n\n           In this case it is the defendant's contention\n           that even if he had withheld material\n           information   from  other   investigators  on\n           December 10th, he disclosed that the DNA\n           testing had excluded Mr. Burke at the time of\n           the arraignment on December 11th, so that any\n           continued detention of Mr. Burke after that\n           time could not have been caused by his\n           withholding of information.    That is also a\n           factual issue for you to determine -- for you\n           to resolve, if, of course, you find that\n           Trooper McDonald had withheld information\n           prior to the application for a warrant.\n\n           Before the jury retired, the district court held a\n\nsidebar discussion and invited objections and corrections to its\n\ninstructions.    Tpr. McDonald's attorney objected, to no avail, as\n\nfollows:   \"Your Honor, just for the record, I wanted to state that\n\nI believe I'm entitled to as a matter of law instruction that the\n\nprobable cause determination by the Court on the 11th terminates\n\nany exposure my client has to damages.\"           This objection was in\n\naddition to an instruction that Tpr. McDonald had proposed, also to\n\nno avail, which would have instructed:\n\n           [Y]ou may award [the Plaintiff] only such\n           damages as will reasonably compensate him for\n           such injury and damages as you find, from a\n           preponderance of the evidence in the case,\n           that he sustained from the time of his arrest\n           until when the DNA results were disclosed.\n           You are not permitted to award any damages you\n           find the Plaintiff may have suffered following\n\n\n     3\n      Tpr. McDonald has not challenged the district                court's\ninstructions as to the meaning of \"proximate cause.\"\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           when the DNA results were disclosed by the\n           Defendant.\n\n           The jury found in favor of Burke using a general verdict\n\nform, and a flurry of post-trial motions followed.          Among them was\n\nBurke's request for attorneys' fees, originally in the amount of\n\n$324,859.75, but voluntarily reduced to $292,463.50 after a filing\n\nfrom Tpr. McDonald challenged the amount.            The district court\n\nfurther   reduced   the   fee   award   to   $118,882.50,   declaring   the\n\nplaintiff's success \"decidedly partial.\"            In arriving at this\n\namount, the district court depended heavily on the fact that the\n\nplaintiff obtained a jury verdict against \"only one of twenty-one\n\ndefendants on only one of sixteen causes of action.\"4\n\n           As for the amount of the reduction, the district court\n\ndescribed the time and billing records as providing \"little, if any\n\nbasis for determining what work reflected in them was done to\n\ndevelop what claims,\" and therefore made a \"proportional estimate\"\n\nthat, prior to Burke I, \"it is fair to estimate that 15% of the .\n\n. . work was of direct or indirect benefit to the plaintiff's\n\n\n     4\n      The court also awarded $12,632.89 in total expenses, an\namount arrived at by way of the same global eighty-five percent\nreduction that was applied to the claimed attorneys' fees. It is\nunclear whether Burke intends his cross-appeal to encompass the\ndistrict court's decision to reduce the expenses: except for a few\npassing references to costs, the brief complains only of the \"fees\"\nreduction and refers only to \"time\" records and \"time spent\"; not\nsurprisingly, Tpr. McDonald takes the position that Burke has made\n\"no argument challenging . . . the reduction of costs.\" But the\nmatter is immaterial to our decision, for to the extent it has been\nappealed, we affirm the district court's reduction of expenses for\nsubstantially the same reasons we affirm its fee award.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fability to prevail on his [successful] claim against McDonald.\"\n\nThe district court recognized only 15% of the claimed pre-Burke I\n\nhours, added them to the hours spent on the case after Burke I\n\n(100% of which were recognized), and proceeded to calculate the\n\nfinal award using the \"lodestar method.\"5              Both parties appealed.\n\nII.   TPR. MCDONALD'S APPEAL\n\n            The gravamen of Tpr. McDonald's appeal is simply put: he\n\nbelieves   that   his     liability   is   limited     to   the   damages   Burke\n\nincurred between the arrest and the arraignment.              He advances this\n\nposition with three related arguments.           First, he argues that the\n\ndistrict court should have cut off the damages as a matter of law\n\nwith a legal ruling before trial, an instruction to the jury not to\n\nconsider damages incurred after the arraignment, a post-trial\n\njudgment as a matter of law, or a remittitur.6                     Second, Tpr.\n\nMcDonald argues that even if the district court was theoretically\n\ncorrect    in   framing    McDonald's      potential    liability    for    post-\n\narraignment damages as a question of proximate cause, in this case\n\nthe prosecutors' informed and independent decision to proceed with\n\n\n      5\n      The \"lodestar method\" of calculating attorneys' fees awards\nrequires the district judge to multiply the number of hours\nproductively expended by counsel by a reasonable hourly rate.

McDonald.    The jury\n\ncould also have disbelieved Tpr. McDonald's testimony that he fully\n\ninformed the prosecutors involved in the bail decision about the\n\nDNA test results. Tpr. McDonald claimed to have unburdened himself\n\nto First Assistant District Attorney John Kivlan directly on the\n\nday of the arraignment, but ADA Kivlan was never called to testify,\n\nnor was any other evidence offered to support McDonald's assertion.\n\n          The jury might well have determined that Tpr. McDonald's\n\ntestimony was nakedly self-serving and not credible. Tpr. McDonald\n\nalso claimed to have informed ADA Pudolsky of Burke's exclusion by\n\nway of Tpr. Shea, who testified that he told ADA Pudolsky that\n\nBurke was excluded when he interrupted the arraignment.    But the\n\nrest of the evidence does not fully corroborate that account.\n\nAmong the infirmities in Tpr. McDonald's version of events is the\n\nfact that, while both Tprs. McDonald and Shea testified that Tpr.\n\nMcDonald told Tpr. Shea that \"Burke is excluded\" based on the DNA\n\ntest results, and while Tpr. Shea testified that he passed this\n\nmessage on to ADA Pudolsky, ADA Pudolsky testified that Tpr. Shea\n\nonly told him to \"go downstairs and call\" his supervisors, leaving\n\nADA Pudolsky with the impression that there was \"some evidence\"\n\nthat had \"come to light.\"   ADA Pudolsky did not testify that Tpr.\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fShea told him that Burke was excluded, nor did he testify that Tpr.\n\nShea so much as mentioned DNA or test results to him.        The gap\n\nbetween these two versions of this chain of events -- Tprs.\n\nMcDonald and Shea's version on the one hand, and ADA Pudolsky's on\n\nthe other -- was wide enough to accommodate the inference that Tpr.\n\nMcDonald did not, in fact, unburden himself to the prosecution by\n\nway of Tpr. Shea.\n\n             Other evidence before the jury bolstered this inference,\n\nsuch as the fact that ADA Pudolsky, after phoning his supervisors,\n\nargued to the magistrate that the DNA test results were ambiguous\n\nas to Burke's culpability, a position he would have been unlikely\n\nto adopt had he heard Calicchio's opinion, which she said she\n\nrendered to Tpr. McDonald the previous day, that the DNA test\n\nresults unquestionably excluded Burke.      The jury also heard that\n\nTprs. Shea and McDonald were colleagues and that both participated\n\nin the investigation and arrest of Burke, thus providing at least\n\nsome basis for the jury to infer that the two troopers might have\n\nhad untoward incentives or inclinations to corroborate each other's\n\ntestimony.      When taken together, these additional facts could\n\nreasonably have led the jury to discount Tprs. McDonald's and\n\nShea's testimony about what disclosures Tpr. McDonald made to whom,\n\nand when.8\n\n\n     8\n      As a postscript to our discussion of this evidence, we\nbriefly note that Calicchio testified at trial that, the day before\nthe arraignment, she spoke to Robert Martin, a chemist for the\n\n                                 -16-\n\f          None of the evidence just described leads inexorably to\n\nthe conclusion that Tpr. McDonald failed to disclose the DNA test\n\nresults to the prosecution, but we need no such certainty to reject\n\nMcDonald's argument that his liability for damages must end, as a\n\nmatter of law, when the prosecutors weighed in at the bail hearing.\n\nAll that is required is a finding that, when these facts are viewed\n\nin the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could\n\nhave found that Tpr. McDonald failed to disclose what he knew, and\n\nthat this failure prevented the magistrate and prosecutors from\n\nmaking informed, independent judgments.    The evidence discussed\n\nabove supports that finding.9\n\n\nMassachusetts State Police Crime Laboratory, and that during this\nconversation she may have advised him that Burke was excluded. She\nalso testified that, on the day of the arraignment, she spoke to\nRichard Iwanicki, then a forensic chemist with the Massachusetts\nState Police, and that in the context of discussing the specific\nprocedures used in the DNA tests, she did in fact advise him of\nBurke's exclusion. What was said between Calicchio, Martin, and\nIwanicki, and whether those discussions sufficiently broke the\nchain of causation between Tpr. McDonald's failure to disclose what\nhe knew of the DNA test results and Burke's eventual damages, were,\nfor the reasons provided herein, questions appropriately left to\nthe jury.\n     9\n      This is so even assuming -- without deciding -- that Tpr.\nMcDonald is correct to assert that the \"presumption of regularity\"\nthat often attaches to a prosecutor's charging decision in the\ncontext of retaliatory-prosecution actions, see Hartman v.

We find no cognizable error in the district\n\ncourt's jury instructions, which framed the question of damages as\n\na matter of proximate cause.

McDonald for his role in\n\nBurke's arrest.       Given the heinousness and visibility of the crime\n\nat issue, Burke's arrest attracted a significant amount of public\n\nattention.        Burke testified at trial to having seen the scene\n\ndevelop outside his house on the day of his arrest.                    He described\n\nlooking     out    the     window   in    the    morning   and    seeing     police\n\n\"everywhere,\" including what he believed to be unmarked observation\n\nvans in the parking lot.            He also described hearing a helicopter\n\n\"circling the house.\"         By lunchtime, Burke said that he saw people\n\nother   than      police   \"gathering     on    the   sidewalk   and    across   the\n\nstreet,\" perhaps as many as one hundred or more, some with cameras.\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fThereafter, the police, including Tprs. Shea and McDonald and\n\nOfficer Dolan, entered Burke's house by breaking in through the\n\nback door, arrested him, and led him handcuffed into the street\n\nwearing a \"torn, crummy tee-shirt that was on inside out.\"\n\n            At trial, after a videotape of Burke's walk into the\n\nstreet was published to the jury, Burke described the reaction of\n\nthe bystanders as sounding \"sort of like the 4th of July with\n\nfloats going by, people clapping, you know, when you're in a\n\nparade.\"     He   described   a   television   reporter   who   \"stuck   a\n\nmicrophone in [his] face and asked [him] if [he] murdered Mrs.\n\nKennedy.\"    He also testified to his knowledge -- acquired later --\n\nof newspaper and television news stories that publicized his arrest\n\nfor the murder, saying, \"Every video media, every TV station in\n\nBoston and Cable News New England was there.       Every newspaper was\n\nreporting:    the Herald, the Transcript, the Walpole Times, the\n\nGlobe.\"\n\n            Burke also described his experience being held that night\n\nin a \"very small\" cell at the police station that was equipped with\n\nlittle more than \"a short wooden thing that you could sit on.\"           He\n\ntestified to hearing another inmate say from an adjacent holding\n\ncell at the courthouse the next day that the suspect in Mrs.\n\nKennedy's murder (at that point, Burke) is \"not going to last long\"\n\nin prison, and that the suspect should be executed.              He also\n\ntestified to his humiliation at the prospect of being led into a\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fpublic    arraignment         hearing    in    handcuffs,          chains,     and   ankle\n\nbracelets, an event that eventually occurred.\n\n               Burke's qualitative assessments of the impact of these\n\nevents    on    his    life    emphasized      the    extent       of   his   mental     and\n\nemotional anguish.             He described feeling like his house was a\n\n\"pressure cooker\" as the police and bystanders gathered outside on\n\nthe day of his arrest, making him \"very tense.\"                          Of his anxiety\n\nleading up to the arraignment hearing, he stated, \"I thought it was\n\nthe end of my life.           It was something that I didn't think there was\n\nany way that I'd be able to deal with. . . . I didn't think I could\n\nget   through     what    I     was    about   to    face.     .    .   .     It   was   too\n\nhumiliating.\"         Of the publicity surrounding his arrest, Burke said\n\nsimply,    \"It    destroyed       my   life.        It   destroyed       my   life,\"     and\n\nelaborated by pointing out that the articles had portrayed him not\n\njust as a murderer but also an \"abuser,\" \"weirdo,\" and \"loner,\"\n\nlabels which clearly and understandably upset him.                            On multiple\n\noccasions during his testimony, Burke hesitated to describe the\n\nfull extent of his ordeal, stating that he was being asked to\n\ndescribe events that were uncomfortable for him to think about.\n\n               The jury was also presented with evidence that Burke's\n\nemotional and mental anguish had potentially long-lasting effects.\n\nBurke testified that he lost friends at the time of the arrest\n\n\"because they didn't want to be associated with what was about to\n\ncome down.\" Burke's brother also testified that Burke's reputation\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fin the Walpole community prior to the arrest was as a \"gentle,\n\nkind, animal lover, non-violent,\" and juxtaposed it with a more\n\nrecent event he had witnessed in Burke's new home town in another\n\nstate, during which a stranger yelled the word \"murderer\" at Burke\n\nfrom a passing car.     Burke's brother also contrasted Burke's pre-\n\narrest personality, which he described as including \"a great sense\n\nof humor,\" with his post-arrest personality, which he described as\n\n\"tearful, hopeless, despondent, enraged,\" and observed that, post-\n\narrest, Burke \"focused all his mental . . . activity to try and\n\nunderstand how and why this happened to him. . . . [I]t engulfed\n\nhis life.\"    If the jury awarded damages to compensate Burke for his\n\ntrauma, there is a basis for concluding that it was entitled to do\n\nso: the jury was presented with adequate evidence upon which to\n\nbase the award, it was properly instructed as to the circumstances\n\nunder which such damages are compensable, and it was entitled to\n\nmake the award as a matter of law.      See, e.g., Wagenmann, 829 F.2d\n\nat 215-16 (upholding a jury award based on \"the stress, fear,\n\nhumiliation, embarrassment, anguish, and stigmatization\" that a\n\ndefendant \"suffered (and continues to suffer)\" after his arrest\n\nwithout probable cause).\n\n             In sum, we discern no error of law by the district court\n\nwhen it refused to cut off damages at the moment of arraignment or\n\nwhen it instructed the jury as to Tpr. McDonald's liability for\n\ndamages.     We further find that the jury's award can fairly be\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\funderstood to be supported by at least one and probably two\n\nrational appraisals of the damages.     We therefore have no cause to\n\nconclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying\n\nthe motions for a new trial and remittitur, nor reason to upset the\n\nverdict ourselves.\n\nIII.    BURKE'S CROSS-APPEAL\n\n            Burke's   cross-appeal   mounts   two   challenges   to   the\n\ndistrict court's attorneys' fees award.       First, Burke argues that\n\nthe district court erred in declaring Burke's victory \"decidedly\n\npartial,\" given that he ultimately secured a jury verdict in the\n\namount of $400,000 on his § 1983 claim.        Burke acknowledges, of\n\ncourse, that many of his claims were unsuccessful, but he argues\n\nthose claims were so inseparable from the successful claim that\n\n\"each and every minute spent was necessary to the actual verdict.\"\n\nSecond, Burke characterizes the district judge's decision as an\n\nadjustment to the lodestar amount based on the \"results obtained,\"\n\nand argues that the district court erred in so doing by considering\n\nBurke's claim-by-claim success without also considering \"the relief\n\nactually achieved\" and the \"societal importance of the right which\n\nhas been vindicated.\"10\n\n\n\n\n       10\n       Burke's challenge relates only to the district court's\ncalculation of recognizable hours; he does not challenge the\ndistrict court's findings regarding appropriate hourly billing\nrates.\n\n                                 -24-\n\f          A.

Excluding fees for unsuccessful claims not\n\ninterconnected with the successful claim is precisely what the\n\ndistrict court did in this case:                in calculating the number of\n\nhours to recognize for purposes of its lodestar calculation, it\n\ndistinguished Burke's successful § 1983 claim against Tpr. McDonald\n\nfrom his other, unsuccessful claims, each of which was made against\n\nother    defendants,       premised    on    significantly     different    legal\n\ntheories, or both.         For instance, the district court noted that\n\nwhereas \"the jury verdict against Trooper McDonald was supported by\n\nevidence that he, being the only investigating officer aware of\n\nexculpatory DNA evidence prior to the plaintiff's arrest, knowingly\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fwithheld that information from others who were applying for the\n\narrest     warrant\"    (emphasis    added),    Burke's    lawsuit     included\n\nunsuccessful claims that other officers executed his arrest without\n\na validly issued warrant, that other defendants mishandled DNA\n\nevidence, and that other defendants had withheld or misstated non-\n\nDNA evidence bearing on probable cause (such as the bite mark\n\nevidence).     The district court further noted          that Burke brought\n\n\"completely distinct claims . . . against forensic odontologists,\"\n\nand a separate defamation claim against the Walpole police chief\n\nfor statements he made to the news media about the arrest.              While\n\nacknowledging that \"the multiple and varied claims asserted were\n\nall related in a very broad sense – they all pertained to the\n\nevents that culminated in Burke's arrest,\" the district court\n\nnonetheless concluded \"that preparation of the successful case\n\nagainst McDonald did not benefit from legal efforts expended in\n\npursuit of theories based on different facts against different\n\ndefendants,\" and it thus decided to exclude the hours Burke's\n\nattorneys     spent     on   unsuccessful     claims   from    the    lodestar\n\ncalculation.\n\n            The only wrinkle in this case is the manner in which the\n\ndistrict    court     calculated   the   number   of   hours   that   were   so\n\nunrelated to the successful claim as to be excludable from the\n\nlodestar calculation, to wit, a global reduction of eighty-five\n\npercent to the pre-Burke I hours based on the district court's\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\f\"proportionate estimate.\"        To be sure, a more exacting approach to\n\nthe lodestar method is preferred, but this case did not allow for\n\nmore precision:          as the district court noted after providing\n\nexamples of the ambiguous time entries contained in the time and\n\nbilling records (\"strategy meeting\" and \"telephone conference\"),\n\nthose records provided \"little, if any, basis for determining what\n\nwork reflected in them was done to develop what claims,\" and,\n\ndespite   the     fact    that   he   bore      the   burden   to    prove   the\n\nreasonableness of the hours he claimed, Burke did not provide an\n\naffidavit explaining with sufficient detail how the line item\n\nentries -- or even categories of line item entries -- were related\n\nto the meritorious claim.        Therefore, under the circumstances, we\n\ncannot conclude that a global reduction based on a proportionate\n\nestimate of the time spent on the meritorious claim constituted\n\nerror.\n\n          On the contrary, it was the best approach available to\n\nthe district court, and it was consistent with Burke's burden to\n\nprove his hours.

A claim-by-claim analysis of the case was necessary\n\nto reach that end; considerations of the relief obtained and\n\nsocietal importance were not.          If those considerations had a place\n\nin   the   district       court's    analysis,    it   would      have   been   when\n\nconsidering    whether      to   adjust     the   lodestar     amount    upward   or\n\ndownward, not when calculating it in the first instance.11\n\n            Finally, we note that the size of the district court's\n\nglobal reduction under these circumstances -- eighty-five percent\n\nof the pre-Burke I fees, which amounts to a nearly sixty-percent\n\nreduction     to    the    overall    fee    request   --    is    unquestionably\n\nsubstantial.       Reasonable minds could differ about whether some of\n\nthe claims against other defendants, or some of the mishandling or\n\n\n      11\n      After computing the lodestar, the district court would have\nbeen within its discretion to consider an adjustment -- upward or\ndownward -- based on the results obtained by taking into account\nBurke's claim-by-claim success, the relief obtained, and the\nsocietal importance of the right vindicated. That the district\ncourt appears not to have done so, however, is of no moment under\nthe circumstances, for two reasons. First, Burke has not argued on\nappeal that the district court's decision not to consider such an\nadjustment constituted error, and therefore the argument is waived.\nSecond, the burden of proving that an upward adjustment is\nnecessary to the determination of a reasonable fee is on the fee\napplicant.

Stenson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111123\"><a href=\"/opinion/111123/blum-v-stenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 898 (1984). Although\nBurke made mention of an upward adjustment in his affidavit\naccompanying his motion for attorneys' fees, that affidavit also\nincluded what could be understood as an abandonment of the request\nwhen it acknowledged that \"enhancements are rarely allowed\" and\nadvocated   for  the   district   court   to  award   \"the   actual\ncontemporaneously recorded time-slips.\" In any event, nothing in\nthe record compels us to find that Burke proved the necessity of an\nupward enhancement, or that the district court erred by not\nconsidering one. See, e.g., id. at 898-902.\n\n                                       -30-\n\fwithholding of evidence claims, were sufficiently interrelated with\n\nthe ultimately successful claim against Tpr. McDonald.    Reasonable\n\nminds might also doubt that the pre-Burke I fee award, which\n\namounts to just $28,050 for the period of 1999 through 2005,\n\nadequately recognizes the undoubtedly significant attorney time\n\nrequired to develop the facts underlying the successful claim\n\nagainst Tpr. McDonald.   But our limited review for manifest abuse\n\nof discretion in the attorneys' fees context is designed to defer\n\nto the district court in the face of such disagreements, and this\n\nis particularly the case when, as here, the fee application is\n\ninsufficiently documented and insufficiently explained.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           For the reasons provided above, we AFFIRM the decisions\n\nof the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\f</pre>",
