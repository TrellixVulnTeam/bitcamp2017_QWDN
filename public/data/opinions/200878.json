E.C. Waste, Inc. d/b/a Waste\n\nManagement of Puerto Rico (the Company) asks us to set aside a\n\ndecision and order of the National Labor Relations Board (the\n\nBoard), reported at 339 N.L.R.B. No. 39     (June 13, 2003).    The\n\nBoard cross-petitions for enforcement of its order.         We have\n\njurisdiction under section 10(f) of the National Labor Relations\n\nAct (the Act), 29 U.S.C. § 160(f), inasmuch as the Board's order is\n\nfinal and the putative unfair labor practices occurred in Puerto\n\nRico.\n\n          The Board found in relevant part that the Company (i) had\n\nengaged in a pattern of conduct that violated section 8(a)(1) of\n\nthe Act, id. § 158(a)(1), and (ii) had fired Blanca Santana because\n\nof her suspected pro-union leanings, in derogation of section\n\n8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act, id. § 158(a)(1) & (3).   To the extent\n\nthat these findings are challenged in this proceeding — a matter to\n\nwhich we shall return — the question presented is whether they are\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.      See NLRB v.\n\nHorizon Air Servs., Inc., 761 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n          Certain background facts are undisputed.    As its trade\n\nname implies, the Company collects and disposes of waste.    It has\n\nseven offices within Puerto Rico, including one in Humacao.      In\n\nApril of 2000 — all dates are in that year unless otherwise\n\nindicated — Santana began work at the Humacao office on assignment\n\nfrom an agency that supplies temporary staff assistance.         On\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fSeptember 11, she accepted an offer of regular employment from the\n\ndistrict   manager,   Manuel   Fresneda.     The   Company    unilaterally\n\ndesignated December 11 as the end of Santana's probationary period\n\nand inserted that date in her personnel form.\n\n           Local 901 of the Union De Tronquistas De Puerto Rico (the\n\nUnion) filed an election petition with the Board's regional office\n\non October 13.        The Union sought to represent the Company's\n\nclerical employees at Humacao (a proposed bargaining unit that\n\nincluded Santana).       An election was scheduled to take place on\n\nNovember 21.   Although Santana did not sign a union authorization\n\ncard, she told at least two coworkers, Angie Santiago and Iris\n\nAndrews, that she would vote for the Union.\n\n           From   this    point   forward,   the   critical    facts   are\n\ncontroverted. There is substantial evidence, however, that in mid-\n\nOctober Fresneda interrogated a clerical worker, the aforementioned\n\nIris Andrews, about which employees were sympathetic to the Union.\n\nHe then recruited Andrews to spy on her coworkers' organizing\n\nefforts and to convince Santana to vote against the Union.\n\n           On October 19, Fresneda and Wilma Figueroa (the Company's\n\nhuman resources manager) met with the clerical workers. During the\n\nmeeting, Fresneda told the employees that if the Union succeeded in\n\nits quest, bargaining would begin \"at zero.\"        He embellished upon\n\nthis pronouncement by declaring that there would be no assurances\n\nof either job security or paid benefits.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f           As the meeting progressed, Figueroa inquired, without\n\nsuccess, as to the identity of the Union's \"delegate\" (i.e., the\n\nmember of the proposed bargaining unit who was leading the charge\n\nfor unionization). Figueroa also insisted that the attendees share\n\ntheir work-related problems with her.       For the most part, she\n\nreceived a taciturn response.     When Figueroa pressed Santana on\n\nthis issue, the latter fended off the incessant questioning by\n\nexpressing pleasure with the raise that she recently had received\n\nand denying that any problems existed.\n\n           Soon after this meeting, Santana asked Andrews whether\n\nshe had told anyone about Santana's intention to vote for the\n\nUnion.    Andrews ducked the question.   She admitted, however, that\n\nFresneda had enlisted her help in persuading Santana to vote\n\nagainst unionization.\n\n           In the early morning hours of October 23, Santana's\n\ninfant son became ill and she took him to the emergency room.    She\n\ntelephoned the office a full half-hour before her shift was to\n\nstart and asked for her supervisor, Milisha González.         Since\n\nGonzález had not yet arrived, Santana explained her predicament to\n\nJosé Orlando Hernández, a group leader who happened to be in the\n\noffice.    She said that if she was able to leave the hospital at a\n\nreasonable hour, she would come to work.     As matters turned out,\n\nthe exigencies of treatment forced Santana to remain at her son's\n\nside throughout the day.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f              The next morning, Santana reported for work at the usual\n\ntime   and    volunteered     to    furnish    González      with   proof   of   the\n\nemergency room visit.         González declined the offer, stating that\n\nthere was \"no problem.\"             That statement proved to be overly\n\nsanguine:       the next day, González handed Santana a reproving\n\nmemorandum written by the Company's controller, José Rodriguez, in\n\nwhich Rodriguez asserted that Santana had promised to arrive at\n\nwork   late    on   October    23    but   had   never      appeared.       Santana\n\nimmediately protested this mischaracterization.\n\n              Rodriguez's   memorandum        laid   the    groundwork    for    what\n\ntranspired next. On October 26, he summoned Santana and handed her\n\na letter of dismissal.        The letter stated only that the Company was\n\nterminating her employment \"for not having completed satisfactorily\n\n[her] probationary period.\" Despite Santana's importunings, no one\n\nwould elaborate on this cryptic statement.\n\n              In due season, the Union lodged unfair labor practice\n\ncharges against the Company.          These charges, which were prosecuted\n\nby the Board's regional counsel, involved both the Company's\n\noverall conduct vis-à-vis the Union's organizational effort and its\n\ntreatment of Santana.       The charges were heard by an administrative\n\nlaw judge (ALJ).       The ALJ found that the Company had transgressed\n\nsection 8(a)(1) of the Act by improperly interrogating employees,\n\nthreatening     them   with    economic       reprisals     if   they    voted    for\n\nunionization,       impermissibly      soliciting          employee     grievances,\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcreating    an    impression       that   pro-union          activities   were    under\n\nsurveillance, and asking an employee (Andrews) to spy on her\n\ncoworkers (i.e., to note and report their pro-union activities).\n\nThe ALJ further found that the Company had violated section 8(a)(1)\n\nand (3) of the Act by cashiering Santana because it believed that\n\nshe would vote for the Union.\n\n            The Company appealed.               The Board, in the absence of\n\nexceptions, adopted the first (generalized) set of findings.                         It\n\nsimultaneously overruled the Company's exceptions to the second set\n\nof findings and upheld the ALJ's assessment of Santana's firing.\n\nIts ensuing order required the Company to cease and desist from\n\nthese    unfair        labor   practices        and        from   interfering     with,\n\nrestraining,      or    coercing    employees         in    the   exercise   of   their\n\nstatutory rights. As to Santana, the order directed the Company to\n\noffer her reinstatement, make her financially whole, and post a\n\nremedial notice.1\n\n            We need not linger long over the Board's generalized\n\nfindings.        Section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 157, guarantees\n\nemployees \"the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist\n\nlabor    organizations,        [and]      to    bargain       collectively      through\n\nrepresentatives of their own choosing . . . .\"                      In turn, section\n\n\n     1\n      In addition, the Board's decision and order resolved issues\ntouching upon the representation proceeding. These issues are not\nbefore us at this moment. See Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376 U.S.\n473, 476-78 (1964) (explaining that representation proceedings are\nnot subject to direct judicial review).\n\n                                          -6-\n\f8(a)(1) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to\n\ninterfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of\n\ntheir section 7 rights.     Id. § 158(a)(1).      Here, the ALJ found\n\nmyriad violations of section 8(a)(1) and the Company, in its appeal\n\nto the Board, did not object to those findings.       See E.C. Waste,\n\nInc., 339 N.L.R.B. No. 39 at n.1.      Consequently, the Board adopted\n\nthe findings.\n\n            That ends this aspect of the matter.    When a party fails\n\nto raise particular issues before the Board, it ordinarily forfeits\n\nany right to challenge those findings on a petition for judicial\n\nreview.2   See Woelke & Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645,\n\n665-66 (1982); see also 29 U.S.C. § 160(e).        That rule pertains\n\nhere.    It follows inexorably that the Board is entitled to summary\n\nenforcement of those portions of its order that are based on the\n\nunappealed findings.    See McGaw of P.R., Inc. v. NLRB, 135 F.3d 1,\n\n11 (1st Cir. 1997); Horizon Air Servs., 761 F.2d at 26.     We hasten\n\nto add, however, that those findings remain in the case, and we are\n\nfree to draw upon them to put the contested violation — Santana's\n\nfiring — into proper perspective.      See McGaw, 135 F.3d at 7; NLRB\n\nv. Clark Manor Nursing Home Corp., 671 F.2d 657, 660 (1st Cir.\n\n1982).\n\n\n     2\n      There is, of course, an exception that may apply in\nextraordinary circumstances. See, e.g., Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB,\n467 U.S. 883, 896 n.7 (1984); NLRB v. Marshall Maint. Corp., 320\nF.2d 641, 645 (3d Cir. 1963).      We discern no extraordinary\ncircumstances here.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           This brings us to the Board's findings anent Santana. We\n\nstart our analysis by erecting the applicable legal framework.\n\nSection 8(a)(3) of the Act prohibits employer \"discrimination in\n\nregard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of\n\nemployment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor\n\norganization.\"      29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3).            An employer violates\n\nsection 8(a)(3) by punishing an employee for engaging in pro-union\n\nor other protected activities. Horizon Air Servs., 761 F.2d at 27.\n\n           Withal, not every dismissal during a union organizing\n\ncampaign infracts section 8(a)(3).             Whether or not a particular\n\ndismissal crosses the line typically depends on the employer's\n\nmotive.   Under the applicable test, a violation is established\n\nwhere the General Counsel has shown that an employer's antipathy\n\ntoward pro-union or other protected activity was a substantial or\n\na motivating factor for an adverse employment action.             Id.     In the\n\nfirst   instance,      the    General   Counsel   satisfies     this    test   by\n\ndemonstrating    (i)    the    employee's     engagement   in   the    protected\n\nactivity; (ii) the employer's knowledge of that activity; (iii) the\n\nemployer's antipathy toward it; and (iv) a causal link between the\n\nantipathy and the adverse employment action. NLRB v. Transp. Mgmt.\n\nCorp., 462 U.S. 393, 401-03 (1983).\n\n           Upon such a showing, the burden shifts to the employer to\n\nprove that it would have taken the same action in the absence of\n\nthe protected activity.          Id.     Even if the employer proffers a\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fseemingly plausible explanation, however, the Board does not have\n\nto accept it at face value.       If the Board supportably finds that\n\nthe reasons advanced by the employer are either insufficient or\n\npretextual, the violation is deemed proven. Cumberland Farms, Inc.\n\nv. NLRB, 984 F.2d 556, 560 (1st Cir. 1993); Boston Mut. Life Ins.\n\nCo. v. NLRB, 692 F.2d 169, 171 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n           In addressing such questions, direct evidence of pretext\n\nis not required.       To determine motive, the Board may rely on\n\nindirect evidence and inferences reasonably drawn from the totality\n\nof the circumstances.     See NLRB v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U.S. 584, 602\n\n(1941); cf. Desert Place, Inc. v. Costa, 123 S. Ct. 2148, 2154\n\n(2003) (explaining that, to establish a discriminatory motive,\n\n\"[c]ircumstantial evidence is not only sufficient, but may also be\n\nmore certain, satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence\").\n\nAmong the factors that the Board may consider are such things as\n\nthe timing of the adverse employment action.                Abbey's Transp.\n\nServs., Inc. v. NLRB, 837 F.2d 575, 580 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n           The Board's findings with respect to motivation are\n\nbinding   on   a   reviewing   court    as   long   as   those   findings    are\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,\n\n340 U.S. 474, 477 (1951); Horizon Air Servs., 761 F.2d at 25.               When\n\na court is called upon to make such a determination, the Board's\n\ncredibility assessments normally are entitled to great respect.\n\nMcGaw, 135 F.3d at 7.     Measuring the instant record against these\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fbenchmarks, we conclude, without serious question, that substantial\n\nevidence supports the Board's finding that the Company discharged\n\nSantana in order to prevent her from voting for the Union in the\n\nupcoming election.    We explain briefly.\n\n           The Company's initial protest is that it did not know how\n\nSantana was likely to vote.       It is settled beyond peradventure,\n\nhowever,   that   inferences   drawn    from   circumstantial   proof   may\n\nsuffice to establish knowledge.        NLRB v. Hosp. of San Pablo, Inc.,\n\n207 F.3d 67, 74 (1st Cir. 2000); Abbey's Transp. Servs., 837 F.2d\n\nat 579-80. Here, the Board reasonably could have inferred from the\n\nevidence of record that the Company knew (or, at least, suspected)\n\nthat Santana had decided to cast her lot with the Union.                To\n\namplify, the Board supportably found that Santana told Andrews that\n\nshe planned to vote in favor of the Union and that Fresneda\n\nenlisted Andrews as a covert operative. One of Andrews's tasks was\n\nto report back to Fresneda on her colleagues' attitudes toward\n\nunionization.     From this collocation of circumstances, we think\n\nthat the Board reasonably could have inferred — as it did — that\n\nAndrews relayed the information about Santana's intentions to\n\nFresneda (and, thus, to the Company).\n\n           In an effort to parry this thrust, the Company posits\n\nthat it could not have suspected Santana's pro-union bias because\n\nher statement at the October 19 meeting that she had \"no problem\"\n\nwith her working conditions sent a different signal. This argument\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fis unpersuasive.   The record supports a conclusion that Santana\n\nresponded in that way only because Figueroa was engaged in the\n\ncoercive solicitation of grievances — and the employer had full\n\nknowledge of the pertinent circumstances.   Seen in this light, the\n\nBoard was not compelled to draw the inference that the Company only\n\ncould have taken Santana's statement as a public declaration of\n\nfealty (or even of neutrality).\n\n          The remaining elements of the General Counsel's case fall\n\nreadily into place.     Given the litany of generalized section\n\n8(a)(1) violations, the Company's anti-union animus seems evident.\n\nThe uncontested findings show plainly that the Company responded to\n\nthe Union's organizing campaign with a no-holds-barred effort to\n\nstifle employee support.    That deep-seated hostility, in turn,\n\nmakes more plausible the Board's further finding that the Company\n\nperceived Santana as pro-union and fired her so that she would be\n\nunable to cast a vote in the upcoming election.\n\n          What is more, the probative value of the timing of the\n\nCompany's action — firing Santana in the critical interval between\n\nthe time that the Union filed its petition for recognition and the\n\nplanned representation election — is obvious. The Board reasonably\n\ncould have considered that chronology as a further indication that\n\nSantana's perceived support for the Union was instrumental in her\n\ndischarge.   See, e.g., Abbey's Transp. Servs., 837 F.2d at 580.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f           The Company's attempt to blunt the force of the timing\n\nbackfires.    It claims that it had to act against Santana on October\n\n26 for a neutral reason:         her probationary period had expired the\n\nprevious day and the Company wanted to jettison her before she\n\naccrued an entitlement to severance pay.          But the Board found (and\n\nthe Company's records show) that Santana's probationary period was\n\nnot due to end until December 11.          Thus, the premature curtailment\n\nof Santana's probationary period operates in favor of the Board's\n\n\"unlawful motive\" finding. See Shattuck Denn Mining Corp. v. NLRB,\n\n362 F.2d 466, 470 (9th Cir. 1966) (explaining that an employer's\n\nproffer of a false rationale for an employment decision permits the\n\nBoard to infer that the employer's actual reason \"is one that [it]\n\ndesires to conceal — an unlawful motive\"); see also Santiago-Ramos\n\nv. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(noting   that      a   plaintiff    may   establish   pretext     by    showing\n\n\"weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or\n\ncontradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons such\n\nthat a fact finder could infer that the employer did not act for\n\nthe asserted non-discriminatory reasons.\") (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d\n\n151, 168 (1st Cir. 1998) (similar).\n\n           The Company's argument that Puerto Rico Law 80, 29 P.R.\n\nLaws   Ann.    §§       185a-185m,   automatically     shortened        Santana's\n\nprobationary period from ninety days to forty-five days, so that it\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fended on October 25 rather than on December 11, rests on two\n\nfictions.      First, Law 80 requires the mutual execution of a\n\nwriting, prior to the commencement of the employment, specifying\n\nthe length of the probationary period and the beginning and ending\n\ndates of that period.          Id. § 185h.    The Company adduced no proof\n\nthat any such writing was ever drafted or signed.                Second, the\n\nCompany's position tries to turn a severance-pay law, meant as a\n\nshield for employees, into a sword to be wielded by employers.\n\nBecause we endorse the Board's well-reasoned rejection of this\n\nclaim, see E.C. Waste, Inc., 339 N.L.R.B. No. 39 at n.2, we dismiss\n\nthis argument without further elaboration.          Here, as in McGaw, 135\n\nF.3d at 10, it would be perverse to allow the Company \"to invoke a\n\nstatute enacted for the protection of workers as a justification\n\nfor its unlawful labor practices.\"\n\n             The Company has a fallback position:         it notes that, on\n\nthe   same   day   that   it    discharged    Santana,   it   terminated   the\n\nemployment    of   its    spy    (Andrews).      Based   on   this   temporal\n\ncoincidence, the Company suggests that \"it would not seem logical\n\n. . . to dismiss a union supporter and an apparent anti-union\n\nemployee at the same time\" because \"nothing could be achieved (in\n\nterms of gaining a vote).\"          Petitioner's Br. at 37.      This shows,\n\nthe Company says, that both firings were legitimate.\n\n             We reject this suggestion.         An employer should not be\n\npermitted to disguise its unlawful motive for discharging a pro-\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\funion activist by the simple expedient of taking a simultaneous\n\naction   against     a   coworker    who   has   no   union   ties.      We   hold\n\nunhesitatingly that retaliating against an employee for supporting\n\na union violates section 8(a)(3) even if the employer also targets\n\nother employees who are not pro-union.            See McGaw, 135 F.3d at 8.\n\n           The short of the matter is that the General Counsel made\n\nout a strong prima facie case, sufficient to shift the burden to\n\nthe Company to prove that it would have discharged Santana even if\n\nit did not regard her as pro-union.           The Company endeavors to carry\n\nthis     burden,      maintaining      that      it    had     a      legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for ousting Santana:                 her absenteeism.\n\nThis endeavor is unsuccessful.\n\n           We remark, first, the lack of constancy in the Company's\n\nexplanation.       At the time it pink-slipped Santana, it refused to\n\ngive her any substantive reason for her discharge.                 Then, in its\n\noriginal position statement to the Board's regional director, the\n\nCompany asserted that it discharged Santana because she had \"a\n\ndemonstrated pattern of not arriving on time to work in the\n\nmornings.\"     This assertion proved to be false:             Fresneda admitted\n\nin his testimony that Santana was late only once, and then by a\n\npaltry seventeen minutes.           The Company then came up with another\n\nexplanation:        at the unfair labor practice hearing, Fresneda\n\ntestified that he and Rodriguez made the decision to fire Santana\n\nbecause she had been absent three times in a relatively short time\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fspan.   The ALJ rejected this testimony as \"hollow\" and found that\n\nthe Company's stated ground was pretextual.             The Board agreed.\n\n           This finding is premised on substantial evidence. In the\n\nfirst place, an employer's shifting explanations for discharging an\n\nemployee may themselves serve either to ground or to reinforce a\n\nfinding of pretext.    See Abbey's Transp. Servs., 837 F.2d at 581.\n\nThis is such a case.\n\n           In the second place, the absenteeism claim is implausible\n\non its face.    Although the Company now laments Santana's supposed\n\nattendance problems, the record reflects that she missed work on\n\nonly three occasions.        That statistic is exaggerated, however,\n\nbecause the Company had approved two of her three absences.                 To\n\ncinch matters, the third absence — the one involving Santana's sick\n\nchild — was consistent with company policy, which at the time\n\nrequired   an   employee    to   notify     her   \"immediate   supervisor   or\n\nmanagement (in the office)\" of an emergency or illness at least\n\nthirty minutes before her shift was slated to begin.              Santana did\n\nexactly that, and her supervisor acknowledged the next day that her\n\nabsence posed \"no problem.\"\n\n           To say more would be to paint the lily.                A party who\n\nseeks to topple a factfinder's credibility determination typically\n\nfaces a steep uphill climb.        In this instance, the Company cannot\n\nscale those heights.       Its claim that Santana's three absences led\n\nto   her   termination      simply     cannot      be   squared    with     its\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fcontemporaneous actions.    On this record, the Board was amply\n\njustified in finding that poor attendance was a pretext designed to\n\nmask the true reason for Santana's ouster.\n\n          We need go no further.   We have considered each and all\n\nof the employer's contentions (including some so baseless as not to\n\nwarrant discussion in this opinion) and find them without merit.\n\nConcluding, as we do, that the Board's findings are well-supported,\n\nwe deny and dismiss the petition for review and grant the cross-\n\npetition for enforcement of the Board's order.     Costs are to be\n\ntaxed in favor of the Board.\n\n\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

Waste, Inc. d/b/a Waste Management of Puerto Rico (the Company) asks us to set aside a decision and order of the National Labor Relations Board (the Board), reported at 339 N.L.R.B. No. 39 (June 13, 2003). The Board cross-petitions for enforcement of its order. We have jurisdiction under section 10(f) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(f), inasmuch as the Board's order is final and the putative unfair labor practices occurred in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found in relevant part that the Company (i) had engaged in a pattern of conduct that violated section 8(a)(1) of the Act, <i>id.</i> &#167; 158(a)(1), and (ii) had fired Blanca Santana because of her suspected pro-union leanings, in derogation of section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act, <i>id.</i> &#167; 158(a)(1) &amp; (3). To the extent that these findings are challenged in this proceeding &#8212; a matter to which we shall return &#8212; the question presented is whether they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <i>See NLRB v. Horizon Air Servs., Inc.,</i> 761 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certain background facts are undisputed. As its trade name implies, the Company collects and disposes of waste. It has seven offices within Puerto Rico, including one in Humacao. In April of 2000 &#8212; all dates are in that year unless otherwise indicated &#8212; Santana began work at the Humacao office on assignment from an agency that supplies temporary staff assistance. On September 11, she accepted an offer of regular employment from the district manager, Manuel Fresneda. The Company unilaterally designated December 11 as the end of Santana's probationary period and inserted that date in her personnel form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Local 901 of the Union De Tronquistas De Puerto Rico (the Union) filed an election petition with the Board's regional office on October 13. The Union sought to represent the Company's clerical employees at Humacao (a proposed bargaining unit that included Santana). An election was scheduled to take place on November 21. Although Santana did not sign a union authorization card, she told at least two coworkers, Angie Santiago and Iris Andrews, that she would vote for the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this point forward, the critical facts are controverted. There is substantial evidence, however, that in mid-October Fresneda interrogated a clerical worker, the aforementioned Iris Andrews, about which employees were sympathetic to the Union. He then recruited Andrews to spy on her coworkers' organizing efforts and to convince Santana to vote against the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 19, Fresneda and Wilma Figueroa (the Company's human resources manager) met with the clerical workers. During the meeting, Fresneda told the employees that if the Union succeeded in its quest, bargaining would begin \"at zero.\" He embellished upon this pronouncement by declaring that there would be no assurances of either job security or paid benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the meeting progressed, Figueroa inquired, without success, as to the identity of the Union's \"delegate\" (i.e., the member of the proposed bargaining unit who was leading the charge for unionization). Figueroa also insisted that the attendees share their work-related problems with her. For the most part, she received a taciturn response. When Figueroa pressed Santana on this issue, the latter fended off the incessant questioning by expressing pleasure with the raise that she recently had received and denying that any problems existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after this meeting, Santana asked Andrews whether she had told anyone about Santana's intention to vote for the Union. Andrews ducked the question. She admitted, however, that Fresneda had enlisted her help in persuading Santana to vote against unionization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning hours of October 23, Santana's infant son became ill and she took him to the emergency room. She telephoned the office a full half-hour before her shift was to start and asked for her supervisor, Milisha Gonz&#225;lez. Since Gonz&#225;lez had not yet arrived, Santana explained her predicament to Jos&#233; Orlando Hern&#225;ndez, a group leader who happened to be in the office. She said that if she was able to leave the hospital at a reasonable hour, she would come to work. As matters turned out, the exigencies of treatment forced Santana to remain at her son's side throughout the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next morning, Santana reported for work at the usual time and volunteered to furnish Gonz&#225;lez with proof of the emergency room visit. Gonz&#225;lez declined the offer, stating that there was \"no problem.\" That statement proved to be overly sanguine: the next day, Gonz&#225;lez handed Santana a reproving memorandum written by the Company's controller, Jos&#233; Rodriguez, in which Rodriguez asserted that Santana had promised to arrive at work late on October 23 but had never appeared. Santana immediately protested this mischaracterization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez's memorandum laid the groundwork for what transpired next. On October 26, he summoned Santana and handed her a letter of dismissal. The letter stated only that the Company was terminating her employment \"for not having completed satisfactorily [her] probationary period.\" Despite Santana's importunings, no one would elaborate on this cryptic statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, the Union lodged unfair labor practice charges against the Company. These charges, which were prosecuted by the Board's regional counsel, involved both the Company's overall conduct vis-&#224;-vis the Union's organizational effort and its treatment of Santana. The charges were heard by an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ found that the Company had transgressed section 8(a)(1) of the Act by improperly interrogating employees, threatening them with economic reprisals if they voted for unionization, impermissibly soliciting employee grievances, creating an impression that pro-union activities were under surveillance, and asking an employee (Andrews) to spy on her coworkers (i.e., to note and report their pro-union activities). The ALJ further found that the Company had violated section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act by cashiering Santana because it believed that she would vote for the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company appealed. The Board, in the absence of exceptions, adopted the first (generalized) set of findings. It simultaneously overruled the Company's exceptions to the second set of findings and upheld the ALJ's assessment of Santana's firing. Its ensuing order required the Company to cease and desist from these unfair labor practices and from interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of their statutory rights. As to Santana, the order directed the Company to offer her reinstatement, make her financially whole, and post a remedial notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long over the Board's generalized findings. Section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 157, guarantees employees \"the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, [and] to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing....\" In turn, section 8(a)(1) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of their section 7 rights. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 158(a)(1). Here, the ALJ found myriad violations of section 8(a)(1) and the Company, in its appeal to the Board, did not object to those findings. <i>See E.C. Waste, Inc.,</i> 339 N.L.R.B. No. 39 at n. 1. Consequently, the Board adopted the findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. When a party fails to raise particular issues before the Board, it ordinarily forfeits any right to challenge those findings on a petition for judicial review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 456 U.S. 645, 665-66, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982); <i>see also</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(e). That rule pertains here. It follows inexorably that the Board is entitled to summary enforcement of those portions of its order that are based on the unappealed findings. <i>See McGaw of P.R., Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 135 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Horizon Air Servs.,</i> 761 F.2d at 26. We hasten to add, however, that those findings remain in the case, and we are free to draw upon them to put the contested violation &#8212; Santana's firing &#8212; into proper perspective. <i>See McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 7; <i>NLRB v. Clark Manor Nursing Home Corp.,</i> 671 F.2d 657, 660 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the Board's findings anent Santana. We start our analysis by erecting the applicable legal framework. Section 8(a)(3) of the Act prohibits employer \"discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(a)(3). An employer violates section 8(a)(3) by punishing an employee for engaging in pro-union or other protected activities. <i>Horizon Air Servs.,</i> 761 F.2d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Withal, not every dismissal during a union organizing campaign infracts section 8(a)(3). Whether or not a particular dismissal crosses the line typically depends on the employer's motive. Under the applicable test, a violation is established where the General Counsel has shown that an employer's antipathy toward pro-union or other protected activity was a substantial or a motivating factor for an adverse employment action. <i>Id.</i> In the first instance, the General Counsel satisfies this test by demonstrating (i) the employee's engagement in the protected activity; (ii) the employer's knowledge of that activity; (iii) the employer's antipathy toward it; and (iv) a causal link between the antipathy and the adverse employment action. <i>NLRB v. Transp. Mgmt. Corp.,</i> 462 U.S. 393, 401-03, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon such a showing, the burden shifts to the employer to prove that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected activity. <i>Id.</i> Even if the employer proffers a seemingly plausible explanation, however, the Board does not have to accept it at face value. If the Board supportably finds that the reasons advanced by the employer are either insufficient or pretextual, the violation is deemed proven. <i>Cumberland Farms, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 984 F.2d 556, 560 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Boston Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. NLRB,</i> 692 F.2d 169, 171 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing such questions, direct evidence of pretext is not required. To determine motive, the Board may rely on indirect evidence and inferences reasonably drawn from the totality of the circumstances. <i>See NLRB v. Link-Belt Co.,</i> 311 U.S. 584, 602, 61 S.Ct. 358, 85 L.Ed. 368 (1941); <i>cf. Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> 539 U.S. 90, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 2154, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003) (explaining that, to establish a discriminatory motive, \"[c]ircumstantial evidence is not only sufficient, but may also be more certain, satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence\"). Among the factors that the Board may consider are such things as the timing of the adverse employment action. <i>Abbey's Transp. Servs., Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 837 F.2d 575, 580 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's findings with respect to motivation are binding on a reviewing court as long as those findings are supported by substantial evidence. <i>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,</i> 340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); <i>Horizon Air Servs.,</i> 761 F.2d at 25. When a court is called upon to make such a determination, the Board's credibility assessments normally are entitled to great respect. <i>McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 7. Measuring the instant record against these benchmarks, we conclude, without serious question, that substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that the Company discharged Santana in order to prevent her from voting for the Union in the upcoming election. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company's initial protest is that it did not know how Santana was likely to vote. It is settled beyond peradventure, however, that inferences drawn from circumstantial proof may suffice to establish knowledge. <i>NLRB v. Hosp. of San Pablo, Inc.,</i> 207 F.3d 67, 74 (1st Cir. 2000); <i>Abbey's Transp. Servs.,</i> 837 F.2d at 579-80. Here, the Board reasonably could have inferred from the evidence of record that the Company knew (or, at least, suspected) that Santana had decided to cast her lot with the Union. To amplify, the Board supportably found that Santana told Andrews that she planned to vote in favor of the Union and that Fresneda enlisted Andrews as a covert operative. One of Andrews's tasks was to report back to Fresneda on her colleagues' attitudes toward unionization. From this collocation of circumstances, we think that the Board reasonably could have inferred &#8212; as it did &#8212; that Andrews relayed the information about Santana's intentions to Fresneda (and, thus, to the Company).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to parry this thrust, the Company posits that it could not have suspected Santana's pro-union bias because her statement at the October 19 meeting that she had \"no problem\" with her working conditions sent a different signal. This argument is unpersuasive. The record supports a conclusion that Santana responded in that way only because Figueroa was engaged in the coercive solicitation of grievances &#8212; and the employer had full knowledge of the pertinent circumstances. Seen in this light, the Board was not compelled to draw the inference that the Company only could have taken Santana's statement as a public declaration of fealty (or even of neutrality).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining elements of the General Counsel's case fall readily into place. Given the litany of generalized section 8(a)(1) violations, the Company's anti-union animus seems evident. The uncontested findings show plainly that the Company responded to the Union's organizing campaign with a no-holds-barred effort to stifle employee support. That deep-seated hostility, in turn, makes more plausible the Board's further finding that the Company perceived Santana as pro-union and fired her so that she would be unable to cast a vote in the upcoming election.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more, the probative value of the timing of the Company's action &#8212; firing Santana in the critical interval between the time that the Union filed its petition for recognition and the planned representation election &#8212; is obvious. The Board reasonably could have considered that chronology as a further indication that Santana's perceived support for the Union was instrumental in her discharge. <i>See, e.g., Abbey's Transp. Servs.,</i> 837 F.2d at 580.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company's attempt to blunt the force of the timing backfires. It claims that it had to act against Santana on October 26 for a neutral reason: her probationary period had expired the previous day and the Company wanted to jettison her before she accrued an entitlement to severance pay. But the Board found (and the Company's records show) that Santana's probationary period was not due to end until December 11. Thus, the premature curtailment of Santana's probationary period operates in favor of the Board's \"unlawful motive\" finding. <i>See Shattuck Denn Mining Corp. v. NLRB,</i> 362 F.2d 466, 470 (9th Cir.1966) (explaining that an employer's proffer of a false rationale for an employment decision permits the Board to infer that the employer's actual reason \"is one that [it] desires to conceal &#8212; an unlawful motive\"); <i>see also Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> 217 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir.2000) (noting that a plaintiff may establish pretext by showing \"weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons such that a fact finder could infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> 144 F.3d 151, 168 (1st Cir.1998) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company's argument that Puerto Rico Law 80, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 185a-185m, automatically shortened Santana's probationary period from ninety days to forty-five days, so that it ended on October 25 rather than on December 11, rests on two fictions. First, Law 80 requires the mutual execution of a writing, prior to the commencement of the employment, specifying the length of the probationary period and the beginning and ending dates of that period. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 185h. The Company adduced no proof that any such writing was ever drafted or signed. Second, the Company's position tries to turn a severance-pay law, meant as a shield for employees, into a sword to be wielded by employers. Because we endorse the Board's well-reasoned rejection of this claim, <i>see E.C. Waste, Inc.,</i> 339 N.L.R.B. No. 39 at n. 2, we dismiss this argument without further elaboration. Here, as in <i>McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 10, it would be perverse to allow the Company \"to invoke a statute enacted for the protection of workers as a justification for its unlawful labor practices.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company has a fallback position: it notes that, on the same day that it discharged Santana, it terminated the employment of its spy (Andrews). Based on this temporal coincidence, the Company suggests that \"it would not seem logical... to dismiss a union supporter and an apparent anti-union employee at the same time\" because \"nothing could be achieved (in terms of gaining a vote).\" Petitioner's Br. at 37. This shows, the Company says, that both firings were legitimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this suggestion. An employer should not be permitted to disguise its unlawful motive for discharging a pro-union activist by the simple expedient of taking a simultaneous action against a coworker who has no union ties. We hold unhesitatingly that retaliating against an employee for supporting a union violates section 8(a)(3) even if the employer also targets other employees who are not pro-union. <i>See McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of the matter is that the General Counsel made out a strong prima facie case, sufficient to shift the burden to the Company to prove that it would have discharged Santana even if it did not regard her as pro-union. The Company endeavors to carry this burden, maintaining that it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for ousting Santana: her absenteeism. This endeavor is unsuccessful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remark, first, the lack of constancy in the Company's explanation. At the time it pink-slipped Santana, it refused to give her any substantive reason for her discharge. Then, in its original position statement to the Board's regional director, the Company asserted that it discharged Santana because she had \"a demonstrated pattern of not arriving on time to work in the mornings.\" This assertion proved to be false: Fresneda admitted in his testimony that Santana was late only once, and then by a paltry seventeen minutes. The Company then came up with another explanation: at the unfair labor practice hearing, Fresneda testified that he and Rodriguez made the decision to fire Santana because she had been absent three times in a relatively short time span. The ALJ rejected this testimony as \"hollow\" and found that the Company's stated ground was pretextual. The Board agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This finding is premised on substantial evidence. In the first place, an employer's shifting explanations for discharging an employee may themselves serve either to ground or to reinforce a finding of pretext. <i>See Abbey's Transp. Servs.,</i> 837 F.2d at 581. This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, the absenteeism claim is implausible on its face. Although the Company now laments Santana's supposed attendance problems, the record reflects that she missed work on only three occasions. That statistic is exaggerated, however, because the Company had approved two of her three absences. To cinch matters, the third absence &#8212; the one involving Santana's sick child &#8212; was consistent with company policy, which at the time required an employee to notify her \"immediate supervisor or management (in the office)\" of an emergency or illness at least thirty minutes before her shift was slated to begin. Santana did exactly that, and her supervisor acknowledged the next day that her absence posed \"no problem.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be to paint the lily. A party who seeks to topple a factfinder's credibility determination typically faces a steep uphill climb. In this instance, the Company cannot scale those heights. Its claim that Santana's three absences led to her termination simply cannot be squared with its contemporaneous actions. On this record, the Board was amply justified in finding that poor attendance was a pretext designed to mask the true reason for Santana's ouster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We have considered each and all of the employer's contentions (including some so baseless as not to warrant discussion in this opinion) and find them without merit. Concluding, as we do, that the Board's findings are well-supported, we deny and dismiss the petition for review and grant the cross-petition for enforcement of the Board's order. Costs are to be taxed in favor of the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So Ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition, the Board's decision and order resolved issues touching upon the representation proceeding.

Waste, Inc. d/b/a Waste Management of Puerto Rico (the Company) asks us to set aside a decision and order of the National Labor Relations Board (the Board), reported at 339 N.L.R.B. No. 39 (June 13, 2003). The Board cross-petitions for enforcement of its order. We have jurisdiction under section 10(f) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(f), inasmuch as the Board's order is final and the putative unfair labor practices occurred in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found in relevant part that the Company (i) had engaged in a pattern of conduct that violated section 8(a)(1) of the Act, <i>id.</i> &#167; 158(a)(1), and (ii) had fired Blanca Santana because of her suspected pro-union leanings, in derogation of section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act, <i>id.</i> &#167; 158(a)(1) &amp; (3). To the extent that these findings are challenged in this proceeding &#8212; a matter to which we shall return &#8212; the question presented is whether they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <i>See NLRB v. Horizon Air Servs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451687\"><a href=\"/opinion/451687/national-labor-relations-board-v-horizon-air-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certain background facts are undisputed. As its trade name implies, the Company collects and disposes of waste. It has seven offices within Puerto Rico, including one in Humacao. In April of 2000 &#8212; all dates are in that year unless otherwise indicated &#8212; Santana began work at the Humacao office on assignment from an agency that supplies temporary staff assistance. On September 11, she accepted an offer of regular employment from the district manager, Manuel Fresneda. The Company unilaterally designated December 11 as the end of Santana's probationary period and inserted that date in her personnel form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Local 901 of the Union De Tronquistas De Puerto Rico (the Union) filed an election petition with the Board's regional office on October 13. The Union sought to represent the Company's clerical employees at Humacao (a proposed bargaining unit that included Santana). An election was scheduled to take place on November 21. Although Santana did not sign a union authorization card, she told at least two coworkers, Angie Santiago and Iris Andrews, that she would vote for the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From this point forward, the critical facts are controverted. There is substantial evidence, however, that in mid-October Fresneda interrogated a clerical worker, the aforementioned Iris Andrews, about which employees were sympathetic to the Union. He then recruited Andrews to spy on her coworkers' organizing efforts and to convince Santana to vote against the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 19, Fresneda and Wilma Figueroa (the Company's human resources manager) met with the clerical workers. During the meeting, Fresneda told the employees that if the Union succeeded in its quest, bargaining would begin \"at zero.\" He embellished upon this pronouncement by declaring that there would be no assurances of either job security or paid benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the meeting progressed, Figueroa inquired, without success, as to the identity of the Union's \"delegate\" (i.e., the member of the proposed bargaining unit who was leading the charge for unionization). Figueroa also insisted that the attendees share their work-related problems with her. For the most part, she received a taciturn response. When Figueroa pressed Santana on this issue, the latter fended off the incessant questioning by expressing pleasure with the raise that she recently had received and denying that any problems existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after this meeting, Santana asked Andrews whether she had told anyone about Santana's intention to vote for the Union. Andrews ducked the question. She admitted, however, that Fresneda had enlisted her help in persuading Santana to vote against unionization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning hours of October 23, Santana's infant son became ill and she took him to the emergency room. She telephoned the office a full half-hour before her shift was to start and asked for her supervisor, Milisha Gonz&#225;lez. Since Gonz&#225;lez had not yet arrived, Santana explained her predicament to Jos&#233; Orlando Hern&#225;ndez, a group leader who happened to be in the office. She said that if she was able to leave the hospital at a reasonable hour, she would come to work. As matters turned out, the exigencies of treatment forced Santana to remain at her son's side throughout the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next morning, Santana reported for work at the usual time and volunteered to furnish Gonz&#225;lez with proof of the emergency room visit. Gonz&#225;lez declined the offer, stating that there was \"no problem.\" That statement proved to be overly sanguine: the next day, Gonz&#225;lez handed Santana a reproving memorandum written by the Company's controller, Jos&#233; Rodriguez, in which Rodriguez asserted that Santana had promised to arrive at work late on October 23 but had never appeared. Santana immediately protested this mischaracterization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez's memorandum laid the groundwork for what transpired next. On October 26, he summoned Santana and handed her a letter of dismissal. The letter stated only that the Company was terminating her employment \"for not having completed satisfactorily [her] probationary period.\" Despite Santana's importunings, no one would elaborate on this cryptic statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, the Union lodged unfair labor practice charges against the Company. These charges, which were prosecuted by the Board's regional counsel, involved both the Company's overall conduct vis-&#224;-vis the Union's organizational effort and its treatment of Santana. The charges were heard by an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ found that the Company had transgressed section 8(a)(1) of the Act by improperly interrogating employees, threatening them with economic reprisals if they voted for unionization, impermissibly soliciting employee grievances, creating an impression that pro-union activities were under surveillance, and asking an employee (Andrews) to spy on her coworkers (i.e., to note and report their pro-union activities). The ALJ further found that the Company had violated section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act by cashiering Santana because it believed that she would vote for the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company appealed. The Board, in the absence of exceptions, adopted the first (generalized) set of findings. It simultaneously overruled the Company's exceptions to the second set of findings and upheld the ALJ's assessment of Santana's firing. Its ensuing order required the Company to cease and desist from these unfair labor practices and from interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of their statutory rights. As to Santana, the order directed the Company to offer her reinstatement, make her financially whole, and post a remedial notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long over the Board's generalized findings. Section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 157, guarantees employees \"the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, [and] to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing....\" In turn, section 8(a)(1) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of their section 7 rights. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 158(a)(1). Here, the ALJ found myriad violations of section 8(a)(1) and the Company, in its appeal to the Board, did not object to those findings. <i>See E.C. Waste, Inc.,</i> 339 N.L.R.B. No. 39 at n. 1. Consequently, the Board adopted the findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. When a party fails to raise particular issues before the Board, it ordinarily forfeits any right to challenge those findings on a petition for judicial review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. v.

We hasten to add, however, that those findings remain in the case, and we are free to draw upon them to put the contested violation &#8212; Santana's firing &#8212; into proper perspective. <i>See McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 7; <i>NLRB v.

We start our analysis by erecting the applicable legal framework. Section 8(a)(3) of the Act prohibits employer \"discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(a)(3). An employer violates section 8(a)(3) by punishing an employee for engaging in pro-union or other protected activities. <i>Horizon Air Servs.,</i> 761 F.2d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Withal, not every dismissal during a union organizing campaign infracts section 8(a)(3). Whether or not a particular dismissal crosses the line typically depends on the employer's motive. Under the applicable test, a violation is established where the General Counsel has shown that an employer's antipathy toward pro-union or other protected activity was a substantial or a motivating factor for an adverse employment action. <i>Id.</i> In the first instance, the General Counsel satisfies this test by demonstrating (i) the employee's engagement in the protected activity; (ii) the employer's knowledge of that activity; (iii) the employer's antipathy toward it; and (iv) a causal link between the antipathy and the adverse employment action. <i>NLRB v.

We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company's initial protest is that it did not know how Santana was likely to vote. It is settled beyond peradventure, however, that inferences drawn from circumstantial proof may suffice to establish knowledge. <i>NLRB v. Hosp. of San Pablo, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768062\"><a href=\"/opinion/768062/national-labor-relations-board-v-hospital-san-pablo-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir. 2000); <i>Abbey's Transp. Servs.,</i> 837 F.2d at 579-80. Here, the Board reasonably could have inferred from the evidence of record that the Company knew (or, at least, suspected) that Santana had decided to cast her lot with the Union. To amplify, the Board supportably found that Santana told Andrews that she planned to vote in favor of the Union and that Fresneda enlisted Andrews as a covert operative. One of Andrews's tasks was to report back to Fresneda on her colleagues' attitudes toward unionization. From this collocation of circumstances, we think that the Board reasonably could have inferred &#8212; as it did &#8212; that Andrews relayed the information about Santana's intentions to Fresneda (and, thus, to the Company).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to parry this thrust, the Company posits that it could not have suspected Santana's pro-union bias because her statement at the October 19 meeting that she had \"no problem\" with her working conditions sent a different signal. This argument is unpersuasive. The record supports a conclusion that Santana responded in that way only because Figueroa was engaged in the coercive solicitation of grievances &#8212; and the employer had full knowledge of the pertinent circumstances. Seen in this light, the Board was not compelled to draw the inference that the Company only could have taken Santana's statement as a public declaration of fealty (or even of neutrality).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining elements of the General Counsel's case fall readily into place. Given the litany of generalized section 8(a)(1) violations, the Company's anti-union animus seems evident. The uncontested findings show plainly that the Company responded to the Union's organizing campaign with a no-holds-barred effort to stifle employee support. That deep-seated hostility, in turn, makes more plausible the Board's further finding that the Company perceived Santana as pro-union and fired her so that she would be unable to cast a vote in the upcoming election.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more, the probative value of the timing of the Company's action &#8212; firing Santana in the critical interval between the time that the Union filed its petition for recognition and the planned representation election &#8212; is obvious. The Board reasonably could have considered that chronology as a further indication that Santana's perceived support for the Union was instrumental in her discharge. <i>See, e.g., Abbey's Transp. Servs.,</i> 837 F.2d at 580.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company's attempt to blunt the force of the timing backfires. It claims that it had to act against Santana on October 26 for a neutral reason: her probationary period had expired the previous day and the Company wanted to jettison her before she accrued an entitlement to severance pay. But the Board found (and the Company's records show) that Santana's probationary period was not due to end until December 11. Thus, the premature curtailment of Santana's probationary period operates in favor of the Board's \"unlawful motive\" finding. <i>See Shattuck Denn Mining Corp. v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"272232\"><a href=\"/opinion/272232/shattuck-denn-mining-corporation-iron-king-branch-v-national-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 470 (9th Cir.1966) (explaining that an employer's proffer of a false rationale for an employment decision permits the Board to infer that the employer's actual reason \"is one that [it] desires to conceal &#8212; an unlawful motive\"); <i>see also Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198991\"><a href=\"/opinion/198991/santiago-ramos-v-centennial-pr-wire/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.2000) (noting that a plaintiff may establish pretext by showing \"weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons such that a fact finder could infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197958\"><a href=\"/opinion/197958/hodgens-v-general-dynamics-cor/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 168 (1st Cir.1998) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company's argument that Puerto Rico Law 80, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 185a-185m, automatically shortened Santana's probationary period from ninety days to forty-five days, so that it ended on October 25 rather than on December 11, rests on two fictions. First, Law 80 requires the mutual execution of a writing, prior to the commencement of the employment, specifying the length of the probationary period and the beginning and ending dates of that period. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 185h. The Company adduced no proof that any such writing was ever drafted or signed. Second, the Company's position tries to turn a severance-pay law, meant as a shield for employees, into a sword to be wielded by employers. Because we endorse the Board's well-reasoned rejection of this claim, <i>see E.C. Waste, Inc.,</i> 339 N.L.R.B. No. 39 at n. 2, we dismiss this argument without further elaboration. Here, as in <i>McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 10, it would be perverse to allow the Company \"to invoke a statute enacted for the protection of workers as a justification for its unlawful labor practices.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company has a fallback position: it notes that, on the same day that it discharged Santana, it terminated the employment of its spy (Andrews). Based on this temporal coincidence, the Company suggests that \"it would not seem logical... to dismiss a union supporter and an apparent anti-union employee at the same time\" because \"nothing could be achieved (in terms of gaining a vote).\" Petitioner's Br. at 37. This shows, the Company says, that both firings were legitimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this suggestion. An employer should not be permitted to disguise its unlawful motive for discharging a pro-union activist by the simple expedient of taking a simultaneous action against a coworker who has no union ties. We hold unhesitatingly that retaliating against an employee for supporting a union violates section 8(a)(3) even if the employer also targets other employees who are not pro-union. <i>See McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of the matter is that the General Counsel made out a strong prima facie case, sufficient to shift the burden to the Company to prove that it would have discharged Santana even if it did not regard her as pro-union. The Company endeavors to carry this burden, maintaining that it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for ousting Santana: her absenteeism. This endeavor is unsuccessful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remark, first, the lack of constancy in the Company's explanation. At the time it pink-slipped Santana, it refused to give her any substantive reason for her discharge. Then, in its original position statement to the Board's regional director, the Company asserted that it discharged Santana because she had \"a demonstrated pattern of not arriving on time to work in the mornings.\" This assertion proved to be false: Fresneda admitted in his testimony that Santana was late only once, and then by a paltry seventeen minutes. The Company then came up with another explanation: at the unfair labor practice hearing, Fresneda testified that he and Rodriguez made the decision to fire Santana because she had been absent three times in a relatively short time span. The ALJ rejected this testimony as \"hollow\" and found that the Company's stated ground was pretextual. The Board agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This finding is premised on substantial evidence. In the first place, an employer's shifting explanations for discharging an employee may themselves serve either to ground or to reinforce a finding of pretext. <i>See Abbey's Transp. Servs.,</i> 837 F.2d at 581. This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, the absenteeism claim is implausible on its face. Although the Company now laments Santana's supposed attendance problems, the record reflects that she missed work on only three occasions. That statistic is exaggerated, however, because the Company had approved two of her three absences. To cinch matters, the third absence &#8212; the one involving Santana's sick child &#8212; was consistent with company policy, which at the time required an employee to notify her \"immediate supervisor or management (in the office)\" of an emergency or illness at least thirty minutes before her shift was slated to begin. Santana did exactly that, and her supervisor acknowledged the next day that her absence posed \"no problem.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be to paint the lily. A party who seeks to topple a factfinder's credibility determination typically faces a steep uphill climb. In this instance, the Company cannot scale those heights. Its claim that Santana's three absences led to her termination simply cannot be squared with its contemporaneous actions. On this record, the Board was amply justified in finding that poor attendance was a pretext designed to mask the true reason for Santana's ouster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We have considered each and all of the employer's contentions (including some so baseless as not to warrant discussion in this opinion) and find them without merit. Concluding, as we do, that the Board's findings are well-supported, we deny and dismiss the petition for review and grant the cross-petition for enforcement of the Board's order. Costs are to be taxed in favor of the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So Ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition, the Board's decision and order resolved issues touching upon the representation proceeding.
