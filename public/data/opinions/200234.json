Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, and Yasmin A.\nIrizarry, Assistant Federal Public Defender, on brief for\nappellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Sonia I. Torres-Pabon,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 9, 2002\n\f       Per Curiam.    Defendant-appellant Belkis Altagracia Ortiz-De\n\nMundo appeals from the district court's refusal to grant a downward\n\ndeparture pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2, Application Note 5 (2000).\n\nThe government argues that this             court lacks jurisdiction to\n\nreview the sentencing court's refusal to grant the departure\n\nbecause it was merely an exercise of its discretion.           \"[A]n appeal\n\nlies if the departure decision is based on an assessment that the\n\nsentencing court is powerless to depart on the grounds alleged by\n\nthe proponent, but not if the court simply declines to exercise its\n\ndiscretionary power to depart.\" United States v. Morrison, 46 F.3d\n\n127, 130 (1st Cir. 1995)(emphasis in original).\n\n       \"When determining whether the sentencing court merely refused\n\nto exercise its discretionary power to depart, we consider the\n\ntotality of the record and the sentencing court's actions as\n\nreflected therein.\" Id.       The transcript of the sentencing hearing\n\nclearly   indicates    that   the    sentencing   court   believed    that   a\n\ndeparture was impermissible under § 2L1.2 because one of the\n\nrequirements of Application Note 5 (concerning length of the\n\nsentence imposed for the previous conviction) had not been met.\n\nIts ambiguous statement that \"if I don't exercise it, there would\n\nstill be no question about it,\" absent any reference to facts which\n\nmade such a departure unjustified in this case, does not deprive\n\nthis court of jurisdiction. Compare United States v. Jackson, 93\n\nF.3d    335,   338   (7th   Cir.    1996)   (holding   that   court   lacked\n\njurisdiction \"where the district court unambiguously indicates that\n\n                                       2\n\fit would not depart from the sentence, even if it had authority to\n\ndo so\") (emphasis added). We find that this court has jurisdiction\n\nto   review     the   district       court's    determination       that   it   lacked\n\nauthority to depart pursuant to § 2L1.2, Application Note 5.\n\n       Application       Note    5    permits    a    downward     departure    if    §\n\n2L1.2(b)(1)(A) applies and three other requirements are met.                         The\n\nPSR in this case indicates that the relevant subsection applied and\n\nthat all three of the other requirements of Application Note 5 were\n\nmet.       The district court erred in concluding that the requirement\n\nthat the term of imprisonment imposed for the aggravated felony\n\nwhich triggered the 16-level increase under subsection (b)(1)(A)\n\n\"not exceed one year\" was not met in this case.                    The PSR indicates\n\n(and the district court found) that the relevant prison sentence\n\nimposed      was   one   year.       Therefore,       the    sentencing    court     had\n\nauthority to grant a departure from the guideline sentencing range\n\npursuant to Application Note 5 \"based on the seriousness of the\n\naggravated felony.\" § 2L1.2, comment. (n.5). Its conclusion to the\n\ncontrary was erroneous.\n\n       The    sentence    is     vacated   and       the    case   is   remanded   for\n\nresentencing.1 See Loc.R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       We note that on remand for resentencing the current\nSentencing Guidelines, including the amended version of § 2L1.2,\napply. See, e.g., United States v. Kirkham, 195 F.3d 126, 132 n.5\n(2d Cir. 1999).\n\n                                           3\n\f",
