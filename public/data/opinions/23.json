Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme\nCourt of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.         Two corporations, one based in\n\nMassachusetts, and the other in Michigan, entered into a business\n\narrangement (the Agreement).         After a falling-out, one of the\n\ncontracting parties, PowerShare, Inc., commenced a civil action in\n\nthe district court to enforce the Agreement. The defendant, Syntel,\n\nInc., countered by instituting a parallel arbitration proceeding and\n\nmoving to stay litigation pending arbitration.                 The district court\n\ndenied the motion, and Syntel now appeals.                  We have jurisdiction\n\npursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act to review the interlocutory\n\norder   denying    Syntel's     motion     to        stay    litigation    pending\n\narbitration.    See 9 U.S.C. § 16(a)(1)(A); Combined Energies v. CCI,\n\nInc., 514 F.3d 168, 170 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            The question that lies at the heart of the appeal is\n\nwhether the Agreement contains a mandatory arbitration provision.\n\nThe district court thought not.      We hold that the Agreement does so\n\nprovide and therefore reverse.           Along the way, we address, as a\n\nmatter of first impression at the federal appellate level, an issue\n\nconcerning the standard of review to be applied by a district judge\n\nwhen reviewing a magistrate judge's disposition of a motion to stay\n\nlitigation     pending   the   completion       of    a     parallel   arbitration\n\nproceeding.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            PowerShare and Syntel entered into the Agreement on July\n\n16, 2003.     Their evident purpose was to form a joint venture to\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fhandle the outsourcing needs of third parties.   Paragraph 18 of the\n\nAgreement reads in relevant part:1\n\n          All disputes, controversies and claims directly\n          or indirectly arising out of or in relation to\n          this Agreement or the validity, interpretation,\n          performance, breach, enforceability of the\n          Agreement    (collectively    referred    to   as\n          \"Dispute\") shall be resolved amicably between\n          Syntel and PowerShare at an operational level in\n          consultation with the top management of both\n          companies.    If any such Dispute cannot be\n          resolved, as stated above, the same shall be\n          settled in accordance with the principles and\n          procedures    of   the   American     Arbitration\n          Association and per the decision of an\n          accredited   arbitrator    acceptable   to   both\n          parties. Nothing in this clause shall prejudice\n          Syntel or PowerShare's right to seek injunctive\n          relief or any other equitable/legal relief or\n          remedies available under law.\n\n          Some five years after the execution of the Agreement, a\n\ndispute arose.   On August 8, 2008, PowerShare invoked diversity\n\njurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), and filed suit against Syntel,\n\nclaiming breach of the Agreement, in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts. PowerShare accompanied its\n\ncomplaint with a request for jury trial.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(b).\n\n          In response, Syntel lodged a demand for arbitration with\n\nthe American Arbitration Association (AAA). It simultaneously moved\n\nin the district court to stay PowerShare's action pending resolution\n\n\n\n     1\n       The parties agree that other material at the beginning and\nend of Paragraph 18 is, for present purposes, uncontroversial. We\nthus quote the three relevant sentences of the paragraph and\nhenceforth refer to them as the \"first,\" \"second,\" and \"third\"\nsentences. This practice emulates what the parties have done.\n\n                                -3-\n\fof    the   parallel   arbitration   proceeding.    Not    to   be   outdone,\n\nPowerShare filed a motion to stay the arbitration.\n\n             The district court assigned the motions to a magistrate\n\njudge, who denied Syntel's motion to stay the litigation and granted\n\nPowerShare's cross-motion to stay the arbitration. PowerShare, Inc.\n\nv. Syntel, Inc., 607 F. Supp. 2d 240, 244 (D. Mass. 2008).            In her\n\nrescript, the magistrate judge concluded that, under the Agreement,\n\narbitration was optional.      Id. at 241.    She reasoned that the third\n\nsentence of Paragraph 18, which refers to \"any other equitable/legal\n\nrelief or remedies available under law,\" made manifest the parties'\n\nintention to allow litigation because a jury trial is a remedy\n\n\"available under law.\"      Id. at 243.    In so holding, the magistrate\n\njudge rejected Syntel's argument that the federal policy favoring\n\narbitration should be given weight.        Rather, she declared that this\n\npolicy applies only to the resolution of \"scope\" questions, not to\n\nquestions about whether a contract calls for mandatory arbitration\n\nat all.     Id. at 244.\n\n             Syntel appealed this decision to the district judge, Fed\n\nR. Civ. P. 72(a), who issued an electronic order stating that the\n\ndecision was \"not clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\"                This\n\ntimely appeal followed.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n             We divide our analysis into two parts.       First, we clarify\n\nthe standard of review to be employed by a district judge when\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\freviewing a magistrate judge's order on a motion to stay litigation\n\npending the resolution of a parallel arbitration proceeding.           Only\n\nthen do we proceed to the merits.\n\n                                   A.\n\n           The   Federal   Magistrates    Act   confers   authority   upon\n\ndistrict judges to designate magistrate judges to hear pretrial\n\nmotions.   28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1).       Magistrate judges serve as aides\n\nto, and under the supervision of, district judges; but magistrate\n\njudges are not themselves Article III judicial officers.              Given\n\ntheir status as Article I judicial officers, magistrate judges\n\nordinarily may not decide motions that are dispositive either of a\n\ncase or of a claim or defense within a case.2        This is so because\n\n\"[t]he Constitution requires that Article III judges exercise final\n\ndecisionmaking authority.\"    Ocelot Oil Corp. v. Sparrow Indus., 847\n\nF.2d 1458, 1463 (10th Cir. 1988); see Stauble v. Warrob, Inc., 977\n\nF.2d 690, 693-94 (1st Cir. 1992). Dispositive motions include those\n\nenumerated in 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A), but this list is not\n\nexhaustive; rather, it simply \"informs the classification of other\n\nmotions as dispositive or nondispositive.\"         Phinney v. Wentworth\n\nDouglas Hosp., 199 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           Consistent with this dichotomy between dispositive and\n\nnon-dispositive motions, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72 sets out\n\n\n     2\n       We say \"ordinarily\" because there is an exception for cases\nin which all parties consent. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(c); Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 73. The record reveals no such consent here.\n\n                                  -5-\n\ftwo separate standards of review to be employed by a district judge\n\nin reviewing a magistrate judge's determinations. When a magistrate\n\njudge decides a non-dispositive motion, the district judge may,\n\ngiven a timely appeal, set aside the order if it \"is clearly\n\nerroneous or is contrary to law.\"       Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a).    Absent a\n\ntimely appeal, the order stands.       Id.    When, however, a magistrate\n\njudge passes upon a dispositive motion, he or she may only issue a\n\nrecommended decision, and if there is a timely objection, the\n\ndistrict judge must engage in de novo review.            Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n72(b).   Absent a timely objection, the recommended decision ripens\n\ninto an order.    Id.\n\n          Here, the district judge employed the \"clearly erroneous\n\nor contrary to law\" standard applicable to non-dispositive motions\n\nunder Rule 72(a).       Syntel protests that its motion to stay the\n\nlitigation   to   allow   resolution     of   the   parallel   arbitration\n\nproceeding was, in effect, dispositive of the court case and, thus,\n\nshould have engendered de novo review by the district judge pursuant\n\nto Rule 72(b).\n\n          No court of appeals has decided this precise question.\n\nNevertheless, a number of district courts have held that motions to\n\nstay litigation and compel related arbitration are non-dispositive\n\nmotions under Rule 72(a).     See, e.g., Gonzalez v. GE Group Adm'rs,\n\nInc., 321 F. Supp. 2d 165, 166 (D. Mass. 2004); Torrance v. Aames\n\nFunding Corp., 242 F. Supp. 2d 862, 865 (D. Or. 2002); All Saint's\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fBrands, Inc. v. Brewery Group Den., A/S, 57 F. Supp. 2d 825, 833 (D.\n\nMinn. 1999); Herko v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 978 F. Supp. 141, 142\n\nn.1 (W.D.N.Y. 1997).        But see Flannery v. Tri-State Div., 402 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 819, 821 (E.D. Mich. 2005) (concluding that such a motion,\n\nif granted, is dispositive because it \"has the practical effect of\n\nallowing the case to proceed in a different forum\").\n\n            Motions to stay litigation pending the resolution of\n\nparallel    arbitration     proceedings      are   not    among     the   motions\n\nenumerated in 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A).            Nor are they of the same\n\ncharacter as the listed motions.           A federal court's ruling on a\n\nmotion to stay litigation pending arbitration is not dispositive of\n\neither the case or any claim or defense within it.                        Although\n\ngranting or denying a stay may be an important step in the life of\n\na   case   (lawyers   are   keenly   aware    that   there    are    substantive\n\nconsequences to whether or not a stay is granted), in the last\n\nanalysis a stay order is merely suspensory.              Even if such a motion\n\nis granted, the court still retains authority to dissolve the stay\n\nor, after the arbitration has run its course, to make orders with\n\nrespect to the arbitral award.            See Federal Arbitration Act, 9\n\nU.S.C. § 9 (permitting parties to apply to the court for an order\n\nconfirming the award); id. § 10 (providing district courts with\n\nauthority to vacate an arbitral award); id. § 11 (providing district\n\ncourts with authority to modify an arbitral award). We acknowledge\n\nthat the scope of judicial review of arbitral awards is very narrow,\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fbut that does not extinguish such review.       See Advest, Inc. v.\n\nMcCarthy, 914 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).     Thus, there is no final\n\nexercise of Article III power at the time the court acts on the\n\nmotion to stay.   See Herko, 978 F. Supp. at 142 n.1.\n\n            In light of these realities, we conclude that, from a\n\nprocedural standpoint, the district judge acted appropriately in\n\nreviewing the magistrate judge's denial of Syntel's motion to stay\n\nunder the \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law\" standard elucidated\n\nin Rule 72(a).\n\n            In this case arbitrability depended on interpreting a\n\ncontractual term, a question of law for the courts.     See Combined\n\nEnergies, 514 F.3d at 171.      Nothing in the contract expressly\n\nprovided that an arbitrator would decide questions of arbitrability\n\ninstead.    See Coady v. Ashcraft & Gerel, 223 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   When, as in this case, review of a non-dispositive motion by\n\na district judge turns on a pure question of law, that review is\n\nplenary under the \"contrary to law\" branch of the Rule 72(a)\n\nstandard.   See, e.g., Haines v. Liggett Group Inc., 975 F.2d 81, 91\n\n(3d Cir. 1992); EEOC v. Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 621 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 603, 605-06 (W.D. Tenn. 2009); Sprint Commc'ns Co. v.\n\nVonage Holdings Corp., 500 F. Supp. 2d 1290, 1346-47 (D. Kan. 2007);\n\n14 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 72.11[1][b]\n\n(3d ed. 2009); 12 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Richard L.\n\nMarcus, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3069, at 350 (2d ed. 1997).\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fThis means that, for questions of law, there is no practical\n\ndifference between review under Rule 72(a)'s \"contrary to law\"\n\nstandard and review under Rule 72(b)'s de novo standard.\n\n          To complete the picture, we limn the standard of review at\n\nthis level.     Here, too, the purely legal nature of the question\n\ncontrols: we, like the district court, must afford de novo review to\n\nthe purely legal question of whether the Agreement provides for\n\nmandatory arbitration of the parties' dispute.              See Osband v.\n\nWoodford, 290 F.3d 1036, 1041 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n                                    B.\n\n          Arbitration is a matter of contract.         First Options of\n\nChi., Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943 (1995).       In this case, the\n\nAgreement contains a choice-of-law provision in favor of the laws of\n\nthe United States.      The parties agree that this provision brings\n\ninto play the federal common and statutory law.\n\n          In construing a contract governed by federal common law,\n\ncourts   must   be    guided   by   common-sense    rules    of   contract\n\ninterpretation.      Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disab. Plan, 70\n\nF.3d 173, 178 (1st Cir. 1995); Burnham v. Guardian Life Ins. Co.,\n\n873 F.2d 486, 489 (1st Cir. 1989).        And although more a product of\n\nthe Federal Arbitration Act than of federal common law, per se,\n\nfederal law undeniably includes a policy favoring arbitration.        See\n\nVolt Info. Scis., Inc. v. Bd. of Trs. of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ.,\n\n489 U.S. 468, 475-76 (1989).        At a minimum, this policy requires\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fthat \"ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself\n\n[must be] resolved in favor of arbitration.\"           Id.\n\n           Syntel contends that this policy creates a presumption of\n\narbitrability here.    PowerShare demurs, relying principally on our\n\ndecision   in   Paul   Revere   Variable     Annuity     Insurance    Co.     v.\n\nKirschhofer, 226 F.3d 15, 25 (1st Cir. 2000), which it characterizes\n\nas limiting the presumption of arbitrability to questions about the\n\nscope of an arbitration agreement (as contrasted with questions\n\nabout the existence of such an agreement).             Because the issue in\n\nthis case is whether a mandatory arbitration agreement exists,\n\nPowerShare contends that the presumption does not attach.\n\n           Despite the parties' importunings, we need not decide\n\nwhether the federal policy favoring arbitration applies here.               Even\n\nif we assume that the presumption does not affect the decisional\n\ncalculus, the plain language of the Agreement mandates arbitration.\n\nThus, the applicability vel non of the presumption makes no ultimate\n\ndifference.\n\n           With this question set to one side, we go directly to the\n\nlanguage of the Agreement itself.       Paragraph 18, quoted above, sets\n\nout the mechanisms for resolving disputes between the parties.               The\n\nfirst   sentence   provides   that   all    disputes    \"shall   be   resolved\n\namicably between Syntel and PowerShare.\"               The second sentence\n\nprovides that if a dispute cannot be resolved amicably, it \"shall be\n\nsettled in accordance with the principles and procedures of the\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fAmerican   Arbitration   Association       and   per    the   decision    of   an\n\naccredited arbitrator.\"       The third sentence states that \"[n]othing\n\nin this clause shall prejudice Syntel or PowerShare's right to seek\n\ninjunctive relief or any other equitable/legal relief or remedies\n\navailable under law.\"\n\n           In deciding whether this language mandates arbitration, we\n\nare mindful that \"an interpretation which gives effect to all the\n\nterms of a contract is preferable to one that harps on isolated\n\nprovisions, heedless of context.\"          Blackie v. Maine, 75 F.3d 716,\n\n722 (1st Cir. 1996); see Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 892\n\nF.2d 1076, 1084 (1st Cir. 1989).         In line with this wise counsel, we\n\nstrive for a reasonable interpretation of the Agreement as a whole,\n\nwhile avoiding constructions that would render any term within it\n\nmeaningless.     Summit Packaging Sys., Inc. v. Kenyon & Kenyon, 273\n\nF.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2001); Jimenez v. Penin. & Oriental Steam\n\nNavig. Co., 974 F.2d 221, 223 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           PowerShare urges us to focus on the third sentence of\n\nParagraph 18 and to read that sentence as reserving to the parties\n\nthe right to pursue remedies at law (that is, the right to litigate\n\nin court).     In order to square this interpretation with the second\n\nsentence of Paragraph 18, PowerShare suggests that the parties\n\nintended   arbitration   to    be   an   optional      mechanism   for   dispute\n\nresolution.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f          Although PowerShare's interpretation of the third sentence\n\nmay be plausible when read in isolation, that interpretation cannot\n\nbe   reconciled with the unvarnished language of Paragraph 18's\n\nsecond sentence.   That sentence states explicitly that disputes\n\nbetween the parties \"shall\" be settled through arbitration.       The\n\nword \"shall\" denotes obligation, not choice; therefore, accepting\n\nPowerShare's interpretation of the third sentence would drain the\n\nsecond sentence of its essential meaning.     Put bluntly, the word\n\n\"shall\" in the second sentence would be rendered nugatory were we to\n\nread the arbitration provision as creating nothing more than an\n\noption.   That PowerShare's interpretation of Paragraph 18 would\n\nnegate the obvious meaning of the second sentence is a powerful\n\nargument against accepting that interpretation.     See Mastrobuono v.\n\nShearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52, 64 (1995) (rejecting\n\nreading of two clauses in an arbitration agreement as \"untenable\"\n\nwhen that reading \"sets up the two clauses in conflict with one\n\nanother\"); Blackie, 75 F.3d at 722 (rejecting reading of one section\n\nof a contract when that reading would \"flatly contradict[]\" other\n\nsections); see also Smart, 70 F.3d at 179 (\"Accepted canons of\n\nconstruction   forbid   the   balkanization    of     contracts   for\n\ninterpretative purposes.\").\n\n          We conclude that the only sensible reading of Paragraph 18\n\nis that the second sentence mandates arbitration and the third\n\nsentence furnishes the arbitrator with broad legal and equitable\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fpowers should either party seek special kinds of relief (say, an\n\ninjunction).   This is the only plausible interpretation of the third\n\nsentence that fits with, and gives effect to, the plain meaning of\n\nthe second sentence.3\n\n          In an endeavor to deflect the force of this reasoning,\n\nPowerShare argues that a jury trial is a \"remedy\" preserved in the\n\nthird sentence.    It says that because only a court can implement\n\nsuch a remedy, the interpretation that we propose must be incorrect.\n\n          This    argument   is   unconvincing.     Unlike   the     second\n\nsentence, which plainly mandates arbitration, the reference in the\n\nthird sentence to \"any other equitable/legal relief or remedies\n\navailable under law\" never mentions jury trials (or, for that\n\nmatter, recourse to the courts).          Moreover, there is no textual\n\nsupport for a belief that this reference necessarily includes jury\n\ntrials.\n\n          PowerShare tries to counter-punch by citing a pair of\n\ndecisions holding that \"remedies\" include \"jury trials.\"           But some\n\nwords mean different things in different contexts, see United States\n\n\n     3\n       Other courts have reached similar conclusions. See, e.g.,\nLaughton v. CGI Techs. & Sol'ns, Inc., 602 F. Supp. 2d 262, 265 (D.\nMass. 2009) (holding, in similar circumstances, that \"[t]he correct\nreading of the Arbitration and Cumulative Remedies provisions is\nthat arbitration is mandatory, but the arbitrator is not limited to\nawarding certain remedies\" (citation and internal quotation mark\nomitted)); Kingstown Corp. v. Black Cat Cranberry Corp., 839 N.E.2d\n333, 338 (Mass. App. Ct. 2005) (holding, in similar circumstances,\nthat the agreement \"provides an aggrieved party with the right to\nmandatory arbitration while also empowering an arbitrator to grant\ninjunctive or other equitable relief\").\n\n                                   -13-\n\fv. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 74 (1st Cir. 2004) (explaining that \"words\n\nare like chameleons; they frequently have different shades of\n\nmeaning depending upon the circumstances\"); and when context is\n\ntaken into account, the decisions on which PowerShare relies are\n\noff-point.       Each of them interprets a savings clause in a maritime\n\nstatute.     See Lewis v. Lewis & Clark Marine, Inc., 531 U.S. 438,\n\n454-55 (2001) (holding that \"[t]rial by jury is an obvious . . .\n\nexample of the remedies available\" under the savings to suitors\n\nclause of 28 U.S.C. § 1333(1)); Curcuru v. Rose's Oil Serv., Inc.,\n\n802 N.E.2d 1032, 1037 (Mass. 2004) (holding that savings clause of\n\nthe Death on the High Seas Act preserves jury trial right in state\n\ncourt).     These decisions, immersed in the historical context of\n\nadmiralty law, offer little guidance for the issue of contract\n\ninterpretation with which we must grapple.             See, e.g., Laughton v.\n\nCGI Techs. & Sol'ns, Inc., 602 F. Supp. 2d 262, 265 (D. Mass. 2009)\n\n(rejecting argument that reference to \"remedies\" in an agreement\n\ncontaining a mandatory arbitration clause preserves a party's right\n\nto litigate and, thus, renders the arbitration provision elective);\n\nBeaver Constr. Co. v. Lakehouse, L.L.C., 742 So. 2d 159, 164 (Ala.\n\n1999) (similar).\n\n            In the end, we come full circle.           Reading the \"remedies\"\n\nlanguage in the third sentence to allow access to a jury trial would\n\nplace     this    provision   at   cross    purposes    with   the   mandatory\n\narbitration provision spelled out in the second sentence.                That\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fwould violate one of the cardinal rules of contract interpretation:\n\n\"that a document should be read to give effect to all its provisions\n\nand to render them consistent with each other.\"       Mastrobuono, 514\n\nU.S. at 63.   Confronted with two competing interpretations of the\n\n\"remedies\" language, we must give preference to the one that makes\n\nsense of the Agreement as a whole.      See Blackie, 75 F.3d at 722.\n\n          PowerShare tries to turn this principle to its advantage.\n\nIt asserts that our reading of the third sentence — to afford the\n\narbitrator broad power to dispense legal and equitable remedies —\n\nrenders that sentence superfluous because, under the AAA's rules, an\n\narbitrator already has those powers. As support for this assertion,\n\nPowerShare identifies Rule 34(a) of the AAA's Commercial Arbitration\n\nRules, which allows an arbitrator to \"take whatever interim measures\n\nhe or she deems necessary.\"\n\n          Here, however, the parties went beyond Rule 34(a); they\n\nagreed to vest in the arbitrator broad powers extending to the\n\narbitrator's final decisionmaking, not just powers in connection\n\nwith interim relief.   The \"remedies\" provision, read in this way, is\n\nnot superfluous but, rather, makes perfect sense.        In commercial\n\narbitration cases, the scope of a final award is governed by Rule\n\n43(a), which provides that the arbitrator \"may grant any remedy or\n\nrelief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable and within the\n\nscope of the agreement of the parties\" (emphasis supplied). Because\n\nan arbitrator's power to award relief can be shaped by the parties'\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fagreement, it is reasonable — and certainly not redundant — for the\n\nparties to clarify that the person arbitrating their disputes will\n\nbe free to choose from the widest possible array of remedies.\n\nConsequently, PowerShare's superfluity argument fails.\n\n           The short of it is that the Agreement as a whole admits of\n\nonly one reasonable interpretation: the parties are obliged to\n\nsubmit their disputes to arbitration.    See Fashion House, 892 F.2d\n\nat 1084 (\"Black letter law teaches that 'a construction which\n\ncomports with the Agreement as a whole is to be preferred even if it\n\nbe thought that certain language, viewed only by itself, more\n\nreadily suggests something else.'\"     (quoting Spartans Indus., Inc.\n\nv. John Pilling Shoe Co., 385 F.2d 495, 499 (1st Cir. 1967))).\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.   For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe reverse the decision appealed from and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict court for the entry of an order staying the litigation\n\npending the resolution of the parallel arbitration proceeding,\n\ndissolving the existing stay of arbitration, and making such other\n\nprovisions consistent with this opinion, as the district court may\n\ndeem meet.\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f",

After a falling-out, one of the contracting parties, PowerShare, Inc., commenced a civil action in the district court to enforce the Agreement. The defendant, Syntel, Inc., countered by instituting a parallel arbitration proceeding and moving to stay litigation pending arbitration. The district court denied the motion, and Syntel now appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act to review the interlocutory order denying Syntel's motion to stay litigation pending arbitration. <i>See</i> 9 U.S.C. § 16(a)(1)(A); <i>Combined Energies v. CCI, Inc.,</i> 514 F.3d 168, 170 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The question that lies at the heart of the appeal is whether the Agreement contains a mandatory arbitration provision. The district court thought not. We hold that the Agreement does so provide and therefore reverse. Along the way, we address, as a matter of first impression at the federal appellate level, an issue concerning the standard of review to be applied by a district judge when reviewing a magistrate judge's disposition of a motion to stay litigation pending the completion of a parallel arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>PowerShare and Syntel entered into the Agreement on July 16, 2003. Their evident purpose was to form a joint venture to handle the outsourcing needs of third parties. Paragraph 18 of the Agreement reads in relevant part:<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>All disputes, controversies and claims directly or indirectly arising out of or in relation to this Agreement or the validity, interpretation, performance, breach, enforceability of the Agreement (collectively referred to as \"Dispute\") shall be resolved amicably between Syntel and PowerShare at an operational level in consultation with the top management of both companies. If any such Dispute cannot be resolved, as stated above, the same shall be settled in accordance with the principles and procedures of the American Arbitration Association and per the decision of an accredited arbitrator acceptable to both parties. Nothing in this clause shall prejudice Syntel or PowerShare's right to seek injunctive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> relief or any other equitable/legal relief or remedies available under law.</blockquote>\n<p>Some five years after the execution of the Agreement, a dispute arose. On August 8, 2008, PowerShare invoked diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), and filed suit against Syntel, claiming breach of the Agreement, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. PowerShare accompanied its complaint with a request for jury trial. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 38(b).</p>\n<p>In response, Syntel lodged a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). It simultaneously moved in the district court to stay PowerShare's action pending resolution of the parallel arbitration proceeding. Not to be outdone, PowerShare filed a motion to stay the arbitration.</p>\n<p>The district court assigned the motions to a magistrate judge, who denied Syntel's motion to stay the litigation and granted PowerShare's cross-motion to stay the arbitration. <i>PowerShare, Inc. v. Syntel, Inc.,</i> 607 F.Supp.2d 240, 244 (D.Mass. 2008). In her rescript, the magistrate judge concluded that, under the Agreement, arbitration was optional. <i>Id.</i> at 241. She reasoned that the third sentence of Paragraph 18, which refers to \"any other equitable/legal relief or remedies available under law,\" made manifest the parties' intention to allow litigation because a jury trial is a remedy \"available under law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 243. In so holding, the magistrate judge rejected Syntel's argument that the federal policy favoring arbitration should be given weight. Rather, she declared that this policy applies only to the resolution of \"scope\" questions, not to questions about whether a contract calls for mandatory arbitration at all. <i>Id.</i> at 244.</p>\n<p>Syntel appealed this decision to the district judge, Fed R. Civ. P. 72(a), who issued an electronic order stating that the decision was \"not clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\" This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We divide our analysis into two parts. First, we clarify the standard of review to be employed by a district judge when reviewing a magistrate judge's order on a motion to stay litigation pending the resolution of a parallel arbitration proceeding. Only then do we proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A.</i></h2>\n<p>The Federal Magistrates Act confers authority upon district judges to designate magistrate judges to hear pretrial motions. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). Magistrate judges serve as aides to, and under the supervision of, district judges; but magistrate judges are not themselves Article III judicial officers. Given their status as Article I judicial officers, magistrate judges ordinarily may not decide motions that are dispositive either of a case or of a claim or defense within a case.<sup>[2]</sup> This is so because \"[t]he Constitution requires that Article III judges exercise final decisionmaking authority.\" <i>Ocelot Oil Corp. v. Sparrow Indus.,</i> 847 F.2d 1458, 1463 (10th Cir.1988); <i>see </i><i>Stauble v. Warrob, Inc.,</i> 977 F.2d 690, 693-94 (1st Cir. 1992). Dispositive motions include those enumerated in 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A), but this list is not exhaustive; rather, it simply \"informs the classification of other motions as dispositive or nondispositive.\" <i>Phinney v. Wentworth Douglas Hosp.,</i> 199 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>Consistent with this dichotomy between dispositive and non-dispositive motions, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72 sets out two separate standards of review to be employed by a district judge in reviewing a magistrate judge's determinations. When a magistrate judge decides a non-dispositive motion, the district judge may, given a timely appeal, set aside the order if it \"is clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a). Absent a timely appeal, the order stands. <i>Id.</i> When, however, a magistrate judge passes upon a dispositive motion, he or she may only issue a recommended decision, and if there is a timely objection, the district judge must engage in de novo review. Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b). Absent a timely objection, the recommended decision ripens into an order. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Here, the district judge employed the \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law\" standard applicable to non-dispositive motions under Rule 72(a). Syntel protests that its motion to stay the litigation to allow resolution of the parallel arbitration proceeding was, in effect, dispositive of the court case and, thus, should have engendered de novo review by the district judge pursuant to Rule 72(b).</p>\n<p>No court of appeals has decided this precise question. Nevertheless, a number of district courts have held that motions to stay litigation and compel related arbitration are non-dispositive motions under Rule 72(a). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gonzalez v. GE Group Adm'rs, Inc.,</i> 321 F.Supp.2d 165, 166 (D.Mass.2004); <i>Torrance v. Aames Funding Corp.,</i> 242 F.Supp.2d 862, 865 (D.Or.2002); <i>All Saint's Brands, Inc. v. Brewery Group Den., A/S,</i> 57 F.Supp.2d 825, 833 (D.Minn.1999); <i>Herko v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 978 F.Supp. 141, 142 n. 1 (W.D.N.Y.1997). <i>But see </i><i>Flannery v. Tri-State Div.,</i> 402 F.Supp.2d 819, 821 (E.D.Mich.2005) (concluding that such a motion, if granted, is dispositive because it \"has the practical effect of allowing the case to proceed in a different forum\").</p>\n<p>Motions to stay litigation pending the resolution of parallel arbitration proceedings are not among the motions enumerated in 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A). Nor are they of the same character as the listed motions. A federal court's ruling on a motion to stay litigation pending arbitration is not dispositive of either the case or any claim or defense within it. Although granting or denying a stay may be an important step in the life of a case (lawyers are keenly aware that there are substantive consequences to whether or not a stay is granted), in the last analysis a stay order is merely suspensory. Even if such a motion is granted, the court still retains authority to dissolve the stay or, after the arbitration has run its course, to make orders with respect to the arbitral award. <i>See</i> Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 9 (permitting parties to apply to the court for an order confirming the award); <i>id.</i> § 10 (providing district courts with authority to vacate an arbitral award); <i>id.</i> § 11 (providing district courts with authority to modify an arbitral award). We acknowledge that the scope of judicial review of arbitral awards is very narrow, but that does not extinguish such review. <i>See </i><i>Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy,</i> 914 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1990). Thus, there is no final exercise of Article III power at the time the court acts on the motion to stay. <i>See </i><i>Herko,</i> 978 F.Supp. at 142 n. 1.</p>\n<p>In light of these realities, we conclude that, from a procedural standpoint, the district judge acted appropriately in reviewing the magistrate judge's denial of Syntel's motion to stay under the \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law\" standard elucidated in Rule 72(a).</p>\n<p>In this case arbitrability depended on interpreting a contractual term, a question of law for the courts. <i>See </i><i>Combined</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> <i>Energies,</i> 514 F.3d at 171. Nothing in the contract expressly provided that an arbitrator would decide questions of arbitrability instead. <i>See </i><i>Coady v. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel,</i> 223 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.2000). When, as in this case, review of a nondispositive motion by a district judge turns on a pure question of law, that review is plenary under the \"contrary to law\" branch of the Rule 72(a) standard. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Haines v. Liggett Group Inc.,</i> 975 F.2d 81, 91 (3d Cir.1992); <i>EEOC v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co.,</i> 621 F.Supp.2d 603, 605-06 (W.D.Tenn.2009); <i>Sprint Commc'ns Co. v. Vonage Holdings Corp.,</i> 500 F.Supp.2d 1290, 1346-47 (D.Kan.2007); 14 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 72.11[1][b] (3d ed.2009); 12 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3069, at 350 (2d ed.1997). This means that, for questions of law, there is no practical difference between review under Rule 72(a)'s \"contrary to law\" standard and review under Rule 72(b)'s de novo standard.</p>\n<p>To complete the picture, we limn the standard of review at this level. Here, too, the purely legal nature of the question controls: we, like the district court, must afford de novo review to the purely legal question of whether the Agreement provides for mandatory arbitration of the parties' dispute. <i>See </i><i>Osband v. Woodford,</i> 290 F.3d 1036, 1041 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B.</i></h2>\n<p>Arbitration is a matter of contract. <i>First Options of Chi., Inc. v. Kaplan,</i> 514 U.S. 938, 943, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995). In this case, the Agreement contains a choice-of-law provision in favor of the laws of the United States. The parties agree that this provision brings into play the federal common and statutory law.</p>\n<p>In construing a contract governed by federal common law, courts must be guided by common-sense rules of contract interpretation. <i>Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disab. Plan,</i> 70 F.3d 173, 178 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Burnham v. Guardian Life Ins. Co.,</i> 873 F.2d 486, 489 (1st Cir.1989). And although more a product of the Federal Arbitration Act than of federal common law, per se, federal law undeniably includes a policy favoring arbitration. <i>See </i><i>Volt Info. Scis., Inc. v. Bd. of Trs. of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ.,</i> 489 U.S. 468, 475-76, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989). At a minimum, this policy requires that \"ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself [must be] resolved in favor of arbitration.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Syntel contends that this policy creates a presumption of arbitrability here. PowerShare demurs, relying principally on our decision in <i>Paul Revere Variable Annuity Insurance Co. v. Kirschhofer,</i> 226 F.3d 15, 25 (1st Cir.2000), which it characterizes as limiting the presumption of arbitrability to questions about the <i>scope</i> of an arbitration agreement (as contrasted with questions about the existence of such an agreement). Because the issue in this case is whether a mandatory arbitration agreement exists, PowerShare contends that the presumption does not attach.</p>\n<p>Despite the parties' importunings, we need not decide whether the federal policy favoring arbitration applies here. Even if we assume that the presumption does not affect the decisional calculus, the plain language of the Agreement mandates arbitration. Thus, the applicability vel non of the presumption makes no ultimate difference.</p>\n<p>With this question set to one side, we go directly to the language of the Agreement itself. Paragraph 18, quoted above, sets out the mechanisms for resolving disputes between the parties. The first sentence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> provides that all disputes \"shall be resolved amicably between Syntel and PowerShare.\" The second sentence provides that if a dispute cannot be resolved amicably, it \"shall be settled in accordance with the principles and procedures of the American Arbitration Association and per the decision of an accredited arbitrator.\" The third sentence states that \"[n]othing in this clause shall prejudice Syntel or PowerShare's right to seek injunctive relief or any other equitable/legal relief or remedies available under law.\"</p>\n<p>In deciding whether this language mandates arbitration, we are mindful that \"an interpretation which gives effect to all the terms of a contract is preferable to one that harps on isolated provisions, heedless of context.\" <i>Blackie v. Maine,</i> 75 F.3d 716, 722 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see </i><i>Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart Corp.,</i> 892 F.2d 1076, 1084 (1st Cir.1989). In line with this wise counsel, we strive for a reasonable interpretation of the Agreement as a whole, while avoiding constructions that would render any term within it meaningless. <i>Summit Packaging Sys., Inc. v. Kenyon &amp; Kenyon,</i> 273 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Jimenez v. Penin. &amp; Oriental Steam Navig. Co.,</i> 974 F.2d 221, 223 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n<p>PowerShare urges us to focus on the third sentence of Paragraph 18 and to read that sentence as reserving to the parties the right to pursue remedies at law (that is, the right to litigate in court). In order to square this interpretation with the second sentence of Paragraph 18, PowerShare suggests that the parties intended arbitration to be an optional mechanism for dispute resolution.</p>\n<p>Although PowerShare's interpretation of the third sentence may be plausible when read in isolation, that interpretation cannot be reconciled with the unvarnished language of Paragraph 18's second sentence. That sentence states explicitly that disputes between the parties \"shall\" be settled through arbitration. The word \"shall\" denotes obligation, not choice; therefore, accepting PowerShare's interpretation of the third sentence would drain the second sentence of its essential meaning. Put bluntly, the word \"shall\" in the second sentence would be rendered nugatory were we to read the arbitration provision as creating nothing more than an option. That PowerShare's interpretation of Paragraph 18 would negate the obvious meaning of the second sentence is a powerful argument against accepting that interpretation. <i>See </i><i>Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.,</i> 514 U.S. 52, 64, 115 S.Ct. 1212, 131 L.Ed.2d 76 (1995) (rejecting reading of two clauses in an arbitration agreement as \"untenable\" when that reading \"sets up the two clauses in conflict with one another\"); <i>Blackie,</i> 75 F.3d at 722 (rejecting reading of one section of a contract when that reading would \"flatly contradict[]\" other sections); <i>see also </i><i>Smart,</i> 70 F.3d at 179 (\"Accepted canons of construction forbid the balkanization of contracts for interpretative purposes.\").</p>\n<p>We conclude that the only sensible reading of Paragraph 18 is that the second sentence mandates arbitration and the third sentence furnishes the arbitrator with broad legal and equitable powers should either party seek special kinds of relief (say, an injunction). This is the only plausible interpretation of the third sentence that fits with, and gives effect to, the plain meaning of the second sentence.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> In an endeavor to deflect the force of this reasoning, PowerShare argues that a jury trial is a \"remedy\" preserved in the third sentence. It says that because only a court can implement such a remedy, the interpretation that we propose must be incorrect.</p>\n<p>This argument is unconvincing. Unlike the second sentence, which plainly mandates arbitration, the reference in the third sentence to \"any other equitable/legal relief or remedies available under law\" never mentions jury trials (or, for that matter, recourse to the courts). Moreover, there is no textual support for a belief that this reference necessarily includes jury trials.</p>\n<p>PowerShare tries to counter-punch by citing a pair of decisions holding that \"remedies\" include \"jury trials.\" But some words mean different things in different contexts, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Romain,</i> 393 F.3d 63, 74 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining that \"words are like chameleons; they frequently have different shades of meaning depending upon the circumstances\"); and when context is taken into account, the decisions on which PowerShare relies are off-point. Each of them interprets a savings clause in a maritime statute. <i>See </i><i>Lewis v. Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc.,</i> 531 U.S. 438, 454-55, 121 S.Ct. 993, 148 L.Ed.2d 931 (2001) (holding that \"[t]rial by jury is an obvious ... example of the remedies available\" under the savings to suitors clause of 28 U.S.C. § 1333(1)); <i>Curcuru v. Rose's Oil Serv., Inc.,</i> 441 Mass. 12, 802 N.E.2d 1032, 1037 (2004) (holding that savings clause of the Death on the High Seas Act preserves jury trial right in state court). These decisions, immersed in the historical context of admiralty law, offer little guidance for the issue of contract interpretation with which we must grapple. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Laughton v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sol'ns, Inc.,</i> 602 F.Supp.2d 262, 265 (D.Mass.2009) (rejecting argument that reference to \"remedies\" in an agreement containing a mandatory arbitration clause preserves a party's right to litigate and, thus, renders the arbitration provision elective); <i>Beaver Constr. Co. v. Lakehouse, L.L.C.,</i> 742 So.2d 159, 164 (Ala. 1999) (similar).</p>\n<p>In the end, we come full circle. Reading the \"remedies\" language in the third sentence to allow access to a jury trial would place this provision at cross purposes with the mandatory arbitration provision spelled out in the second sentence. That would violate one of the cardinal rules of contract interpretation: \"that a document should be read to give effect to all its provisions and to render them consistent with each other.\" <i>Mastrobuono,</i> 514 U.S. at 63, 115 S.Ct. 1212. Confronted with two competing interpretations of the \"remedies\" language, we must give preference to the one that makes sense of the Agreement as a whole. <i>See </i><i>Blackie,</i> 75 F.3d at 722.</p>\n<p>PowerShare tries to turn this principle to its advantage. It asserts that our reading of the third sentence  to afford the arbitrator broad power to dispense legal and equitable remedies  renders that sentence superfluous because, under the AAA's rules, an arbitrator already has those powers. As support for this assertion, PowerShare identifies Rule 34(a) of the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules, which allows an arbitrator to \"take whatever interim measures he or she deems necessary.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> Here, however, the parties went beyond Rule 34(a); they agreed to vest in the arbitrator broad powers extending to the arbitrator's final decisionmaking, not just powers in connection with interim relief. The \"remedies\" provision, read in this way, is not superfluous but, rather, makes perfect sense. In commercial arbitration cases, the scope of a final award is governed by Rule 43(a), which provides that the arbitrator \"may grant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable <i>and within the scope of the agreement of the parties</i>\" (emphasis supplied). Because an arbitrator's power to award relief can be shaped by the parties' agreement, it is reasonable  and certainly not redundant  for the parties to clarify that the person arbitrating their disputes will be free to choose from the widest possible array of remedies. Consequently, PowerShare's superfluity argument fails.</p>\n<p>The short of it is that the Agreement as a whole admits of only one reasonable interpretation: the parties are obliged to submit their disputes to arbitration. <i>See </i><i>Fashion House,</i> 892 F.2d at 1084 (\"Black letter law teaches that `a construction which comports with the Agreement as a whole is to be preferred even if it be thought that certain language, viewed only by itself, more readily suggests something else.'\" (quoting <i>Spartans Indus., Inc. v. John Pilling Shoe Co.,</i> 385 F.2d 495, 499 (1st Cir.1967))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we reverse the decision appealed from and remand the case to the district court for the entry of an order staying the litigation pending the resolution of the parallel arbitration proceeding, dissolving the existing stay of arbitration, and making such other provisions consistent with this opinion, as the district court may deem meet.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed and remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Hon.

After a falling-out, one of the contracting parties, PowerShare, Inc., commenced a civil action in the district court to enforce the Agreement. The defendant, Syntel, Inc., countered by instituting a parallel arbitration proceeding and moving to stay litigation pending arbitration. The district court denied the motion, and Syntel now appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act to review the interlocutory order denying Syntel's motion to stay litigation pending arbitration. <i>See</i> 9 U.S.C. § 16(a)(1)(A); <i>Combined Energies v. CCI, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203137\"><a href=\"/opinion/203137/combined-energies-v-cci-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, 170 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The question that lies at the heart of the appeal is whether the Agreement contains a mandatory arbitration provision. The district court thought not. We hold that the Agreement does so provide and therefore reverse. Along the way, we address, as a matter of first impression at the federal appellate level, an issue concerning the standard of review to be applied by a district judge when reviewing a magistrate judge's disposition of a motion to stay litigation pending the completion of a parallel arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>PowerShare and Syntel entered into the Agreement on July 16, 2003. Their evident purpose was to form a joint venture to handle the outsourcing needs of third parties. Paragraph 18 of the Agreement reads in relevant part:<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<blockquote>All disputes, controversies and claims directly or indirectly arising out of or in relation to this Agreement or the validity, interpretation, performance, breach, enforceability of the Agreement (collectively referred to as \"Dispute\") shall be resolved amicably between Syntel and PowerShare at an operational level in consultation with the top management of both companies. If any such Dispute cannot be resolved, as stated above, the same shall be settled in accordance with the principles and procedures of the American Arbitration Association and per the decision of an accredited arbitrator acceptable to both parties. Nothing in this clause shall prejudice Syntel or PowerShare's right to seek injunctive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> relief or any other equitable/legal relief or remedies available under law.</blockquote>\n<p>Some five years after the execution of the Agreement, a dispute arose. On August 8, 2008, PowerShare invoked diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), and filed suit against Syntel, claiming breach of the Agreement, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. PowerShare accompanied its complaint with a request for jury trial. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 38(b).</p>\n<p>In response, Syntel lodged a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). It simultaneously moved in the district court to stay PowerShare's action pending resolution of the parallel arbitration proceeding. Not to be outdone, PowerShare filed a motion to stay the arbitration.</p>\n<p>The district court assigned the motions to a magistrate judge, who denied Syntel's motion to stay the litigation and granted PowerShare's cross-motion to stay the arbitration. <i>PowerShare, Inc. v. Syntel, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2409344\"><a href=\"/opinion/2409344/powershare-inc-v-syntel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 244 (D.Mass. 2008). In her rescript, the magistrate judge concluded that, under the Agreement, arbitration was optional. <i>Id.</i> at 241. She reasoned that the third sentence of Paragraph 18, which refers to \"any other equitable/legal relief or remedies available under law,\" made manifest the parties' intention to allow litigation because a jury trial is a remedy \"available under law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 243. In so holding, the magistrate judge rejected Syntel's argument that the federal policy favoring arbitration should be given weight. Rather, she declared that this policy applies only to the resolution of \"scope\" questions, not to questions about whether a contract calls for mandatory arbitration at all. <i>Id.</i> at 244.</p>\n<p>Syntel appealed this decision to the district judge, Fed R. Civ. P. 72(a), who issued an electronic order stating that the decision was \"not clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\" This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We divide our analysis into two parts. First, we clarify the standard of review to be employed by a district judge when reviewing a magistrate judge's order on a motion to stay litigation pending the resolution of a parallel arbitration proceeding. Only then do we proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A.</i></h2>\n<p>The Federal Magistrates Act confers authority upon district judges to designate magistrate judges to hear pretrial motions. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). Magistrate judges serve as aides to, and under the supervision of, district judges; but magistrate judges are not themselves Article III judicial officers. Given their status as Article I judicial officers, magistrate judges ordinarily may not decide motions that are dispositive either of a case or of a claim or defense within a case.<sup>[2]</sup> This is so because \"[t]he Constitution requires that Article III judges exercise final decisionmaking authority.\" <i>Ocelot Oil Corp. v. Sparrow Indus.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506649\"><a href=\"/opinion/506649/ocelot-oil-corporation-v-sparrow-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1458</span></a></span>, 1463 (10th Cir.1988); <i>see </i><i>Stauble v. Warrob, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593171\"><a href=\"/opinion/593171/alfred-stauble-individually-and-fub-warrob-inc-v-warrob-inc-alfred/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, 693-94 (1st Cir. 1992). Dispositive motions include those enumerated in 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A), but this list is not exhaustive; rather, it simply \"informs the classification of other motions as dispositive or nondispositive.\" <i>Phinney v. Wentworth Douglas Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198735\"><a href=\"/opinion/198735/phinney-v-paulshock/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5-6 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>Consistent with this dichotomy between dispositive and non-dispositive motions, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72 sets out two separate standards of review to be employed by a district judge in reviewing a magistrate judge's determinations. When a magistrate judge decides a non-dispositive motion, the district judge may, given a timely appeal, set aside the order if it \"is clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a). Absent a timely appeal, the order stands. <i>Id.</i> When, however, a magistrate judge passes upon a dispositive motion, he or she may only issue a recommended decision, and if there is a timely objection, the district judge must engage in de novo review. Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b). Absent a timely objection, the recommended decision ripens into an order. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Here, the district judge employed the \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law\" standard applicable to non-dispositive motions under Rule 72(a). Syntel protests that its motion to stay the litigation to allow resolution of the parallel arbitration proceeding was, in effect, dispositive of the court case and, thus, should have engendered de novo review by the district judge pursuant to Rule 72(b).</p>\n<p>No court of appeals has decided this precise question. Nevertheless, a number of district courts have held that motions to stay litigation and compel related arbitration are non-dispositive motions under Rule 72(a). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gonzalez v. GE Group Adm'rs, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2411131\"><a href=\"/opinion/2411131/gonzalez-v-ge-group-administrators-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 142 n. 1 (W.D.N.Y.1997). <i>But see </i><i>Flannery v. Tri-State Div.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2426259\"><a href=\"/opinion/2426259/flannery-v-tri-state-div/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span>, 821 (E.D.Mich.2005) (concluding that such a motion, if granted, is dispositive because it \"has the practical effect of allowing the case to proceed in a different forum\").</p>\n<p>Motions to stay litigation pending the resolution of parallel arbitration proceedings are not among the motions enumerated in 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A). Nor are they of the same character as the listed motions. A federal court's ruling on a motion to stay litigation pending arbitration is not dispositive of either the case or any claim or defense within it. Although granting or denying a stay may be an important step in the life of a case (lawyers are keenly aware that there are substantive consequences to whether or not a stay is granted), in the last analysis a stay order is merely suspensory. Even if such a motion is granted, the court still retains authority to dissolve the stay or, after the arbitration has run its course, to make orders with respect to the arbitral award. <i>See</i> Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 9 (permitting parties to apply to the court for an order confirming the award); <i>id.</i> § 10 (providing district courts with authority to vacate an arbitral award); <i>id.</i> § 11 (providing district courts with authority to modify an arbitral award). We acknowledge that the scope of judicial review of arbitral awards is very narrow, but that does not extinguish such review. <i>See </i><i>Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547665\"><a href=\"/opinion/547665/advest-inc-v-patrick-mccarthy/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1990). Thus, there is no final exercise of Article III power at the time the court acts on the motion to stay. <i>See </i><i>Herko,</i> 978 F.Supp. at 142 n. 1.</p>\n<p>In light of these realities, we conclude that, from a procedural standpoint, the district judge acted appropriately in reviewing the magistrate judge's denial of Syntel's motion to stay under the \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law\" standard elucidated in Rule 72(a).</p>\n<p>In this case arbitrability depended on interpreting a contractual term, a question of law for the courts. <i>See </i><i>Combined</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> <i>Energies,</i> 514 F.3d at 171. Nothing in the contract expressly provided that an arbitrator would decide questions of arbitrability instead. <i>See </i><i>Coady v. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199031\"><a href=\"/opinion/199031/coady-v-ashcraft-gerel/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8-9 (1st Cir.2000). When, as in this case, review of a nondispositive motion by a district judge turns on a pure question of law, that review is plenary under the \"contrary to law\" branch of the Rule 72(a) standard. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Haines v. Liggett Group Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590904\"><a href=\"/opinion/590904/susan-haines-as-administratrix-ad-prosequendum-and-of-the-estate-of-peter/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 91 (3d Cir.1992); <i>EEOC v.

Miller &amp; Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3069, at 350 (2d ed.1997). This means that, for questions of law, there is no practical difference between review under Rule 72(a)'s \"contrary to law\" standard and review under Rule 72(b)'s de novo standard.</p>\n<p>To complete the picture, we limn the standard of review at this level. Here, too, the purely legal nature of the question controls: we, like the district court, must afford de novo review to the purely legal question of whether the Agreement provides for mandatory arbitration of the parties' dispute. <i>See </i><i>Osband v. Woodford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777722\"><a href=\"/opinion/777722/lance-ian-osband-v-jeanne-woodford-warden-of-the-california-state-prison/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span>, 1041 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B.</i></h2>\n<p>Arbitration is a matter of contract. <i>First Options of Chi., Inc. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span> (1995). In this case, the Agreement contains a choice-of-law provision in favor of the laws of the United States. The parties agree that this provision brings into play the federal common and statutory law.</p>\n<p>In construing a contract governed by federal common law, courts must be guided by common-sense rules of contract interpretation. <i>Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disab. Plan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196424\"><a href=\"/opinion/196424/smart-v-the-gillette-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span>, 178 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Burnham v.

And although more a product of the Federal Arbitration Act than of federal common law, per se, federal law undeniably includes a policy favoring arbitration. <i>See </i><i>Volt Info. Scis., Inc. v. Bd. of Trs. of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112212\"><a href=\"/opinion/112212/volt-info-sciences-inc-v-bd-of-trustees-of-leland-stanford-jr-u/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, 475-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112212\"><a href=\"/opinion/112212/volt-info-sciences-inc-v-bd-of-trustees-of-leland-stanford-jr-u/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span> (1989). At a minimum, this policy requires that \"ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself [must be] resolved in favor of arbitration.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Syntel contends that this policy creates a presumption of arbitrability here. PowerShare demurs, relying principally on our decision in <i>Paul Revere Variable Annuity Insurance Co. v. Kirschhofer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770357\"><a href=\"/opinion/770357/the-paul-revere-variable-annuity-insurance-company-v-maureen-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2000), which it characterizes as limiting the presumption of arbitrability to questions about the <i>scope</i> of an arbitration agreement (as contrasted with questions about the existence of such an agreement). Because the issue in this case is whether a mandatory arbitration agreement exists, PowerShare contends that the presumption does not attach.</p>\n<p>Despite the parties' importunings, we need not decide whether the federal policy favoring arbitration applies here. Even if we assume that the presumption does not affect the decisional calculus, the plain language of the Agreement mandates arbitration. Thus, the applicability vel non of the presumption makes no ultimate difference.</p>\n<p>With this question set to one side, we go directly to the language of the Agreement itself. Paragraph 18, quoted above, sets out the mechanisms for resolving disputes between the parties. The first sentence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> provides that all disputes \"shall be resolved amicably between Syntel and PowerShare.\" The second sentence provides that if a dispute cannot be resolved amicably, it \"shall be settled in accordance with the principles and procedures of the American Arbitration Association and per the decision of an accredited arbitrator.\" The third sentence states that \"[n]othing in this clause shall prejudice Syntel or PowerShare's right to seek injunctive relief or any other equitable/legal relief or remedies available under law.\"</p>\n<p>In deciding whether this language mandates arbitration, we are mindful that \"an interpretation which gives effect to all the terms of a contract is preferable to one that harps on isolated provisions, heedless of context.\" <i>Blackie v. Maine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712176\"><a href=\"/opinion/712176/dana-blackie-v-state-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span>, 722 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see </i><i>Fashion House, Inc. v.

In line with this wise counsel, we strive for a reasonable interpretation of the Agreement as a whole, while avoiding constructions that would render any term within it meaningless. <i>Summit Packaging Sys., Inc. v.

In order to square this interpretation with the second sentence of Paragraph 18, PowerShare suggests that the parties intended arbitration to be an optional mechanism for dispute resolution.</p>\n<p>Although PowerShare's interpretation of the third sentence may be plausible when read in isolation, that interpretation cannot be reconciled with the unvarnished language of Paragraph 18's second sentence. That sentence states explicitly that disputes between the parties \"shall\" be settled through arbitration. The word \"shall\" denotes obligation, not choice; therefore, accepting PowerShare's interpretation of the third sentence would drain the second sentence of its essential meaning. Put bluntly, the word \"shall\" in the second sentence would be rendered nugatory were we to read the arbitration provision as creating nothing more than an option. That PowerShare's interpretation of Paragraph 18 would negate the obvious meaning of the second sentence is a powerful argument against accepting that interpretation. <i>See </i><i>Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117907\"><a href=\"/opinion/117907/mastrobuono-v-shearson-lehman-hutton-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117907\"><a href=\"/opinion/117907/mastrobuono-v-shearson-lehman-hutton-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span> (1995) (rejecting reading of two clauses in an arbitration agreement as \"untenable\" when that reading \"sets up the two clauses in conflict with one another\"); <i>Blackie,</i> 75 F.3d at 722 (rejecting reading of one section of a contract when that reading would \"flatly contradict[]\" other sections); <i>see also </i><i>Smart,</i> 70 F.3d at 179 (\"Accepted canons of construction forbid the balkanization of contracts for interpretative purposes.\").</p>\n<p>We conclude that the only sensible reading of Paragraph 18 is that the second sentence mandates arbitration and the third sentence furnishes the arbitrator with broad legal and equitable powers should either party seek special kinds of relief (say, an injunction). This is the only plausible interpretation of the third sentence that fits with, and gives effect to, the plain meaning of the second sentence.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> In an endeavor to deflect the force of this reasoning, PowerShare argues that a jury trial is a \"remedy\" preserved in the third sentence. It says that because only a court can implement such a remedy, the interpretation that we propose must be incorrect.</p>\n<p>This argument is unconvincing. Unlike the second sentence, which plainly mandates arbitration, the reference in the third sentence to \"any other equitable/legal relief or remedies available under law\" never mentions jury trials (or, for that matter, recourse to the courts). Moreover, there is no textual support for a belief that this reference necessarily includes jury trials.</p>\n<p>PowerShare tries to counter-punch by citing a pair of decisions holding that \"remedies\" include \"jury trials.\" But some words mean different things in different contexts, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Romain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201394\"><a href=\"/opinion/201394/united-states-v-romain/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining that \"words are like chameleons; they frequently have different shades of meaning depending upon the circumstances\"); and when context is taken into account, the decisions on which PowerShare relies are off-point. Each of them interprets a savings clause in a maritime statute. <i>See </i><i>Lewis v. Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118409\"><a href=\"/opinion/118409/lewis-v-lewis-clark-marine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span>, 454-55, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118409\"><a href=\"/opinion/118409/lewis-v-lewis-clark-marine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span> (2001) (holding that \"[t]rial by jury is an obvious ... example of the remedies available\" under the savings to suitors clause of 28 U.S.C. § 1333(1)); <i>Curcuru v. Rose's Oil Serv., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></span>, 1037 (2004) (holding that savings clause of the Death on the High Seas Act preserves jury trial right in state court). These decisions, immersed in the historical context of admiralty law, offer little guidance for the issue of contract interpretation with which we must grapple. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Laughton v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sol'ns, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1634013\"><a href=\"/opinion/1634013/laughton-v-cgi-technologies-and-solutions-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">602</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 265 (D.Mass.2009) (rejecting argument that reference to \"remedies\" in an agreement containing a mandatory arbitration clause preserves a party's right to litigate and, thus, renders the arbitration provision elective); <i>Beaver Constr. Co. v. Lakehouse, L.L.C.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">742</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></span>, 164 (Ala. 1999) (similar).</p>\n<p>In the end, we come full circle. Reading the \"remedies\" language in the third sentence to allow access to a jury trial would place this provision at cross purposes with the mandatory arbitration provision spelled out in the second sentence. That would violate one of the cardinal rules of contract interpretation: \"that a document should be read to give effect to all its provisions and to render them consistent with each other.\" <i>Mastrobuono,</i> 514 U.S. at 63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117907\"><a href=\"/opinion/117907/mastrobuono-v-shearson-lehman-hutton-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1212</span></a></span>. Confronted with two competing interpretations of the \"remedies\" language, we must give preference to the one that makes sense of the Agreement as a whole. <i>See </i><i>Blackie,</i> 75 F.3d at 722.</p>\n<p>PowerShare tries to turn this principle to its advantage. It asserts that our reading of the third sentence  to afford the arbitrator broad power to dispense legal and equitable remedies  renders that sentence superfluous because, under the AAA's rules, an arbitrator already has those powers. As support for this assertion, PowerShare identifies Rule 34(a) of the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules, which allows an arbitrator to \"take whatever interim measures he or she deems necessary.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> Here, however, the parties went beyond Rule 34(a); they agreed to vest in the arbitrator broad powers extending to the arbitrator's final decisionmaking, not just powers in connection with interim relief. The \"remedies\" provision, read in this way, is not superfluous but, rather, makes perfect sense. In commercial arbitration cases, the scope of a final award is governed by Rule 43(a), which provides that the arbitrator \"may grant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable <i>and within the scope of the agreement of the parties</i>\" (emphasis supplied). Because an arbitrator's power to award relief can be shaped by the parties' agreement, it is reasonable  and certainly not redundant  for the parties to clarify that the person arbitrating their disputes will be free to choose from the widest possible array of remedies. Consequently, PowerShare's superfluity argument fails.</p>\n<p>The short of it is that the Agreement as a whole admits of only one reasonable interpretation: the parties are obliged to submit their disputes to arbitration. <i>See </i><i>Fashion House,</i> 892 F.2d at 1084 (\"Black letter law teaches that `a construction which comports with the Agreement as a whole is to be preferred even if it be thought that certain language, viewed only by itself, more readily suggests something else.'\" (quoting <i>Spartans Indus., Inc. v. John Pilling Shoe Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"277804\"><a href=\"/opinion/277804/spartans-industries-inc-v-john-pilling-shoe-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span>, 499 (1st Cir.1967))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we reverse the decision appealed from and remand the case to the district court for the entry of an order staying the litigation pending the resolution of the parallel arbitration proceeding, dissolving the existing stay of arbitration, and making such other provisions consistent with this opinion, as the district court may deem meet.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed and remanded.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The parties agree that other material at the beginning and end of Paragraph 18 is, for present purposes, uncontroversial. We thus quote the three relevant sentences of the paragraph and henceforth refer to them as the \"first,\" \"second,\" and \"third\" sentences. This practice emulates what the parties have done.</p>\n<p>[2]  We say \"ordinarily\" because there is an exception for cases in which all parties consent. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 636(c); Fed.R.Civ.P. 73. The record reveals no such consent here.</p>\n<p>[3]  Other courts have reached similar conclusions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Laughton v.
