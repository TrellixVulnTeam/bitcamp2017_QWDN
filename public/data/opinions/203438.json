McElroy, Assistant Federal Defender, on brief\nfor appellant.\n          Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney,\nand Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          August 13, 2008\n\f          STAHL, Circuit Judge.    Dawn Walker, who pled guilty to\n\none count of bank robbery, challenges her sentence of 77 months'\n\nincarceration.   She argues on appeal that the district court erred\n\nby considering her need for mental health and substance abuse\n\ntreatment when determining the length of her prison sentence, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(a).1     We do not reach the merits of\n\nWalker's appeal because, at sentencing, she intentionally abandoned\n\nthe objection she now raises.     As a result of this waiver, \"the\n\nobjection in question is unreviewable.\"    United States v. Jimenez,\n\n512 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          After pleading guilty to one count of bank robbery, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a), Walker was sentenced to 77\n\nmonths' incarceration, which was at the low end of the advisory\n\nguideline sentencing range of 77 to 96 months.       Walker did not\n\nobject to the presentence report, but filed a motion and sentencing\n\nmemorandum in support of a downward departure.     At the sentencing\n\nproceeding, held on August 10, 2007, Walker's counsel elaborated on\n\nher request for a below-guidelines sentence, explaining that a term\n\nof no more than 48 months would \"allow the amount of time necessary\n\nfor [Walker] to engage in drug treatment that's required, for her\n\n\n     1\n      18 U.S.C. § 3582(a) states: \"The court, in determining\nwhether to impose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of\nimprisonment is to be imposed, in determining the length of the\nterm, shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to\nthe extent that they are applicable, recognizing that imprisonment\nis not an appropriate means of promoting correction and\nrehabilitation.\"\n\n                                 -2-\n\fto seek an education and for her to put her life on a track where\n\nshe can become a productive member of society.\"       In other words,\n\nWalker's rationale for a below-guidelines sentence was that 48\n\nmonths was a sufficient length of time for her to reap the benefits\n\nof the rehabilitative services offered within the federal prison\n\nsystem.\n\n             In imposing the 77-month sentence, the district court\n\nadopted the sentencing rationale put forth by Walker -- that her\n\nsentence should be related to the amount of time necessary for her\n\nto benefit from the prison system's rehabilitation services -- but\n\ndisagreed as to the length of time necessary to accomplish this\n\ngoal.2\n\n\n\n     2\n         The court said, in part:\n\n             I've come to the conclusion that in this case it would be\n             a disservice to grant you the request that your lawyer\n             has made for a sentence below that guideline range\n             because it's not enough time to give you the services\n             that you need.\n\n             . . .\n\n             And so I have come to the conclusion, Ms. Walker, that in\n             order to turn you around, in order to give you the\n             foundation in basic day-to-day living skills that you so\n             desperately need, that a sentence at the low end of the\n             guideline range is appropriate and just in this case.\n\n             It will give you the time that you need to clean up. It\n             will give you the time that you need to get some\n             education. It will give you the time that you need for\n             mental health treatment. If you can't get all of those\n             things under control, my concern is that I don't want to\n             set you up to fail by giving you too little time.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f          On appeal, Walker argues that the court's sentencing\n\nrationale violated 18 U.S.C. § 3582(a), which requires sentencing\n\ncourts to \"recogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropriate\n\nmeans of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\"3         However, at\n\nsentencing, both Walker and the district court adopted the view\n\nthat the length of Walker's sentence should be informed by the\n\namount   of   time   necessary   for   her   to   receive    sufficient\n\nrehabilitative services.    They merely differed on the length of\n\ntime required to accomplish that goal.        Therefore, because she\n\nasserted below the same rationale that she now claims was error,\n\nWalker has waived the argument that the rehabilitation rationale\n\nadopted by the court violated § 3582(a).4\n\n          This is not merely a case of forfeiture, where a party\n\n\"fails to make a timely assertion of a right,\" United States v.\n\n\n\n     3\n      This circuit has not determined how 18 U.S.C. § 3582(a)\ninteracts with the mandate contained in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(D),\nrequiring sentencing courts to consider, among other factors, the\n\"need for the sentence imposed\" to \"provide the defendant with\nneeded educational or vocational training, medical care, or other\ncorrectional treatment in the most effective manner.\"        Other\ncircuits have reached disparate conclusions on this question.\nCompare United States v. Manzella, 475 F.3d 152, 157-58 (3d Cir.\n2007) with United States v. Hawk Wing, 433 F.3d 622, 629-30 (8th\nCir. 2006).\n     4\n      To the extent that Walker also suggests, for the first time\non appeal, that the imposed term of incarceration was not supported\nby the evidence, we disagree. On the contrary, the sentence was\nadequately supported by Walker's own description of her needs, a\nsealed psychiatric report, and other information in the unobjected-\nto presentence report about her past conduct and failed treatment\nefforts.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fRodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002), which we would review\n\nunder plain error, id., but is actually a waiver, which occurs when\n\na party \"intentionally relinquishes or abandons\" a known right, id.\n\n\"The difference is critical: a waived issue ordinarily cannot be\n\nresurrected on appeal.\"    Id.   Walker waived her right to object to\n\nthe district court's rehabilitation rationale by affirmatively\n\nemploying the same rationale to support her request for a below-\n\nguidelines sentence.     Where an appellant has waived an objection\n\nbelow, we will not review her argument, even for plain error.   See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Ross, 77 F.3d 1525, 1542 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n          For the foregoing reason, we affirm the sentence imposed\n\nby the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f",
