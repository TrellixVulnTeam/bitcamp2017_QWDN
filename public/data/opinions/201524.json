BACKGROUND\n\n          Plaintiffs-Appellants Jason C. Mason and Natasha A. Mason\n\nare minor children who resided with their mother, Lisa Mason, at\n\n18-A West Bow Street, Franklin, New Hampshire from May 21, 1997\n\nuntil July 2, 1998.      During that time, the property was first owned\n\nby   Appellee    James   P.   Morrisette   and   then   was   subsequently\n\ntransferred to Appellee Joseph M. Griffiths.2           On September 29,\n\n1997, Natasha was examined and found to have high levels of lead in\n\nher blood.      As a result, on October 15, 1997, the New Hampshire\n\n\n\n     1\n      All references throughout the opinion to the United States\nCode are to 42 U.S.C.\n     2\n      Prior to moving to the Bow Street apartment, the Masons\nresided at 94-95 Franklin Street in Franklin, New Hampshire, from\nDecember 1, 1996 to May 21, 1997, in an apartment owned at all\nrelevant times by Appellee Morrisette.         In the Appellants'\ncomplaint to the district court, they stated that both Jason and\nNatasha were tested for lead poisoning and were determined to have\nhigh blood lead levels during the time they resided on Franklin\nStreet.   The Appellants stated that their mother complained to\nAppellee Morrisette regarding a possible lead paint hazard in the\nFranklin Street apartment, and that Appellee Morrisette suggested\nthat the Masons move to the West Bow Street apartment. These facts\nare not relied on nor discussed by the Appellants in their brief to\nthis court.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fDivision of Health Services inspected the West Bow Street apartment\n\nfor lead paint and found significant lead contamination.   Appellee\n\nGriffiths was ordered by the state to abate the lead hazards\n\ndiscovered during the inspection but did not comply.     Both Jason\n\nand Natasha were subsequently tested and their blood contained\n\ndangerous amounts of lead.     On July 2, 1998, the state of New\n\nHampshire provided the Masons with emergency housing so that they\n\ncould vacate their lead-ridden apartment.\n\n          Natasha and Jason, through their guardian and attorney\n\nRichard Heiser, brought suit in the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of New Hampshire alleging that the Appellees\n\nviolated the RLPHRA.3   In their complaint, they also raised several\n\nstate law claims including that the defendants violated the New\n\nHampshire Consumer Protection Act, were negligent in failing to\n\nmaintain both the Franklin Street and West Bow Street buildings,\n\nand misrepresented that the West Bow Street building was lead-free.\n\n          Defendants Morrisette and Griffiths moved to dismiss the\n\nRLPHRA claims, arguing that the leasehold in question was pursuant\n\nto an oral lease, and that the protections and remedies of the\n\nRLPHRA apply only to written leases.     The district court, before\n\nruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss, requested sua sponte\n\n\n\n     3\n      It is not clear from the record, and the Appellants declined\nto provide an explanation at argument, why Lisa Mason, as the\nmother of Jason and Natasha, did not bring the suit against the\nAppellees.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthat the parties address the issue of whether the minor children of\n\na lessee have standing to sue the lessor under the RLPHRA.   After\n\nreviewing the parties' submissions, the district court granted the\n\ndefendants' motion to dismiss, holding that the minor children were\n\nnot \"lessees\" for purposes of the RLPHRA and therefore had no\n\nstatutory standing to seek remedies under that statute.4\n\n          The Appellants filed this timely appeal, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court committed reversible error when it ruled that the\n\nminor children did not have standing because the plain language of\n\nthe RLPHRA, along with the legislative history and the regulations\n\nimplementing the RLPHRA, make it clear that the statute was enacted\n\nto protect children residing in residential property from lead\n\npoisoning, and thus Congress intended for the minor children of\n\nlessees to have standing under the civil liability provision.   The\n\nAppellants contend that the district court's interpretation of the\n\nstatute produces an absurd result because it provides that only the\n\nadult lessee may seek damages for violations of the disclosure\n\nprovision of the RLPHRA when it is actually the children of the\n\nadult lessees, not the adults themselves, who are the ones likely\n\nto suffer injury from such violations.     Finding that the plain\n\n\n\n     4\n      The district court then declined to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction over the Appellants' remaining state law claims.\n       We note that because the district court granted the\nAppellees' motion to dismiss based on the Appellants' lack of\nstanding, the issue of whether the disclosure provision of the\nRLPHRA applies to oral leases is not before this court.\n\n                               -4-\n\flanguage of the statute limits the private cause of action to a\n\n\"purchaser or lessee,\" and because the Mason children cannot be\n\nconsidered either, we affirm.\n\n                             II.   ANALYSIS\n\n           We review a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) de novo, and we ask whether the well-\n\npleaded facts, taken as true, justify recovery on any supportable\n\nlegal theory.     See Cruz v. Melecio, 204 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   Thus, for purposes of our review of the district court's\n\nmotion to dismiss, we assume that the defendants were obligated to\n\ndisclose under the RLPHRA, that they did not disclose in violation\n\nof the RLPHRA, and that Natasha and Jason's lead poisoning was\n\ncaused by the defendants' violation of the statute.          With these\n\nassumptions, we turn to our review of the statute.\n\nA.         The Statutory Scheme\n\n           The RLPHRA was enacted in 1992 in an effort, among other\n\nthings, \"to develop a national strategy to build the infrastructure\n\nnecessary to eliminate lead-based paint hazards in all housing as\n\nexpeditiously as possible\" and to \"educate the public concerning\n\nthe hazards and sources of lead-based paint poisoning and steps to\n\nreduce and eliminate such hazards.\"      § 4851a(1), (7).    The Act was\n\nthe   response   to   congressional   findings   that   \"low-level   lead\n\npoisoning is widespread among American children, afflicting as many\n\nas 3,000,000 children under age 6,\" § 4851(1); that \"the health and\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdevelopment of children living in as many as 3,800,000 American\n\nhomes is endangered by chipping or peeling lead paint, or excessive\n\namounts of lead-contaminated dust in their homes,\" § 4851(5); and\n\nthat \"the danger posed by lead-based paint hazards can be reduced\n\nby abating lead-based paint or by taking interim measures to\n\nprevent paint deterioration and limit children's exposure to lead\n\ndust and chips,\" § 4851(6).\n\n           As part of a comprehensive plan to reduce the hazards of\n\nlead-based paint in the national residential housing stock, the\n\nRLPHRA provided the statutory framework to require the disclosure\n\nof   information   concerning   lead    hazards   upon   the   transfer   of\n\nresidential property.    § 4852d.      It is this \"disclosure provision\"\n\nthat is the subject of the case before us today.\n\n           The   disclosure   provision    of   the   RLPHRA   directs    the\n\nSecretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development\n\n(\"HUD\") and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection\n\nAgency (\"EPA\") to \"promulgate regulations . . . for the disclosure\n\nof lead-based paint hazards in target housing which is offered for\n\nsale or lease.\"    § 4852d(a)(1).5      The statute goes on to state:\n\n      The regulations shall require that, before the purchaser\n      or lessee is obligated under any contract to purchase or\n      lease the housing, the seller or lessor shall—\n      (A) provide the purchaser or lessee with a lead hazard\n      information pamphlet . . . ;\n\n\n      5\n      \"Target housing\" is defined in the RLPHRA as \"any housing\nconstructed prior to 1978,\" with a few limited exclusions.\n§ 4851b(27).\n\n                                    -6-\n\f      (B) disclose to the purchaser or lessee the presence of\n      any known lead-based paint, or any known lead-based paint\n      hazards, in such housing . . . ; and\n      (C) permit the purchaser a 10-day period . . . to conduct\n      a risk assessment or inspection for the presence of lead-\n      based paint hazards.6\n\n      § 4852d(a)(1).\n\n           The statute also provides for an array of penalties for\n\nviolations of the disclosure provision including a civil liability\n\nremedy which states:         \"Any person who knowingly violates the\n\nprovisions of this section shall be jointly and severally liable to\n\nthe purchaser or lessee in an amount equal to 3 times the amount of\n\ndamages incurred by such individual.\"          § 4852d(b)(3).    The HUD and\n\nthe EPA have jointly promulgated regulations implementing Section\n\n4852d, and have defined lessee to mean \"any entity that enters into\n\nan agreement to lease, rent, or sublease target housing, including\n\nbut not limited to individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusts,\n\ngovernment agencies, housing agencies, Indian tribes, and nonprofit\n\norganizations.\"     40 C.F.R. § 745.103; 24 C.F.R. § 35.86.          The issue\n\nwe must decide is whether Congress intended for the minor children\n\nof   lessees   to   have   standing   to    enforce   this   civil   liability\n\nprovision against landlords who violate the disclosure provision.\n\nB.         Our Review of the Statute\n\n           In our review of § 4852d(b)(3), we must first ask whether\n\nit is clear that Congress intended either to limit the term\n\n\n      6\n      The ten-day inspection period is only for purchasers of\ntarget housing and does not apply to lessees of target housing.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f\"lessee\" to a party who legally enters into a lease with a lessor\n\nor to permit the minor children who reside with the lessee to\n\nenforce the disclosure provision.       See Bryson v. Shumway, 308 F.3d\n\n79, 84 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"If the meaning of a statute is clear, we\n\nenforce that meaning.\").   Here, the plain language of the statute\n\nlimits recovery under § 4852d(b)(3) to a \"purchaser or lessee.\" We\n\nfind this limitation not only clear, but also consistent with the\n\npurpose of the disclosure provision--to provide the purchaser or\n\nlessee of target property with notice that there could be a lead-\n\nbased paint   hazard   present   in   the   subject   premises,   and   the\n\nopportunity to either decline to enter into a contract regarding\n\nthe premises or proceed forward with the transaction in the face of\n\nthe knowledge that a lead-based paint hazard could be present. See\n\n§ 4852d(a)(1).   This disclosure provision does not require the\n\nseller or lessor to abate the lead-paint hazard, nor disqualify a\n\npurchaser or lessee with young children from occupying a property\n\nthat possibly contains lead-based paint hazards.         Thus, because a\n\nviolation of the statute occurs when the seller or lessor fails to\n\ndisclose, it is logical that the party harmed by the failure to\n\ndisclose is the purchaser or the lessee. See Gladysz v. Desmarais,\n\nNo. Civ. 02-208-B, 2003 WL 1343033, at *2 (D.N.H. March 17, 2003)\n\n(unpublished) (\"The civil liability provision in RLPHRA is within\n\nthe 'disclosure' section and as such, it is both logical and\n\nreasonable to read the civil liability to cover only purchasers or\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\flessees who were deprived of the required notice of lead hazards\n\n'upon the transfer of residential property.'\").          Although it\n\nappears that we are the first circuit court of appeals to address\n\nthis issue, district courts have similarly found that the plain\n\nmeaning of § 4852d(b)(3) limits recovery to a \"purchaser or lessee\"\n\nto the exclusion of minor children of a lessee.         See id. at *3\n\n(holding that grandchildren of lessee residing in home with lead-\n\nbased paint hazards did not have standing to sue landlord because\n\n§ 4852d(b)(3) clearly limits recovery to a 'purchaser or lessee');\n\nL.B. III v. Hous. Auth. of Louisville, 345 F. Supp. 2d 725, 729\n\n(W.D. Ky. 2004) (minor children of lessees \"fail to fit the\n\nstatutory   [standing]   requirement   because   they   were   neither\n\npurchasers nor lessees of the property in which they lived\").7\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      The Appellants cite Sipes v. Russell, 89 F. Supp. 2d 1199\n(D. Ks. 2000) as evidence that at least one district court has held\nthat the minor children of a lessee have standing to pursue a claim\nunder § 4852(b)(3). In that case, the United States District Court\nfor the District of Kansas held that although it did have subject\nmatter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' RLPHRA claims, the\nregulations implementing the disclosure provision of the RLPHRA did\nnot take effect until after the plaintiffs entered into their lease\nwith the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiffs could not recover\nunder § 4852(b)(3). At no point did the court state that the minor\nchildren had standing to pursue a claim under § 4852(b)(3), and\ncontrary to Appellants' argument, a finding of subject matter\njurisdiction does not imply that a party has standing to bring a\nclaim. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83,\n89 (1998); Cooperman v. Individual, Inc., 171 F.3d 43, 47 n.3 (1st\nCir. 1999).\n\n                                -9-\n\fC.         The HUD/EPA Regulation and Legislative History\n\n           Having determined that Congress' intent to limit recovery\n\nunder § 4852d(b)(3) to a \"purchaser or lessee\" is clear from a\n\nplain reading of the statute, it is not necessary for us to consult\n\neither the HUD/EPA regulation defining lessee or the legislative\n\nhistory of the RLPHRA.         See Bryson, 308 F.3d at 85 (If a \"statute\n\nis   unambiguous,     we       use   neither   legislative   history,     nor\n\nadministrative      agency      interpretation.\")     (internal   citations\n\nomitted). We briefly discuss both, however, because we do not find\n\nthat our interpretation of the statute is in conflict with either.\n\n           First, our interpretation is consistent with the HUD/EPA\n\ndefinition of lessee, which essentially confirms that any entity\n\nthat is capable of entering into a legally binding contract for the\n\npurchase or lease of real property is permitted to seek redress for\n\na violation of the disclosure provision of the RLPHRA; that is, the\n\nregulation clarifies that the term \"lessee\" is not limited to\n\nindividuals and that it includes sublessees.               See 40 C.F.R. §\n\n745.103;   24   C.F.R.     §   35.86   &   Comment   IV(C)(9).    Thus,   the\n\nregulation, which is a reasonable clarification of the statute,\n\ndoes not, as the Appellants contend, impermissibly narrow the class\n\nof   \"lessees\" who have standing under Section 4852(b)(3), and the\n\nAppellants do not have standing under either the regulation or the\n\nstatute.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f          Similarly, our interpretation of Section 4852d does not\n\nconflict with the legislative history of the RLPHRA.       To be sure,\n\nas Appellants point out, it is clear from both the legislative\n\nhistory and the text of the statute itself that the RLPHRA was\n\nenacted to protect children from the hazards of lead-based paint in\n\nresidential housing.   But, the disclosure provision is merely one\n\nmethod in an attempt to effectuate this goal, and does not conflict\n\nwith the overarching purposes of the RLPHRA to protect children\n\nfrom lead poisoning.\n\n          Lastly, we note that the federal scheme to reduce the\n\nhazards of lead-based paint in residential housing is intended to\n\nbe implemented in conjunction with state and local laws that\n\nrequire abatement of lead-based paint.        Thus, the Mason children\n\nare not left without a remedy:   they can pursue claims against the\n\nAppellees in the New Hampshire state courts.\n\n                         III.    CONCLUSION\n\n          For the above-mentioned reasons, the district court's\n\ngrant of the Appellees' motion to dismiss is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f",

The issue we must decide is whether Congress intended for the minor children of lessees to have standing to enforce this civil liability provision against landlords who violate the disclosure provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Our Review of the Statute</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our review of &#167; 4852d(b)(3), we must first ask whether it is clear that Congress intended either to limit the term \"lessee\" to a party who legally enters into a lease with a lessor or to permit the minor children who reside with the lessee to enforce the disclosure provision. <i>See Bryson v. Shumway,</i> 308 F.3d 79, 84 (1st Cir.2002) (\"If the meaning of a statute is clear, we enforce that meaning.\"). Here, the plain language of the statute limits recovery under &#167; 4852d(b)(3) to a \"purchaser or lessee.\" We find this limitation not only clear, but also consistent with the purpose of the disclosure provision &#8212; to provide the purchaser or lessee of target property with notice that there could be a lead-based paint hazard present in the subject premises, and the opportunity to either decline to enter into a contract regarding the premises or proceed forward with the transaction in the face of the knowledge that a lead-based paint hazard could be present. <i>See</i> &#167; 4852d(a)(1). This disclosure provision does not require the seller or lessor to abate the lead-paint hazard, nor disqualify a purchaser or lessee with young children from occupying a property that possibly contains lead-based paint hazards. Thus, because a violation of the statute occurs when the seller or lessor fails to disclose, it is logical that the party harmed by the failure to disclose is the purchaser or the lessee. <i>See Gladysz v. Desmarais,</i> No. Civ. 02-208-B, 2003 WL 1343033, at *2 (D.N.H. March 17, 2003) (unpublished) (\"The civil liability provision in RLPHRA is within the `disclosure' section and as such, it is both logical and reasonable to read the civil liability to cover only purchasers or lessees who were deprived of the required notice of lead hazards `upon the transfer of residential property.'\"). Although it appears that we are the first circuit court of appeals to address this issue, district courts have similarly found that the plain meaning of &#167; 4852d(b)(3) limits recovery to a \"purchaser or lessee\" to the exclusion of minor children of a lessee. <i>See id.</i> at *3 (holding that grandchildren of lessee residing in home with lead-based paint hazards did not have standing to sue landlord because &#167; 4852d(b)(3) clearly limits recovery to a `purchaser or lessee'); <i>L.B. III v. Hous. Auth. of Louisville,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d 725, 729 (W.D.Ky.2004) (minor children of lessees \"fail to fit the statutory [standing] requirement because they were neither purchasers nor lessees of the property in which they lived\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The HUD/EPA Regulation and Legislative History</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that Congress' intent to limit recovery under &#167; 4852d(b)(3) to a \"purchaser or lessee\" is clear from a plain reading of the statute, it is not necessary for us to consult either the HUD/EPA regulation defining lessee or the legislative history of the RLPHRA. <i>See Bryson,</i> 308 F.3d at 85 (If a \"statute is unambiguous, we use neither legislative history, nor administrative agency interpretation.\") (internal citations omitted). We briefly discuss both, however, because we do not find that our interpretation of the statute is in conflict with either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, our interpretation is consistent with the HUD/EPA definition of lessee, which essentially confirms that any entity that is capable of entering into a legally binding contract for the purchase or lease of real property is permitted to seek redress for a violation of the disclosure provision of the RLPHRA; that is, the regulation clarifies that the term \"lessee\" is not limited to individuals and that it includes sublessees. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 745.103; 24 C.F.R. &#167; 35.86 &amp; Comment IV(C)(9). Thus, the regulation, which is a reasonable clarification of the statute, does not, as the Appellants contend, impermissibly narrow the class of \"lessees\" who have standing under Section 4852(b)(3), and the Appellants do not have standing under either the regulation or the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, our interpretation of Section 4852d does not conflict with the legislative history of the RLPHRA. To be sure, as Appellants point out, it is clear from both the legislative history and the text of the statute itself that the RLPHRA was enacted to protect children from the hazards of lead-based paint in residential housing. But, the disclosure provision is merely one method in an attempt to effectuate this goal, and does not conflict with the overarching purposes of the RLPHRA to protect children from lead poisoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, we note that the federal scheme to reduce the hazards of lead-based paint in residential housing is intended to be implemented in conjunction with state and local laws that require abatement of lead-based paint. Thus, the Mason children are not left without a remedy: they can pursue claims against the Appellees in the New Hampshire state courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

In that case, the United States District Court for the District of Kansas held that although it did have subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' RLPHRA claims, the regulations implementing the disclosure provision of the RLPHRA did not take effect until after the plaintiffs entered into their lease with the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiffs could not recover under &#167; 4852(b)(3). At no point did the court state that the minor children had standing to pursue a claim under &#167; 4852(b)(3), and contrary to Appellants' argument, a finding of subject matter jurisdiction does not imply that a party has standing to bring a claim. <i>See Steel Co. v.

Mason are minor children who resided with their mother, Lisa Mason, at 18-A West Bow Street, Franklin, New Hampshire from May 21, 1997 until July 2, 1998. During that time, the property was first owned by Appellee James P. Morrisette and then was subsequently transferred to Appellee Joseph M. Griffiths.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On September 29, 1997, Natasha was examined and found to have high levels of lead in her blood. As a result, on October 15, 1997, the New Hampshire Division of Health Services inspected the West Bow Street apartment for lead paint and found significant lead contamination. Appellee Griffiths was ordered by the state to abate the lead hazards discovered during the inspection but did not comply. Both Jason and Natasha were subsequently tested and their blood contained dangerous amounts of lead. On July 2, 1998, the state of New Hampshire provided the Masons with emergency housing so that they could vacate their lead-ridden apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Natasha and Jason, through their guardian and attorney Richard Heiser, brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire alleging that the Appellees violated the RLPHRA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In their complaint, they also raised several state law claims including that the defendants violated the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act, were negligent in failing to maintain both the Franklin Street and West Bow Street buildings, and misrepresented that the West Bow Street building was lead-free.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants Morrisette and Griffiths moved to dismiss the RLPHRA claims, arguing that the leasehold in question was pursuant to an oral lease, and that the protections and remedies of the RLPHRA apply only to written leases. The district court, before ruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss, requested <i>sua sponte</i> that the parties address the issue of whether the minor children of a lessee have standing to sue the lessor under the RLPHRA. After reviewing the parties' submissions, the district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, holding that the minor children were not \"lessees\" for purposes of the RLPHRA and therefore had no statutory standing to seek remedies under that statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appellants filed this timely appeal, arguing that the district court committed reversible error when it ruled that the minor children did not have standing because the plain language of the RLPHRA, along with the legislative history and the regulations implementing the RLPHRA, make it clear that the statute was enacted to protect children residing in residential property from lead poisoning, and thus Congress intended for the minor children of lessees to have standing under the civil liability provision. The Appellants contend that the district court's interpretation of the statute produces an absurd result because it provides that only the adult lessee may seek damages for violations of the disclosure provision of the RLPHRA when it is actually the children of the adult lessees, not the adults themselves, who are the ones likely to suffer injury from such violations.

Thus, because a violation of the statute occurs when the seller or lessor fails to disclose, it is logical that the party harmed by the failure to disclose is the purchaser or the lessee. <i>See Gladysz v. Desmarais,</i> No. Civ. 02-208-B, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1343033</span></span>, at *2 (D.N.H. March 17, 2003) (unpublished) (\"The civil liability provision in RLPHRA is within the `disclosure' section and as such, it is both logical and reasonable to read the civil liability to cover only purchasers or lessees who were deprived of the required notice of lead hazards `upon the transfer of residential property.'\"). Although it appears that we are the first circuit court of appeals to address this issue, district courts have similarly found that the plain meaning of &#167; 4852d(b)(3) limits recovery to a \"purchaser or lessee\" to the exclusion of minor children of a lessee. <i>See id.</i> at *3 (holding that grandchildren of lessee residing in home with lead-based paint hazards did not have standing to sue landlord because &#167; 4852d(b)(3) clearly limits recovery to a `purchaser or lessee'); <i>L.B.

We briefly discuss both, however, because we do not find that our interpretation of the statute is in conflict with either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, our interpretation is consistent with the HUD/EPA definition of lessee, which essentially confirms that any entity that is capable of entering into a legally binding contract for the purchase or lease of real property is permitted to seek redress for a violation of the disclosure provision of the RLPHRA; that is, the regulation clarifies that the term \"lessee\" is not limited to individuals and that it includes sublessees. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 745.103; 24 C.F.R. &#167; 35.86 &amp; Comment IV(C)(9). Thus, the regulation, which is a reasonable clarification of the statute, does not, as the Appellants contend, impermissibly narrow the class of \"lessees\" who have standing under Section 4852(b)(3), and the Appellants do not have standing under either the regulation or the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, our interpretation of Section 4852d does not conflict with the legislative history of the RLPHRA. To be sure, as Appellants point out, it is clear from both the legislative history and the text of the statute itself that the RLPHRA was enacted to protect children from the hazards of lead-based paint in residential housing. But, the disclosure provision is merely one method in an attempt to effectuate this goal, and does not conflict with the overarching purposes of the RLPHRA to protect children from lead poisoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, we note that the federal scheme to reduce the hazards of lead-based paint in residential housing is intended to be implemented in conjunction with state and local laws that require abatement of lead-based paint. Thus, the Mason children are not left without a remedy: they can pursue claims against the Appellees in the New Hampshire state courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

In that case, the United States District Court for the District of Kansas held that although it did have subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' RLPHRA claims, the regulations implementing the disclosure provision of the RLPHRA did not take effect until after the plaintiffs entered into their lease with the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiffs could not recover under &#167; 4852(b)(3). At no point did the court state that the minor children had standing to pursue a claim under &#167; 4852(b)(3), and contrary to Appellants' argument, a finding of subject matter jurisdiction does not imply that a party has standing to bring a claim. <i>See Steel Co. v.
