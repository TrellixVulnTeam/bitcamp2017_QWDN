McCarthy on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paul D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          November 16, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the   Second    Circuit   Court   of   Appeals,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f          STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.     Defendant Edward Fox was\n\nconvicted by a jury in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Maine of possessing an unregistered shotgun.     When he\n\noriginally appeared before us, he challenged that conviction on\n\nmultiple grounds, alleging police misconduct in conducting the\n\nsearch that revealed his possession of the weapon, complaining of\n\nimproper admission of evidence, and challenging his sentence under\n\nthe United States Sentencing Guidelines.    In an earlier published\n\nopinion, United States v. Fox, 393 F.3d 52 (1st Cir. 2004), we\n\nrejected his challenges and affirmed his conviction.   That opinion\n\nstates the facts of the case, which we will not repeat here.\n\n          Fox petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari. His\n\npetition was granted, the judgment below vacated, and the case\n\nremanded to us for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in United States v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005).   See Fox\n\nv. United States, 125 S.Ct. 2949 (2005).    We invited supplemental\n\nbriefing on whether the case should be remanded to the district\n\ncourt for resentencing in accordance with Booker.\n\n          In his supplemental brief, Fox seems to suggest that he\n\npreserved a Booker claim because he raised a challenge to his\n\nsentence under Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 269 (2004), when he\n\noriginally appealed his sentence in this court.    However, in order\n\nto preserve a Booker claim, Fox had to make his Blakely argument\n\nbefore the district court in the first instance.   Our review of the\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fsentencing transcript and related memoranda reveals no evidence of\n\nany suggestion made to the district court that the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines, either on their face or as applied to Fox’s case, were\n\nunconstitutional.             In the absence of any indication in the record\n\nthat Fox challenged the constitutionality of his sentence in the\n\ndistrict court, we treat his claim as forfeited. See United States\n\nv. Burnette, 423 F.3d 22, 24 n.2 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                We review a forfeited Booker challenge for plain error.\n\nId. at 24.        \"To establish plain error, an appellant must point to\n\n(1)   an       error    (2)    that   is    plain       and    that   both     (3)    affects\n\nsubstantial           rights    and   (4)    seriously         affects    the     fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                                    Id.\n\n(citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993)).\n\n                The    first    two   prongs       of    the    plain    error       test   are\n\nsatisfied \"whenever [a] defendant's Guidelines sentence was imposed\n\nunder      a    mandatory       Guidelines      system.\"              United     States     v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir. 2005).                          To satisfy the\n\nthird prong, a defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability\n\nthat he would have received a lesser sentence under an advisory\n\nguidelines regime.              Id. at 75.              Although we are not overly\n\ndemanding in assessing a defendant's attempt to make this showing,\n\nsee United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005),\n\nwe do require the defendant to point to \"something concrete . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\fthat provides a plausible basis for such a finding,\" United States\n\nv. Guzmán, 419 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Fox points to nothing that establishes any probability\n\nthat the district judge would have imposed a lesser sentence under\n\nan advisory guidelines regime.       He cites only to language in the\n\nsentencing transcript that demonstrates that the judge understood\n\nthe Guidelines to be mandatory.       This, as we have just noted, is\n\nsufficient to prove error, but not to prove the degree of harm\n\nrequisite under plain error review.        We are left with no reason to\n\nbelieve that Fox would have received a different sentence under an\n\nadvisory    guidelines    regime,   and   therefore   conclude   that   the\n\noriginal sentence should be reinstated.          Accordingly, we again\n\ndirect the entry of judgment affirming both the conviction and the\n\nsentence.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
