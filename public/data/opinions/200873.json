Connors, Jr. on brief for appellant.\n     Adi Goldstein, Assistant United States Attorney, Kenneth P.\nMadden, Assistant United States Attorney, Craig N.

Pedro      Anglon    appeals      from   a   135-month\n\nsentence    imposed      following        his   guilty     plea   to   conspiring   to\n\ndistribute and to possess with intent to distribute the drug\n\n\"ecstasy,\" and to distributing ecstasy on three occasions in August\n\nand September, 2001.        On appeal, Anglon argues that the sentencing\n\ncourt erred in calculating the drug quantity attributable to him\n\nand in enhancing his base offense level for his supervisory role in\n\nthe offense (and, consequently, denying him a \"safety valve\"\n\nreduction).         As neither argument is availing, we affirm Anglon's\n\nsentence.\n\n              I. Drug Quantity\n\n              The sentencing court determined that the pre-sentence\n\nreport (\"PSR\") had properly attributed the equivalent of 7,022.12\n\nkilograms of marijuana to Anglon in calculating his base offense\n\nlevel (\"BOL\") of 34.           That drug quantity was based upon: 1) the\n\nquantity of ecstasy pills sold in the transactions charged in\n\nCounts II - IV, to which Anglon pled guilty; 2) the quantity of\n\necstasy pills sold in the transactions charged in Counts V and VI\n\nof the indictment (which did not charge Anglon as a participant);\n\n3) a small sample of heroin (.27 grams) delivered by co-defendant\n\nFélix R. Martínez on December 8, 2001; and 4) $7,000 in cash and\n\ncocaine, cocaine base and heroin seized in a search of Anglon's\n\nresidence on December 10, 2001.                 The cocaine base alone accounted\n\nfor   6,746    kilograms       of   the    total    drug    quantity,    determining\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fAnglon's BOL of 34 (corresponding with at least 3,000 but not more\n\nthan 10,000 kilograms of marijuana).\n\n            Anglon argues that the district court erred in including\n\nas \"relevant conduct\" the second, third and fourth categories\n\nlisted above in calculating drug quantity.          Because we conclude\n\nthat the district court did not err in including the fourth\n\ncategory as    relevant   conduct,   and   the   exclusion   of   the   drug\n\nquantities in categories 2 and 3 would not impact Anglon's BOL or\n\nsentence, we need not consider Anglon's challenge to categories 2)\n\nand 3).   See United States v. Young, 78 F.3d 758, 763 n.4 (1st Cir.\n\n1996)(noting that it was unnecessary to consider whether a certain\n\ndrug was properly included because its exclusion from the total\n\ndrug quantity would not change appellant's base offense level or\n\nsentencing range).\n\n            Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines,\n            a court is to consider all relevant conduct in\n            determining the quantity of drugs for which a\n            defendant is responsible. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3.\n            A preponderance of the evidence standard\n            applies to the determination of drug quantity,\n            and a sentencing court's drug quantity\n            determination is a factual matter that will\n            not be disturbed on appeal unless it is\n            clearly erroneous.\n\nUnited States v. May, 343 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            Anglon's PSR reported that a search of his apartment and\n\nthe basement to his apartment building on December 10, 2001,\n\nresulted in the seizure of $7,000 in cash from Anglon's apartment\n\n                                 -3-\n\fand quantities     of   cocaine,    cocaine    base   and   heroin   from   the\n\nbasement.   Anglon argues on appeal, as he did in his objections to\n\nthe PSR, that the cash and drugs seized should not have been\n\nincluded    as   relevant   conduct    because   there      was   insufficient\n\nevidence connecting them to him.        He also argues that there was an\n\ninsufficient nexus to the charged conduct because the drugs seized\n\nwere different in type from the drug Anglon was charged with\n\ndistributing (ecstasy).\n\n            Under the Sentencing Guidelines, 'relevant\n            conduct' includes all acts 'that were part of\n            the same course of conduct or common scheme or\n            plan as the offense of conviction[.]' U.S.S.G.\n            § 1B1.3.    For two or more offenses to be\n            considered part of a common scheme or plan,\n            'they must be substantially connected to each\n            other by at least one common factor, such as\n            common victims, common accomplices, common\n            purpose, or similar modus operandi.' U.S.S.G.\n            § 1B1.3, comment. (n.9(A)).\n\nYoung, 78 F.3d at 763.      A sentencing court's determination that an\n\noffense forms part of the same course of conduct or common scheme\n\nor plan \"is a predominantly factual finding that will be disturbed\n\nonly if clearly erroneous.\"        United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12,\n\n16 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            After hearing testimony from Anglon and his wife that\n\nthey had only limited access to the basement where the drugs were\n\nfound, and contrary testimony by a police detective who executed\n\nthe search, the sentencing court concluded that Anglon's and his\n\nwife's testimony was not credible.            \"It is settled beyond cavil\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthat, in the sentencing phase of a criminal case, credibility\n\nchoices are within the exclusive province of the district judge.\"\n\nUnited    States    v.    Conley,    156   F.3d   78,   85   (1st   Cir.    1998).\n\nSimilarly, the sentencing court implicitly found that Anglon's\n\nclaim that he did not know the origins of the $7,000 in cash seized\n\nfrom his apartment, but that it was not drug money, was not\n\ncredible.\n\n            The fact that the drugs seized from Anglon's residence\n\nwere of different types (cocaine, cocaine base and heroin) than the\n\ndrug     involved    in    the      charged   offense    (ecstasy)         is   not\n\ndeterminative.      See May, 343 F.3d at 7; Young, 78 F.3d at 763.              The\n\nPSR reported that Martínez delivered the sample of heroin to Agent\n\nCruz on December 8, 2001, immediately after paying a visit to\n\nAnglon's residence.        It also indicated that during the August 15,\n\n2001 and September 18, 2001 transactions, Anglon made references to\n\ndealing cocaine and heroin in his conversations with Agent Cruz.\n\nFinally, the PSR stated that during the search of 8 Mawney Street\n\non December 10, 2001, a scale, sifter and grinder, containing\n\nheroin residue, were seized from inside Anglon's apartment.                      In\n\nlight of this evidence, to which Anglon made no objection, the\n\ninclusion (as relevant conduct) of the drugs and cash seized from\n\nAnglon's address was not clearly erroneous.\n\n            II. Role in the Offense and Safety Valve\n\n            The district court increased Anglon's base offense level\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fby two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c), for his role as \"an\n\norganizer, leader, manager or supervisor in any criminal activity\"\n\ninvolving one-to-three other participants.            A two-level increase\n\nunder § 3B1.1(c) is justified\n\n             if the sentencing court supportably finds that\n             (1) the criminal enterprise involved at least\n             two complicit participants (of whom the\n             defendant may be counted as one), and (2) the\n             defendant,   in    committing   the   offense,\n             exercised control over, organized, or was\n             otherwise responsible for superintending the\n             activities of, at least one of those persons.\n\nUnited States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997).                      The\n\ngovernment bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the defendant qualifies for such an adjustment. See\n\nid.    The evidence supporting the role in the offense determination\n\nmay be wholly circumstantial. See id. at 4.            The government need\n\nonly prove that the defendant exercised authority or control over\n\nanother participant on one occasion. See id.; United States v.\n\nBrown, 298 F.3d 120, 122 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S.\n\n1096 (2002).     We review such a determination for clear error. See\n\nBrown, 298 F.3d at 122.\n\n             In his testimony at the sentencing hearing, Anglon stated\n\nthat    he   never   had   anyone   \"working   for   [him],   delivering   or\n\nreceiving drugs other than the co-defendants in this case.\"                 He\n\ntestified that he used to have Martínez make deliveries from him so\n\nthat Anglon would not have drugs on his person.         Anglon admitted to\n\nhaving \"arranged\" the August 15, 2001 transaction and that he \"had\n\n                                      -6-\n\fMr. Paulino deliver ecstasy pills to Agent Cruz.\"                      He specified\n\nthat he had told co-defendant Juan Paulino to bring the ecstasy\n\npills to the restaurant and, after the pills were delivered and\n\npaid   for,    had   told    Paulino    to    bring   the    money     to   Anglon's\n\napartment.       Anglon denied that he was the boss of anyone and\n\nmaintained that he and Martínez and Paulino were equal partners,\n\nsharing the profits from the drug sales equally.                  On the basis of\n\nthis evidence, the district court's conclusion that the government\n\nhad proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Anglon had\n\nexercised authority or control over another participant on at least\n\none occasion, was not clearly erroneous. That competing reasonable\n\ninferences might be drawn from Anglon's testimony did not make the\n\nsentencing court's choice between them clearly erroneous.                        See\n\nCruz, 120 F.3d at 4.\n\n              The district court did not err in determining that Anglon\n\ndid not qualify for a two-level reduction under the \"safety valve\"\n\nprovision.       See   U.S.S.G.    §§   2D1.1(b)(6),        5C1.2(a).        Such   a\n\nreduction is permitted only if \"the defendant was not an organizer,\n\nleader, manager,       or    supervisor      of   others    in   the   offense.\"    §\n\n5C1.2(a)(4).\n\n              Affirmed.     See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f",

Conley,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198112\"><a href=\"/opinion/198112/united-states-v-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   85   (1st   Cir.    1998).\n\nSimilarly, the sentencing court implicitly found that Anglon's\n\nclaim that he did not know the origins of the $7,000 in cash seized\n\nfrom his apartment, but that it was not drug money, was not\n\ncredible.\n\n            The fact that the drugs seized from Anglon's residence\n\nwere of different types (cocaine, cocaine base and heroin) than the\n\ndrug     involved    in    the      charged   offense    (ecstasy)         is   not\n\ndeterminative.      See May, 343 F.3d at 7; Young, 78 F.3d at 763.              The\n\nPSR reported that Martínez delivered the sample of heroin to Agent\n\nCruz on December 8, 2001, immediately after paying a visit to\n\nAnglon's residence.        It also indicated that during the August 15,\n\n2001 and September 18, 2001 transactions, Anglon made references to\n\ndealing cocaine and heroin in his conversations with Agent Cruz.\n\nFinally, the PSR stated that during the search of 8 Mawney Street\n\non December 10, 2001, a scale, sifter and grinder, containing\n\nheroin residue, were seized from inside Anglon's apartment.                      In\n\nlight of this evidence, to which Anglon made no objection, the\n\ninclusion (as relevant conduct) of the drugs and cash seized from\n\nAnglon's address was not clearly erroneous.\n\n            II. Role in the Offense and Safety Valve\n\n            The district court increased Anglon's base offense level\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fby two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c), for his role as \"an\n\norganizer, leader, manager or supervisor in any criminal activity\"\n\ninvolving one-to-three other participants.            A two-level increase\n\nunder § 3B1.1(c) is justified\n\n             if the sentencing court supportably finds that\n             (1) the criminal enterprise involved at least\n             two complicit participants (of whom the\n             defendant may be counted as one), and (2) the\n             defendant,   in    committing   the   offense,\n             exercised control over, organized, or was\n             otherwise responsible for superintending the\n             activities of, at least one of those persons.\n\nUnited States v. Cruz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744197\"><a href=\"/opinion/744197/united-states-v-ceferino-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 1997).                      The\n\ngovernment bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the defendant qualifies for such an adjustment. See\n\nid.    The evidence supporting the role in the offense determination\n\nmay be wholly circumstantial. See id. at 4.            The government need\n\nonly prove that the defendant exercised authority or control over\n\nanother participant on one occasion. See id.; United States v.\n\nBrown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200067\"><a href=\"/opinion/200067/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 122 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1096</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002).     We review such a determination for clear error. See\n\nBrown, 298 F.3d at 122.\n\n             In his testimony at the sentencing hearing, Anglon stated\n\nthat    he   never   had   anyone   \"working   for   [him],   delivering   or\n\nreceiving drugs other than the co-defendants in this case.\"                 He\n\ntestified that he used to have Martínez make deliveries from him so\n\nthat Anglon would not have drugs on his person.         Anglon admitted to\n\nhaving \"arranged\" the August 15, 2001 transaction and that he \"had\n\n                                      -6-\n\fMr. Paulino deliver ecstasy pills to Agent Cruz.\"                      He specified\n\nthat he had told co-defendant Juan Paulino to bring the ecstasy\n\npills to the restaurant and, after the pills were delivered and\n\npaid   for,    had   told    Paulino    to    bring   the    money     to   Anglon's\n\napartment.       Anglon denied that he was the boss of anyone and\n\nmaintained that he and Martínez and Paulino were equal partners,\n\nsharing the profits from the drug sales equally.                  On the basis of\n\nthis evidence, the district court's conclusion that the government\n\nhad proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Anglon had\n\nexercised authority or control over another participant on at least\n\none occasion, was not clearly erroneous. That competing reasonable\n\ninferences might be drawn from Anglon's testimony did not make the\n\nsentencing court's choice between them clearly erroneous.                        See\n\nCruz, 120 F.3d at 4.\n\n              The district court did not err in determining that Anglon\n\ndid not qualify for a two-level reduction under the \"safety valve\"\n\nprovision.       See   U.S.S.G.    §§   2D1.1(b)(6),        5C1.2(a).        Such   a\n\nreduction is permitted only if \"the defendant was not an organizer,\n\nleader, manager,       or    supervisor      of   others    in   the   offense.\"    §\n\n5C1.2(a)(4).\n\n              Affirmed.     See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f</pre>",
