Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                 Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Vivianne M. Marrero-Torres, Assistant Federal Public Defender,\nwith whom Joseph C. Laws, Federal Public Defender, was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Germán Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 6, 2010\n\f          Per Curiam.         Nearly twenty years ago, when appellant\n\nErick Flores-Rivera was arrested on federal drug charges, the\n\nUnited States Customs Service1 took possession of his new Jeep\n\nCherokee, $1,903 in cash, and other items.2              Pursuant to a plea\n\nagreement, Flores pled guilty to two counts in January 1991, and\n\nthe court imposed a term of imprisonment of 240 months and a\n\n$20,000 fine.    Eight years later, in 1999, the government conceded\n\nthat Flores was entitled to the return of the seized property\n\nbecause   it    had   been        improperly    forfeited   without   notice.\n\nRemarkably,     however,     as    a   result   of   procedural   errors   and\n\nmisjudgments by the district court, abetted by the government's own\n\nconduct and inaction, Flores is still without his property3 and\n\nthere has been no proper determination that it may lawfully be\n\nwithheld from him.    The most glaring of these missteps was the one\n\nchallenged in this appeal: the district court's sua sponte ruling\n\nin December 2008 that the property should be returned but, at the\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       The Customs Service is now known as the United States\nCustoms and Border Protection (\"CBP\") section of the Department of\nHomeland Security.\n     2\n        The parties agree that a Puerto Rico driver's license and\na social security card also were seized. Flores contends that a\nRolex watch also was taken from him, and the record also contains\nreferences to the seizure of a wallet and a beeper.\n     3\n       The Jeep was sold by the government in 1999 for $6,400, and\nit is therefore the proceeds of the sale, rather than the vehicle,\nthat are now at issue. In addition, as described infra, Flores\nclaims he should be credited with an amount greater than $6,400.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fsame time, summarily ordering that the funds be applied to Flores's\n\ncriminal fine.\n\n              At oral argument, the government tried to defend the\n\ndecision of the district court as not plain error.             Subsequently,\n\nit sensibly changed its position and acknowledged that the case\n\nshould   be    remanded   so   that   the   district   court   can   \"properly\n\ndetermine\" the amount that should be returned to Flores, which also\n\nwould give the court, as the government finally put it, \"the\n\nopportunity to comply with the notification requirements and the\n\nprocedures for enforcement of criminal fines in 18 U.S.C. §§[]\n\n3572, 3611-15.\"     Both the amount owed to Flores for his property\n\nand whether that entire sum may be immediately applied to his fine\n\nare difficult issues of considerable consequence to him.              The Jeep\n\nwas new when it was seized, and Flores asserts that it was worth\n\n$23,000 at that time.          A customs employee reported in a 2007\n\ndeclaration that the vehicle was transferred from storage in June\n\n1992 and used by the agency for almost seven years – without\n\ncompensation to Flores – until it was sold for $6,400 in 1999.4             In\n\n\n     4\n       In this appeal, Flores's counsel raised the question of how\nmuch Flores is owed for the Jeep in a motion filed about a week\nbefore oral argument. Although the government points out in its\nsupplemental brief that arguments not made in a party's initial\nbrief ordinarily are waived, it acknowledges that an exception is\nwarranted here. Indeed, in the unusual circumstances of this case,\nwhich we recount infra, the government arguably had an obligation\nto bring this valuation issue to our attention.          Given the\ndocuments in the record, it had to know that the valuation question\nwas unresolved. That fact makes its initial resolve to oppose this\nappeal all the more perplexing.\n\n                                      -3-\n\faddition, Flores entered into a contract with the Bureau of Prisons\n\n(BOP) to repay his fine in installments, see infra, but the\n\ngovernment contends that the district court nonetheless has the\n\nauthority to order full payment at any time.\n\n              Given the history of this case, we are dismayed that the\n\ngovernment chose initially to defend the district court's judicial\n\nimprovisation, which denied Flores statutory and procedural due\n\nprocess rights designed to protect against just such unexamined\n\ndeprivations of property.         By the time this appeal was filed,\n\nFlores already had endured indefensible delays in obtaining relief.\n\nIn 1999, we vacated the denial of his 1997 pro se motion seeking\n\nreturn   of    his   property   and   remanded   for   further   proceedings\n\nbecause, as the government acknowledged, Flores had not received\n\nadequate notice of the forfeiture proceedings.           Not until May 2006\n\ndid the government ask the district court to hold a hearing – a\n\nrequest made only after appellant sought mandamus and we directed\n\nthe government to reply to his petition and \"propose or implement\n\na course of action.\"5 No hearing has ever been held.6            Although the\n\n\n     5\n       In its Informative Motion dated May 18, 2006, the government\nrequested \"additional proceedings to determine the forfeitability\nof the[] properties,\" and stated that \"a hearing may be required in\nthis case because there is a discrepancy between Flores-Rivera and\nthe United States Custom Service as to the number of items seized\nand administratively forfeited.\"\n     6\n       We note that, on July 28, 1999, the district court held a\nhearing on a motion by Flores seeking certification to file an\nuntimely motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to vacate, set aside or\ncorrect his sentence. It appears that no attention was given in\n\n                                      -4-\n\fgovernment agreed during a status conference on August 2, 2006 to\n\nreturn the property, it did not at that time know the location of\n\nthe items, including the cash seized at the time of Flores's\n\narrest.   A year later, in August 2007, the government informed the\n\ndistrict court that the Jeep had been sold and the $1,903 in\n\ncurrency had been deposited in the Treasury Department's Asset\n\nForfeiture Fund.7\n\n           Meanwhile, in October and December 2006, and in February\n\n2007, Flores filed pro se motions seeking the appointment of\n\ncounsel for the forfeiture proceedings.     Flores claims to have\n\n\n\nthat proceeding to our remand order, which had been entered on the\ndistrict court docket on June 3.       Meanwhile, Flores had been\ncharged in 1991 in a separate criminal case, see United States v.\nFlores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319 (1st Cir. 1995), and the docket in that\ncase shows that he was represented by counsel for post-conviction\nproceedings related to his sentencing that were occurring between\n2000 and 2005. At a re-sentencing hearing on April 5, 2004, Flores\nwas sentenced to a total of 408 months' imprisonment to be served\nconsecutively to the term of imprisonment imposed in the criminal\ncase underlying his forfeiture claim. We affirmed that sentence in\nan unpublished decision on July 29, 2005, and our docket in the\nreturn-of-property    mandamus    action   shows   that    Flores's\nrepresentation by counsel terminated on that date. Although the\ncriminal matters overlapped in time with the pendency of his motion\nfor return of property, the forfeiture-related filings were all pro\nse. We found no indication on the district court docket that the\ncourt or counsel considered our 1999 remand before Flores's motion\nfor mandamus and the government's resulting May 2006 Informative\nMotion.\n     7\n         The government did not report whether the proceeds from\nthe sale of the Jeep were deposited into the same account. As for\nthe other items allegedly seized, the government has no record of\nthe Rolex watch, and it reported that the agency was unable to\nlocate the driver's license and social security card.         The\ngovernment's notice to the court did not mention the wallet.\n\n                                -5-\n\flearned for the first time in 2008 that counsel had in fact been\n\nappointed for him in July 2006.         The appointed counsel appeared at\n\nthe August 2006 status conference, but there is no evidence that\n\nFlores was told of the appointment, that the appointed counsel ever\n\nmet with Flores, or that he took any other action on Flores's\n\nbehalf.\n\n                 On November 12, 2008 – following yet another pro se\n\nrequest by Flores for mandamus relief – we directed the district\n\ncourt to address the discrepancies in the value of the forfeited\n\nitems.8       When the court issued its final order three weeks later,\n\nhowever, it did not discuss Flores's contentions concerning the\n\nvalue       of   the   returned   property.   Instead,   disregarding   the\n\nprocedures applicable to the collection of delinquent criminal\n\nfines, see 18 U.S.C. § 3612, and without a motion from the\n\ngovernment, the court simply ordered that the proceeds from the\n\nJeep and the $1,903 in currency be deposited and credited toward\n\nhis fine.        Flores filed a pro se notice of appeal and, on January\n\n\n        8\n            Our order stated, in relevant part:\n\n     In response to petitioner's latest request for mandamus\n     relief, the government has proposed a final disposition,\n     and petitioner has opposed that disposition in part. In\n     these circumstances, we think the district court should\n     address the government's proposal and the petitioner's\n     opposition and endeavor to bring this litigation to a\n     final conclusion.\n\nIn his opposition, Flores had challenged the amount of compensation\nproposed by the government for the Jeep in light of its much higher\nvalue at the time it was seized.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f16, 2009, the district court granted his motion for new counsel and\n\nappointed the Federal Public Defender to represent him.\n\n            Despite the factual and procedural complexity of this\n\ncase, Flores was effectively left to represent himself until the\n\npublic defender was appointed in January 2009.9          Further delay is\n\nunacceptable, and his claims must now be given serious, careful\n\nattention.    In addition to the dispute over the appropriate value\n\nfor the Jeep, Flores invokes the contract he signed in February\n\n2003 to participate in the BOP's Inmate Financial Responsibility\n\nProgram (IFRP).    See 28 C.F.R. §§ 545.10-545.11.       He agreed to pay\n\n$25 quarterly, beginning in June 2003. Records submitted by Flores\n\nand   the    government   indicate    some   confusion   about   Flores's\n\noutstanding debt and, as noted above, a question of law exists\n\nconcerning the district court's authority to bypass the contract\n\nand immediately order full payment of the fine.\n\n            On remand, the district court should promptly conduct a\n\nhearing, follow the applicable statutory procedures, and otherwise\n\n\n\n      9\n       In its May 2006 Informative Motion to the district court,\nthe government noted that Flores was \"free to request from the\nCourt the appointment of counsel\" and that \"the Court may wish to\nappoint counsel given the complexity of the possible forfeiture\nissues.\" It thus implicitly suggested that providing Flores with\ncounsel would be advisable and cited case law for the proposition\nthat complex forfeiture issues may warrant appointment of counsel.\nSee United States v. Giraldo, 45 F.3d 509, 512 (1st Cir. 1995) and\nUnited States v. Chambers, 192 F.3d 374, 378 (3d Cir. 1999). As\nnoted above, the court took the suggestion and appointed counsel in\nJuly 2006, though it appears that counsel contributed little or\nnothing to the resolution of his case.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fprovide    Flores   with   the   long-delayed   process   to   which   he   is\n\nentitled.    It is time for this embarrassing saga to end.\n\n            The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the\n\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f",

The Jeep was new when it was seized, and Flores asserts that it was worth $23,000 at that time. A customs employee reported in a 2007 declaration that the vehicle was transferred from storage in June 1992 and used by the agency for almost seven yearswithout compensation to Flores until it was sold for $6,400 in 1999.<sup>[4]</sup> In addition, Flores entered into a contract with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to repay his fine in installments, <i>see infra,</i> but the government contends that the district court nonetheless has the authority to order full payment at any time.</p>\n<p>Given the history of this case, we are dismayed that the government chose initially <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> to defend the district court's judicial improvisation, which denied Flores statutory and procedural due process rights designed to protect against just such unexamined deprivations of property.

Eight years later, in 1999, the government conceded that Flores was entitled to the return of the seized property because it had been improperly forfeited without notice. Remarkably, however, as a result of procedural errors and misjudgments by the district court, abetted by the government's own conduct and inaction, Flores is still without his property<sup>[3]</sup> and there has been no proper determination that it may lawfully be withheld from him. The most glaring of these missteps was the one challenged in this appeal: the district court's sua sponte ruling in December 2008 that the property should be returned but, at the same time, summarily ordering that the funds be applied to Flores's criminal fine.</p>\n<p>At oral argument, the government tried to defend the decision of the district court as not plain error. Subsequently, it sensibly changed its position and acknowledged that the case should be remanded so that the district court can \"properly determine\" the amount that should be returned to Flores, which also would give the court, as the government finally put it, \"the opportunity to comply with the notification requirements and the procedures for enforcement of criminal fines in 18 U.S.C. §§ [ ]3572, 3611-15.\" Both the amount owed to Flores for his property and whether that entire sum may be immediately applied to his fine are difficult issues of considerable consequence to him. The Jeep was new when it was seized, and Flores asserts that it was worth $23,000 at that time. A customs employee reported in a 2007 declaration that the vehicle was transferred from storage in June 1992 and used by the agency for almost seven yearswithout compensation to Flores until it was sold for $6,400 in 1999.<sup>[4]</sup> In addition, Flores entered into a contract with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to repay his fine in installments, <i>see infra,</i> but the government contends that the district court nonetheless has the authority to order full payment at any time.</p>\n<p>Given the history of this case, we are dismayed that the government chose initially <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> to defend the district court's judicial improvisation, which denied Flores statutory and procedural due process rights designed to protect against just such unexamined deprivations of property. By the time this appeal was filed, Flores already had endured indefensible delays in obtaining relief. In 1999, we vacated the denial of his 1997 pro se motion seeking return of his property and remanded for further proceedings because, as the government acknowledged, Flores had not received adequate notice of the forfeiture proceedings. Not until May 2006 did the government ask the district court to hold a hearinga request made only after appellant sought mandamus and we directed the government to reply to his petition and \"propose or implement a course of action.\"<sup>[5]</sup> No hearing has ever been held.<sup>[6]</sup> Although the government agreed during a status conference on August 2, 2006 to return the property, it did not at that time know the location of the items, including the cash seized at the time of Flores's arrest. A year later, in August 2007, the government informed the district court that the Jeep had been sold and the $1,903 in currency had been deposited in the Treasury Department's Asset Forfeiture Fund.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in October and December 2006, and in February 2007, Flores filed pro se motions seeking the appointment of counsel for the forfeiture proceedings. Flores claims to have learned for the first time in 2008 that counsel had in fact been appointed for him in July 2006. The appointed counsel appeared at the August 2006 status conference, but there is no evidence that Flores was told of the appointment, that the appointed counsel ever met with Flores, or that he took any other action on Flores's behalf.</p>\n<p>On November 12, 2008following yet another pro se request by Flores for mandamus reliefwe directed the district court to address the discrepancies in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> value of the forfeited items.<sup>[8]</sup> When the court issued its final order three weeks later, however, it did not discuss Flores's contentions concerning the value of the returned property. Instead, disregarding the procedures applicable to the collection of delinquent criminal fines, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3612, and without a motion from the government, the court simply ordered that the proceeds from the Jeep and the $1,903 in currency be deposited and credited toward his fine. Flores filed a pro se notice of appeal and, on January 16, 2009, the district court granted his motion for new counsel and appointed the Federal Public Defender to represent him.</p>\n<p>Despite the factual and procedural complexity of this case, Flores was effectively left to represent himself until the public defender was appointed in January 2009.<sup>[9]</sup> Further delay is unacceptable, and his claims must now be given serious, careful attention. In addition to the dispute over the appropriate value for the Jeep, Flores invokes the contract he signed in February 2003 to participate in the BOP's Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP). <i>See</i> 28 C.F.R. §§ 545.10-545.11. He agreed to pay $25 quarterly, beginning in June 2003. Records submitted by Flores and the government indicate some confusion about Flores's outstanding debt and, as noted above, a question of law exists concerning the district court's authority to bypass the contract and immediately order full payment of the fine.</p>\n<p>On remand, the district court should promptly conduct a hearing, follow the applicable statutory procedures, and otherwise provide Flores with the long-delayed process to which he is entitled. It is time for this embarrassing saga to end.</p>\n<p><i>The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Customs Service is now known as the United States Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") section of the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>[2]  The parties agree that a Puerto Rico driver's license and a social security card also were seized. Flores contends that a Rolex watch also was taken from him, and the record also contains references to the seizure of a wallet and a beeper.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Jeep was sold by the government in 1999 for $6,400, and it is therefore the proceeds of the sale, rather than the vehicle, that are now at issue. In addition, as described <i>infra,</i> Flores claims he should be credited with an amount greater than $6,400.</p>\n<p>[4]  In this appeal, Flores's counsel raised the question of how much Flores is owed for the Jeep in a motion filed about a week before oral argument. Although the government points out in its supplemental brief that arguments not made in a party's initial brief ordinarily are waived, it acknowledges that an exception is warranted here. Indeed, in the unusual circumstances of this case, which we recount <i>infra,</i> the <i>government</i> arguably had an obligation to bring this valuation issue to our attention. Given the documents in the record, it had to know that the valuation question was unresolved. That fact makes its initial resolve to oppose this appeal all the more perplexing.</p>\n<p>[5]  In its Informative Motion dated May 18, 2006, the government requested \"additional proceedings to determine the forfeitability of the[] properties,\" and stated that \"a hearing may be required in this case because there is a discrepancy between Flores-Rivera and the United States Custom Service as to the number of items seized and administratively forfeited.\"</p>\n<p>[6]  We note that, on July 28, 1999, the district court held a hearing on a motion by Flores seeking certification to file an untimely motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. It appears that no attention was given in that proceeding to our remand order, which had been entered on the district court docket on June 3. Meanwhile, Flores had been charged in 1991 in a separate criminal case, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Flores-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196112\"><a href=\"/opinion/196112/united-states-v-flores-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995), and the docket in that case shows that he was represented by counsel for post-conviction proceedings related to his sentencing that were occurring between 2000 and 2005. At a re-sentencing hearing on April 5, 2004, Flores was sentenced to a total of 408 months' imprisonment to be served consecutively to the term of imprisonment imposed in the criminal case underlying his forfeiture claim. We affirmed that sentence in an unpublished decision on July 29, 2005, and our docket in the return-of-property mandamus action shows that Flores's representation by counsel terminated on that date. Although the criminal matters overlapped in time with the pendency of his motion for return of property, the forfeiture-related filings were all pro se. We found no indication on the district court docket that the court or counsel considered our 1999 remand before Flores's motion for mandamus and the government's resulting May 2006 Informative Motion.</p>\n<p>[7]  The government did not report whether the proceeds from the sale of the Jeep were deposited into the same account. As for the other items allegedly seized, the government has no record of the Rolex watch, and it reported that the agency was unable to locate the driver's license and social security card. The government's notice to the court did not mention the wallet.</p>\n<p>[8]  Our order stated, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>In response to petitioner's latest request for mandamus relief, the government has proposed a final disposition, and petitioner has opposed that disposition in part. In these circumstances, we think the district court should address the government's proposal and the petitioner's opposition and endeavor to bring this litigation to a final conclusion.</p>\n<p>In his opposition, Flores had challenged the amount of compensation proposed by the government for the Jeep in light of its much higher value at the time it was seized.</p>\n<p>[9]  In its May 2006 Informative Motion to the district court, the government noted that Flores was \"free to request from the Court the appointment of counsel\" and that \"the Court may wish to appoint counsel given the complexity of the possible forfeiture issues.\" It thus implicitly suggested that providing Flores with counsel would be advisable and cited case law for the proposition that complex forfeiture issues may warrant appointment of counsel. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Giraldo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195842\"><a href=\"/opinion/195842/united-states-v-giraldo/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, 512 (1st Cir.1995) and <i>United States v. Chambers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766240\"><a href=\"/opinion/766240/united-states-v-ceverilo-chambers/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 378 (3d Cir. 1999). As noted above, the court took the suggestion and appointed counsel in July 2006, though it appears that counsel contributed little or nothing to the resolution of his case.</p>\n\n</div>",
